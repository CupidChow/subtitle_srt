1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:20,890


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,360
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,570
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,220
   

16
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,080
   
   

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,320
Zhang Yang!

18
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,600
That was a nice kick!

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,700
Zhang Yang, this is our new roommate, Jing Xi Chi.

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,020
- Hello. 
 - Hello. Hello.

21
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,422
Come on, let's play a match.

22
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:10,600
I haven't played in a long time.

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,740
Come on, you must know how to play.

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,920
Let's go! We're just one person short.

25
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,490
Come on.

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,820
Let's go.

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,560
- Okay. I'll try. 
 - Let's go.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,097
Huan Er, which department is your friend from?

29
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:26,200
Computer Science.

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,500
Computer Science?

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,220
So he's going to be a programmer, right?

32
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,070
I don't know what he'll do in the future.

33
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,920
Aren't programmers all those nerdy types,

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,080
wearing black-rimmed glasses, checkered shirts, and always looking serious?

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,800
Is he nerdy? I don't know.

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,180
However, he's very childish.

37
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,730
- He's so handsome! 
 - Take a picture for me!

38
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,330
- He's so handsome! 
 - Exactly!

39
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,170
- Nice! 
 - Nice!

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,610
Over here! Over here!

41
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,070
Run, quick!

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,820
Nice shot!

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,400
Great!

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,380
Nice shot!

45
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,500
- Nice shot! 
 - Defend!

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,180
Wow, impressive! You're the Beckham of China.

47
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,990
Chen Huan Er!

48
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,760
I sent you so many messages. Why didn't you reply?

49
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,070
I didn't see them.

50
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,360
I knew it; Cong even thought you were mad at me.

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,300
Come on, we're so close. Why would you be mad?

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,180
Oh, right. My mom asked me to bring you some medicine.

53
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,010
Here, take it. Bye.

54
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,650
Let's go.

55
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,410
Huan Er, so is this your programmer friend?

56
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,080
Or is this your little sister, Huan Er?

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,800
We're high school classmates who live in the same compound.

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,640
Dude, if you keep gossiping, I'll kick you so hard you'll end up calling me Dad.

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,040
You're so fierce! That's the spirit!

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,735
You can't play football without a bit of aggression.

61
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:03,180
Stop staring and let's continue.

62
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,130
Stop looking. Don't be so reluctant. Come on.

63
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,820
Pass it to me!

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,620
I squeezed too much; take some.

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,300
Thank you.

66
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,050
   

67
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,740
Huan Er.

68
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,900
Look.

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,160
This. Is this your handsome friend from Computer Science?

70
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,100
   

71
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,570
 Within three minutes, I want all the information on this football guy. 

72
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,760
 I declare he is the new heartthrob of Wuan University. 

73
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,861
 He's just okay. 

74
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:51,320
 I think Tian Chi from the pharmacy course is more handsome. 

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,010
Yes.

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,760
Was he very popular at your high school?

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,050
Do you think he's handsome?

78
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,820
Of course! Honestly, he's pretty good-looking.

79
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,000
Just be honest: during the three years as his classmate,

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,580
did you ever have any thoughts about him?

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,400
Yes.

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,130
Every day I wanted to shoot him, especially today.

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,160
A famous psychologist once said,

84
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,570
"The essence of avoiding your true feelings is guilt."

85
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,030
That makes so much sense.

86
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,490
Which psychologist said that?

87
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,400
I did.

88
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,470
The student council senior invited me to a social barbecue.

89
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,500
Why don't you come with me?

90
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,840
Sure.

91
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,960
Would that be okay, though? She invited you, not us.

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,160
- If we go, wouldn't it be... 
 - It's fine.

93
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,710
It's a welcome event, after all. The more, the merrier.

94
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,970
In that case, I need to sleep early.

95
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,750
So it's settled then.

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,270
Where's Dong Hui Xin? I haven't seen her all day.

97
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,310
She's really over the top.

98
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,800
Forget it. Let's sleep.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,150
- Let's sleep. Good night. 
 - Good night.

100
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,290
 Are you still mad? 

101
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,520
Hello.

102
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,930
Nice to meet you. Hope we can get along well.

103
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,860
It's late now.

104
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,200
Let's get to know each other better tomorrow.

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,930
Good night.

106
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,560
Well...

107
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,830
Are you hot?

108
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,840
I'm fine.

109
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,420
Left.

110
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,220
Is Yan Mu out again?

111
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,150
He thinks we're too loud when we play games. He says it affects his inner peace.

112
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,200
So he went to the lake to chant scriptures.

113
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,880
Fine.

114
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,740
Tonight, the student councils from various faculties are hosting a big social event.

115
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,810
They're having a barbecue. Are you coming?

116
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,300
Yes!

117
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,252
- Jing, what about you? 
 - No.

118
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:36,280
Jing, I heard you've been trending on the school forum.

119
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,540
Shouldn't you take this chance to meet more people?

120
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,700
Expanding your network is just as important as studying seriously.

121
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,270
No need.

122
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,650
Jing.

123
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,300
Just go.

124
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,060
A senior specifically asked me to bring you over.

125
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,130
If you don't go, how am I supposed to explain?

126
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,360
- Catch. 
 - Then I'm definitely not going.

127
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,750
Come on, Jing. Do me a favor.

128
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,630
- No. 
 - Are you really not coming?

129
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,400
- No. 
 - Then we're heading out.

130
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,270
Let's go.

131
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,760
Let's go.

132
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,980
What a pity.

133
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,360
   

134
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,300
   

135
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,000
What are you doing, Chen Huan Er?

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,940
Why aren’t you getting ready?

137
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,110
I'm ready.

138
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,250
That's ready?

139
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,610
- What's wrong? 
 - She means you should put on some makeup

140
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,890
and change clothes.

141
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,990
Is this not okay?

142
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,660
Chen Huan Er.

143
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,845
Are you really planning to just show up like this for dinner?

144
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,050
Isn't it just a casual gathering?

145
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,560
This isn't an ordinary dinner.

146
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,760
It's your first time meeting the seniors. You need to make a good impression.

147
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,960
Even if you don't want to join the student council, you should at least tidy up a bit.

148
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,330
Look up.

149
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,964
Lipstick, too?

150
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,820
- Press your lips together. 
 - Put this on as well.

151
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,490
Fine, you both...

152
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,020
Hurry up.

153
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,150
- Let me see. 
 - Are you satisfied?

154
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,650
Yes.

155
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,230
Let's go.

156
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,320
We're running late!

157
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,440
Well.

158
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,700
First of all, welcome to today's gathering!

159
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,230
I'll say a few words.

160
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,580
I really hope you all consider joining our art department.

161
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,960
Our department is full of handsome guys and beautiful girls,

162
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,210
and it's the most popular department of the student council.

163
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,880
Right. Since you've spoken,

164
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,630
I'll say a few words for the sports department.

165
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,580
We are pretty straightforward.

166
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,660
Tonight, I just want everyone to eat well, drink well, and have a great time!

167
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,970
- Nice! 
 - Great! Great!

168
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,390
- Great! Great! 
 - Good!

169
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,150
Good!

170
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,380
- Tian Chi, cheers. 
 - Cheers.

171
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,640
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Don't drink alone. I'll drink with you.

172
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,410
All right.

173
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,240
Watch your manners. Be ladylike.

174
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,820
Look at the good stuff I bought.

175
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,230
- Here. 
 - Be ladylike.

176
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,150
- Try this. 
 - Thanks.

177
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,460
Huan Er?

178
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,250
Tian Chi?

179
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,210
Why are you here?

180
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm in the student council.

181
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,140
I was busy earlier, but I came over once I was done.

182
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,760
Do you want a skewer?

183
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,210
- Here. 
 - Thanks.

184
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,060
- Would you like some beer? 
 - I'll pass.

185
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,640
Thanks.

186
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,180
I saw you're studying pharmacy.

187
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,210
Was that your choice?

188
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,690
Do you plan to go into drug research or some other field?

189
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,690
I haven't thought that far ahead.

190
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,420
I'll just take it one step at a time. The semester hasn't even started yet.

191
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,060
What if I can't keep up?

192
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,090
Your answers are always unexpected.

193
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,000
This beer is pretty good.

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,410
It tastes just like juice.

195
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,030
- Are you sure you don't want to try? 
 - I... I'll pass.

196
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,200
Well... Is Jing really not coming?

197
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,350
I texted him; he said he's not coming.

198
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,520
I'll text him again.

199
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,960
- Okay. 
 - I'll text him again.

200
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,480
Okay.

201
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,640
 Everyone's waiting for you. 

202
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,215
 Hurry and come! 

203
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:14,860
 I'm not going. 

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,830
That one is really tasty.

205
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,440
You can really hold your liquor.

206
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,810
Drink up!

207
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,280
Drink more! Come on.

208
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,100
More!

209
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,710
You should slow down.

210
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,080
What's going on with this kid?

211
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,030
She's not answering the phone.

212
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,470
Come on, pick up!

213
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,190
She's...

214
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,400
Still can't get through?

215
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,580
This kid just won't pick up. I've called several times.

216
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,190
Could it be because you and Xi Chi lied to Huan Er and upset her?

217
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,100
That kid is so stubborn. Who does she take after?

218
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,640
Goodness, who does she take after?

219
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,130
Call Xi Chi and ask him. She's probably fine.

220
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,370
Right, good idea. I'll call Xi Chi.

221
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,080
   

222
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,410
- Hello, Aunt Li Na. 
  - Xi Chi. 

223
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,130
Xi Chi, is Huan Er with you?

224
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,660
 - No.  
 - Didn't she contact you?

225
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,160
She hasn't messaged me all day.

226
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
Could something have happened to her?

227
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,840
What's wrong?

228
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,650
Is Chen Huan Er unreachable?

229
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,530
 I've been calling, but she won't pick up. 

230
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,150
Xi Chi, can you find her?

231
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,460
Okay. Don't panic. I'll ask around.

232
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,550
 Okay. 

233
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,700
What's going on?

234
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,820
Huan Er. Huan Er.

235
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,280
- Huan Er. 
 - Are you all right?

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,400
Do you want some water?

237
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,435
These... Did she drink all of these?

238
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:22,380
This alcohol has a strong aftereffect.

239
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,300
- Is she all right? 
 - Huan Er.

240
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,530
- What should we do? 
 - Let her drink some water.

241
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,160
Huan Er.

242
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,810
I feel dizzy.

243
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,280
Chen Huan Er.

244
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,860
Your mother called you. Where's your phone?

245
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,920
My phone... My phone...

246
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,350
My phone...

247
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,490
It's in my bag.

248
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,160
Right. It's here. It's here.

249
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,440
It's in the bag.

250
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,490
I found it.

251
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,080
Sorry, her alcohol tolerance isn't great.

252
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,390
We'll leave first.

253
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,640
No battery.

254
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,850
- My phone's dead. 
 - Charge it when we get back.

255
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,500
- Let's go. 
 - We're heading off too, Qiu Li.

256
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,740
We'll leave now. We're going back to the girls' dorm.

257
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,083
Goodbye.

258
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,600
- Hey, pass me the bag. 
 - Keep up!

259
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,320
- Be careful. 
 - Watch out.

260
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,910
I'll help her.

261
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,820
- Slow down. Watch the stairs. 
 - Is she okay?

262
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,990
How did she get this drunk so fast?

263
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,320
- Slow down. 
 - Be careful.

264
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,230
Let's take her there to rest for a bit before heading back.

265
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,710
Slow down. Let's go there.

266
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,820
All right. Don't touch me.

267
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,700
- I'm all right. 
 - Be careful.

268
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,300
Other than feeling dizzy, do you feel unwell anywhere else?

269
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,870
Not really. I'm fine.

270
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,030
Really fine.

271
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,640
Lu, I want to go back to use the bathroom.

272
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,600
Number one or number two?

273
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,200
You could go back first.

274
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,810
I'll sit here with her until she sobers up, then send her back.

275
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,510
- Okay. 
 - Wait.

276
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,930
Leaving her alone here doesn't seem right.

277
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,500
I really can't hold it anymore, I really can't.

278
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,300
Aunt Li Na.

279
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,080
- Don't worry, I found Huan Er. 
 - Her parents know him.

280
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,500
Okay.

281
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,990
I'll take her back first. Please take care of her.

282
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,050
- Okay. 
 - All right. Huan Er, we're heading off now.

283
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,580
I need to go to the bathroom.

284
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,020
- It's fine. Just go back. 
 - Okay.

285
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,110
- Goodbye. 
 - Okay. Please take care of her.

286
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,320
- Goodbye. 
 - I'll leave her to you.

287
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,440
- Call me when you're back. 
 - It's okay. I can go back myself.

288
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,970
Can you walk by yourself?

289
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,804
Yes.

290
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:41,230
Isn't that the dorm right there?

291
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,030
I can make it.

292
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,540
Can you? Are you sure?

293
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,010
Get on.

294
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,650
Just get on.

295
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,660
You're poking me, it hurts.

296
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,110
I feel like throwing up.

297
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,500
Just don't throw up on me!

298
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,950
Jing Xi Chi.

299
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,180
What now?

300
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,980
Take this punch from me.

301
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,810
Can you stop making people worry about you, Chen Huan Er?

302
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:28,630
Drinking with strangers and getting this drunk. Are you careless or just stupid?

303
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes, I'm just stupid.

304
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,440
I'm an idiot.

305
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,370
That's why I let you fool me for so long.

306
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,810
I just wanted to joke with you and give you a surprise.

307
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:48,180
A joke is only a joke when both people find it funny.

308
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,220
Do you get that?

309
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,760
Fine. I'll apologize.

310
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,280
I'm sorry. Okay?

311
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,220
Can you stop being so childish, Jing Xi Chi?

312
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,870
Are you saying I'm childish?

313
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,520
Does going to that social event and getting drunk the first time you drink make you mature?

314
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,660
We're not in high school anymore. We're in university.

315
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,490
I can't just stay by your side all the time like before.

316
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,760
Can you stop caring about me?

317
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,420
If I don't, who will?

318
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,660
If Aunt Li Na hadn't called me, I...

319
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,680
I wouldn't have bothered.

320
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Fine!

321
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,180
From now on, we'll go our separate ways.

322
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,720
Don't care about me anymore.

323
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,960
I'll go back myself.

324
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
- How are you going to walk like this? 
 - Why wouldn't I be able to walk?

325
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,690
I can walk! I... I can walk.

326
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,980
I... I can walk.

327
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,220
You seem to be on a shaky bridge.

328
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,300
Didn't you say you don't care about me?

329
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,660
You sure that wasn’t fake alcohol?

330
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,830
Hello.

331
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,910
Today is the first class of Medical Psychology.

332
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,790
I won't be taking attendance.

333
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,290
There's no need for these formalities.

334
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:42,550
Everyone seated in this hall today, I trust you all have a certain level of self-discipline.

335
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:49,530
Those who chose clinical medicine aren't here to enjoy life.

336
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,690
Do we all agree on that?

337
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,140
Enough talk. Let's get straight to class.

338
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,880
My stomach hurts.

339
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,880
You're awake.

340
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,650
Drink some honey water. You drank too much last night.

341
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,320
Li, thanks for saving my life.

342
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,540
Next time, don't be so foolish.

343
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,220
If you can't drink, don't.

344
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,810
Anyway, you were pretty impressive. You could get upstairs on your own.

345
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,550
Last night, wasn't it you both who brought me back?

346
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,660
Don't you remember?

347
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,020
 Chen Huan Er, what are you doing? 

348
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,420
 This is my bed! 

349
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,550
 Huang Lu! Come get her off my bed! 

350
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,650
 Chen Huan Er! 

351
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,820
 Tonight, you're staying with me. 

352
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,220
- Thanks. 
 - Seriously, Huan Er, you're really strong.

353
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,320
Last night, Qiu Li and I couldn't move you no matter how hard we tried.

354
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,550
I'm really sorry.

355
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:39,220
I had no idea I got this strong when I was drunk.

356
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,280
By the way, last night, did I do anything I shouldn't have?

357
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,619
For that, you'll have to ask Jing.

358
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:51,740
- Why would I ask him? 
 - He's the one who brought you back.

359
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,260
Was he... was he there last night?

360
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,680
What did you two do last night?

361
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,460
Did he do something to you, or did you do something to him?

362
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
No way! What could possibly have happened between us?

363
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,260
Don't overthink it.

364
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,120
As expected, buddies can never become a couple.

365
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,460
It's so hot. Who turned off the air con again?

366
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,910
Who else? It was the top student.

367
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,940
I woke up at midnight from the heat and didn't fall back asleep until after five.

368
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,880
Every time she comes back, she turns it off.

369
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,640
If she doesn't like air-conditioned rooms, why doesn't she move to the old dorms in the east?

370
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,390
Oh, right, Huan Er.

371
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,880
Tian Chi called last night to ask how you were.

372
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,810
You were already asleep, so I didn't wake you up.

373
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,070
I charged your phone, check your message.

374
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,900
Thanks, Lu.

375
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,910
 Are you okay? 

376
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,420
 Huan Er, did you make it back? 

377
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,740
 Thanks, Tian Chi. 

378
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,590
 I'm fine. 

379
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,049
 Classes officially start today. 

380
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,080
 Wishing you all the best. 

381
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,393
 Where are you? 

382
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,460
 Aunt Li Na is looking for you. 

383
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,460
   

384
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,220
Oh no.

385
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,180
No, no, no.

386
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,600
 After a ridiculous drunken night, my university life has officially begun. 

387
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,400
 Honestly, university life isn't very different from high school. 

388
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,642
 I still rush to class at the last minute every day. 

389
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:45,260
 The only difference is the lecturer doesn't know every student by name. 

390
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,400
Today is a general course.

391
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,470
Let's do a random roll call.

392
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,560
- Wang Tao. 
 - Yes.

393
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,870
- Yang Tao. 
 - Yes.

394
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,790
- Sun Chang He. 
 - Yes.

395
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,020
- Zhou Hai Tao. 
 - Yes.

396
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,260
Zhou Ye.

397
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,700
Yes.

398
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,310
Jing Xi Chi.

399
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,910
Yes.

400
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,260
He's so handsome.

401
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,790
Dong Hui Xin.

402
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,110
Yes.

403
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,970
Qiu Li.

404
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,390
Qiu Li.

405
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,930
Yes.

406
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,830
Huang Lu.

407
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,730
Yes.

408
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,220
Chen Huan Er.

409
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,220
Sir, I'm here.

410
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,870
Chen Huan Er.

411
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,800
Are you attending class on behalf of three people?

412
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,150
You answered three times consecutively.

413
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,070
I can't even pretend not to notice anymore.

414
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,110
All three of you are marked absent.

415
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,550
- I... 
 - Next.

416
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,910
- Tang Song. 
 - Yes.

417
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,050
Today, we're covering Chapter One, Marxist Philosophy.

418
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,250
 It's not a great start. 

419
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,810
It has a long history.

420
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:12,020
The emergence of Marxist philosophy brought about a great revolution

421
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,220
in the history of thought.

422
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,270
In the history of human thought, in terms of scientific validity, truth, influence,

423
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,600
and reach...

424
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,180
 What does this have to do with you? 

425
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,800
The significance of Marxism...

426
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,110
Class dismissed.

427
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,280
Last...

428
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,630
Last night, how did I get back to the dorm?

429
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:57,065
Don't tell me you don't remember anything.

430
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,680
You...

431
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,320
You didn't do anything crazy to me, did you?

432
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I didn't... but you did plenty.

433
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,070
 Jing Xi Chi, take this punch from me. 

434
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,180
You owe me medical expenses, Chen Huan Er.

435
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,520
I didn't ask for your help; besides, weren't my roommates there?

436
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,940
That's exactly what you said last night.

437
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,170
 From now on, we're going our separate ways. 

438
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,600
 Don't care about me anymore. 

439
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,270
You're really heartless, aren't you?

440
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,420
Are you still mad?

441
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,170
It's unnecessary.

442
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,080
Sister Huan Er.

443
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,070
Hello, I'm Zhou Ye, Jing's roommate.

444
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,260
Look, it looks like we were meant to be classmates in this general course.

445
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,200
How about we add each other?

446
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,820
If you ever need anything, just call me.

447
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,500
Who said you could call her Sister Huan Er?

448
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,960
Aren't we all one big family?

449
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,340
No need to be so distant.

450
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,154
If she needs anything, she can come to me.

451
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:10,600
What's it got to do with you?

452
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,460
Look at you.

453
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,140
There's a club recruitment this afternoon, let's check it out.

454
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,070
No need to trouble yourself.

455
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,548
Well, don't be mad anymore. This semester just started. Are you planning to be mad throughout?

456
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:25,980
Who would dare be mad at you? You're a campus celebrity now.

457
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,550
That football video went viral.

458
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,020
Well, that just proves talent eventually shines.

459
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,910
Don't get cocky.

460
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,734
Let's go check out the club recruitment.

461
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:38,300
- Is it this way? 
 - Which club do you like?

462
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,660
Not sure yet. Let's take a look.

463
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Zhou Ye!

464
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,730
Du Wei.

465
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,030
- Hello, Du Wei. 
 - Jing, this is our third-year senior, Du Wei.

466
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,176
She's also from our course and incredibly skilled.

467
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,860
She's the head of the art department in the student council.

468
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,740
She was there yesterday too. Don't you remember?

469
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,070
With so many people, how could I?

470
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,760
- Hello, Du Wei. 
 - Jing Xi Chi, I've been wanting to meet you.

471
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,830
I'd like to invite you to join our Computer Competition Team.

472
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,260
Are you interested?

473
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,550
Of course, we're definitely interested!

474
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,660
Jing, I've heard a lot about this competition team.

475
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,160
Everyone in it is a top student.

476
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,130
That's perfect. We're having a gathering later,

477
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,700
and many people are curious about your current project.

478
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Come along. It'll be a great chance to exchange ideas.

479
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,180
Okay.

480
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,200
I can go to the club recruitment alone.

481
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,750
Then I'll meet you once I'm done.

482
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,010
Okay. Sure, go ahead.

483
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,110
- Let's go. 
 - Goodbye.

484
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,310
- Goodbye. 
 - Let's go.

485
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,970
Let's go.

486
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,260
I have to tell you, the Marxist Philosophy professor took attendance today.

487
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,194
I answered for both of you, but guess what?

488
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:45,080
We all got marked absent.

489
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,980
 What? That's so unlucky. 

490
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,400
Well, you two owe me a hotpot meal now.

491
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,640
That's settled, I'm hanging up.

492
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,560
Are you craving hotpot?

493
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,980
Tian Chi.

494
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,390
I was just joking with my roommate.

495
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,840
- Did you just finish class? 
 - Yes.

496
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,882
I thought I'd check out the club recruitment.

497
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:09,910
What a coincidence. I'm going too.

498
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,500
Let's go; I'll introduce you to the different clubs.

499
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,730
Thank you.

500
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,250
No problem.

501
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,910
There are so many clubs.

502
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,450
University clubs can be a mixed bag.

503
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:37,110
If you pick the wrong one, it's a waste of time and energy.

504
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,010
Do you have any hobbies?

505
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,870
- If you're interested, check us out. 
 - Thanks.

506
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:48,390
I feel like I like everything, but at the same time, nothing in particular.

507
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,566
You once told me that you have to try things to know whether you like them or not.

508
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:54,800
Do you remember that?

509
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,064
Of course.

510
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,000
Do you have any special skills?

511
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,550
I know martial arts.

512
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,700
Does our university have a martial arts club?

513
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,980
Martial arts?

514
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,550
Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm making it up or that I can't do it?

515
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,660
No, I believe you.

516
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,500
Unfortunately, our university doesn't have a martial arts club,

517
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,660
but you could consider joining the Student Union's Sports Department.

518
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,320
It's easy to get in.

519
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,965
All right, everyone, that's all for this week.

520
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:28,660
Same time, same place next week. Don't be late.

521
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,280
 I'm done here. Are you still at the club recruitment area? 

522
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,120
Here's the application form. Welcome aboard.

523
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,866
I don't think I've agreed yet.

524
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:49,160
Joining the competition team not only improves your professional skills

525
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,020
but also earns you extra credits. Why wouldn't you want to?

526
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,420
I'll think about it.

527
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,820
Can I borrow your phone for a moment?

528
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,070
I've already saved my number for you.

529
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,390
If you make up your mind, feel free to contact me.

530
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,420
   

531
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,840
I've heard this senior is quite the tough one.

532
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,420
Well, seeing is believing.

533
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,910
Let's go.

534
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,660
- Where to? 
 - Check out the club recruitment.

535
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,910
Class dismissed.

536
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,700
 First, you have to take the initiative. 

537
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,970
 - Then? 
 - Make sure he knows you like him. 

538
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,260
 You two will be far away from home with no parents around to watch over you, 

539
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,070
 and there will be plenty of chances for you to study together. 

540
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,500
 Isn't that your opportunity? 

541
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,680
Jing, is there any club you're interested in?

542
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,540
I haven't decided yet. I'll take a look first.

543
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,450
Zhou Ye! Zhou Ye!

544
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,740
Here.

545
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,560
Lin.

546
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,420
You're done.

547
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,070
I sent you a message just now. Why didn't you reply?

548
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,982
I was busy filling out the form and didn't see it.

549
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:27,590
Your friend joined the sports department. Consider it.

550
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,590
You can mention that you're good at martial arts.

551
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,400
Oh, I almost forgot.

552
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,040
Also, you're a sports lover.

553
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Sports lover.

554
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,870
Write that you want to use this opportunity to make new friends.

555
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,550
Sports department?

556
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,830
What's in it for you?

557
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,040
Do you want to lead the charge during Sports Day, starting with a 1,500m run?

558
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,350
No.

559
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,120
Tian Chi told me the sports department is pretty chill.

560
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,560
I think you're just blinded by a pretty face.

561
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,784
Not again.

562
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:09,020
Li.

563
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,360
Which club did you join?

564
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,580
The student council's art department.

565
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,500
The arts department?

566
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,800
Nice choice.

567
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,180
Don't even try to leave.

568
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,910
Lu.

569
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:26,210
I have a feeling that Tian Chi likes you.

570
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,460
Tian Chi is the most handsome guy on campus.

571
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,350
He's in the top three of his major and has published in a core journal with his supervisor.

572
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,450
He's even been recommended by a professor for a postgraduate spot.

573
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,910
He's such a perfect guy.

574
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,640
What a catch!

575
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,840
Stop talking nonsense.

576
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,720
Who's talking nonsense?

577
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,840
At the start of the semester, didn't he help you carry your luggage

578
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,480
and give you his contact?

579
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,560
That's just because we went to the same high school.

580
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,840
- We're alumni. 
 - Then why did he

581
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,360
accompany you to the club recruitment today?

582
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,870
He didn't accompany me.

583
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,310
We just ran into each other.

584
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,830
He ran into so many people, but why did he only accompany you?

585
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,360
Li, am I right?

586
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,870
- Yes. 
 - Look.

587
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,270
People pursuing Qiu Li are lining up from the West Campus to the East Campus.

588
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,710
Even she thinks I have a point.

589
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,830
What do you have to say now?

590
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,310
According to your logic, shouldn't he like Qiu Li instead?

591
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,780
Stop right there! He's not my type.

592
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,420
Why are you turning off the air con?

593
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,920
It's not that hot.

594
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
I think we should just turn on the fan.

595
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,331
Why use a fan when we have an air con?

596
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:44,600
With the air con on, the temperature inside gets too low while it's hot outside.

597
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
If we keep going in and out, we'll catch a cold.

598
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,880
Plus, it wastes electricity.

599
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,420
Well, if you don't want to split the air con bill

600
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,920
because you're not here often, I'll pay for it myself.

601
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,680
However, I get to decide when it's on.

602
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,830
Why do you always boss people around?

603
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,960
Just because you have money?

604
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,867
What does this have to do with money?

605
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:12,720
Can you stop making all of us suffer just because of you?

606
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,340
It's fine.

607
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,350
It's not that hot. We don't have to turn it on.

608
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,680
Yes, we can wait until it gets hotter.

609
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,230
Here, eat something.

610
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,670
Don't be angry.

611
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,460
Go ahead and sweat if you like.

612
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,620
Li, you...

613
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,390
Your phone.

614
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,540
Let me take this call.

615
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,420
Hello? Qi Qi.

616
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,710
You finally remembered me.

617
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,880
How's your new life?

618
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,980
 It's hard to explain. 

619
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:59,600
I thought university would be pretty chill, but I didn't expect so many frustrating things.

620
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,040
What about Jing Xi Chi?

621
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,080
He's something else. He actually tricked us for so long.

622
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,820
Exactly. Even Cong—

623
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,270
Let's not talk about him anymore. Let's stop.

624
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:15,570
It's okay.

625
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,110
I've let it go.

626
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,270
By the way, what are you doing?

627
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,450
I... I'm waiting for a classmate to eat.

628
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,180
I need to stop, he just finished class.

629
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
He?

630
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,870
Who is he?

631
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,000
Why are you here?

632
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,290
You've been in the city for so long and never contacted me.

633
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,230
I'm just joking.

634
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,260
I'm over all that.

635
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,270
Since it's just the two of us studying here,

636
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,350
shouldn't we look out for each other as old classmates?

637
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,830
Are you free later?

638
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,500
I'm free.

639
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,330
Then come with me to your university's screening hall for a movie.

640
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,100
A movie?

641
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,420
Why not?

642
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,390
I rarely visit your campus. Won't you even show me around?

643
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,940
Okay.

644
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,360
Let's go.

645
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,520
Who's that? Why didn't you reply?

646
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,953
It's Du Wei.

647
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:51,800
She asked if I filled out that application form.

648
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,665
Speaking of this, I'm curious.

649
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,740
Isn't that competition team pretty good? Why are you so against joining?

650
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,133
It's too much hassle.

651
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:00,310
Not joining is more hassle, okay?

652
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,960
Du Wei is famous for never giving up until she gets what she wants.

653
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,087
What's that got to do with me?

654
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:09,920
Haven't you noticed she's got her eye on you?

655
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,649
Keep going.

656
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:16,440
What exactly has she set her sights on?

657
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,670
Even if I'm the top student, that's only among freshmen.

658
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:25,210
Even if we actually join that competition, we'll just end up doing the hardest work.

659
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,910
That's it?

660
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,450
That's it.

661
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,910
Well, should I call you naive or just plain dumb?

662
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,280
Haven't you noticed the way she looks at you?

663
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,480
It's like she's about to see right through you!

664
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:48,240
So by your logic, since you pay so much attention to her, do you like her?

665
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,020
Can you not say things like that? It'll bring bad luck.

666
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,501
What are you doing?

667
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:00,760
I'm working out now. I have to strictly control my daily fat intake.

668
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,200
It can only be 30% of my total daily calories.

669
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,370
- Okay. 
 - I'll have some more of this then.

670
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,140
What exactly are you trying to do?

671
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,120
Let me educate you.

672
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,640
Based on my fitness plan, not only do I need to control my fat intake,

673
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,140
but I also have to consume exactly 120 grams of protein a day.

674
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,573
I've already had quite a bit.

675
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:23,680
I think I'm still short by 15 or 16 grams.

676
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,340
What "15 grams"?

677
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,270
I need protein too! Do you think only you need protein?

678
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,890
- Don't I? 
 - I put in so much effort—

679
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,390
 If I don't gain muscle, it's on you. 

680

"Yesterday’s Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi

682
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,570
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

683
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,440
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

684
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:11,070
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

685
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:17,460
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

686
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:24,970
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

687
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,900
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

688
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,680
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

689
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,380
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

690
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,340
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

691
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,460
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

692
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:59,180
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

693
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,640
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

694
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,010
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

695
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,900
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

696
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,700
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

697
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,640
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

698
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,330
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

699
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,070
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

700
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,480
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

701
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,660
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

702
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,060
♫  At the right time  ♫
