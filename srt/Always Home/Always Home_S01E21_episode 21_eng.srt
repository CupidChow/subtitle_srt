00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:21,150


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,580
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,020
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,730
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:59,160
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,680
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,670
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,250
 ­  

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,980
   
   

17
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,680
Huan Er, what are you looking for?

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,010
I'm searching for a book called Medical Herbology.

19
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,840
Medical Herbology.

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,700
Medical Herbology...

21
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,160
   

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,660
   

23
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,740
Thank you.

24
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,240
Sorry, I still need to find one more book.

25
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,380
   

26
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,613
You can't be worse off than me, right?

27
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:05,590
If you're already making that face, I might as well hit a wall.

28
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:10,460
   

29
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,460
Have you ever been ranked this low?

30
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,890
Yenching University is the top university in the country.

31
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,860
If you could casually get first place like before,

32
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,540
it wouldn't be any different from Tianhe.

33
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,620
 The cafeteria food was pretty good today. 

34
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,580
Yeah, I think they must have changed the chef.

35
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,500
And... You are?

36
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,250
Let me introduce myself. I'm Lin Jing Yi.

37
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,580
From now on, we're roommates.

38
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,990
You don't look like you're our age.

39
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,730
- How old are you? 
 - I'm fifteen.

40
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,040
At your age, I should be calling you "brother."

41
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,960
Since the semester started, you haven't been here.

42
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,620
I came a few times, but I applied for an off-campus hostel,

43
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,840
and these past few months I've been abroad with my supervisor on an academic exchange.

44
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,320
Your supervisor?

45
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,450
By the way, who's Song Cong?

46
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,450
- Him. 
 - That's me.

47
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,500
Your note was on the desk, and I just skimmed through it.

48
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,320
Your Compensatory Value Formula has an error in the calculation.

49
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,890
The arterial blood range for the patient should be between 31.8 and 37.8 mmol/L.

50
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,890
Let me see...

51
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,400
You’re right.

52
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,480
Add me on QQ.

53
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,810
Here.

54
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,280
Boomerang Nebula?

55
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,980
The coldest nebula in the known universe.

56
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,180
- You know about it? 
 - Just a little.

57
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,240
Hello, Mom.

58
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,939
You've arrived? All right, I'll be right down.

59
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:13,700
I have to go downstairs for a bit. I'll be back soon.

60
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,940
Fifteen years old.

61
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,430
The world has gone insane.

62
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,610
These are my old lecture notes; they might be helpful to you.

63
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,090
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

64
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,740
But... can you read them tomorrow?

65
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,660
I want to sleep now.

66
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,110
Sorry.

67
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,990
I'll read them outside.

68
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,910
It's time to sleep. Good night, everyone.

69
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,150
Good night.

70
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,010
Good night.

71
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,790
What's wrong with you?

72
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,790
You've seemed down these past few days.

73
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,740
Is it because of Jing Xi Chi?

74
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,520
I wonder what it feels like to like someone.

75
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,640
It's like wanting to be attached to him like conjoined twins.

76
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,040
You'd want to see him all the time.

77
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,520
I just want to be a top student with him.

78
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,760
Dong Hui Xin, have you ever liked someone?

79
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,300
Why so surprised?

80
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,620
It's human nature.

81
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,420
I'm human too, okay?

82
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,260
Top Student, please tell me: if you like someone

83
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,470
and they touch you, even accidentally...

84
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,260
would you feel uncomfortable?

85
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,420
Of course not.

86
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,940
Yeah.

87
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,150
Even if they don't touch you accidentally but deliberately,

88
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,300
you still wouldn't feel uncomfortable.

89
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,550
When you like someone, you just want to hug and hold them all the time.

90
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,620
Otherwise, why are there idioms describing their intimacy,

91
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,490
their lingering affection, or their night of ecstasy?

92
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,740
Huang Lu, you use all your knowledge of idioms in erotic fiction.

93
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,350
A gangster isn't scary.

94
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,860
What's scary is a literate gangster.

95
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,440
What gangster? What erotic fiction?

96
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,150
This is a lesson by Master Huang Lu.

97
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,260
Master Huang has never been in a relationship, yet she's giving lectures, right?

98
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,030
How ungrateful! You better jot down the points.

99
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,540
   

100
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,450
 Forget it. It's pointless to ask more. 

101
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,950
Ye.

102
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,900
I saw you in the library yesterday.

103
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,780
It's so rare!

104
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,780
Don't be so mean. Can't I just study?

105
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,070
Don't pretend.

106
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,680
Did a pretty girl catch your attention?

107
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,420
Oh yeah, you're right.

108
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,900
Wow, why didn't you bring me along?

109
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,310
You know her.

110
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,740
But stop dreaming.

111
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,430
She's already taken.

112
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,120
Who?

113
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,390
Chen Huan Er.

114
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,140
She's taken? By who?

115
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,830
Tian Chi.

116
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,860
I saw them at the library yesterday.

117
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,200
They looked like they were on a date.

118
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,280
From the way they interacted, it seemed they were together.

119
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,870
I see. It's late now. Let's sleep.

120
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,660
   

121
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,400
 What are your plans today? 

122
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,880
 Do you want to eat together? 

123
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,940
 There's a soccer match on the campus today. 

124
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,780
 I can't go with you. 

125
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:29,800
   

126
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,092
 Are you free today? 

127
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:33,210
 Do you want to eat together? 

128
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,040
Why are you calling me on a weekend?

129
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,316
Just checking in on you.

130
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,150
 You're never this thoughtful. 

131
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,460
It's Uncle Jing's birthday today, right?

132
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,820
You still remember?

133
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,500
Jing Xi Chi,

134
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,380
carrying everything alone is exhausting.

135
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,020
You guys told me that before,

136
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,380
but why can't you understand it now?

137
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,430
 I've been wanting to say it, don't bear it alone. 

138
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,020
 We're friends. 

139
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,600
Friends support each other. Do you understand?

140
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,110
It's not that serious.

141
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,300
Don't sound so stern, okay?

142
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,920
 Did something happen? 

143
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,260
It hasn't even been that long.

144
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,960
What changed your personality?

145
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,620
You went from a quiet top student to a talkative one.

146
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,480
I just wanted to make a change in a new environment.

147
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,360
 How are things between you and Huan Er? 

148
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,280
You done? If you're done, I'm hanging up.

149
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,100
What a chatterbox!

150
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,030
Aren't you the one who called me?

151
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,850
 My friend is organizing a photography exhibition. 

152
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,930
 Shall we go together tonight? 

153
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,280
 All right, let's go after class. 

154
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,310
One salad and a medium sirloin steak.

155
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,990
All right.

156
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,500
 There's a soccer match today, but he didn't even invite me to watch. 

157
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,190
 Is he lying to me? 

158
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,810
Huan Er,

159
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,280
I'm fine with anything.

160
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,620
A medium-well sirloin steak, please.

161
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,920
All right.

162
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,700
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

163
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,800
The bar we're going to tonight has live performances.

164
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,920
It should be fun.

165
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,090
Really? Then...

166
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,210
Who else will be there?

167
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,920
Some local bands.

168
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,660
But the vibe there is nice.

169
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,700
Didn't expect you to be this shy.

170
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Look at this one, here.

171
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,920
Your setup is very interesting.

172
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,280
Over there, we have...

173
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,400
Qi Qi!

174
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,740
You can go explore first. My friend just arrived.

175
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,970
- Hello, Xi Xi. 
 - You're finally here.

176
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,940
I've been waiting for so long!

177
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,060
This is...

178
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,980
Song Cong. He's my friend.

179
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,540
Hi.

180
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,320
She is Xi Xi from our university's Art Department,

181
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,680
and most of these artworks are hers.

182
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,900
Come on, you've got pieces too. Why not mention that?

183
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,290
Your artwork is also on display?

184
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,888
What do you think of this exhibition?

185
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,280
It's very interesting.

186
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,140
It's quite different from what I imagined a photography exhibition to be.

187
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,500
That's good to hear.

188
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,400
Qi Qi. Lu Lu and the others are here. Let's go and say hi to them.

189
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,560
Sure. Wait for me a while.

190
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,070
All right.

191
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,780
Hello.

192
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,070
Long time no see.

193
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,020
It's been a while!

194
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,760
I go over there first.

195
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,440
Do you like Venus?

196
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,090
I was just looking at the muscle structure in the photo.

197
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,940
You're here at the exhibition, but you're still thinking about that kind of stuff?

198
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,760
Do you want to go outside for some fresh air?

199
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,450
Sure.

200
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,460
Your classmates' photography exhibition is being held in such a nice place.

201
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,260
This place belongs to Xi Xi's family.

202
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,190
Song Cong,

203
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,920
I can tell you're different from before.

204
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,380
- I... 
 - Are you struggling with your studies?

205
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,540
You could tell?

206
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,800
Before this, Li Tian once asked me a question.

207
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,370
He asked if I ever experienced that feeling of not being able to absorb knowledge.

208
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,700
I didn't answer him.

209
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,136
I was afraid of hurting his pride

210
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,730
because, honestly, I had never felt that way.

211
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,530
But now...

212
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,000
I finally understand it.

213
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,680
So now you've gone from a highly capable top student to a less capable good student,

214
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,040
and you can't accept it?

215
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,260
Not exactly.

216
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,680
It's not that I can't accept being less capable than others.

217
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,630
It's just that...

218
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,610
I feel like I could do better.

219
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:44,680
You know, sculptures like Venus weren't unique in ancient Greece.

220
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,190
But only this one that lost its arms became an unsurpassable masterpiece in art history.

221
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,770
Because its imperfections spark people's imaginations even more?

222
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,530
Maybe.

223
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,290
But I prefer another interpretation.

224
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,910
There is no such thing as perfection in this world.

225
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,950
To be human is to be flawed.

226
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,290
It's not just you.

227
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,470
Everyone is the same.

228
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,800
Oh, by the way, I have something to tell you.

229
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm transferring to the Literature Department.

230
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,973
Although I don't know whether the path of literature will be bright in the future,

231
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:32,260
I believe that as long as I'm firm in my choice,

232
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,860
no matter what difficulties I encounter, nothing will stop me from moving forward.

233
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,580
So, Song Cong, stop overthinking.

234
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:53,020
Close your eyes and keep moving forward. You will make it through.

235
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,100
Okay.

236
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,667
 What time does the match start? 
   

237
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:28,710
 Have you finished playing? Did you win? 

238
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,150
 Why haven't you replied yet? 

239
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,740
 Did the soccer match end already? 
   

240
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,480
Was the food not to your liking?

241
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,880
No. It was actually good.

242
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,160
Then what about—

243
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,050
 There is no soccer match on the campus today.  
    

244
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,960
 We're at an internet café. 

245
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,500
 Today is Uncle Jing's birthday. 
   

246
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,970
 Jing seems a bit down. 

247
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,400
 Do you want to go and keep him company? 

248
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,970
What about ordering some dessert?

249
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,160
I'm sorry, Tian Chi.

250
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,220
I have something to do now. I need to head back to school.

251
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,768
All right. I'll take you back then.

252
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:30,780
It's fine. I can go back on my own.

253
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,180
- Waiter, can I pay the bill, please? 
 - I'll pay for this.

254
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,273
Don't you have something urgent to do? You should go first.

255
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:38,660
Well... next time... it's my treat next time.

256
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,185
Thank you, Tian Chi.

257
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:43,819
Huan Er, the bar stays open late.

258
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:47,870
If you're done with your plans, come and find me.

259
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,680
All right. I'm sorry, Tian Chi.

260
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,160
I'll contact you later.

261
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,730
Okay.

262
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,680
Jing Xi Chi.

263
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,370
Wait right there.

264
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,480
I've been calling you all day, and you're not answering!

265
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,090
What kind of big business do you have now?

266
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,060
I was playing soccer and didn't bring my phone.

267
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,460
You don't look like you've just played soccer.

268
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,850
Well, maybe it's just because I was born naturally good-looking.

269
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,150
Don't pretend. I can smell your shampoo.

270
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,014
What's wrong with you?

271
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:52,140
Did you get your heart broken?

272
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,240
What?

273
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,300
You think I'm the type to get heartbroken?

274
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,810
Oh yeah, now you're a star in the Computer Science Department.

275
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,450
It's different from before.

276
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,050
I'm in high demand now.

277
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,580
Exactly.

278
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,645
I heard about the pink rose thing.

279
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:08,800
Did someone confess to you?

280
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,510
I turned her down.

281
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,280
Why?

282
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,210
Don't you think she looks a bit like our high school English teacher?

283
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,580
Does she? Du Wei is quite pretty, though.

284
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,450
I'm not talking about her looks. It's her vibe.

285
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,340
She always seems smiley, but deep down, she's super serious.

286
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,400
I'm scared I'd dream about her forcing me to finish an English practice set.

287
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,840
You're nuts.

288
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,840
Speaking of that, why did you go for Tian Chi?

289
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,810
He seems like such a boring guy.

290
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,450
I just thought I'd give it a try.

291
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,290
You never know what you like until you try.

292
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,900
If you wanted to try it, did it have to be him?

293
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,620
If you wanted to try dating a top student, you could've picked Cong.

294
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,870
Are you out of your mind?

295
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,640
- You're mad. 
 - No, I'm not.

296
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,250
- You're mad. 
 - I'm not!

297
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,550
Definitely mad.

298
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,760
I brought you a lot of snacks.

299
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,180
Come on, I'm an adult now.

300
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,460
I don't eat these.

301
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,880
I got you a ton of chips!

302
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,150
Why is there no Little Raccoon's crunchy noodles?

303
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,250
They don't sell them at the campus store anymore.

304
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,770
The favorite restaurants close down.

305
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,980
The favorite snacks disappear.

306
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,210
Why does this happen?

307
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,260
You can try new snacks.

308
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,350
This one's really good.

309
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,150
How is it? Is it good?

310
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,310
It's good.

311
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,310
It tastes good.

312
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,250
But some things just can't be replaced.

313
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,830
Right?

314
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,730
Yeah.

315
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,560
If you like it, I'll buy you another pack next time.

316
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,237
Just one pack?

317
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:16,350
One pack isn't enough?

318
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,260
You're so stingy.

319
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,630
You say I'm stingy?

320
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,100
Remember back in high school when we got robbed?

321
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,700
You bought only one can of Jianlibao and shared it with Song Cong,

322
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,350
but you didn't let me drink.

323
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,980
You still remember such a trivial thing?

324
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,550
Of course I do. I hold grudges.

325
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,070
Do you remember the agriculture study? I gave you everything I had.

326
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,070
Lies!

327
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,660
You clearly gave half of it to Song Cong.

328
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,160
- You forgot? 
 - Did I?

329
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,790
- You really don't remember? 
 - I don't think so.

330
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,740
- You did! Don't try to weasel out of it. 
 - No way.

331
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,000
I swear I gave it all to you.

332
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,700
Hold this for me.

333
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,420
Oh no!

334
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,780
   

335
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,350
 Hello, Huan Er. 

336
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,680
Sorry, are you still there?

337
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,989
Are you already here?

338
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:02,780
 I'm sorry. 

339
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,140
How about we go there another day?

340
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,740
 - All right.  
 - Sorry.

341
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,220
Rest early.

342
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,790
Okay.

343
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,310
 Bye. 

344
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,360
   

345
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,560
Well... I'm heading back.

346
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,480
They are about to rest now.

347
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,681
What about you?

348
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,940
I'll just stay here for a bit.

349
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,600
Bye.

350
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,530
Jing Xi Chi, what are you doing?

351
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,980
Tian Chi...

352
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,790
why are you here?

353
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:33,940
Huan Er, actually, today I do have something I wanted to tell you.

354
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,560
I...

355
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,958
I also have something to tell you.

356
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,901
Let me finish first.

357
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:45,250
I'm afraid that if I don't say it now, I won't get another chance.

358
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,940
I'm not good with words,

359
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,590
but for some reason, every time I see you,

360
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:04,120
I become nervous, which makes me unable to say what I want.

361
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,830
Even when I do, it never comes out right.

362
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,150
So, whenever we part, I regret it,

363
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,890
thinking I didn't do enough.

364
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,520
I always believed that feelings should happen naturally.

365
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,100
I think there's a long way to go,

366
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,540
and as time passes, the two people will eventually become closer.

367
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,340
But I realized I was wrong.

368
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,910
I know there is someone very important in your heart.

369
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,290
But unfortunately, that person isn't me.

370
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,570
I'm sorry, Tian Chi.

371
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,460
Maybe you're right.

372
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:19,680
Right now, I really can't like anyone else.

373
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,640
I should return this book to you.

374
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,390
Things that don't belong to me shouldn't be kept.

375
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,740
I also hope you find your own happiness.

376
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,480
I wish you happiness, too.

377
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,810
Sincerely.

378
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,020
Then...

379
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,970
I'll get going now.

380
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,800
You seem to be in a good mood.

381
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,540
What happened? Did Tian Chi confess to you?

382
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,100
Yeah.

383
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,530
- You're not single anymore— 
 - I turned him down.

384
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,540
I knew it.

385
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,840
Why?

386
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,990
He's such a great guy. Why don't you like him?

387
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:12,950
Li said not to ask why you love someone or why you don't.

388
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,780
Good girl.

389
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,150
What does that mean?

390
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,880
I know this one!

391
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,580
In White Horse Neighs in the Western Wind,

392
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,050
Li Wen Xiu mentions: "There are many wonderful things.

393
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,630
But I just don't like them."

394
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,200
 But some things just can't be replaced. 

395
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,770
 Right? 

396
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,950
 Yeah. 

397
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,630
Come on.

398
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,370
Try this cake.

399
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,500
I specifically bought two flavors. Both are your favorites. Try them.

400
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,300
I tell you, I knew you would reject Tian Chi.

401
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,640
Why are you so sure that I'd turn him down?

402
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,890
Think about this. Cong is such an outstanding guy,

403
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,950
and you already rejected him.

404
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,920
Compared to Song, Tian Chi is still far away.

405
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,260
Even if you're dying to fall in love, you shouldn't settle, right?

406
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,540
Can you stop bringing up Cong?

407
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,950
You're so petty.

408
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,230
I'm not petty.

409
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,570
I'm just curious.

410
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,780
You've turned down two guys already.

411
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,630
So, what kind of person do you actually like?

412
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:52,470
Do you have a specific description of him in your mind?

413
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:58,430
Like his hair length, his personality, or his...

414
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,950
Why do you even want to know that?

415
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:07,040
I just see you single all the time, and it shouldn't be like that.

416
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,720
I don't have an ideal type.

417
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,640
But don't girls usually love fantasizing about this?

418
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,230
I'm not an ordinary girl.

419
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,190
 Huan Er, Song Cong and I are thinking of visiting during the break. 

420
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,300
- What's going on? 
 - Qi Qi just told me

421
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,430
that she and Cong are coming to visit us in a few days.

422
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,580
- The two of them? 
 - Yeah.

423
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,330
Coming to visit us?

424
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,660
Do you want to eat this cake? If not, I'll have it.

425
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,920
You aren't curious at all.

426
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,530
- Yeah. 
 - The two of them...

427
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,130
Yeah, so?

428
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,890
Stop eating! They've known each other since high school.

429
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,880
And now, they're finally...

430
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,290
Aren't you curious about its flavor?

431
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,330
Not really.

432
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,640
I'll try this one instead.

433
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,100
Don't guys usually not like sweets?

434
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,320
Well, I'm not an ordinary guy.

435
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,580
These are for me, aren't they?

436
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,440
Drink your coffee.

437
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,520
 - I'll carry it. 
 - It's fine. I can carry it. 

438
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,020
Cong, what a lame place you found! It's so foggy.

439
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,990
That's just how it is in the mountain.

440
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,490
Once the sun comes up, it'll clear.

441
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,430
Later, in front of Song Cong, don't mention anything about grades or rankings.

442
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,780
From what I know about him, he's just used to being at the top.

443
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,660
He can't bear a sudden drop in grades.

444
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,430
Since love can cure everything, why not match him up with someone?

445
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,820
So it takes his mind off things.

446
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,190
Wow, your little brain is so smart.

447
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,020
Yeah.

448
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,910
Hello, I've reserved two rooms.

449
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,600
- Please wait a moment. 
 - All right. Thank you.

450
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,220
- Wow, he's so handsome. 
 - He's your cup of tea.

451
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,300
Isn't he your type?

452
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,180
What's your relationship with him now?

453
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,950
What do you mean?

454
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,910
I saw him carrying your luggage so naturally.

455
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,830
I thought you two were already...

456
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,950
It's the same as before.

457
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,680
I help him, he helps me.

458
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,390
But I saw Cong carrying your luggage too.

459
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,660
How's that going between you two?

460
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,700
Didn't you notice? He only did that because Jing Xi Chi helped you first.

461
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,740
Forget about that. Let's talk about something pleasant.

462
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,440
I switched my major from Law to Chinese Literature.

463
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,430
Really? That's great.

464
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,180
I'm really happy now.

465
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,700
I feel like my world suddenly opened up.

466
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,310
Maybe because I opened up too.

467
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:08,660
So now, I also want to help Song Cong get out of his slump as well.

468
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,830
Really?

469
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,180
I don't think it's that simple.

470
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,140
It's not?

471
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,790
No, it isn't.

472
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,750
How is everything going between you and Qi Qi?

473
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,220
What do you mean?

474
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,150
Don't play dumb. You know what I mean.

475
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,220
I think Qi Qi is different now,

476
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,220
but I can't quite say how.

477
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,640
What about you? How's everything between you and Chen Huan Er?

478
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,470
What do you mean?

479
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,600
Don't play dumb.

480
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,280
When are you going to confess?

481
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,055
I've known for a long time that you like her.

482
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:51,270
How did you figure that out?

483
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,100
Instinct.

484
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,600
Do you mind that I used to like Chen Huan Er?

485
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,910
When I first found out, of course I did.

486
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,040
But I don't care anymore because it's been so long already.

487
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,232
Do you still like her?

488
00:36:14,232 --> 00:36:15,890
Are you crazy?

489
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,900
If you like her, why don't you confess?

490
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,774
I'm afraid that if I fail, we won't even be friends anymore.

491
00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:28,579
See, weren't the two of you just like that?

492
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:30,890
Didn't you start talking less afterward?

493
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,640
I didn't think that far ahead back then.

494
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,520
So you care about your relationship with Chen Huan Er more than I did.

495
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,660
Hello, your check-in is complete.

496
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,660
Thank you.

497
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,720
- It's done? 
 - Let's go. It's done.

498
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,590
- Where's your suitcase? 
 - It's there.

499
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,220
Jing Xi Chi.

500
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,840
What's up?

501
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,728
What were you doing?

502
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:03,790
Go straight to the point.

503
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,020
We need to figure out a way to get them to leave first

504
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,430
so they can spend time with each other.

505
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,710
How is this possible?

506
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,820
Let's think of some good ideas.

507
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,500
I've got it!

508
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,439
What are you doing? I don't have time for this right now.

509
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,500
I figured out a way!

510
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,270
What way?

511
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,290
Are you crazy, Chen Huan Er?

512
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,140
Help!

513
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,880
Help!

514
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,660
Shout with me! Scream!

515
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,870
You can do it on your own.

516
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,140
Shout with me!

517
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,700
Hurry!

518
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,790
What's wrong with this?

519
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,470
- Why is the water so strong? 
 - It's spraying everywhere!

520
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,470
 - My clothes are soaked! 
 - Help! 

521
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,910
 Why is the water so strong? 

522
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,750
 Let me check it. 

523
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,270
They're coming. Faster!

524
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,460
Come.

525
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,660
- What happened? 
 - What's wrong?

526
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,830
Why are you all soaked?

527
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,320
The shower head broke, and we got sprayed all over.

528
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,060
- Yeah. 
 - Should we switch rooms?

529
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,580
- No, no need. 
 - Just go change your clothes.

530
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,990
I checked it out and fixed it.

531
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,540
You two can leave first.

532
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,350
We need to clean up a bit.

533
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,580
Yeah. Well... we need to change clothes and take a shower.

534
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,430
- You have fun first. See you later. 
 - Yeah, go ahead.

535
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,920
- Let me know when you're done. 
 - Sure.

536
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,140
- See you later. 
 - Let's go.

537
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,200
- You go first. 
 - Go ahead. Bye.

538
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,580
Go ahead.

539
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,920
Well, then we leave first.

540
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,880
Yeah, let's go.

541
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,430
Chen Huan Er, I just came up with a genius idea.

542
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,870
What is it?

543
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,960
Think about this. When they come back later,

544
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,948
we'll find a way to put them in the same room.

545
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:03,800
Then they'll be alone together in the room.

546
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,640
The romantic atmosphere is the perfect breeding ground for love.

547
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,380
What do you think?

548
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,690
Who says being alone together automatically leads to love?

549
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,220
Why wouldn't it?

550
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,390
Think about this. People are sensitive, right?

551
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,910
The smaller the space, the more they'll feel each other's presence. Am I right?

552
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,950
The best moment is when they're physically close.

553
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,430
And then, a ray of sunlight...

554
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,870
Don't laugh. I'm serious. Stop laughing. Listen to me.

555
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,390
And then, a ray of sunlight falls on the floor.

556
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,580
At this moment, the room will become very silent.

557
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,100
Neither of them says a word, but they are...

558
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,220
Stop laughing. Be serious.

559
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,390
But, they...

560
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,270
But they pay attention to each other's movements.

561
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,950
- Movement... 
 - Even if there's just a little flow of air,

562
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,620
they'll sense it instantly.

563
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,000
And just like that, the love arrives.

564
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,880
- The love arrives just like that? 
 - Yeah, just like that.

565
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:40,860
Well... since we're already here, should we go out for a bit?

566
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,711
Sure. I was thinking the same thing.

567
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:46,960
I'll go down first and wait for you.

568
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,100
- I... 
 - I...

569
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,540
I'll get going first.

570
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,940
Okay.

571
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:11,770


572
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:17,030
 "Yesterday’s Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi

♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

574

578
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:57,520
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

579
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:04,100
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

580
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:10,800
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

581
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,760
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

582

583
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,600
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

584
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,060
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

585
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:33,430
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

586
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:38,320
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

587
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,220
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

588
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,160
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

589
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,850
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

590
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,390
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

591
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,800
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

592
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,980
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

593
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,480
♫  At the right time  ♫
