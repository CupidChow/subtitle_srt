00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:20,860


2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,360
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,550
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,230
  ­ 

16
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,280
   
   

17
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,300
- Happy New Year. 
 - Happy New Year.

18
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,620
I really want to set off fireworks.

19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,480
Cong and I searched everywhere, but no one was selling them.

20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,970
Is he okay?

21
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,690
He's all right. He drank less than half a can.

22
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,340
Only half a can?

23
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,290
He's expected to perform exceptionally well today.

24
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,410
Have you had alcohol before?

25
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,250
Just once.

26
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,840
We had just graduated from junior middle school,

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,730
and his mom insisted that he join the international class.

28
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:52,600
We both felt like the sky was falling, so we had a drink to say goodbye.

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,080
He only took a sip and slept the whole day.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,750
Since then, we never drank again.

31
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,860
I think you two have a pretty good relationship.

32
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,040
We've been in the same class from kindergarten to middle school.

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,010
Even the teacher said we were like twins, inseparable.

34
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,920
Just like...

35
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,450
I never thought there would be a day when I'd be separated from my parents either.

36
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,690
Are you okay?

37
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,580
I'm all right.

38
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,740
Give me a hand.

39
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,840
Help him to the bedroom.

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,280
The floor is cold. Don't let him catch a cold.

41
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,270
Cong. Get up, Cong.

42
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,180
Lie down.

43
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,120
I feel dizzy.

44
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,960
I'll get you a glass of water.

45
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,990
Jing Xi Chi.

46
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Jing Xi Chi.

47
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,380
   

48
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,230
   

49
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,150
Jing Xi Chi!

50
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,350
Jing Xi Chi!

51
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,720
Jing Xi Chi.

52
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,860
Jing Xi Chi...

53
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,570
Jing Xi Chi!

54
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,620
Jing Xi Chi!

55
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,960
Jing Xi Chi!

56
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,770
Aunt Lin.

57
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,910
Aunt Lin.

58
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,710
Chen Huan Er.

59
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,400
Why did you come out?

60
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,175
I went to buy you some fireworks.

61
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,450
I searched for a long time but couldn't find any.

62
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,500
I searched a few streets.

63
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,390
It took me a lot of effort to find a store selling fireworks.

64
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,540
Jing Xi Chi.

65
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,002
Can you take your phone with you when you go out?

66
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:41,030
Can't you tell me first? Don't make it hard for me to find you!

67
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,480
If you do this again, I won't look for you anymore!

68
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,400
Do you know that when I opened my eyes and saw you were gone,

69
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,730
I... I thought...

70
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,160
I just went to buy you fireworks.

71
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,660
Didn't you just say you wanted some?

72
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,380
I searched several streets and didn't find any.

73
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,460
It wasn't easy to find.

74
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,760
Huan Er.

75
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,605
I’m sorry.

76
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:24,940
I'll make sure you can always find me in the future.

77
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,400
Stop crying.

78
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,390
Come on. I'll take you to set off fireworks.

79
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,390
Look, I bought sparklers for you.

80
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,380
Here. Take these.

81
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,270
Stop crying.

82
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,990
Cheer up.

83
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,640
Happy New Year.

84
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,350
Chen Huan Er.

85
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,400
 I don't know why I cried. 

86
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,710
What are you doing?

87
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,860
 Adolescence is complicated. 

88
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:00,740
 At least I didn't understand the tangled-up emotions back then. 

89
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:08,610
 All I knew was that Jing Xi Chi meant a lot to me. 

90
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,860
 As long as he was happy, I was happy. 

91
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,110
 If he was sad, I couldn't help but feel sad too. 

92
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,750
Chen Huan Er.

93
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,580
Everything... will be fine.

94
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,110
 I knew Jing Xi Chi was just forcing a smile, 

95
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,920
 but even if I couldn’t make things better, 

96
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:09,340
 I still wanted to stay by his side, to be there for him through the hardest time of his life. 

97
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,830
Let's light another one.

98
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,900
Happy New Year, Chen Huan Er!

99
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,620
Happy New Year, Jing Xi Chi!

100
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,550
   

101
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,090
Sun Han Yu, have you not washed your hair in a week?

102
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,990
Shut up. It's only been three days.

103
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,590
Only three days?

104
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,480
Stop being sarcastic. You think I don't want to wash it?

105
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,678
Guys have short hair, so you can wash it in five minutes.

106
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:50,680
It takes me an hour to wash and blow-dry it.

107
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,480
It's annoying.

108
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,229
 Even though senior year revision was getting intense, 

109
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:59,120
 Jing Xi Chi's condition was finally improving. 

110
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,620
 I felt a little upset when Jing Xi Chi's results surpassed mine. 

111
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,827
 I even made an excuse that he had short hair that was easier to wash, 

112
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:13,020
 so he had a lot more time to study. 

113
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,780
   

114
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,700
   

115
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,360
   

116
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,330
Chen Huan Er.

117
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,860
Chen Huan Er.

118
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,280
What are you doing? Have you become stupid from studying?

119
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm memorizing words.

120
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,380
Hurry up. We're going to be late for English tuition class.

121
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,160
We're skipping today. I'll take you to a different English class.

122
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,430
- Come on. 
 - Where are we going?

123
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,780
- Tell me where we're going first. 
 - We're learning English.

124
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,760
Learning English?

125
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,950
Is this what you mean by learning English?

126
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,360
Why can't we learn English by watching movies?

127
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,174
We're watching How to Train Your Dragon.

128
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:43,370
We can relax and practice our listening. It's like killing two birds with one stone.

129
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,070
If you want to watch a movie, just say so.

130
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,070
It's mainly about creating the right environment.

131
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,980
And what’s the most important part of learning English?

132
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,260
Immersion.

133
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,780
Stupid.

134
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,390
Stupid.

135
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,110
Why do you carry a small notebook everywhere like Du Man?

136
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,850
Give it back. You're hindering my studies.

137
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,720
Watch the movie. I'll ask questions after the movie.

138
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,540
Why are you looking at me?

139
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,950
I just realized that you look a lot like that thing.

140
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,310
Which one?

141
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,800
- That one. 
 - Do you mean the female warrior?

142
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,960
Yes. The dragon next to the female warrior.

143
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,360
The one that flies.

144
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,710
You're the one who looks like a dragon.

145
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,290
Bow down before me! Bow down!

146
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,740
Can you two stop talking?

147
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,380
 Li Tian? 

148
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,490
- Why are you here? 
 - Don't you have tuition classes?

149
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,540
How dare you ask me? Why are you here?

150
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,070
Are you on a date?

151
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,600
 We're learning English. 

152
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,660
What about you?

153
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,250
I'm here to learn English too.

154
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,110
But don't tell my parents.

155
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,640
Why are you pretending?

156
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,800
How does it feel to skip class?

157
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,740
Don't worry. We will never tell your parents.

158
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,940
We won't tell them.

159
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,680
- Don't worry. 
 - Could you three just be quiet?

160
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,610
Sorry.

161
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,340
Sorry.

162
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,490
Chen Huan Er.

163
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,090
Have you never eaten popcorn before or what?

164
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,250
Popcorn is my favorite.

165
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,940
I can't believe you.

166
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,870
Eat more.

167
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,570
 Time flew by, 

168
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,470
 and winter finally passed. 

169
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:23,300
 As the leaves turned green again, the shadow of Uncle Jing’s passing gradually faded. 

170
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,000
 Everyone's life returned to normal. 

171
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,340
 Our time was filled with study. 

172
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,780
 Moments of sadness came and went, like shooting stars. Quick and fleeting. 

173
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,050
 Every day was the same, memorizing textbooks, doing practice papers... 

174
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:52,190
 But in that repetition, there was also a strange sense of comfort. A feeling of being on track. 

175
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:26,140
   

176
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,760
A. No, pick B.

177
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,670
B isn't right either. Pick C.

178
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,780
No. Pick D.

179
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,920
How come all this is right?

180
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,460
Pick A, B, C, and D.

181
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,560
This is a multiple-choice question.

182
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,520
Li Tian, have you become stupid from studying too much?

183
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,340
Take a break.

184
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,980
Continue studying when you're clear-headed.

185
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,640
You can't even understand the questions. How can you study?

186
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,500
 Many people said they would never want to return to senior year, 

187
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,820
 but I miss the night study session when the power was out. 

188
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,810
Is there a power outage?

189
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,640
Calm down.

190
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,290
It must be a power outage.

191
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,340
Students, stop what you're doing.

192
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,850
I have a few words to tell you.

193
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,920
Give me a few minutes.

194
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,890
And give yourselves a few minutes.

195
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,500
Okay?

196
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,130
Students of Senior Three Class 5.

197
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,330
Today is your final day sitting in this classroom before the big exam.

198
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,440
I should have emphasized the key exam points more

199
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,610
or reminded you about what to prepare before the exam.

200
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:08,460
But I suddenly thought that I should talk about something more important than key exam points.

201
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,020
I've taken care of you for three years.

202
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,100
During these three years, I forced you

203
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,960
to answer countless exam papers and filled your minds with countless standard answers.

204
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,150
But what I really want to say is that there's no standard answer in life.

205
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,680
You can memorize the answers, but it's better not to copy someone else's path.

206
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:44,740
An exam may affect your life, but it can't determine your life.

207
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:54,320
No matter what the result is, you must try your best to live your own life without regrets.

208
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,300
Have you kept that in mind?

209
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,500
 During the last lesson of high school life, 

210
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,260
 I was very grateful to Mr. Xu for telling us that. 

211
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,820
 But even more, I was grateful for that unexpected blackout... 

212
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:15,000
 because it gave us a chance to let go of our worries and just be our true selves in the dark. 

213
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,540
♫  White moon  ♫

214
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,980
♫  Next to the candle holder  ♫

215
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,740
♫  Does the girl who loves to smile  ♫

216
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,340
♫  Still remember that night  ♫

217
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,180
♫  When the stars were as bright as her eyes?  ♫

218
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,660
♫  What does she expect?  ♫

219
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,880
♫  What kind of future does she imagine?  ♫

220
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,705
♫  How colorful and magnificent is the rainbow  ♫

221
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:54,420
♫  In her dream?  ♫

222
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,460
♫  Don't cry, my friend  ♫

223
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,060
♫  Friends get separated sometimes  ♫

224
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,060
♫  Loneliness is the norm in life  ♫

225
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,500
♫  I didn't understand until I grew up  ♫

226
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,420
♫  Don't cry, my friend  ♫

227
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,260
♫  I'm used to your company  ♫

228
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,020
♫  Parting shouldn't be sorrowful  ♫

229
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,316
♫  When we meet again  ♫

230
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:32,860
♫  Remember to be happy  ♫

231
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:48,040
   

232
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,940
   

233
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,980
   

234
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:50,740
   

235
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,350
 Huan Er, Xi Chi is here to see you. Get up! 

236
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,150
Coming.

237
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,820
What are you doing? Can't you let me sleep a little longer?

238
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,670
It's noon, and you're still sleeping?

239
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm telling you, Cong and I have already put away those old books.

240
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,320
We're planning to sell them and earn some money for a good meal.

241
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm almost done putting them away too.

242
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,870
These are workbooks. Those are books and papers.

243
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,470
Sell them all.

244
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,557
You kept those from primary school and middle school?

245
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:51,260
You didn't look like the nostalgic type.

246
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:54,880
This is precious to me. Don't touch it.

247
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,860
It's precious? I'd like to see what's so precious about it.

248
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,230
Jing Xi Chi, give it back to me.

249
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,780
Isn't it just an English book?

250
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,390
What's this?

251
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,430
Is this you?

252
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,990
Yeah.

253
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,540
I didn't know you were so cute when you were little.

254
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,244
What do you mean by that? Am I not cute now?

255
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:15,800
You're a weirdo now.

256
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,837
You're the weirdest in the whole compound.

257
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:20,000
Besides me and Cong, no one dares to sit next to you.

258
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,735
Who are you calling a weirdo? Give it back.

259
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:24,260
I used to be popular. All right?

260
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,860
You don't behave like a girl at all. Who will like you?

261
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,710
See this little boy in the photo?

262
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,260
Let me introduce you formally.

263
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,870
He's my Sishui childhood friend.

264
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,980
His name is Yu.

265
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,060
I get along best with him in all of Sishui.

266
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,100
He was so good-looking when he was a kid.

267
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,500
Fair-skinned, clean, and with big eyes.

268
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,870
And he was particularly popular.

269
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,490
We used to call him "Sishui's Heartthrob."

270
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,470
Those who were good-looking as kids usually grow up to be ugly, okay?

271
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,630
Why do you sound a bit jealous?

272
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,530
I'm not jealous.

273
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,660
Besides, no matter how close you were, you haven't been in touch for years, right?

274
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,020
Who said we haven't been in touch?

275
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,470
We just got in touch yesterday. He's visiting today.

276
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,540
He's visiting you today?

277
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,150
- Later. 
 - Later?

278
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,470
- Why didn't you tell me just now? 
 - You didn't ask.

279
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,100
 Huan Er! 

280
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,840
 Yu is downstairs. Go meet him. 

281
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,160
Wait.

282
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,820
Yu, right?

283
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,670
I'll go meet him first.

284
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,470
What, Yu?

285
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,640
Are you Sishui's Heartthrob?

286
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,870
I'm Jing Xi Chi.

287
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,200
I'm Chen Huan Er's neighbor and best friend.

288
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,430
I'm probably older than you.

289
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,810
You can call me Brother Chi.

290
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,680
When it comes to brotherhood among men, it's not about age but about ability.

291
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,990
Yu.

292
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,327
You're here. Come on. We've waited for you for a long time.

293
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:22,910
Let's go. This way.

294
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,860
 I'm telling you, my parents kept talking about you. 

295
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,950
Yu, you must be tired from your journey here.

296
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,880
I'm all right.

297
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,340
Do as I say. You hear me?

298
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,200
What are you up to?

299
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
How cute. Fair and chubby.

300
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,163
- You're more handsome. 
 - Be gentle.

301
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:57,200
Grown up and looking even better.

302
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,320
So, how'd your exams go?

303
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,457
I did all right. I performed as usual.

304
00:29:01,457 --> 00:29:03,020
You'll be okay then. Here.

305
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,820
Have a strawberry.

306
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,100
No.

307
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,370
Eat it.

308
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,470
Chen Huan Er.

309
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,160
- How obedient. 
 - Can you be a little more reserved?

310
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,990
What's wrong? We slept in the same bed when we were little.

311
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,500
Right? Yu.

312
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,740
Right?

313
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,680
Yes, you're right.

314
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,470
Chen Huan Er.

315
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,150
You're seriously a weirdo.

316
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,810
Here, Yu. Have another one.

317
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,278
I can't take it anymore. I need to go to the bathroom first.

318
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:34,670
It's over there. Hurry.

319
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,160
Such a good boy...

320
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,568
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

321
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,800
- What am I doing on purpose? 
 - Why are you so pretentious today?

322
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,630
This is how I act around him. If you don't like it, don't watch.

323
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,190
Food's ready.

324
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,500
Xi Chi.

325
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,140
Uncle Chen isn't here. We're only having a simple meal at home.

326
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,230
- Sure, Aunt Li Na. 
 - Where's Yu?

327
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,340
In the bathroom.

328
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,540
Yu, dinner's ready!

329
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Hurry. Here, eat.

330
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,230
Yu. Here.

331
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,670
Sit here.

332
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,020
- Sit. 
 - Here, Yu.

333
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,960
Sit with me. Here, sit beside me.

334
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,910
Mom's cooking smells so good.

335
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,570
You must eat a lot, Yu.

336
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,500
Yu, it's your first time here since we moved.

337
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
It's nice here, right?

338
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,580
I looked around just now.

339
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,320
- The environment here is good. 
 - Right?

340
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,300
- You've lost weight. Eat more. 
 - Sure.

341
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,450
Aunt Li Na, you don't have to help me with the food.

342
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,320
I'm familiar with this place. I come here often.

343
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,180
I can do it myself.

344
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,780
Here, Yu. Eat more.

345
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,100
Isn't this your favorite meat?

346
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,110
Eat more.

347
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,540
Yu.

348
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,220
Why not stay a few more days?

349
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,060
Spend more time with Huan Er.

350
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,640
Sure.

351
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,190
Aunt Li Na.

352
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,920
Let Yu stay at my place tonight.

353
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,020
Why should Yu stay at your place?

354
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,780
I just think Yu's a guy.

355
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,100
Surely it would be somewhat inconvenient for him to stay the night.

356
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,780
Wait. Yu, do you think it's inconvenient?

357
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,390
Why would it be inconvenient, Auntie?

358
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:16,040
Yeah. What's inconvenient about Yu staying at his aunt's and cousin's house?

359
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,640
You're funny.

360
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,540
What did you call Aunt Li Na?

361
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,060
Auntie Li Na.

362
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,260
- So Chen Huan Er is your... 
 - Cousin.

363
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,670
Yeah.

364
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Nothing, Aunt Li Na. I... Well...

365
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,670
The food looks good. No, well... the sun is nice.

366
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,260
No, I got to go. I got to go, Aunt Li Na.

367
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,670
Well...

368
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,260
What's up with him?

369
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,250
Nothing.

370
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,020
Here. You did good. Have a prawn.

371
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,480
Here.

372
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,813
Why are you so strange today?

373
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,670
What's wrong with me?

374
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,578
You're overly enthusiastic.

375
00:31:58,578 --> 00:31:59,670
Did you take the wrong pill?

376
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,860
Hey! Don't ask so much. Eat.

377
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,950
Don't hit him.

378
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,430
I didn't, Mom. It was just a pat.

379
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,810
Eat.

380
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,780
Why did you call me here?

381
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,990
Sit.

382
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,060
Why are you looking at me?

383
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,580
Has Sishui's Heartthrob left?

384
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,800
Yeah. He left after staying for two days.

385
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,570
Sishui's Heartthrob?

386
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,580
She said he was her childhood friend and her best friend, but he's actually her cousin.

387
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,751
Chen Huan Er, don't you think you're silly? Do you think it's funny to trick me?

388
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,150
Didn't you say it first?

389
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,620
You said I don't behave like a girl, and that nobody will like me.

390
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,950
Cong, in what way do I not behave like a girl?

391
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,150
How am I not worthy of being liked?

392
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,970
You're... worthy.

393
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,060
Ignore him.

394
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,300
He's just blind.

395
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,060
Look, Cong said it himself.

396
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,430
Song Cong.

397
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,340
I'm upset that you said that.

398
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,910
I was even planning to help you get rich.

399
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,500
Get rich?

400
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,300
How?

401
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,910
Didn't I tell you a few days ago

402
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,840
that I was going to sell all our school's supplementary teaching materials?

403
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,540
But then I thought, no.

404
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,100
Think about it. Cong's notes are priceless.

405
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,740
If we sell them by weight, we'll lose a lot of money.

406
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,300
Right?

407
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,390
You have a point.

408
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,400
- So? 
 - So...

409
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,680
I'm going to put them up for sale on a website and sell them at a marked price.

410
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,860
So you mean you want to register as a seller online?

411
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,560
Chen Huan Er, can you broaden your perspective a little?

412
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,991
- What's wrong with me? 
 - He just wants to set up

413
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,710
a second-hand book trading website.

414
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,230
Yes.

415
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,080
This is a good idea.

416
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,800
Have you thought of a name for your website?

417
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,460
It's so troublesome to think of a name.

418
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,200
Does it matter what it's called?

419
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,540
Lying on my back in bed,

420
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,790
gazing at the roof beams while writing a book.

421
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,310
I got it.

422
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,680
We'll call it...

423
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,070
Yangwu. 
  (T/N: gazing at the roof) 

424
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,910
Yangwu?

425
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,520
What do you think?

426
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,980
It sounds all right.

427
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,350
- Not bad, right? 
 - Not bad.

428
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,390
Not bad, right?

429
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,700
No one objects, right?

430
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,310
Okay. Meeting adjourned.

431
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,850
Go home.

432
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,060
Bye.

433
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,910
Let's go, Cong.

434
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,450
Sleep early. Good night.

435
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,560
Jing Xi Chi sent me away as soon as he called me over.

436
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,580
Cong, I'm leaving now.

437
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,180
Huan Er.

438
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,516
What's the matter?

439
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,310
Nothing.

440
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,070
- See you tomorrow then. 
 - Okay.

441
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,000
Thank you.

442
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,360
- Xin Yan. 
 - Help me take two.

443
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,760
Okay.

444
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,140
Is that all?

445
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,460
Let's go.

446
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,550
Milk tea again.

447
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,470
Everyone.

448
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,620
Drink this.

449
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,520
Everyone, let's discuss where to go later.

450
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,380
What's fun?

451
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,600
Why are you so excited?

452
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
My mom won't control me anymore. I can go out and have fun freely.

453
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,520
How could I not be excited?

454
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,870
Look at this poor kid...

455
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,220
How about we watch a movie?

456
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,490
I heard there's a good romance movie recently.

457
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,350
Who wants to watch romance movies?

458
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,950
I remember there's an action movie that's not bad. Do you want to watch it?

459
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,380
You can watch it.

460
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,380
The two of us will watch the romance movie.

461
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,300
If you ask me, let's go to an internet cafe.

462
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,700
You two can also watch movies in the internet cafe.

463
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,270
The three of us can play games, have some instant noodles, and add a sausage.

464
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,400
Isn't that great?

465
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,340
All you know is how to play online games.

466
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,950
Didn't we agree on group activities?

467
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,450
Group!

468
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,320
How annoying...

469
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,928
Why can't we figure out what to do after graduation?

470
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,060
Yeah.

471
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,000
Suddenly being able to have fun feels a bit uncomfortable.

472
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,290
How about we go sing?

473
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,890
I still think I'm okay with going to an internet cafe.

474
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,180
- Go to hell. 
 - What's wrong?

475
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,080
All right. You boys can figure it out.

476
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,810
Huan Er, there are photo booths over there.

477
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,080
Shall we take some photos?

478
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,725
Sure.

479
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:27,620
We should take a photo after graduation.

480
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,950
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

481
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,600
You can surf the internet yourself.

482
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,980
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

483
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,040
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

484
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,490
Let's surf the internet. Go.

485
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:44,935
You can go by yourself.

486
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,870
Ditching your friends for your crush?

487
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,980
   

488
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,850
Aren't the three of us a bit out of place here?

489
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,920
Looks pretty good, right?

490
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,260
- Ladies, are you two done? 
 - Hurry up.

491
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,140
Don't rush us. We'll be done soon.

492
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,690
Last one.

493
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,200
This one looks good.

494
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,900
Take a photo too. You're here anyway.

495
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,160
- Come on. 
 - No.

496
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,227
I'm not taking any photos either.

497
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,960
Hurry up. I still want to go to the internet cafe.

498
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,080
Then you two take a photo.

499
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,142
Take a photo.

500
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:47,100
- We've graduated. Take a photo. 
 - No, I don't want to.

501
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,370
Here, hurry up.

502
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,920
- No. 
 - We're taking the photo without you.

503
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,950
I'll take one then.

504
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,840
Just one photo.

505
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,270
Wait, Jing Xi Chi.

506
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,790
Hold this for me.

507
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,870
Brother, I'm only helping you this one time.

508
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,010
Let's go.

509
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,520
  ­ 

510
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,820
Wait. I'm coming too.

511
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,910
  ­ 

512
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,580
Looks good.

513
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,385
The camera's here.

514
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:26,790
   

515
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,040
Are you out of your mind?

516
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,350
C, what's wrong?

517
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,400
Aren't you pleased?

518
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,000
Don't touch me.

519
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,360
Have you gone stupid from studying?

520
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,120
Find a book to read.

521
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,390
Have you two been here before?

522
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,430
It was during first year.

523
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,490
Come here. I'll take you to the place where I often take photos.

524
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,990
Hurry up.

525
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,320
♫  Seeing yesterday's clear sky frozen in an old photograph  ♫

526
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:14,180
♫  Young love is a postcard that was never sent  ♫

527
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,660
♫  Unfinished words folded into longing  ♫

528
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:26,340
♫  Scattered over the light-years we've walked together  ♫

529
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,480
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

530
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,440
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

531
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,740
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

532
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,065
 Losers! 

533
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,760
 Happy Birthday! 

534
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,780
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

535
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,350
 Don't ever forget me. 

536
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,000
 I will never forget you. 

537
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,920
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

538
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,920
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

539
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,980
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

540
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,950
Excuse me.

541
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,330
Give me two taro cakes.

542
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,290
All right.

543
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,990
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫

544
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,000
Give me one instead.

545
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,450
You guys have graduated, right?

546
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,382
You haven't been here in a long time.

547
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,210
The study pressure in senior year must be tough.

548
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,650
Yes, it is.

549
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:35,790
The girl who used to come with you hasn't been here in a long time either.

550
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,250
Here. Take it.

551
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,140
Be careful. It's hot.

552
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,140
 This taro cake tastes better when shared. 

553
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,480
 That's not a problem. We'll come here often. 

554
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,480
 - Huan Er. 
 - Qi Qi. 

555
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,390
 Huan Er. 

556
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:21,490
 I hope Qi Qi and Huan Er can be friends forever. 

557
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:26,830
 You and I are just from different worlds. 

558
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,120
 You don't want to be friends with me anymore? 

559
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,700
Qi Qi.

560
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:57,960


561
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,400
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

562
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,411
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

563
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:16,181
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

564
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:22,811
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

565
00:44:22,811 --> 00:44:29,101
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

566
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:36,911
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

567
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:43,741
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

568
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:50,521
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

569
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:57,221
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

570
00:44:57,221 --> 00:45:01,081
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

571
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:06,201
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

572
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:10,921
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

573
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:14,481
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

574
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:19,851
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

575
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:24,741
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

576
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:28,541
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

577
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:33,581
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

578
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:37,171
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

579
00:45:38,181 --> 00:45:41,811
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

580
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:45,221
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

581
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:51,401
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

582
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:56,601
♫  At the right time  ♫
