2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,530
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,280
   
   

17
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,340
We're here.

18
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,520
Go home first. I'll make sure you get in.

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,450
I want to see you go up first.

20
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,780
You go first. I'll watch you.

21
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,720
- You go upstairs first. 
 - You first.

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,890
Hurry up.

23
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,520
- Hurry up. 
 - Give me a hug then.

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,260
Hug me.

25
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,370
Just let me hold you a little longer.

26
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,270
Aunt Lin.

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,710
You've been training well, Jing Xi Chi.

28
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,110
Compete with me some other day.

29
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,940
You're back.

30
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:36,808
- Did you come back together? 
 - Yeah.

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,430
Mom, why are you here?

32
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,660
I just went to Aunt Hao's place.

33
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:48,340
Aunt Hao's place...

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,840
Aunt, I'll head home now.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,510
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

36
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,475
Let's go, Mom.

37
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,310
- Men should be responsible. 
 - What?

38
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,430
I already figured it out.

39
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,820
Back in high school, you were already circling around Huan Er.

40
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,850
- Did I? 
 - You didn't?

41
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,300
I think I did.

42
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,020
Since you're together now, be good to Huan Er. Got it?

43
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,540
You've really grown up.

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,475
I'm going to bed.

45
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:57,530
 If I told you that I turned into someone I don't even like... 

46
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,250
 would you still want to be with me? 

47
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,610
Hello? Mom.

48
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,200
I've decided to study abroad.

49
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,860
 Can we talk after your exam? 

50
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,772
Why isn't your mom home today?

51
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,880
She had to go to the hospital.

52
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,440
Did your parents ask you anything when you left?

53
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,880
They went out too.

54
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,070
Speaking of, I think they love each other more than before after my mom got sick.

55
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,600
Why aren't they home when we came to visit for the holidays?

56
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,980
But I can understand your dad.

57
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,980
Aunt Li Na just recovered from a serious illness.

58
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,100
Your dad must be cherishing his time with her.

59
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,180
Let's not disturb their alone time.

60
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,320
Got it.

61
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm getting old now.

62
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,270
I forgot to take my phone when I went out.

63
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,780
Huan Er didn't close the window.

64
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,170
Well, I wish we could be like them when we're old.

65
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,500
Of course.

66
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,510
Then... will you remember the first time we held hands,

67
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,440
our first kiss, and the first time you confessed?

68
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,660
Not necessarily.

69
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,586
Jing Xi Chi, what do you mean?

70
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:37,120
If you don't remember now, later...

71
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,420
Chen Huan Er, what are you doing?

72
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,730
Dad!

73
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,860
Explain!

74
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,950
When did this start?

75
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,920
- A few days ago. 
 - I wasn't asking you.

76
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,830
I was asking him. When did this start?

77
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,470
All right, you're scaring them.

78
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,270
Tell me.

79
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,540
Aunt Li Na.

80
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,200
Uncle Chen.

81
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,730
Huan Er and I started dating officially two days ago.

82
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,470
Come on, Jing Xi Chi.

83
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,431
I asked you to take care of her.

84
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:16,330
You two... Is this how you take care of her?

85
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,340
- Calm down. 
 - Dad.

86
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,830
Sorry, Uncle Chen.

87
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,170
I didn't say anything before because I didn't know how to bring it up.

88
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,910
I really like Huan Er.

89
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,420
I promise to take good care of her.

90
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,200
Don't feed me that crap.

91
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,053
I'm telling you. I've gone through this before.

92
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:39,030
When you're young, who doesn't say one thing and do another while dating?

93
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,510
Why didn't you tell me in person?

94
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,808
Why hide it?

95
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:43,660
You're just a little liar. You know that?

96
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,630
- Uncle Chen, please listen— 
 - Don't explain to me.

97
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,870
Why explain to me? I don't want to hear it.

98
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,110
Go on home. I'll handle my dad.

99
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,060
Just go for now. It's all right.

100
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,780
Uncle Chen.

101
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,300
I'll go home now.

102
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,150
I'll come see you once you've cooled off.

103
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,475
What? Don't come to me. I'll deal with your mom.

104
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:02,420
- How dare you come to me? 
 - What the hell are you doing?

105
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,630
Xi Chi is a good kid.

106
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,750
Oh please. What's so great about him? He's just a little liar.

107
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,390
Enough.

108
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,150
Why are you so agitated?

109
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,080
Dad!

110
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,840
Why are you so angry?

111
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,390
I just have a boyfriend.

112
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,275
I didn't dare to tell you because I was afraid you'd behave like this.

113
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,264
What? Are you saying that I'm wrong?

114
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,831
- He stole you! How could I not be angry? 
 - He didn't steal me!

115
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:23,630
What do you mean he didn't steal you?

116
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,230
How did he steal your daughter?

117
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,986
Xi Chi is a good kid.

118
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:30,200
When I was hospitalized some time ago, he's been helping out. Didn't you see him?

119
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,700
It's all fake. I'm telling you.

120
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,180
- How come it's fake? 
 - You know what?

121
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,342
- What? 
 - This is what you call inviting trouble in.

122
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,630
- What are you saying? 
 - It's The Farmer and the Snake!

123
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,870
- Nonsense. 
 - Dad!

124
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,160
- What's wrong? 
 - What are you saying?

125
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,875
- You tell me! 
 - I can't talk to you!

126
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,837
Who said you can go? I haven't finished talking.

127
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:46,250
What are you doing?

128
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,350
Who said his daughter is grown up, and wants her to live her own life?

129
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,460
Have you forgotten?

130
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,742
I didn't forget, but I won't allow her to have a boyfriend.

131
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,880
Chen Lei.

132
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,720
My daughter has been sensible and obedient since she was little.

133
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,630
Has she ever made you worry?

134
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,208
She's just dating while in college.

135
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,630
And you yelled at her and lectured her in front of others.

136
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,940
Have you thought about her feelings?

137
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,920
How annoying!

138
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,390
It's my first time being a father.

139
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,070
Have any of you considered how I feel?

140
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,630
Dad.

141
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,820
Chen Lei, why are you here so early?

142
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,800
Is Xi Chi at home?

143
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,060
You see, I heard about what happened yesterday.

144
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,270
I lectured him. I don't get it.

145
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,110
Why keep it a secret if you're in a relationship?

146
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,300
Well, Yi Fan. I have something to talk to Xi Chi.

147
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,280
It's okay, Yi Fan.

148
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,180
Uncle Chen.

149
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,510
The way I spoke to you last night was a little rude.

150
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,180
I want to apologize.

151
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,071
Have a seat, let's talk.

152
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,650
 Do you know... 

153
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:06,040
 that Huan Er was like a poor kitten when she was born? 

154
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,580
At that time, I didn't know how to hold her.

155
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,030
Later, Huan Er was in poor health.

156
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,560
Her mom and I were so worried.

157
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,720
We kept accompanying her.

158
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,410
At that time, we both thought that as long as Huan Er could live well,

159
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,580
 nothing else mattered. 

160
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:36,150
That's why Huan Er and Aunt Li Na...

161
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,460
are the two most important women in my life.

162
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,290
But now?

163
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,300
To put it metaphorically…

164
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,560
You're going to take one of them away from me.

165
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,450
And honestly, that's hard for me to accept.

166
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,930
You may not understand.

167
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,853
Maybe you'll understand when you become a father.

168
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,090
Uncle Chen.

169
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,350
I'm serious about Huan Er.

170
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,920
I swear, I'll never let her down.

171
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,700
It's not that I'm dissatisfied with you.

172
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,560
It's just that I have my own concerns because I've been through this before.

173
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,910
Many promises made by young people may not necessarily be fulfilled.

174
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:43,030
Very few people end up marrying their first love.

175
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,110
But still... you two are already at this point.

176
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,350
If I tried to stop you now, I'd just seem selfish.

177
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,940
So I'm here today to make a few things clear to you.

178
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,660
Go ahead.

179
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,560
First,

180
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,660
if you two are going to be together, then you have my blessing.

181
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,650
But remember to be nice to Huan Er.

182
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,870
Don't ever hurt her.

183
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,080
Second, If things don't work out between you,

184
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,900
I hope you can still part on good terms, and stay friends.

185
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,708
After all, you two grew up together.

186
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,460
It's not easy to be friends for so many years.

187
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,390
Her mom and I can't be with her forever.

188
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,993
If one day we're no longer around, and Huan Er encounters difficulties,

189
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:48,870
I hope she has a friend

190
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,070
who knows her well to help her.

191
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,610
Can you promise me that?

192
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,900
Uncle Chen.

193
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,590
I want to be upfront with you, too.

194
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,920
I will take good care of Chen Huan Er.

195
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,000
 She's not just important to you, 

196
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,130
but also the most important person to me.

197
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,850
Okay.

198
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,500
In that case, we have a deal.

199
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,120
- Yi Fan. 
 - Well...

200
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,550
- Don't you want to sit for a while? 
 - No, I'm leaving.

201
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:17,590
Dad...

202
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,490
You want to go abroad?

203
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,057
I'm thinking about it.

204
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:52,390
Since I want to study creative writing,

205
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,700
the earlier I start learning English, the better.

206
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,840
But I haven't made any final decisions yet.

207
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,789
Song Cong.

208
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:05,070
If I go abroad, will you support me?

209
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,500
Studying abroad would definitely help with your writing.

210
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,520
Of course I support you.

211
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,010
Will you consider going abroad?

212
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,420
I have to study for eight years.

213
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,640
At least for now, I'm not planning on it.

214
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,460
What about eight years later?

215
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
Eight years later?

216
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,220
I haven't thought about things so far into the future.

217
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,920
I think I need to focus on what I can learn right now.

218
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,590
Are you...

219
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,770
willing to change the trajectory of your life for me?

220
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,800
I...

221
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,790
I'm kidding.

222
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,920
Did you know that my mom made malicious assumptions about you,

223
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,397
saying you'd try to hold me back.

224
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,980
I won't stop you.

225
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,630
Don't worry.

226
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,520
I think... you should stick to your dream.

227
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,450
Honestly,

228
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,180
part of me actually wished you would try to stop me.

229
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:30,020
Then at least I'd know you want to be in my future.

230
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,700
Song Cong.

231
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,690
Why don't we... break up?

232
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,530
Actually, I've known for a long time that we're not from the same world.

233
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,220
We love freedom, but what we want from it is different.

234
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,070
All these years,

235
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,170
I changed a lot for us to be together.

236
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,830
I even became less and less like myself.

237
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,650
Qi Qi.

238
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,140
Actually, you were already incredible.

239
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,942
You never needed to change for me.

240
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,255
No.

241
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:41,120
You don't understand.

242
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,700
Back in high school, you shone so brightly.

243
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,500
So brightly, it made me feel like I didn't deserve you.

244
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,010
All I could do was stand behind you and watch your back.

245
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,010
All this time, I've been chasing after you.

246
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,120
I'm tired.

247
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,140
I understand what you're saying.

248
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,890
Because...

249
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,899
right now, I'm chasing after you, too.

250
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,760
In your world,

251
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:45,240
I might just be an ordinary university student.

252
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,080
Compared with your imaginative and exciting life,

253
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,410
my life is plain.

254
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,730
Maybe our lives were meant to be two lines that only cross once,

255
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,490
meeting at one fixed moment in time.

256
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,320
Can we hug?

257
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,630
 Mom. 

258
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:33,560
 All these years, you've used love as a reason to pressure me into doing what you want. 

259
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,320
 But I was unhappy and distressed. 

260
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,420
 Then, I met a boy. 

261
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,350
 and I realized I only knew how to love him in the same way you loved me. 

262
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,260
 I now realize I gradually became another you. 

263
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,310
 Mom. 

264
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,790
 Do you think this is the result you wanted? 

265
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,020
 Are you happy? 

266
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,980
♫  Don't go yet  ♫

267
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,960
♫  Take your scarf with you  ♫

268
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,060
♫  Don't work too late  ♫

269
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,070
♫  I left a light on  ♫

270
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,700
 Qi Qi. 

271
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:22,360
 Be my girlfriend. 

272
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,450
 Your heart is beating fast. 

273
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:38,360
 Do you also like me? 

274
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,260
 Do you know why I just told you what's on my mind? 

275
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,910
 Why? 

276
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,830
 Because I like you. 

277
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,980
♫  Oh, love, I don't understand  ♫

278
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,740
 Let's hug too. 

279
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,260
 After all, we're going to separate. 

280
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,020
 Hello. I'm Qi Qi. Huan Er is my desk mate. 

281
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,500
 Hello. 

282
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,660
♫  All right  ♫

283
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,600
♫  Let's not meet again  ♫

284
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:19,300
♫  I want you to remember me  ♫

285
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,390
 Our university life just kept going on. 

286
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,265
Are you planning to apply for a postgraduate?

287
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:42,740
I need to prepare early.

288
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,500
Is it stressful?

289
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,110
It's definitely stressful.

290
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,500
But I'll just keep calm.

291
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,700
Even if I don't pass, I can always try again.

292
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,840
You'll be fine.

293
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,150
Huan Er.

294
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm going to Huan Dao Technology tomorrow.

295
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,420
I talked to them about a new collaboration model.

296
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,880
They'd basically invest in me,

297
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,020
and I'd officially join the team. They'd help me expand the workforce.

298
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,500
Isn't that good?

299
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,308
It's indeed good. It's just that...

300
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:16,660
Right now, it's just me and Zhou Ye handling everything.

301
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:22,970
I'm just worried that if things get busy, I won't have much time for you.

302
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,010
No way.

303
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,740
When did you become so clingy?

304
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,830
I've always been kind of clingy, actually.

305
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,560
Really?

306
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,960
- I'll get water. 
 - Wait.

307
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,760
I'll go. Sit.

308
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,630
Phone.

309
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,397
Why did you take your phone?

310
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:45,275
- Don't bother. 
 - Are you hiding something from me?

311
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,080
Why isn't he here yet?

312
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,630
Xi Chi.

313
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,420
Thanks.

314
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,186
- What's wrong? 
 - The money?

315
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:06,360
I don't have any money now.

316
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,120
- I'll pay you back at the dorm. 
 - No.

317
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,660
The price will go up when you get back.

318
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,830
How much?

319
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,520
200.

320
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,780
Zhou Ye, do you have any heart?

321
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,158
Call me if you need me for something like this again.

322
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,730
Here. Water, and this.

323
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:32,010
Did you buy this for me?

324
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,870
Of course.

325
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,297
Why is it brown sugar ginger tea?

326
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:42,142
What do you think?

327
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,630
How do you know it's today?

328
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,360
How could I not know?

329
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,770
Aunt Li Na has always reminded you not to drink cold drinks during your period.

330
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,970
Even I remember, but you don't.

331
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,010
I wondered how my mom knew my every move.

332
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,320
So it was you all along. You sneaky spy.

333
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,040
As long as it's good for your health, I can be a spy.

334
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,220
- Drink it while it's hot. 
 - No.

335
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,220
It tastes like ginger. I don't want to drink it. I don't like it.

336
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,550
- Hurry. 
 - You...

337
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,520
Done.

338
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,350
No.

339
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,500
Library.

340
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,630
It's a library.

341
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,040
Finish this.

342
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,110
I'm tired.

343
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,740
Chen Huan Er, don't be lazy.

344
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,980
I'm tired.

345
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,350
Lend me your shoulder.

346
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,231
You get five minutes. That's it.

347
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,660
   

348
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,830
- Hello? Mom. 
  - Cong. 

349
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,700
 I had your dad send you 500 more yuan for this month's expenses. 

350
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,390
 Don't just stay in your dorm and study all weekend. 

351
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,830
Take Qi Qi out for a meal or something.

352
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,640
 No need, Mom. I don't spend that much. 

353
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,830
You don't need to transfer so much to me in the future.

354
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,260
 It's not for you. 

355
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,760
 It's to let you spend on Qi Qi. 

356
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,250
We actually broke up a while ago.

357
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,310
What happened?

358
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,310
Why did you break up?

359
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,700
Mom, my roommate is back.

360
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,080
I'll talk to you later.

361
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,876
How did your internship interview go?

362
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,075
I switched majors halfway through.

363
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,520
It's not that easy to find a job.

364
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,560
Have you decided to switch from clinical to pharmaceuticals?

365
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,260
I've thought it through.

366
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,770
Clinical medicine takes too much time.

367
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,180
In one year, all the four-year students will be able to work and earn money.

368
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,310
Yet we still have to go to class.

369
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,475
Even if I can work in a good hospital, the salary won't be high.

370
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:30,550
The effort just doesn't match the reward.

371
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,720
Besides, I come from an average family.

372
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,730
I feel guilty asking my parents for money in my twenties.

373
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,140
Could you please share the WeChat of the group admin for the part-time job group

374
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,390
you mentioned last time?

375
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,180
Sure.

376
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,046
- I've sent it. 
 - Okay.

377
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,770
- Jing. 
 - Mr. Jiang.

378
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,460
- You're here. 
 - Long time no see.

379
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,510
Welcome.

380
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,140
This is Zhou Ye from my team.

381
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,964
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Zhou Ye.

382
00:31:12,964 --> 00:31:15,197
- I'm Jiang Sen. 
 - Hello, Mr. Jiang.

383
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,150
We can finally cooperate officially.

384
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,564
We're looking forward to working with Huan Dao too.

385
00:31:19,564 --> 00:31:21,310
Me too.

386
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,260
Mr. Jiang.

387
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
You're here.

388
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,960
- Fu Ying. 
 - Fu Ying, do you work here?

389
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,020
We have Ms. Fu to thank for introducing us.

390
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,840
Jing, your project is good. And Mr. Jiang has a keen eye for talent.

391
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,629
I just made the introduction.

392
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:38,631
- Thank you, Fu Ying. 
 - Thank you.

393
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:39,700
All right, don't mention it.

394
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,600
Fu Ying, show them around.

395
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,650
- I have a meeting to attend. I'll go to work. 
 - Okay.

396
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,600
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

397
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,611
Thank you, Fu Ying.

398
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:49,940
Fu Ying, are you free someday?

399
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,220
We'll treat you to a meal.

400
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,080
I'd love to, but I have a business trip tomorrow.

401
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,560
How about we do it tonight?

402
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,971
We can do it tonight.

403
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:00,886
But my girlfriend's coming to see me. Do you mind if she joins us?

404
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,480
The more, the merrier. I don't mind.

405
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,880
I'll go upstairs and deliver a document first. Sit here and wait for me.

406
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,360
Sure.

407
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,078
- Jing Xi Chi, have you lost your mind? 
 - What's wrong?

408
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:14,350
You're taking your rumored girlfriend to dinner with your current girlfriend.

409
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,550
- Huan Er will be jealous! 
 - What rumored girlfriend?

410
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,790
Hui Xin told me everything.

411
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,630
You and Fu Ying were photographed in the library.

412
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,630
- It's already all over the place. I know! 
 - What is this all about?

413
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,630
Fu Ying and I had nothing going on. We're innocent.

414
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,600
Besides, Huan Er isn't like that. She won't believe it.

415
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,697
It doesn't matter. You should avoid suspicion in such matters.

416
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:34,200
Rumors spread like wildfire. Do you understand?

417
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,070
You have too little experience in dating.

418
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,142
Girls are usually pretty sensitive about this stuff.

419
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,840
Is it that serious?

420
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,350
If you don't believe what I say, you can witness it yourself tonight.

421
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,040
I... I'm telling you.

422
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,604
I'm not joining this dinner. I have something to do.

423
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:50,520
Are you my buddy? Why are you not coming?

424
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,350
- I... 
 - Let's go. I'll show you around.

425
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,497
- Okay. 
 - Come on. This way.

426
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,550
Think it over.

427
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,708
What do you have to do?

428
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,608
I'm not going no matter what.

429
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,680
Sorry. Am I late?

430
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,500
Huan Er, right? See what's there to eat.

431
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
I'm okay with anything.

432
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,840
- I'll order then. 
 - Okay.

433
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,260
Are you tired?

434
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,942
- A little. 
 - Here. Drink some water.

435
00:33:15,942 --> 00:33:16,980
We'll order these first.

436
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,120
- Thank you. 
 - Drink some.

437
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,220
How was it? It's a long way here, right?

438
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,160
Indeed. It takes about an hour and a half by bus.

439
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,040
Yes. Huan Dao Technology is a bit far from our school.

440
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,200
Have you considered renting a place?

441
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,932
I've been looking for a place lately.

442
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,680
Why don't you check out my residential area?

443
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,160
It's very close to the company. It's only a ten-minute walk.

444
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,453
The key is that it's an old residential area. The rent is affordable.

445
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,870
- Isn't it a good idea? 
 - Yes.

446
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,630
Fu Ying, if it's convenient, could you give me the agent's contact information?

447
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,875
No problem. Let's add each other on WeChat first.

448
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,408
Sure. Thank you.

449
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,110
Thank you.

450
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,070
Fu Ying.

451
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,060
I want to ask you a question.

452
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,650
Go ahead.

453
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,540
What lipstick shade are you wearing?

454
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,670
I thought you wanted to ask me why I became a programmer?

455
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,790
Why would I ask you that?

456
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,910
Girls can do whatever job they want.

457
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,670
You're right, Huan Er.

458
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,140
I used to hate it when people asked me this question.

459
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,140
You're the only one who didn't ask me that.

460
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,578
Fu Ying, people always ask me questions too.

461
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:36,831
They asked me why I applied for Sports Department, and why did I learn martial arts.

462
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:39,460
Why are there so many questions? Learning martial arts is great.

463
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,650
I can carry two buckets up five floors

464
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,200
without breaking a sweat.

465
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,690
Amazing.

466
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,080
After hearing you say that, I think I need to train too.

467
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,073
Or I'll get occupational diseases by sitting all day long.

468
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:51,500
You can try out Baduanjin.

469
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,060
- Baduanjin? 
 - Yes.

470
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,020
You can keep fit by practicing, for a few minutes every day. It's easy.

471
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,160
 How come it's different from what Zhou Ye said? 

472
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,142
Didn't I tell you to try it before? Did you even try it?

473
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,840
I did. It's good.

474
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,300
But I don't know how to practice this.

475
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,750
- Do you have any... 
 - It's fine. I can send you the video.

476
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,460
Okay.

477
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,940
Why are you smiling?

478
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,540
I'm laughing at Zhou Ye's nonsense.

479
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,790
What did he say?

480
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,390
He said you'd be upset about me working with Fu Ying.

481
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,060
How do you know I don't mind?

482
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,540
What, did you expect me to sit here glaring at her all night?

483
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,340
No.

484
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,540
Jing Xi Chi.

485
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,790
Are you happy to be able to work with a beautiful senior?

486
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,120
How could I be happy?

487
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,190
I'm telling you. Fu Ying is scary at work. She often scolds people.

488
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,500
I don't think so. Didn't she help you find a house? She's also nice to you.

489
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,310
No, no, she's just being helpful. That's all.

490
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,390
Helpful?

491
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,070
Helpful...

492
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,390
Don't be like this. You're scaring me.

493
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,910
You're scared?

494
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,060
- You're scared now? 
 - Yes.

495
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,180
You'd better behave and listen.

496
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,350
Don't worry.

497
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,790
Heaven can bear witness.

498
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:18,330
I... I swear on this streetlamp I'll do whatever you say.

499
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:22,370
You don't believe me?

500
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,127
Do you believe me now?

501
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,980
What are you doing?

502
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,790
What's wrong?

503
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,640
- I... 
 - What's wrong?

504
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,540
I believe.

505
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,610
Isn't it normal for a young couple to kiss?

506
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,467
What's wrong with that?

507
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,844
I didn't expect it to be you.

508
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,320
I didn't expect it to be you either.

509
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,980
I started working part-time when I was a freshman.

510
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,940
But I kept getting scammed by agents.

511
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,500
In a rage, I created this group myself,

512
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,880
thinking I could help students find a reliable job.

513
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,670
You don't have to worry about commissions.

514
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,520
My fees are paid by the clients.

515
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,710
I heard from my roommate that your group is well-managed.

516
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,110
Thank you.

517
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,200
Can I ask why you want to work part-time?

518
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,120
I just want to save some money before graduation.

519
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,220
Got it.

520
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,850
I have a job suitable for you.

521
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,670
The client's kid is in the first year of high school.

522
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,230
I'll send you the details when I get back.

523
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,330
Sure. Thank you then.

524
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,880
It's late now. There's nothing else here. You can go back.

525
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,540
I usually stay until closing time.

526
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,110
Me too.

527
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,110
- What are you doing? 
 - Looking for a seat.

528
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,100
Sit here. There's no place now.

529
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,910
What about you?

530
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,910
I happen to start my shift.

531
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,940
- Shift? 
 - I found a part-time job.

532
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,870
I have to work three half-days a week.

533
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,670
With all the academic pressure,

534
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,120
you're still working part-time three half-days a week?

535
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,489
University isn't like high school. Don't just study.

536
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:21,408
I consider it an internship. I'll get paid too.

537
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:22,942
Bye.

538
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,075
You can read. I'll stop bothering you.

539
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,340
Come in.

540
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,390
Hello. I'm here to see Professor...

541
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,060
It's you.

542
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,931
Professor Qiu said a junior would be here to deliver documents.

543
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:21,080
I didn't expect it to be you.

544
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,500
He went out for something.

545
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,108
Give me the documents. I'll take them to his office for you.

546
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:27,660
Sure. Thank you.

547
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,830
Do you also want to pursue a graduate program under Professor Qiu?

548
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,750
Are you already Professor Qiu's graduate student?

549
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,920
Yes. I just got admitted to Professor Qiu's graduate program.

550
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,980
I can see that you're busy.

551
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,540
I got to go.

552
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,080
Sure.

553
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,987
It looks much more comfortable now.

554
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,086
The chores looked like a lot, but they're quite easy to manage.

555
00:40:26,086 --> 00:40:28,220
I finished at nine o'clock.

556
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,390
Really?

557
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,230
Why does it feel like a century has passed?

558
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,710
You lack exercise.

559
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,100
Okay.

560
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,740
- I'm so tired. 
 - I'm going back.

561
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,830
Oh no!

562
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:49,420
It's... It's already eleven o'clock. Your clock is broken.

563
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:54,210
If I go back now, the dorm is closed.

564
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,770
Wait... Did you do it on purpose?

565
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,100
How could I do it on purpose?

566
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,290
I didn't know that the clock had stopped.

567
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,071
It's out of batteries.

568
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:19,390
Well... What do we do now?

569
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,100
What can we do?

570
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,820
If you can't go back, stay here.

571
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,064
Is this bed not big enough for you?

572
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:35,584
Well... If I sleep on the bed, where will you sleep?

573
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,930
I don't need to sleep.

574
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,640
You're not sleeping?

575
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,830
No.

576
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,350
I meant I had a program to write today.

577
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,980
That program is pretty... pretty urgent.

578
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,190
So I was planning to stay up all night to finish it.

579
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,500
So it's not because you're here that I'm staying up.

580
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,710
The bed...

581
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,790
I... I get it.

582
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,150
Okay.

583
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,790
Well...

584
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:19,050
- Well... 
 - Do you want to wash up first?

585
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,993
Yeah, I'll go wash up first.

586
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:26,431
All right.

587
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:39,760


588
