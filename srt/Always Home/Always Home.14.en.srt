=Episode 14=
(Growing Up Happens Overnight)

16
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,340
I'm off to my art class, bye.

17
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,270
Bye.

18
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,470
She's switching to
the art track at this time.

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,320
It's because
of the lower admission scores.

20
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,470
You can't say that.

21
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,700
She's always been interested in drawing.

22
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,270
Probably

23
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,990
she wants to pursue her dreams.

24
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,950
Du Man.

25
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,460
Didn't you say before

26
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,000
that you wanted to sit in the front row?

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,820
Do you still want to?

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,350
Yes.

29
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,860
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

30
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,100
I didn't mean anything by it.

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,230
I just think sitting in the front
makes it easier to see

32
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,390
and ask questions.

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,020
All right.

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,670
Mr. Xu,

35
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,460
can I sit in Du Man's seat?

36
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,270
Go ahead.

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,460
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,920
This session is for self-study.

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,360
Why did you come over here?

40
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,350
To study.

41
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,660
I was afraid you'd feel
lonely studying by yourself,

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,900
so I came to keep you company.

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,860
Are you crazy?

44
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,070
Go back to your seat

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,020
and stop bothering me.

46
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,070
How can you stop me
from making progress?

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,700
How am I stopping you from progressing?

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,760
You think I'd believe that?

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,740
Fine. Just stop talking.

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,980
You're disturbing my studies.

51
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,140
Let me tell you something secretly.

52
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,500
My mother signed me up

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,380
for a top-tier maths tutor
who seems to be good

54
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,510
at predicting exam questions.

55
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,300
Do you want to join?

56
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,420
How much?

57
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,670
Two hundred? That's not bad.

58
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,900
Per session.

59
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,620
That's way too expensive!

60
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,700
We're in our senior three now,

61
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,380
shouldn't we invest
everything into this?

62
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,700
I don't have that kind of money.

63
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,580
Jing Xichi, are you in?

64
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,740
I'm not going.
I don't have money either.

65
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,140
I'll lend it
to you first. Just give it a try.

66
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,580
What if it helps your grades?

67
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,950
Wow, so generous.

68
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,550
What are you saying?

69
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,020
Just go. I'll cover your debt.

70
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,860
Jing Xichi, you...

71
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,140
Xinyan.

72
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,660
Just ignore him.

73
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,700
Jing Xichi,

74
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,900
you're so young,

75
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,860
and you've learned
to get something for nothing.

76
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,700
When you grow up,

77
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,550
you're going to be a menace to society.

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,840
What are you looking at?

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm spiritually connecting
with the exam paper setters.

80
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,460
Be serious.

81
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,510
Do you think

82
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,460
if I don't get into sports universities,

83
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,510
I won't be able to continue studying?

84
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,740
That's why you need to work hard now.

85
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,550
At least give yourself another option.

86
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,110
Why didn't you collect it yourself?

87
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,260
Take this.

88
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,740
Why are you giving me money?

89
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Aren't you planning
to take that tutoring class?

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,180
You go first,

91
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,300
and I'll figure something out for later.

92
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,940
Thanks,

93
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,110
but you should keep the money.

94
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,380
My grades

95
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,910
aren't bad enough to need tutoring.

96
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,740
My point is,

97
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,910
that you go first,

98
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,110
and then when you're done,

99
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,150
you come back and teach me.

100
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,260
Think about it, this way,

101
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,150
we pay for one person

102
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
but get lessons for two.

103
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,500
Isn't that a great deal?

104
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,260
Then later,

105
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,710
you can just pay me back half.

106
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,940
You've thought
this through, haven't you?

107
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,860
Basically, you're
making me do double the work.

108
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,420
What double work?

109
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,110
I take the class,

110
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,710
then I come back and teach you.

111
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,720
Isn't that doing two jobs?

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,660
No, it's just one job.

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,920
I was just messing with you.

114
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,740
Seriously though,

115
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,620
just go.

116
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,590
At least one of us

117
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,670
needs to bring honor
to our family, right?

118
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,710
All right then,
I'll take a hundred first.

119
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,260
What do you mean?

120
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,590
Tuition fee.

121
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,990
Starting today, I'll tutor you.

122
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,110
Forget about it.

123
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,150
After my 'spiritual connection'
with the exam setters today,

124
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,110
I don't even know

125
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,110
where to start studying.

126
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
You can't save me.

127
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,820
That's true.

128
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,180
You weren't that smart to begin with.

129
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm not sure if you'll even understand

130
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,740
what I learned in class.

131
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,790
That's worrying.

132
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,030
Chen Huan'er, are you calling me stupid?

133
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,500
I'm just too lazy to work hard.

134
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,740
Then prove it to me.

135
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,420
Fine, I will.

136
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
Give me a question.

137
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,940
Let's do it when we get home.

138
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,860
(Open)

139
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
So, mitochondria

140
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,590
are the main site of aerobic respiration

141
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,550
in cells.

142
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,380
Ribosomes

143
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,710
are where amino acids

144
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,030
are assembled into proteins.

145
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,820
If you memorize

146
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,940
the entire cell structure,

147
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,110
no matter how the questions

148
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,710
change, you'll still get them right.

149
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,790
Got it?

150
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,420
Yes.

151
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,300
All right, next question.

152
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
In the human body...

153
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,860
Miss Chen,

154
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,990
we've already been studying

155
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,350
for three hours.

156
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,150
Let's call it a day, all right?

157
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,380
You need rest too.

158
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,860
Don't overwork yourself.

159
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,380
Well, all right.

160
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,500
Jing.

161
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,940
Take your test papers with you.

162
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,790
Thanks, Miss Chen.

163
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,500
Honestly, biology

164
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,230
is basically
the art subject of science.

165
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,800
No matter what, you have to memorize it.

166
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,110
So, keep working.

167
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,620
Okay.

168
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,300
Miss Chen,

169
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,230
be honest.

170
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,300
Is this wasting your time?

171
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,420
Not at all.

172
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,030
I'm just treating it as a revision.

173
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,230
Then how about this?

174
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,180
If your rank improves by even one spot,

175
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,180
you have to buy me a cup of milk tea.

176
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,500
Deal.

177
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,590
Then can you

178
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,230
give me back that 100 yuan first?

179
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,780
No way, that's the registration fee.

180
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,580
Class dismissed!

181
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,350
Goodbye, Miss Chen.

182
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,820
Wait!

183
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,550
You better memorize those key points.

184
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,440
I'm checking tomorrow.

185
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,030
Okay.

186
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,860
So, what's the minimum value here?

187
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,500
What is it?

188
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,620

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,260
Don't go to school
the day after tomorrow.

344
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,960
Since I'll be nearby,
I wanted to check it out for you.

345
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,670
I understand.

347
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,910

No matter how sad you are,
you can't just give up on your legs.

352
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,540
What's the point

353
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,150
of my legs now?

354
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,430
I failed the physical exam.

355
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,190
I can't pass.

356
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,580
I really tried my best,

357
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,540
but my legs are still like this.

358
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,430
Maybe in life,

359
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,910
there really are things

360

Tell me, I gave it my all,

363
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,540
but why do I still have regrets?

364
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,910
Do you know?

365
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,470
Actually...

366
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,860
My father wasn't
supposed to be on duty that day.

367
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,390
Do you know why he switched shifts?

368
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,630
He had arranged a meeting

369
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,820
with a sports school coach for me.

370
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,950
He went to ask

371
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,950
if they

372
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,500
could give me a chance

373
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,670
to transfer and continue

374
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,430
playing football.

375
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,390
If only my father

376
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,870
had given up on me sooner...

377
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,820
If only I hadn't been so stubborn...

378
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,470
If I had realized

379
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,670
this earlier,

380
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,300
would my father

381
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,500
still have gotten into that accident?

382
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,300
It'll all pass eventually.

383
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,580
(Many people say)

384
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,540
(that facing loss)

385
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,670
(is the true beginning of growth.)

386
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,430
(I hate this way of romanticizing loss.)

387
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,670
(Loss is just loss.)

388
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,420
(If growth comes
at the cost of losing something,)

389
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,740
(it's unfair.)

390
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,630
(Later on,)

391
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,020
(Uncle Jing was honored,)

392
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,950
(becoming a hero in everyone's eyes.)

393
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,500
(For Xichi,)

394
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,870
(what he faced was still just loss.)

395
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,540
(Yet, the path he chose)

396
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,870
(was the same as Uncle Jing's,)

397
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,840
(which was to hold
this family together.)

398
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,710
Mom.

399
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,390
I have an early meeting tomorrow,

400
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,990
so I might leave home early.

401
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,470
I washed your school uniform for you.

402
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,990
If it's not dry,

403
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,990
just use the hairdryer yourself.

404
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,230
Mom.

405
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,990
I'm sorry.

406
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,710
I let you down.

407
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,190
Silly boy.

408
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,910
You will always be my pride.

409
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,340
Your father's too.

410
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,470
(Today is Uncle Jing's birthday.)

411
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,870
(Xichi kept
his window shut the entire day.)

412
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,950
(Football,)

413
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,260
(family,)

414
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,300
(the things he cherished the most)

415
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,190
(are all slipping away.)

416
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,710
(Even the light in his heart)

417
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,100
(seemed to have been taken too.)

418
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,910
(Open the window,)

419
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,390
(and the sunlight will pour in.)

420
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,910
(However,)

421
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,150
(how can the light
be brought into his heart?)

422
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,830
Sorry.

423
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:44,020
I didn't go to school
because I had something to deal with.

424
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,620
Here, take this.

425
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,790
You can listen to it
when you're feeling tired.

426
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,270
Is everything okay?

427
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,870
I'm going to start studying.

428
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,350
Let's go.

429
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,020
(Countdown to Gaokao)

430
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,990
(The harsh reality of Senior Three...)

431
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,100
(179 days until Gaokao)
(Everything falls apart in its own way.)

432
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,180
Abandon. Abandon.

433
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,830
A, B, A, N, D, O, N.

434
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,100
Abandon. Abandon.

435
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,060
Can you stop going crazy?

436
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,180
You always start
with the word 'abandon',

437
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,500
yet, you abandon your studies!

438
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,620
It's such an ill fortune!

439
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,910
Stay calm, stay peaceful,

440
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,310
and go with the flow.

441
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,100
Mindset determines everything.

442
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,790
(Among all the strange things,)

443
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,220
(the strangest
was definitely Jing Xichi.)

444
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,750
(He went through roughly three stages.)

445
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,470
(First stage.)

446
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,750
(He turned into a studying machine.)

447
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,660
(I knew)

448
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,100
(this was the only way)

449
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,660
(he could temporarily ignore
what happened to Uncle Jing.)

450
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,540
(However, I didn't expect him)

451
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,910
(to push himself)

452
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,950
(this hard.)

453
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,830
Exactly.

454
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,910
I don't know what triggered Xichi.

455
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,020
He studies until midnight every day.

456
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,790
Yifan.

457
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,750
You can't let him continue this.

458
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,100
His body won't take it.

459
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,180
I know.

460
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,310
I'm worried too.

461
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,540
Now, he barely talks anymore.

462
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,950
I have no idea
what's going on in his head.

463
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,620
Negative angle and zero angle...

464
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,910
(When it came to the second stage,)

465
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,990
(he basically went crazy.)

466
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,780
You're not paying
attention in my class anymore.

467
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,220
Come to my office after school.

468
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,500
(Third stage:)

469
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,020
(An academic legend)

470
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,270
(was born.)

471
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,310
(Everyone said he was acting strange,)

472
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,260
(that this wasn't
the right way to cope.)

473
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,080
(However, the changes
on the ranking board)

474
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,990
(told a different story.)

475
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,700
Take a look.

476
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,660
Jing Xichi.

477
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,020
You did pretty well.

478
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,660
You're only five ranks behind me now.

479
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,020
Really?

480
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,790
That high?

481
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,790
Didn't you check?

482
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,310
No.

483
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,990
It doesn't mean anything

484
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,430
until the final results.

485
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,240
This year, Chinese New Year
holiday lasts until the eighth.

486
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,470
Are you going back to Sishui?

487
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,740
No.

488
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,390
My mother is working the night
shift on Chinese New Year's Eve.

489
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,300
I'll probably stay
in the hospital with her.

490
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,350
Robot, what about you?

491
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,180
She's asking you.

492
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,910
We'll see.

493
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,390
Here.

494
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,020
Eat more.

495
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,180
All right, Mom.

496
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,200
Don't worry about me.

497
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,680
Why does everyone decide
to give birth during Chinese New Year?

498
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,430
I know, right?

499
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,180
Lina.

500
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,100
Hello.

501
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,300
Why are you eating
instant noodles during Chinese New Year?

502
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,220
Have some dumplings.

503
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,440
Thank you, Lina, but it's fine.

504
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,620
Our noodles are almost ready.

505
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,700
Dumplings are a must
during Chinese New Year.

506
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,790
These are really good.

507
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,270
Eat more so you have the energy
to take care of the patients.

508
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:50,950
Thank you.

509
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,660
I won't have time to check on you later.

510
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,830
If you

511
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,790
feel bored,

512
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,430
go to Aunt Yifan's house.

513
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,870
Aunt Yifan is on duty today.

514
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,220
Jing Xichi must be home.

515
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,020
Go find him.

516
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,180
Eat.

517
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,430
What's up?

518
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,270
What are you doing?

519
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,620
I just got back
from having dinner at Song's place.

520
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,950
I have nothing much to do.

521
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,140
I'm planning to go over
the final exam papers again.

522
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,270
What about you?

523
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,990
Aren't you at the hospital
keeping Aunt Lina company?

524
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,790
She's busy.

525
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,700
If I stay there, I'll just distract her,

526
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,180
so I come back.

527
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,350
Then get some rest early.

528
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,620
I'm going to do my exercises.

529
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,870
It's Chinese New Year's Eve.
Why are you still studying?

530
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,660
What else would I do?

531
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,830
I'm hanging up.

532
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,060
Hello?

533
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,870
Song.

534
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,220
What are you doing?

535
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,270
Where's Jing Xichi?

536
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,500
He's studying at home.

537
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,820
Is he studying at home
on Chinese New Year's Eve?

538
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,620
That's insane.

539
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,830
Du Man.

540
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,540
Du Man.

541
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,620
Happy Chinese New Year!

542
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,540
You're here.

543
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,620
Where's your father?

544
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,870
He went out to play Mahjong.

545
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,180
Take whatever you want to eat.

546
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:11,950
No.

547
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,580
Uncle Du already
gave me loads of snacks.

548
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,060
I feel bad.

549
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,700
That's just how my father is.

550
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,820
He gives away more than he sells.

551
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,120
He's been like this for over ten years.
He fails at everything.

552
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,180
Don't say that about him.

553
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,220
We'll take a few, then.

554
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:31,830
How many bottles?

555
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,180
Six.

556
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,020
Are you guys drinking?

557
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,140
Is that okay?

558
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,500
Are you 18 already?

559
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,100
Of course.

560
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,910
I turned 18 three months ago.

561
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,430
All right, take them.

562
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,700
Take my money.

563
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,220
No need. Just take them.

564
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,140
If you don't,

565
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,180
we won't come next time.

566
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,390
Let's go.

567
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,580
Happy Chinese New Year.

568
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,520
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

569
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,680
You're just like your father.

571
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,910
Happy Chinese New Year, Robot!

572
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Why are you two here?

573
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,750
My parents are home
for Chinese New Year for once.

574
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,470
I figured I'd give them some space.

575
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,430
Stop studying.

576
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,870
Look what I brought.

577
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:51,580
