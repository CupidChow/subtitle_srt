(This Is The Real Me)

16
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,580
Hello, what's up?

17
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,030
I'm at the door.

18
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,300
Now?

19
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,110
I... Wait a minute.

20
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,600
Good morning.

21
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,900
You're here.

22
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,620
Am I too early?

23
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,070
A little.

24
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,900
Come in first.

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,830
Keep it down.

26
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,300
Okay.

27
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:35,070
What's wrong with your back?

28
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,420
Nothing.

29
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,790
I kind of sprained it

30
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,830
yesterday.

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,790
Well, sit down now.

32
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:43,510
I haven't finished packing yet.

33
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,488
I'll be done in a minute.

34
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,950
So where do I sit?

35
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,070
Wherever you like.

36
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,580
Just like old times.

37
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,830
How can it be the same?

38
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,070
My status is different now,

39
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,790
so my mindset must be different too.

40
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,155
Huan'er,

41
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,790
when are we going

42
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,550
to tell the parents about us?

43
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,460
I...

44
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,550
Huan'er.

45
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,510
Huan'er.

46
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,300
Uncle Chen.

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,460
Xichi is here.

48
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,070
No, it's so early.

49
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,350
What are you two doing here?

50
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,300
Well, school's about to start, isn't it?

51
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,420
I'm discussing something with Huan'er.

52
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,180
Yes.

53
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:27,830
Dad,

54
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,740
where is Mom?

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,844
She's still sleeping.

56
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:30,333
Right,

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,270
bring more clothes

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,390
this time.

59
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,740
Separate the toiletries

60
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,790
from the clothes.

61
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,977
Don't get it all over the place
like last time.

62
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,990
I've packed them all.

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,110
You packed well this time.

65
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,510
My Huan'er has grown up.

66
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,700
Xichi,

67
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,900
it's been hard on you
these past few days.

68
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,460
No.

69
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,490
This is what I should do.

70
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,700
There's something else
I'd like to ask you.

71
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,700
Go ahead, Uncle.

72
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,790
That is,

73
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,070
when you go to school,

74
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,460
take care of Huan'er for me.

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,790
No problem.

76
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,950
I know

77
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,070
there are many

78
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,230
handsome guys

79
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,020
and temptations

80
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,140
in the university.

81
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,790
Keep a close eye on her.

82
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,110
Don't let any boys

83
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,420
trick my girl away.

84
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,390
Dad,

85
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,420
what are you saying?

86
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
You tell me.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
- Okay?
- Sure.

88
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:18,790
No problem, Uncle.

89
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,420
Don't worry.

90
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,888
I will take good care of Huan'er.

91
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:21,511
Good.

92
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,420
I will

93
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,150
leave her to you then.

94
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:27,420
I'll make you two some breakfast.

95
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,933
You two can have a chat.

96
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,500
Okay.

97
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,300
No.

98
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:39,860
Now, I...

99
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,790
Seriously.

100
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,860
With your dad saying that,

101
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,910
I feel like

102
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,822
the big bad wolf
that steals what it guards.

103
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,820
What to do?

104
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,500
Then why don't we keep it

105
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,710
from our family first,

106
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,622
especially my dad?

107
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,740
He's probably

108
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,620
not ready

109
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,180
to accept our relationship right now.

110
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,620
Okay.

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,088
By the way,

112
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:02,755
you haven't told

113
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,800
Qi Qi and Song Cong about us, have you?

114
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,180
I...

115
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,150
They already know.

116
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,150
When?

117
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,350
I told them last night.

118
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,110
Why didn't you tell me?

119
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,060
My back hurts.

120
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,990
Xichi,

121
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,620
do you eat milk and eggs?

122
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,790
I'm not eating, Uncle.

123
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,777
I have something to do.

124
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:19,900
I'll go now.
I'm not eating.

125
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,710
Have breakfast here.

126
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,822
How dare I sit here and eat?

127
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,500
Bye, Uncle.

128
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,350
Thanks.

129
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,400
Be careful. It's hot.

130
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,180
Thank you.

131
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:41,466
It's so good.

132
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,600
You've got it on your lips.

133
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:47,111
Wipe it.

134
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,620
Stop it.

135
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,820
They're sitting here watching.

136
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,110
What's wrong?

137
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,355
I'll wipe it myself.

138
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,550
They're watching us.

139
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,420
What's wrong?

140
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,230
They're calm.

141
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,740
They don't feel anything

142
00:05:58,755 --> 00:05:59,844
and they're not surprised.

143
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,910
We knew you two

144
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,620
would be together.

145
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,380
The whole world knew

146
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,511
you liked each other.

147
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,230
Is it that obvious?

148
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,110
Is it not?

149
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,777
You've been hanging around her all day.

150
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,710
Huan'er,

151
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,940
listen.

152
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,300
Jing has liked you for a long time.

153
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,150
He was afraid
to confess his love to you.

154
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,444
He feared you'd reject him.

155
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,577
Really?

156
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,300
Since when?

157
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,790
About since...

158
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,230
Song Cong,

159
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,420
can you stop

160
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,150
telling everything

161
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,350
like a bullhorn?

162
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,710
Okay.

163
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,355
Since high school?

164
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,110
No.

165
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:33,710
Not so early.

166
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,380
Since high school?

167
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,820
Last Thursday night,

168
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,110
around 8:40 PM.

169
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,060
We're still here.

170
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,400
Stop displaying affection.

171
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,300
Are you going back to school tomorrow?

172
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,150
Yes.

173
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:46,733
What about you?

174
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,200
We're going back tomorrow too.

175
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,150
I've got to leave quickly.

176
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,470
After I changed my major,

177
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,400
my mom has been impatient
with me every day.

178
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
I can't stand it.

179
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,133
Did you get the connecting tickets?

180
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,620
Tickets are hard to come by now.

181
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,590
We'll have to sit separately.

182
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,230
No.

183
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,420
Song Cong,

184
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:06,466
which compartment did you get?

185
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,740
Let me see.

186
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,733
Twelve.

187
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:13,590
What about you?

188
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,260
Twelve?

189
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,066
You bought a second-class seat?

190
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:16,622
Yes.

191
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:19,111
It's okay.

192
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm sure they'd be willing

193
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,600
to exchange a business class seat

194
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,590
for a second-class seat.

195
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,740
I want to sit with you.

196
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,620
Don't do that.

197
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,350
We're just not on the road together.

198
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,990
When we get to Jing City,
I'll take you back to school.

199
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:31,740
It's okay.

200
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,030
It isn't worth much.

201
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,470
It's decided.

202
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,150
Qi Qi,

203
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:45,800
didn't your mom

204
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,060
stop your card

205
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,355
because you changed your major?

206
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,500
I sold some of my old clothes

207
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,110
and bags.

208
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,088
So it's still okay.

209
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,030
I read the novel

210
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:23,466
you posted online.

211
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,533
What are you trying to satirize?

212
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,820
The wording is a bit childish

213
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,150
and the idea a bit cliched,

214
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,860
but I admit

215
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,710
that you have perception and talent.

216
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,900
If you really want to study literature,

217
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,380
I think you should go abroad.

218
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,830
Aunt Zhou's daughter

219
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,200
is studying literature at Cambridge.

220
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:49,444
You can contact her.

221
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,620
I don't want to go abroad.

222
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,070
You don't just need talent
to study literature,

223
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,430
and you need vision, insight,

224
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,244
experience
and a philosophical foundation.

225
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:00,666
No matter what direction

226
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,355
you're going to take in the future,

227
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:03,866
the experience of studying abroad

228
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,990
will definitely nourish your creativity.

229
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,950
But writing for a living

230
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,830
on a second-rate website

231
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,140
only saps

232
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,260
your passion for literature.

233
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:19,977
Are you afraid your boyfriend

234
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,500
will stop you from going abroad?

235
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,830
Listen here.

236
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,830
Only incompetent men

237
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,860
hold back

238
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,190
the progress of their partners.

239
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,830
Think about it.

240
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,780
Since you're going after your dreams,

241
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,590
I want you to have no regrets.

242
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,110
Are you tired?

243
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,590
No.

244
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,900
This is nothing.

245
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,444
Have you forgotten that I have muscles?

246
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:10,710
I'm strong.

247
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,540
Enough.

248
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,066
Alright.

249
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,644
I've arrived.

250
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:17,466
Give it to me.

251
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,710
I'll walk you up.

252
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,950
I'll go up myself.

253
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,400
By the way,

254
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
should we tell

255
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,830
Zhou Ye

256
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,511
and the others about us?

257
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,110
Okay.

258
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:28,620
I'll go back and find a chance

259
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,355
to tell them.

260
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,710
Okay.

261
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,350
Xichi,

262
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,066
Huan'er.

263
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,950
Huixin.

264
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:35,260
It's good that you're all back.

265
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,230
Call your roommates

266
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,880
and have dinner
in our dormitory tonight.

267
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,800
I've brought a lot of specialties
back from home.

268
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,977
We'll make a hot pot together.

269
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,310
Isn't it inconvenient for us girls

270
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,540
to go to the boys' dormitory?

271
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,830
Not really.

272
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,800
Our dormitory isn't as strict as yours.

273
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,130
Besides, it gets crowded at night.

274
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,709
Then we boys will cover them together,

275
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,688
and they'll sneak in.

276
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,500
Come on, Huan'er.

277
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,620
Or Huixin will be alone.

278
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,470
Alright.

279
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,480
The worst that can happen is
to get a scolding.

280
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:05,288
I'll go with Huixin.

281
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,950
Huixin,

282
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,577
see you this evening.

283
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:09,710
Let's go back and tidy up.

284
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,110
Okay.

285
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,590
Let's meet this evening.

286
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,070
Wait.

287
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,380
You'd better tidy up.

288
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,190
Don't leave smelly socks
all over the place.

289
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,500
How can that be?

290
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,680
The boys' dormitory is very clean.
Am I right, Zhou Ye?

291
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:19,710
Clean? Is it clean?

292
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,733
Of course it's clean.

293
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,777
We'll get going now.

294
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,070
Bye.

295
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:22,900
Bye.

296
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,540
Bye, Huan'er.

297
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,430
Bye.

298
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,260
Bye.

299
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,590
What's your hurry?

300
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,177
Let's tidy up.

301
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,155
Run quickly, and go back first.

302
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,470
Oh, no.

303
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,860
Wait, Bro,

304
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,710
why did you run so fast?

305
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,190
Zhou Ye,

306
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,333
go and put away the underwear
on the balcony first.

307
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:51,000
Yan Mu, wash your stinky socks.

308
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,260
Now I'm going to fetch water

309
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,969
and mop the floor.

310
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,040
We have much work to do,
or we won't make it in time.

311
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:55,710
No, wait.

312
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,470
Wait a minute.

313
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,110
What are you doing?

314
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,711
You're role-playing a dormitory warden?

315
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:01,022
You asked a girl to come over.

316
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,488
You're going to let her see this?

317
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,000
A girl is coming to our dormitory?

318
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,950
Before the dormitory is cleaned,

319
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,190
no one is allowed to leave.

320
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,540
No, Jing Xichi,

321
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,380
you're being too much

322
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,020
of an idol now.

323
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,020
My girlfriend is coming

324
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,710
and I said nothing.

325
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,466
Why are you anxious?

326
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:17,780
Just clean it up, okay?

327
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,990
Or I won't help you

328
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,740
with group work anymore.

329
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,022
Wait, where is Zhang Yang?

330
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,350
He's gone out to have fun.

331
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,990
He...

332
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,620
Hi, Madam.

333
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,540
You're back.

334
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,190
Hi, Madam.

335
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,710
Hi, Madam.

336
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,430
You've gained weight.

337
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,350
No.

338
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,310
Hi, Madam.

339
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,070
You're back.

340
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,860
That's what you call a big crowd

341
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,830
and it's easy to sneak in.

342
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:51,311
I really didn't expect this.

343
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,190
Aren't we being a little

344
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,540
abrupt?

345
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,260
Don't worry.

346
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,830
With the way you three are dressed,
who'd recognize you?

347
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,430
Chen Huan'er.

348
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,710
Let's forget it.

349
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,950
I...

350
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,950
No, Huixin.

351
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,990
I've got it all ready.

352
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,540
I...

353
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,950
Since you're here,

354
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:13,900
let's go.

355
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,740
Is this hairstyle for men or women?

356
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,230
We can do it this way?

357
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:26,377
Let's go.

358
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,400
I'll cover you.

359
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,310
Let's go.

360
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:29,422
Huixin, it will be alright.

361
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,422
Which dormitory are you from?

362
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:38,780
Madam,

363
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,780
it's me.

364
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,470
Jing Xichi.

365
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,070
Room 258.

366
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,070
Zhou Ye.

367
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,710
Yes. Zhou Ye.

368
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,529
Which dormitory are they from?

369
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,200
Madam, this is my junior,
a street dancer.

370
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:48,888
Dance for her.

371
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,700
The weird clothes...

372
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:50,260
Yeah. Look.

373
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,260
Madam,

374
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,620
you watch this

375
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,430
TV series too?

376
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:54,644
Let me tell you,

377
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,044
my mom loves to watch this too.

378
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:56,620
Really?

379
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,710
This guy's a scumbag.

380
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,020
He ran off with his sister-in-law.

381
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,266
He's cheating on his wife.

382
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:03,070
Which episode is that?

383
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,777
Alright, Madam.

384
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:04,230
Enjoy it.

385
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,620
I'll spare you the spoilers.

386
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,900
Does her husband divorce her?

387
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,860
Yes.

388
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,950
Tell me

389
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,140
what has happened.

390
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,590
Come on.

391
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,110
The boys' dormitory

392
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,070
is cleaner

393
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,780
than the girls'.

394
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,140
How can it not be?

395
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,350
He made us

396
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,260
clean it all afternoon.

397
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,860
It's as if your girlfriend
is coming over.

398
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,422
Stop it.

399
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,190
Are we missing two stools

400
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,380
in the dormitory?

401
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,780
Oh, right.

402
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,830
Yan... Yan Mu,

403
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,830
go borrow two from the next dormitory.

404
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,710
No problem.

405
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,644
Alright. Thank you.

406
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,900
Come on, let's sit down.

407
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,350
Sit down.

408
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,190
I'll help you.

409
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,710
No.

410
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,230
I can do it.

411
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,540
I can do it.

412
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,140
You didn't tell them

413
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,900
the two of us were in a relationship?

414
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,500
I didn't

415
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,710
get the chance.

416
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,260
Why don't we just tell them today

417
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,260
while everyone's here?

418
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,990
Okay.

419
00:14:58,444 --> 00:14:59,844
Zhou Ye, let me help you.

420
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:03,488
Don't move.

421
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:04,777
I'll take a picture first.

422
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,190
I have to send it to the group chat

423
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,540
to piss off Zhang Yang and Qiu Li.

424
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,430
They're so late.

425
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,070
Alright.

426
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:11,710
Okay, let's eat now.

427
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:12,190
Come on.

428
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,620
Thank you.

429
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:14,955
Let's start eating, my friends.

430
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,990
Come on, Huixin.

431
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,380
Try this.

432
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:18,888
You love to eat bean curd, right?

433
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,110
I bought a lot of them.

434
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,259
It must be enough for you.

435
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,780
Okay.

436
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,990
And... And this.

437
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,350
My mom made these fish balls herself.

438
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:26,310
It's very tasty.

439
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,150
Try it and you'll know.

440
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:27,444
Really?

441
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,155
I'm sure there's enough for you to eat.

442
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,600
You can have another one of these.

443
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,500
Zhou,

444
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,780
we know you're in love.

445
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,355
Can't you restrain yourself?

446
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,140
There are four singles here.

447
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,430
Alright, Huixin.

448
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,844
I'll leave you to it then.

449
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,590
Come on, Huan'er.

450
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,620
Don't you love tripe?

451
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,710
Come on, try some tripe.

452
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,900
It must be delicious.

453
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,430
It smells good when you serve it.

454
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,260
Is it good?

455
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,310
Yes, it's so delicious.

456
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,700
I'll get another one for you.

457
00:15:58,888 --> 00:15:59,590
Try a meat ball.

458
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,990
Thank you, Huan'er.

459
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,977
It's good for your health.

460
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:02,666
Try a fish tofu.

461
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,710
It smells so good.

462
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,020
Thank you. Huan'er.

463
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,470
Thank you.

464
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,190
Lu,

465
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,470
don't just look at your phone.

466
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,710
Why aren't you eating?

467
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Let me upload this first.

468
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,350
You love eating that much?

469
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:24,822
You've never eaten in your life?

470
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm hungry, Bro.

471
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,140
Jing,

472
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,500
you and Chen Huan'er

473
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,777
are using a couple's
profile picture, huh?

474
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,230
Guys,

475
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,740
actually,

476
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,950
we...

477
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:45,733
You two are so destined for each other.

478
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:46,200
Yes.

479
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,822
You're using a couple's profile picture.

480
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:49,088
What kind of destiny is this?

481
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,830
Yeah.

482
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,480
Luckily, you two
aren't seeing each other,

483
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:53,970
or this would be a big misunderstanding.

484
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:54,740
Watch out.

485
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,740
Yeah.

486
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,260
Wait, no.

487
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,110
Why can't you guys just guess

488
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,260
if it's possible that we're in love?

489
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,390
Jing Xichi,
did you not get enough to eat or what?

490
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:16,260
If you two wanted to be in love,

491
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,422
you'd been in love long ago.

492
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:18,400
Why wait until now?

493
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,470
Besides,

494
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,710
I thought you liked

495
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,710
mature schoolgirl type.

496
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,100
Mature schoolgirl?

497
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:27,260
No, I don't. Who told you

498
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,500
I like mature girls?

499
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Don't talk nonsense.

500
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,600
Don't you know about it?

501
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,100
I don't.

502
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,580
Stop.

503
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:32,990
Elaborate.

504
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,088
Let me list them for you.

505
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,990
Du Wei,

506
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,020
the one

507
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,950
who's pretty.

508
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,740
And Fu Ying.

509
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,630
She was rumored to be with him.

510
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,155
All of them are mature girls.

511
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,710
You just said

512
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,780
it was a rumor.

513
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,540
Can you believe rumors?

514
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,430
Even if you're

515
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,340
interested in Huan'er,

516
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,060
it's only unrequited love

517
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,990
because Huan'er

518
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,910
isn't interested in this kind

519
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:57,511
of childhood relationship.

520
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,470
When?

521
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,540
When did I say that?

522
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,230
Last year,

523
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,710
we played the love game,

524
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,340
didn't we?

525
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,950
Didn't you go
for the domineering boss mode?

526
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,540
Didn't you say

527
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,780
that the childhood love mode

528
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,630
is too unchallenging

529
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,430
for you?

530
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,066
Like the left hand
touching the right hand.

531
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:13,950
Domineering boss...

532
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,950
No.

533
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,777
When did I say that?

534
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,430
You did.

535
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,430
You like the domineering boss?

536
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,150
No, that's not true.

537
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:21,710
Well,

538
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,020
it's just a game.

539
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,260
Can a game be like reality?

540
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,710
Am I right?

541
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,822
I chose it blindly, didn't I?

542
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:26,710
I chose it blindly.

543
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,540
Look,

544
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,150
Xichi,

545
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,100
Huan'er likes the domineering type,

546
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,060
and you

547
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,710
like the mature type.

548
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,430
How can you be together?

549
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,780
Jing Xichi.

550
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:41,990
Enough!

551
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,580
I'll stop pretending.

552
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,444
I'm showing my cards.

553
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,200
All of you,

554
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,311
put down your phones

555
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,390
and bowls.

556
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,060
Put it down.

557
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,150
Listen to me.

558
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:50,911
I'll be straight with you.

559
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,740
Actually,

560
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:53,000
a couple of days ago,

561
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,820
the two of us

562
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,740
were already...

563
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,822
Why are the lights off?

564
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,950
It's not even 10 PM.

565
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,866
Why are the lights off?

566
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:03,555
Who is using a high-powered appliance?

567
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,430
Open the doors.

568
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,844
I'm going to check the dormitory.

569
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:06,340
Quick.

570
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,950
I'll deal with it.

571
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,540
Hurry up.

572
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,740
Hide it.

573
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,580
Hide it.

574
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,780
Put it in the cabinet.

575
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:27,266
Did you guys use
any high-powered appliances?

576
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,610
No, that's impossible.

577
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,288
We didn't.

578
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,230
Madam,

579
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,780
we're all

580
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,950
good, law-abiding kids.

581
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,950
We never use that stuff.

582
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,870
Are you sure?

583
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,150
Madam,

584
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,950
whose fault was it

585
00:19:40,977 --> 00:19:42,100
that caused our dormitory

586
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,133
to go off the grid?

587
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,740
None of you kids

588
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,990
are trustworthy.

589
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,150
Come on, step aside.

590
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,340
Let me search your room.

591
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,260
(Mage,)

592
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,470
(guess where I am now.)

593
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,950
What's in here?

594
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,390
(Where is my darling?)

595
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,230
(We came to the boys' dormitory)

596
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,990
(for hot pot.)

597
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:09,822
(The warden came
to check the dormitory.)

598
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:11,710
(I'm hiding under the boys' blanket.)

599
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,500
(How's it?)

600
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,820
(Isn't that dramatic?)

601
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:46,592
(Gosh,)

602
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,020
(that boy farted.)

603
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,300
(I'm afraid to breathe now.)

604
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,710
(I'm suffocating.)

605
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:00,260
Are you sure you don't have

606
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,377
any high-powered appliances?

607
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,400
No, don't worry, Madam.

608
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,355
Don't let me find out,

609
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:04,340
or you'll get a demerit.

610
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,488
No, we don't have it.

611
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:06,000
For sure.

612
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,150
Madam,

613
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,020
it's

614
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,060
my personal

615
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,540
penchant.

616
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,300
Alright.

617
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,710
Rest early.

618
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,710
Okay, Madam.

619
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,390
Bye, Madam.

620
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,100
Goodbye.

621
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,150
Rest early.

622
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,711
Good night.

623
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,260
Good night.

624
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,820
Bye, Madam.

625
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,060
She's gone.

626
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,740
Bro, are you sick?

627
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,470
Get up.

628
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:52,870
She is gone.

629
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,580
She's gone.

630
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,640
She's gone.

631
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,244
She's gone.

632
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,060
I was afraid you'd get caught.

633
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,230
I almost suffocated.

634
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,540
It was a close call last night.

635
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,470
Did your high-powered appliance

636
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,390
ever get found?

637
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,710
She found it in the other dorms.

638
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,390
We got lucky

639
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,230
and escaped it.

640
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,910
What a relief.

641
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,630
Well,

642
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,300
did you tell them

643
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
about us?

644
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,020
Not yet.

645
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,630
I couldn't find a chance.

646
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,390
Me too.

647
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,870
As soon as I told them it was you,

648
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:38,377
they stopped asking questions.

649
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,580
It's so strange.

650
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,400
Jing, you haven't been yourself lately.

651
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:49,390
Which one of the mature girls
are you chatting with?

652
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,340
What mature girls?

653
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,780
Chen Huan'er.

654
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,430
So boring.

655
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,570
I thought it's someone else.

656
00:22:54,577 --> 00:22:55,288
Sleep earlier.

657
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:57,740
Yes,

658
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,710
same in my dormitory.

659
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:01,990
Well,

660
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,300
see you at the cafe.

661
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,710
There is a new situation.

662
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:08,111
Who are you eating with?

663
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,870
Jing Xichi.

664
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,870
Do you think

665
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,100
it could be that we usually

666
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,470
portray the buddy image

667
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,990
too well?

668
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,870
So how do we turn this

669
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,230
buddy image

670
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,910
into a couple image?

671
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,580
How about...

672
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,500
I...

673
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,300
I don't think

674
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,990
it's a good idea to do it

675
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,340
in public.

676
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,020
Well,

677
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,288
what about in private?

678
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:29,333
We'll talk about it later.

679
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,780
Yeah. Let's talk about it later.

680
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,990
Hey,

681
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,580
well,

682
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,630
can you help me to check

683
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,780
if I can move my shift

684
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,300
to Wednesday afternoons?

685
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,390
I'm taking a lot

686
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,190
of electives this semester.

687
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,300
I can only be on duty
on Wednesday afternoons.

688
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,470
Please.

689
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,580
That's great.

690
00:25:00,088 --> 00:25:00,710
Thanks.

691
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:02,355
I'll buy you a meal some other time.

692
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,300
Okay.

693
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,340
Thanks.

694
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,630
I'll buy you a meal when I'm free.

695
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,710
I can do it.

696
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:47,060
(How to kiss a girl?)

697
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,710
Jing Xichi.

698
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,740
You're here.

699
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,311
Are you wearing make-up?

700
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,020
A little.

701
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:06,666
This is for you.

702
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,540
Thank you.

703
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,190
Do you like it?

704
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,580
Yes, I do.

705
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,910
You've prepared so much food.

706
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,230
These... These are not for eating.

707
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,710
This is my

708
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,340
"V".

709
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,710
Look.

710
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,720
(L)

711
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,220
(O)

712
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,540
(V)

713
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,780
(E)

714
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,430
Love, huh?

715
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:48,577
Thanks for your kind thoughts.

716
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,580
You...

717
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,100
Well, we...

718
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:56,820
Now?

719
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,390
Okay.

720
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,470
Wait.

721
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,710
Wait.

722
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,470
I think

723
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,710
I can't get the feeling this way.

724
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,950
Actually,

725
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,500
I feel weird too.

726
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,300
Right?

727
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,430
How do we get the feeling?

728
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,710
How do we get the feeling?

729
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,710
I know.

730
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,020
What

731
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,580
are you doing?

732
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,780
Kabedon.

733
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,540
That's how it's done on TV.

734
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,540
Come on,

735
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:55,990
kabedon me.

736
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,500
How?

737
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,150
That's how kabedon works.

738
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,990
This is kabedon?

739
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,780
Got it?

740
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,780
How could I not know?

741
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,710
Come on, stand here.

742
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:22,088
Stand still.

743
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,260
I'm coming.

744
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:26,990
Come on.

745
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,870
Wait.

746
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,844
- What's wrong again?
- I think

747
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,740
the bag is in the way.

748
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,100
It's alright now?

749
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,740
It's okay.

750
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,950
Can you stop laughing?

751
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:02,390
You...

752
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:04,580
I can't do it when you're laughing.

753
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,300
Sorry.

754
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,710
I'm sorry.

755
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,710
Again. One more time.

756
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,390
I'm sorry.

757
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:10,990
I'll stop laughing.

758
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:11,710
Don't laugh.

759
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,820
Again.

760
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:13,990
Again.

761
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,022
I'm coming.

762
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,990
Chen Huan'er.

763
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:23,950
Sorry.

764
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,470
I'm sorry.

765
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:26,540
Again.

766
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,300
One more time.

767
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,500
One more time.

768
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:29,630
It's the last time.

769
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,888
Okay, the last time.

770
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:34,933
Close your eyes.

771
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,844
Close your eyes.

772
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,000
You're both here.

773
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,644
I put it here for you.

774
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,540
That's a lot of nuts.

775
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,820
It's quite cool.

776
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,800
Did you prepare it for me, Jing?

777
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,710
What are you two doing?

778
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,500
I...

779
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,710
I'm looking for something.

780
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:36,710
Okay, I'm leaving.

781
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,630
Bye.

782
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,190
Bye.

783
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:44,600
It's quite nice.

784
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,950
A good date

785
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,300
was ruined by Zhou Ye.

786
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,710
It's alright.

787
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,820
I have a question for you.

788
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:17,377
Ask away.

789
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,780
When exactly

790
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,740
did you start liking me?

791
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,580
I can't say

792
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,820
exactly when.

793
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:27,910
But I

794
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,630
liked you

795
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,190
when I first met you,

796
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,100
though I didn't know

797
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,340
what kind of liking I had at the time.

798
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,444
What about you?

799
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,540
When did you

800
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,190
start liking me?

801
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,150
I

802
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,260
have a little secret.

803
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,500
What secret?

804
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,230
Actually,

805
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,390
the first time we held hands

806
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,910
wasn't

807
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,630
the night my dad proposed.

808
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,430
When was it then?

809
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,820
It was before that.

810
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:23,133
What are you doing?

811
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,950
What are you doing?

812
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,666
I... I've been sitting here

813
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:29,111
and you suddenly grabbed my hand.

814
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,540
Are you a pervert?

815
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,580
You're a rascal.

816
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,300
Not bad, huh?

817
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,820
You lied to me

818
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,866
and called me a pervert.

819
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,950
If you didn't have anything
in your heart,

820
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,260
why would you believe me?

821
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,340
That's true.

822
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,540
If I

823
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,820
hadn't believed you,

824
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:49,022
would we have been together long ago?

825
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,820
Not necessarily.

826
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,820
How is it?

827
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:49,555
How does our control of the lights

828
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:50,244
work for you?

829
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,190
Go on.

830
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,100
Don't stop.

831
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,150
Well, you...

832
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,260
We've noticed

833
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
you're in love.

834
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:58,111
We've been messing around with you two.

835
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,710
Kiss again.

836
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,260
Go on, quick.

837
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:02,066
There are no outsiders here.

838
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:03,066
- One more.
- Quick.

839
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,230
You four are crazy.

840
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,430
Let's go.

841
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:06,910
Not bad.

842
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:07,933
We won't show you.

843
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:08,700
Don't go.

844
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:09,310
Come back.

845
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,222
We haven't seen enough.

846
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,500
That's it?

847
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,390
Qi Qi,

848
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:21,377
what have you been up to?

849
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:22,444
I haven't seen you around.

850
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,580
I'm busy writing a novel.

851
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,870
I changed my major.

852
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,400
When my mom found out, she got so mad

853
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,310
she stopped my card.

854
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,577
I have to make money.

855
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,430
Then why are you buying me drinks?

856
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,130
How much money
do you make writing novels?

857
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:34,755
I have got some money for drinks.

858
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,020
Where is your boyfriend?

859
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,155
Doesn't he care about you?

860
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:39,100
It's none of his business.

861
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:40,270
I don't want to bother him.

862
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,580
Qi Qi, to be honest,

863
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:45,200
are you happy in this relationship?

864
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,700
I am happy.

865
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,540
Why do you ask?

866
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:54,288
I just have a feeling

867
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,955
you two aren't from the same world.

868
00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:58,060
Okay, I'll stop talking.

869
00:34:58,266 --> 00:34:59,066
Let's drink.

870
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,620
Qi Qi,

871
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,580
we're here.

872
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,180
Song Cong, we're here.

873
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,390
Song Cong?

874
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,020
Hi.

875
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,700
Hi.

876
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,600
How are you feeling?

877
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,350
Am I drunk

878
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,350
or am I hallucinating?

879
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,500
Xu Wenwen called me

880
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,430
and said you were drunk.

881
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,140
She lied to you.

882
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,580
I'm not drunk.

883
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,390
She's just testing

884
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,700
to see if you care about me.

885
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,140
What are you doing?

886
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,750
Let's go back.

887
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,580
I don't want to go back yet.

888
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,620
Have a drink with me.

889
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,540
You know I can't drink.

890
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,470
Just a bottle.

891
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,350
I have an exam tomorrow morning.

892
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,177
One bottle.

893
00:35:59,580 --> 00:35:59,870
Okay.

894
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,311
I'll have a glass of something with you.

895
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,470
We'll leave after that, okay?

896
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:02,870
Okay.

897
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,580
Let's go.

898
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,100
No.

899
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,750
Song Cong, what are you doing?

900
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,790
Cheers! Come on.

901
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,790
I'm dead drunk.

902
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,700
You're fine.

903
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:32,200
Come on, let's keep drinking.

904
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,790
Stop it.

905
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,060
Don't drink too much.

906
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,390
I come to the pub to drink

907
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,950
to have a good time.

908
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,180
If you don't let me drink...

909
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,270
Don't be a buzzkill.

910
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,870
Xu Wenwen.

911
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:13,977
Let's drink.

912
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,111
Song Cong, let's drink.

913
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,310
Stop it.

914
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:19,790
Come on.

915
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,620
I told you not to drink so much.

916
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,990
I just want to drink.

917
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:34,270
How are you feeling?

918
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,220
Are you okay?

919
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,950
I'm fine.

920
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,430
Song Cong,

921
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,140
I want some water.

922
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,100
I have an exam early tomorrow morning.

923
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,060
When you're asleep,

924
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,700
I'll go back.

925
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,270
Are you leaving?

926
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,100
Can you not go?

927
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,910
I can't.

928
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,622
I've got things to do in the morning.

929
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,350
Why can't you stay with me?

930
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,020
Song Cong,

931
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,950
do you really like me?

932
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,580
Of course I do.

933
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,790
No.

934
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,580
That's not

935
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,750
how you like someone at all.

936
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,350
You're not the same to me

937
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,060
as you are to Chen Huan'er.

938
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,220
What does this have to do

939
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,060
with Chen Huan'er?

940
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,540
I saw the way

941
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,140
you liked Chen Huan'er.

942
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,140
It's over now, isn't it?

943
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,700
Yes.

944
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,700
I liked Chen Huan'er before.

945
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,540
But I also lost myself

946
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,700
because I liked her.

947
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:42,020
Now I don't think

948
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,100
that's the right way to go.

949
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,220
Is it wrong for me

950
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,140
to like someone

951
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,750
in a different way?

952
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,910
Isn't it true

953
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,830
that people grow up?

954
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,870
Why are you so mean to me?

955
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,220
So now you think

956
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,310
I'm being unreasonable?

957
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,580
I'm not being mean to you.

958
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,140
I've been

959
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,990
doing my best to be good to you,

960
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,950
to be worthy of your love.

961
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,220
But now you're telling me

962
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,830
that's wrong too.

963
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,700
So what should I do

964
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,733
to be right?

965
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:18,830
Okay.

966
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,990
You said you shouldn't

967
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:23,888
change yourself if you like someone.

968
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,540
But it was only after I changed

969
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,700
that you fell in love with me.

970
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Don't you see?

971
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,270
Over the past year,

972
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,540
I've been acting the way you like

973
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,830
in front of you.

974
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,100
I've never been my true self

975
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,910
in front of you.

976
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,430
Don't you realize that?

977
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,310
What's

978
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,310
the real you like?

979
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,350
Would you like

980
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,540
the real me?

981
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,700
Isn't what I've been
seeing the real you?

982
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:06,950
I'll tell you

983
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,470
what the real me is.

984
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,100
The real me...

985
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,310
The real me

986
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,430
is the one who claims

987
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,990
to be into literature,

988
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,310
but in reality,

989
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,990
I'm on a second-rate fiction site

990
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,470
and I'm just spouting nonsense
for the rewards.

991
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,100
The real me

992
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,100
is the one who says I have to rely
on myself and not on my family,

993
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,580
but in fact,

994
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:30,950
I rely on selling those bags

995
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,350
my mom bought me

996
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,060
to save face.

997
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,950
The real me

998
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,580
is obviously want an

999
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,750
equal love,

1000
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,620
but

1001
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
I am cautious

1002
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,870
in an unequal relationship

1003
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,580
and lose myself.

1004
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,140
Do you still like

1005
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,220
this vain,

1006
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,990
weak,

1007
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,500
real me?

1008
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,580
Qi Qi, you're not like that.

1009
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,500
The you I know is sensitive

1010
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,100
but has a

1011
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,700
soft, kind heart.

1012
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,500
You've always been the same Qi Qi

1013
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:26,580
who pursues her dreams,

1014
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,310
longs for freedom and is brave.

1015
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,540
But we all have to grow up.

1016
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,470
Isn't that what you said?

1017
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,470
Leave now.

1018
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,220
I don't want to see you right now.

1019
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:51,540
I just want to be myself

1020
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,620
for real.

1021
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,830
If I tell you

1022
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,060
that I don't like it when you change me

1023
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,470
into someone I don't like,

1024
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,020
will you still like
