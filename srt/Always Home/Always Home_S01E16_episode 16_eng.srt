♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

♫  Between you and me  ♫

♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,660
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,800
   

18
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,120
I've finished filling it out. 
    

19
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,580
You... You check it.

20
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,630
I can't.

21
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,910
No.

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,830
Check it with your eyes closed.

23
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,130
Check it.

24
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:17,790
I got 602. 
    

25
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,140
Is 602 awesome?

26
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,860
- 602. 
 - 602.

27
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,880
602!

28
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,070
You're awesome!

29
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,390
- Dad! 
 - Coming.

30
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,900
- Dad, hurry up. 
 - Check the applications.

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,360
Here. Check the applications.

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,640
Dad, we just got the score, and we're choosing applications?

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,653
This is a big deal.

34
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,800
- Selecting early will make you secure. 
 - Yeah.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Look, don't you want to study pharmacy?

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,600
I think the major at Wuan University is great.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,860
Your score is all right too. What do you think?

38
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,700
Yeah. Besides pharmacy, there are other easier majors.

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,640
- Yes. 
 - It's not that stressful.

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,840
And the admission score is lower. You'll get in for sure.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,897
Yes.

42
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:55,080
Why am I only applying to this university? I want to check out others.

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,040
- Others are fine too. 
 - Look.

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,160
This one. My scores are enough for this.

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,200
- No. 
 - Not okay.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,830
Their campus environment is average.

47
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,950
- Yes. 
 - Wait.

48
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,520
How did you know?

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,320
We've investigated it thoroughly.

50
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,700
- Yeah. 
 - We don't think this university is good.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,640
- What about this one? I can get into this. 
 - No.

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,180
This is not good either. It's hard to graduate from this school.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,970
- Yes. 
 - And the schoolwork pressure is too much.

54
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,980
No.

55
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,460
- This one then. I heard that this— 
 - No.

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,670
Look at the name of this major. It's really weird.

57
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,060
I think you won't be able to find a job.

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,920
- Right? 
 - Yes.

59
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,300
Wait. What's going on?

60
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,070
So I can only apply to universities within the province and not outside?

61
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,780
No.

62
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,450
She's asking you. What's going on?

63
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,950
She's asking you.

64
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,340
Dad, what's going on?

65
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,890
No, Huan Er. Well...

66
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,900
It's not that we're forcing you to go to universities in the province.

67
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,500
- Yes. 
 - It's mainly because we're a little worried.

68
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,270
Think about it. If you have a headache, I can come over immediately.

69
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,900
Besides, if I can't go, Aunt Hao Mei, Aunt Yi Fan, and Uncle Song can come over.

70
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,110
- Yes. 
 - You...

71
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,550
I...

72
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,070
If you're far away...

73
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,490
- If you're sick... 
 - Don't cry.

74
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,820
- Calm down. 
 - If you're really sick, I can't see you...

75
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,980
even if I want to take care of you.

76
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,720
All right.

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,940
Actually, universities outside the province aren't bad either.

78
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,060
It's just... I don't know how you'll manage.

79
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,740
Mom, I'm just going to university.

80
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,550
I'll come back often, okay?

81
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,860
Okay?

82
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,550
Don't cry.

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,860
If there's no other way, I... I'll apply to Anhui University, okay?

84
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,660
Anhui University?

85
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,820
- Anhui University is actually quite good. 
 - Yes.

86
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,800
- Really. 
 - Yes.

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,740
I think Anhui University is good.

88
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,460
What would you like to eat? I'll make it for you right away.

89
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,930
Let's go.

90
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,010
Hurry.

91
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,860
How comfortable.

92
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,700
How did you all fill out your university applications?

93
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,130
Jing Xi Chi.

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,590
I haven't made up my mind.

95
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,180
I'm lost.

96
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,890
Cong, what about you?

97
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm considering whether to apply to Tianhe University.

98
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,550
With these scores, you're applying to Tianhe University?

99
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,380
Why don't you go to Yenching University?

100
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,740
It's near home. I can take care of my mom.

101
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,960
No. Your mom has your dad to take care of her.

102
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,620
Besides, Aunt Hao has almost recovered.

103
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,380
Haven't you always wanted to go to the Medical School of Yenching University?

104
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,080
Cong, why do I feel like you've changed?

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,050
You weren't like this before.

106
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,960
You were the one full of ideas.

107
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,480
Out of all three years of middle school, you're the one who had the most going on.

108
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,260
You were the one who transferred classes. You even transferred schools.

109
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,036
And you kept saying you wanted to study medicine.

110
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,760
What’s happened to you now?

111
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,060
Yeah, Cong.

112
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,016
I think Jing Xi Chi's right.

113
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:27,520
You can't give in just because you're afraid to tell your mom you want to study medicine.

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,970
Enough about me.

115
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,280
What about you?

116
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,760
Me?

117
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,120
A captive bird like me will probably never be able to escape the cage of my mom's love.

118
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,420
What do you mean?

119
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,930
It means my mom wants me to apply to Anhui University,

120
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,380
saying it's close and convenient for her to take care of me.

121
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,640
Cong, she's teasing you.

122
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,160
Don't sow discord.

123
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,800
Cong. That's not what I meant.

124
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,930
I really think you need to think it through again.

125
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,260
I'll talk to my mom.

126
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,590
Go.

127
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,560
What about you?

128
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,340
Are you really going to give in to your mom?

129
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,370
Not really.

130
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,230
I think that Anhui University is the most suitable.

131
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,440
Besides, I didn't have any ideas about the future.

132
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,580
I was just taking things one step at a time.

133
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,740
But I didn't expect your score to be so much higher than mine.

134
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,640
Didn't Mr. Xu say that grades can't determine your life?

135
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,610
But they can decide that we have fun this summer.

136
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,400
How about we go out and have fun this weekend?

137
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,040
Sure. Where are we going?

138
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,400
Who do you want to invite?

139
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Just tell me who you don't want to invite.

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,010
I don't want to invite you.

141
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,520
Master of sarcasm.

142
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,230
- No. 
 - You're stubborn.

143
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,860
- No. 
 - Go on being stubborn.

144
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,060
- No. 
 - You're still stubborn.

145
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,060
You're back.

146
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,520
What's wrong?

147
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,430
Mom, I want to discuss university applications with you.

148
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,170
No need to discuss.

149
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,530
I've already discussed it with your dad.

150
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,460
We'll enroll you in the Medical School of Yenching University.

151
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,900
Medical school?

152
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,740
What's wrong? Haven't you always wanted to study medicine?

153
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,710
How did you know?

154
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,680
You're my son. How could I not know?

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,860
You're always secretly reading your dad's medical books.

156
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,700
I already noticed.

157
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,710
You two, father and son, really never give me a moment of peace.

158
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,740
One says he wants to quit smoking but ends up smoking secretly in the kitchen every day.

159
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,780
He doesn't even clean up the ashes after smoking.

160
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,330
The other insists on studying medicine.

161
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,030
You two teamed up to lie to me.

162
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,630
Sorry, Mom.

163
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,180
Enough.

164
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,400
Why are you apologizing?

165
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,430
Let go.

166
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,170
Let go.

167
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,920
I know why you want to stay in Tianhe.

168
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,990
I'm recovering well now.

169
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,860
I don't need you to take care of me.

170
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,400
I don't want to be a burden to any of you.

171
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,760
If you stay here for me, I will feel guilty for the rest of my life. You know?

172
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,470
Son.

173
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,780
You'll always make me proud.

174
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,860
Your world can't be limited to just this place.

175
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,230
- Mom. 
 - Don't do it.

176
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,007
   

177
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,460
   

178
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,345
Here, fruit and milk.

179
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:11,500
Drink some.

180
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,900
Rest early. Stop looking at the computer.

181
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,260
Mom.

182
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,380
Tell me which university I should apply to.

183
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,760
It's up to you. I support you no matter what.

184
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,230
Even if you repeat a year and retake the exam, I support you.

185
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,950
But you have to help me think it through!

186
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,120
Other parents are concerned about this.

187
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,593
Really?

188
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:32,620
If I make the decision, will you listen to me?

189
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,090
You can't just leave me to figure it out on my own...

190
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,160
You've grown up.

191
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,010
I trust your decision.

192
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,590
You'll definitely choose the major that suits you best.

193
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,310
With your current score, even the worst school isn't bad.

194
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,530
 Just let him study whatever he wants to study. 

195
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,960
 Enough said. Let's be realistic. 

196
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,760
 At least if he studies something medical, 

197
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,440
 I can help him build some connections. 

198
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,380
 Won't that be good? 

199
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,950
 Go and tell him then. 

200
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,740
 I won't tell him. 

201
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:25,100
   

202
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,580
   

203
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,940
   

204
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,580
   

205
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,440
 At that time, I had no idea how much impact my decision would have on my future. 

206
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,340
 And I didn't know what choices everyone else ended up making either. 

207
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:23,990
 But I think in that moment, we all followed the voice in our hearts. 

208
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,870
   

209
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,028
 My mom wants me to apply to Anhui University, 

210
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:03,500
 saying it's close and convenient for her to take care of me. 

211
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,940
   

212
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,230
I can't stand it anymore.

213
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,310
What a lousy place Jing Xi Chi picked.

214
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,440
Even cars can't get up here!

215
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,950
How is this a graduation trip?

216
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,780
Isn't this military training?

217
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,540
Qi Qi.

218
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,540
What's in your bag? It looks heavy.

219
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,710
I packed some movie DVDs...

220
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,130
Who knew we would be hiking?

221
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,950
No, I can't hike anymore.

222
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,910
I need a break.

223
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,080
I can't hike anymore either.

224
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,700
Whoever wants to hike can go ahead.

225
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,910
Let me call them to pick us up.

226
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,110
How's it going?

227
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,330
No one's picking up...

228
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,310
I'll call Li Tian.

229
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,340
I'll call Song Cong then.

230
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,500
Are we really not answering?

231
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,270
No need.

232
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,790
Would they really be fine?

233
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,073
I can guess what Chen Huan Er is going to say.

234
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:46,920
Jing Xi Chi, are you out of your mind?

235
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,140
Jing Xi Chi, what a lousy place you picked.

236
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,850
Jing Xi Chi, come pick us up.

237
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,140
We should just go pick it up.

238
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,820
Go ahead then.

239
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,050
 Jing Xi Chi, are you out of your mind? 

240
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,770
 What a lousy place you picked. 

241
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,540
 I'll give you one minute to come down and pick us up. 

242
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,390
 You hear me? 

243
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,570
 Hello? Say something. 

244
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,230
Victory is just ahead. Good luck. We'll wait for you.

245
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,860
Hello?

246
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,050
He hung up on me.

247
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,440
He's doomed.

248
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,810
When the three of them arrive, we'll set off some fireworks to surprise them.

249
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,164
- Sure. 
 - You're almost done blowing it, right?

250
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:37,460
Wash the fruits.

251
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,720
Jing Xi Chi, did you call me here just to make me do the hard labor?

252
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,760
What's the matter? You want to leave?

253
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,480
Go home and continue to be scolded?

254
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,630
Fine.

255
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,470
I'll wash them for you now.

256
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,100
See? I told you not to invite him... he's so petty.

257
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,820
All he does is whine.

258
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,320
 Jing Xi Chi, do I need to wash these oranges? 

259
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,390
Why are you washing oranges?

260
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,320
You bought oranges?

261
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,500
Isn't it Chen Huan Er's favorite?

262
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,020
You know what Chen Huan Er likes.

263
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,320
But do you know what I like?

264
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,430
I didn't know before, but now I do.

265
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,230
You like being jealous.

266
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,900
All right.

267
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,390
Cong, you and I are best bros.

268
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,430
Chen Huan Er is at most second place.

269
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,540
I know the order of "first come, first served."

270
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,200
Fine. At least you've got some loyalty.

271
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,330
My buddy will always be in my heart.

272
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,820
Could you say stuff like that when I'm not around?

273
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,160
Is it here?

274
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,710
Number 33.

275
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,710
- Let's go. 
 - We're here.

276
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,480
They're here!

277
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,710
Phone.

278
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,060
Jing Xi Chi.

279
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,100
Song Cong.

280
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,870
Li Tian.

281
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,890
Is no one here?

282
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,670
Did they seriously ditch us?

283
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,977
Jing Xi Chi must be up to something again.

284
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,340
Let's go.

285
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,340
Jing Xi Chi!

286
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,180
Jing Xi Chi.

287
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,260
Happy graduation!

288
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,150
What do you think? Are you happy?

289
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,880
Do you think it's funny?

290
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,610
Surprise!

291
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,030
Surprise!

292
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,590
Li Tian, don't just eat oranges. Help with the chores.

293
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,230
Orange peel.

294
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,480
Throw it here.

295
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,580
- Aren't we here for holiday? 
 - Let me do it.

296
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,340
After finally hiking all the way up, we still have to clean up.

297
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,560
Xin Yan, don't you usually love having everyone clean the class?

298
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,845
Now that we're all united in doing chores, you're upset?

299
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:21,530
I spent two hours putting on my makeup.

300
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,770
You put on makeup? Let me see.

301
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,620
I drew my eyebrows and wore blush and lipstick.

302
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,710
I can't tell at all.

303
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,300
Xin Yan, you're still young. Yet you're already wearing makeup.

304
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,990
What's wrong with that? We're not in high school anymore.

305
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,390
So you're now...

306
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,540
A university student.

307
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,300
A university student? Which university are you admitted to?

308
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,270
What are we then?

309
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,740
We’re... unemployed slackers.

310
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
I agree.

311
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,870
What are we eating tonight? I'm starving.

312
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,900
Work hard. Work hard and you'll have food to eat.

313
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,050
Speaking of, where did you all apply for university?

314
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,080
I applied to Subei Provincial University.

315
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,120
Did anyone apply to Subei?

316
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,680
But I'm close.

317
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,340
Medical School of Hu University.

318
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,580
Song Cong, what about you?

319
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,260
Medical School of Yenching University.

320
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,470
- Huan Er, what about you? 
 - Me?

321
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,320
I applied to Anhui University's Pharmacy.

322
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,243
Qi Qi's going to Beijing University of Political Science and Law.

323
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:30,950
Jing Xi Chi, what about you?

324
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,330
I'm the same as Cong.

325
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,260
What major? Medicine?

326
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,340
No way. I'm studying computer science.

327
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,540
Everyone's going so far away.

328
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,500
I'm here.

329
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,300
Come over and pick a movie you want to watch.

330
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,440
Qi Qi, why don't you guys pick something first?

331
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,570
I'll go cook.

332
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,040
Huan Er, don't go.

333
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,330
Don't we have a lot of food here?

334
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,730
I prepared plenty on purpose.

335
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,470
Just give me a minute.

336
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,910
In the Mood for Love.

337
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,130
Chungking Express.

338
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,290
Buddha Mountain.

339
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,720
Qi Qi, these are all art films.

340
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,330
Choose one.

341
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,670
Song Cong, what do you usually watch?

342
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,060
I don't know much about movies.

343
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
I can watch anything.

344
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,840
I'll choose then.

345
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,920
 I don't watch horror movies. 

346
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,300
 Let's watch this one. I've wanted to watch it for a long time. 

347
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,390
 Why don't we watch something else? 

348
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,740
 I think you guys are scared. 

349
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,060
 Who's scared? Let's watch it. 

350
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,570
Well... I'll go check on Huan Er.

351
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,430
Chef Chen.

352
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,810
Do you need any help?

353
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,500
What are you making? Is it edible?

354
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm not telling you.

355
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,100
We have such a good relationship, yet you won't tell me.

356
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,540
What kind of relationship?

357
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,540
Best brothers for life, obviously!

358
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,910
Then move aside, brother.

359
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,870
I wonder how Huan Er and Xi Chi are doing.

360
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,960
Let me check on them.

361
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,130
I'll check on them too.

362
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,580
Me too.

363
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,140
Pour the juice in here.

364
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,540
Wait.

365
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,276
Is that a strand of your hair?

366
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:32,890
How is it my hair?

367
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,900
- You're laughing at me? 
 - Chen Huan Er.

368
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,950
Chen... you're tough.

369
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,040
You're tough now, Chen Huan Er.

370
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,580
How dare you laugh at me?

371
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,030
Why don't you wear an apron?

372
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,580
Yes, an apron.

373
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,680
The apron is...

374
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,400
Is... is this an apron?

375
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,780
Yes, I'll wear it.

376
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,620
Wear an apron.

377
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,950
Well... can you help me tie it?

378
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,590
Sure.

379
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,630
All done.

380
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,100
All done?

381
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,430
Huan Er, what are you doing?

382
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,370
Do you need help?

383
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,540
I'm almost done.

384
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,390
Well... Jing Xi Chi, help me get the cookies out.

385
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,630
- Wear gloves. 
 - Okay.

386
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,260
What's this? I want to join too.

387
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,590
- Me too. 
 - Come in.

388
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,780
Crack the eggs first.

389
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,430
I'll teach you.

390
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,060
- Here. 
 - Okay.

391
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
- I'll put it here. 
 - Take the eggs.

392
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,640
Add it in here?

393
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,120
Yes. Then throw the trash in...

394
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,500
- You didn't wear gloves? 
 - I didn't.

395
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,580
Why didn't you wear gloves?

396
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,840
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

397
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,200
Are you okay?

398
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,830
Leave it there. Or leave it here instead.

399
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,030
Here they come, friends.

400
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,030
We're drinking this today.

401
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,060
That’s all the alcohol you brought?

402
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,670
Aren't these enough?

403
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,600
I didn't expect Xin Yan to handle her liquor so well.

404
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,570
But it's okay. We have more.

405
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,328
I don't drink this.

406
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:12,330
Drinking will only affect personal cultivation and social harmony.

407
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,820
Yes, you're right.

408
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,150
Coming.

409
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,260
Here. Put it here.

410
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,910
Here.

411
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,230
What are these?

412
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,470
Qi Qi.

413
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,600
This is yours.

414
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,430
This is a rabbit.

415
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,060
Yes, it's the rabbit you like.

416
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,260
- Looks quite similar. 
 - Xin Yan, this is yours.

417
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,700
This is a flower?

418
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,670
Yes.

419
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:43,730
I know you like roses, but I made it into a tulip.

420
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,620
It looks good.

421
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,640
Song Cong, this is yours.

422
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,140
What's this?

423
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,360
Doraemon?

424
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,040
- Yes. 
 - How is this Doraemon?

425
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,580
None of your business.

426
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,640
It's because you're always there to help everyone out, just like Doraemon. Always so reliable.

427
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,340
Chen Huan Er, making a dog bone for Li Tian

428
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,620
doesn't seem like a good idea.

429
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,570
Li Tian.

430
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,540
This elephant is for you.

431
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,870
I hope you can bravely pursue your great ambitions.

432
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,330
Thank you.

433
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,920
Is this dog bone mine?

434
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,390
Yes, it's yours.

435
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,280
I made two more. There's also a piglet.

436
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,360
- Which one? 
 - I don't want any of them.

437
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,020
- Forget it then. I'll eat them myself. 
 - I'll choose one.

438
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,600
I'll choose the piglet.

439
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,640
It really looks like you.

440
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,843
Burping and farting.

441
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:47,760
Huan Er, you put so much thought into this that I'm a little reluctant to eat it.

442
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,580
Yeah.

443
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,750
Actually, I have a lot to tell all of you.

444
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,920
I'm really envious of you for being able to go to universities

445
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,940
so far away from home.

446
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,640
I...

447
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:19,260
I want to say I hope we can always be friends and stay together.

448
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,580
Huan Er, this one's for you.

449
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,040
I get it.

450
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,390
Li Tian, here's a toast to you too.

451
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,780
- Okay. 
 - Let's toast together.

452
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,820
Together.

453
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,820
- Here. Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

454
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,190
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

455
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,610
Cheers.

456
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,340
Huan Er.

457
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,780
Look, travel's so easy these days.

458
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,510
If you ever want to see everyone, you can, anytime you want.

459
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,430
Huan Er.

460
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,020
People who really care about you won't be defeated by distance.

461
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,060
Everyone, let's not get too emotional here!

462
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,238
Here. Keep drinking. Here. Drink.

463
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,440
- Here. 
 - Wait. Wait.

464
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,900
Didn't you say you wouldn't drink

465
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,360
because you were worried it might affect your personal cultivation?

466
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,236
Why are you the one drinking the most now?

467
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,860
Alcohol really makes cowards brave.

468
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,120
Who are you calling a coward?

469
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,520
- I'm calling you a coward, Li Tian. 
 - Do you dare to drink with me?

470
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,940
What's there that I'm afraid of? Here, drink.

471
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,030
- Come on. 
 - Come on.

472
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,280
- Together. 
 - Cheers.

473
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,810
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

474
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,620
- Happy Graduation! 
 - Happy Graduation!

475
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,990
Eat one.

476
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,340
Here, Jing Xi Chi, keep drinking.

477
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,780
Hurry up.

478
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,630
- Drink. 
 - You make so much noise, Li Tian.

479
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,990
- Drink. 
 - Hurry up.

480
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,440
Shut up.

481
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,640
If you ask me, everyone here except me...

482
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,340
Everyone counts.

483
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,510
You're all cowards.

484
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,470
You think I can't see through your little schemes?

485
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,990
I'm ranked third in our class.

486
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,190
I'm smart.

487
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,200
What are you laughing at?

488
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,990
What are you laughing at?

489
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,100
You.

490
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,780
And you.

491
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,810
You.

492
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,950
And you.

493
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,130
You. And you.

494
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,230
Why are you laughing, Xin Yan?

495
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,270
You. And you.

496
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,300
- And me? 
 - Do you really think I can't tell?

497
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,370
I see through all your little schemes.

498
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,590
You didn't think you hid it well, did you?

499
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,580
Cong.

500
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,300
With all that "A, B, C" nonsense...

501
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,840
You're a coward.

502
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,860
What are you even pretending for?

503
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,890
Wait.

504
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:03,220
Is there anyone who can tell me what on earth he is talking about?

505
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,870
Li Tian, what's gotten into you?

506
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,870
What about you?

507
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,300
I...

508
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,640
A wise man never falls in love.

509
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,260
Drink with me.

510
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,390
Here. Drink.

511
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,950
It's too hot. I'm going out to get some fresh air.

512
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,990
Here. Drink.

513
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,920
I'll go with you.

514
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,120
- Let's go. 
 - Did you finish drinking yours?

515
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,380
Stop drinking.

516
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,020
What's the matter?

517
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,910
Let's go upstairs and get some fresh air.

518
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,910
Getting fresh air is a good idea.

519
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,090
Keep drinking, Jing Xi Chi.

520
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,240
No, drink later.

521
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,968
Wait for me to come back.

522
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:48,340
Are you giving up? Are you giving up?

523
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,630
Let him come with me upstairs to get some fresh air.

524
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,260
Let's drink, Xin Yan. Come on.

525
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,870
Let's drink.

526
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,820
Slow down.

527
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,710
Here. Go.

528
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:06,750
I... Cong, let me sit down for a while.

529
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,670
Sit over there.

530
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,860
- Are you okay? 
 - No.

531
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,190
Jing Xi Chi.

532
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,280
How long have we known each other?

533
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,620
Quite a long time.

534
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,790
What's wrong?

535
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,960
Then you should know what kind of person I am.

536
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:55,270
If you ask me about others, I'm really not too sure.

537
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,550
But you...

538
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:05,850
You're just a big bad wolf in sheep's clothing.

539
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,790
Yes.

540
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,350
Since I was little, I always worked hard to get what I wanted.

541
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,300
But it's different this time.

542
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,460
I've been holding back.

543
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,060
Because you're my best friend.

544
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,600
So here's a question I have to ask you.

545
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,480
Do you like Chen Huan Er?

546
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,860
Huan Er.

547
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,930
I like Song Cong.

548
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,300
Actually, I already knew.

549
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,620
Is it that obvious?

550
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,670
No, it's not.

551
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,370
Actually,

552
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,590
it's quite obvious.

553
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,470
I know.

554
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,060
Do you like Song Cong?

555
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,470
Song Cong and I?

556
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,120
We're just friends.

557
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,210
Well...

558
00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:01,190
In your eyes, are Song Cong and Jing Xi Chi the same kind of friends to you?

559
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,400
Let me ask this.

560
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,520
If Song Cong and Jing Xi Chi fell into the water at the same time,

561
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,700
who would you save first?

562
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,100
That's such a cheesy question.

563
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,280
What is this, the Stone Age?

564
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,060
Answer it seriously.

565
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,690
Well...

566
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,870
I... I will take out my phone and film them.

567
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,630
I will save whoever pays me.

568
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,270
Qi Qi.

569
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,480
Is it because of Cong that you have a grudge against me?

570
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,560
Yes, but not much.

571
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,700
It was mainly because you were so close back then. I felt like an outsider.

572
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,670
Haven't I told you about this?

573
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,170
Let's not talk about the past then.

574
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,810
What do you think of Jing Xi Chi?

575
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,390
What do you mean?

576
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,620
I mean...

577
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,650
do you think he likes you?

578
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,860
He likes me?

579
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,270
Why would he like me?

580
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,700
He and I are just buddies.

581
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,530
Are you two buddies like us?

582
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,750
How... how could we be the same?

583
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:28,300
Besides, if I liked someone... it definitely wouldn't be Chen Huan Er.

584
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,700
I'll go find her then.

585
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,830
Who are you going to find?

586
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,420
Huan Er.

587
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,060
Cong.

588
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,040
Jing Xi Chi.

589
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,940
I have something to talk to you about.

590
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,250
Chen Huan Er.

591
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,750
Cong.

592
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,080
Huan Er.

593
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,560
Well, I have something else to do.

594
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,270
Qi Qi, talk to Cong first.

595
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,180
I got to go.

596
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,530
Huan Er.

597
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,860
I have something to say to you alone.

598
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,960
You and me?

599
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,320
I'll step away then.

600
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,790
I also have something to tell you.

601
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,430
Qi Qi.

602
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,180
No, Qi—

603
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,000
What's the matter, Cong?

604
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,270
Chen Huan Er.

605
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,430
I like you.

606
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,700
What did you say?

607
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,500
You're the most optimistic and cheerful person I've ever met.

608
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,790
I've liked you for a long, long time.

609
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:49,950
I deliberately asked Song Cong questions just to get closer to you.

610
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,310
Now that the exam is over,

611
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:59,860
I want to ask you if you will be my boyfriend.

612
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,090
I should have told you this a long time ago.

613
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,120
In my eyes, you have always been the most special one.

614
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,170
Huan Er, I'm serious.

615
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:23,480
I don't want to be Doraemon and be nice to everyone.

616
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,320
I just want to be good to you.

617
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:56,560
No, Cong. I... I always thought

618
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,870
the two of us were just friends.

619
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:12,620
I think we should just stay friends.

620
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,960
I'm sorry.

621
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,140
Xin Yan.

622
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,100
Jing Xi Chi, I hate you.

623
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,250
You... don't... you...

624
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,020
I... where are you going? Liao Xin Yan.

625
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,470
Xin Yan, come back.

626
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,420
Where are you going?

627
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,850
Song Cong.

628
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,520
Qi Qi.

629
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,790
Can your matter wait until tomorrow?

630
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,250
I just want to ask you a question.

631
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,320
If it's Huan Er that you like,

632
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:56,890
why did you leave that sentence in my notebook?

633
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,750
What sentence?

634
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:05,630
I hope I can be a star in the light of your life.

635
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,100
You mean The Fountainhead?

636
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,670
I...

637
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,820
I wrote that for a friend.

638
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,340
I'm sorry.

639
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,390
 That night, I rejected Song Cong. 

640
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:52,270
 Song Cong rejected Qi Qi. 

641
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,830
 Jing Xi Chi rejected Liao Xin Yan. 

642
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:00,470
 Only Li Tian had a good chat with Shakespeare. 

643
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:05,990
Cupid is blindfolded but breaks into people's hearts.

644
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,270
Cupid.

645
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,940
Li Jian Jun.

646
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,910
I'm going to put it out there today.

647
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,480
I won't study medicine.

648
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,540
 Sure enough, it's true that a wise man doesn't fall into the river of love. 

649
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,620
 But even if there's no river of love, 

650
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:27,880
 there will always be other rivers that we need to cross ourselves.

♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

658
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:25,000
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

659
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:31,580
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

660
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:38,380
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

661
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,240
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

662
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,460
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

663
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,180
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

664
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,640
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

665
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:01,010
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

666
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:05,900
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

667
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,700
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

668
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:14,640
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

669
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,330
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

670
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,970
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

671
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,380
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

672
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:32,560
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

673
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,960
♫  At the right time  ♫
