(Happy Graduation Or Not?)

16
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:55,190
Let me throw it for you.

17
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,700
No. I can throw it myself.

18
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,220
Man,

19
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,750
do you still recognize me?

20
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,390
Song Cong,

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,270
you go back first.

22
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,180
The rubbish... I...

23
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,155
Forget it.

24
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:02,990
Man,

25
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,740
I brought you some fruit.

26
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,390
It's all your favorite.

27
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,580
Make yourself at home.

28
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,550
Okay.

29
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,670
I'm not sitting.

30
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,070
You've got a nice cozy house here.

31
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,420
Do you live alone?

32
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,900
Yes.

33
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,230
Well...

34
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,270
You... You've grown so tall.

35
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,180
I couldn't even recognize you.

36
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,830
I remember when I left,

37
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,350
you were

38
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,580
about this tall.

39
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:40,790
Well,

40
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,020
if there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

41
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,510
You...

42
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,620
What can I do for you?

43
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,950
I just want to see you, actually.

44
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,860
How... How's your job now?

45
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,844
Is everything alright?

46
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:00,950
Yes.

47
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,070
That's good.

48
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,580
Is the pay okay?

49
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,900
Can you support yourself?

50
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:07,800
Yes, I can.

51
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,950
I've got

52
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,390
a favor to ask.

53
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,230
Lately, I am

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,710
in a bit of debt.

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,590
I have no choice.

56
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,180
I can't borrow

57
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,860
from anyone.

58
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,300
Wait.

59
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,180
So you came here to ask me

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,380
for money?

61
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,620
I couldn't bring myself to say it, but

62
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,740
please help me.

63
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,940
50,000 or 100,000 yuan is fine too.

64
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,820
If not,

65
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,020
20,000 or 30,000 yuan will do.

66
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,422
50,000 or 100,000 yuan is fine too?

67
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,688
10,000 or 20,000 yuan will do.

68
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,260
It doesn't matter how much.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,150
You left me when I was

70
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,620
this little.

71
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,590
I had

72
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,620
no choice.

73
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,820
Your dad...

74
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,910
After more than 10 years,

75
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,990
you came back to me

76
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,590
for money?

77
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:07,710
Your dad had a mistress

78
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,500
at that time,

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,350
and I couldn't live with him.

80
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,790
I had no choice.

81
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,260
I don't know what to say.

82
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,060
I've been

83
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,910
thinking of you all these years.

84
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,260
Don't blame me.

85
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,060
One month.

86
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,644
I'll definitely pay you back in a month.

87
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:24,740
When you came in,

88
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,350
I thought you just wanted

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,940
to see how your daughter

90
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,500
was doing...

91
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,030
I wanted to see you.

92
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,022
And how she settled in.

93
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,860
I wanted to see you.

94
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,266
I was too embarrassed to come.

95
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:39,860
I...

96
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,670
I really thought

97
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,940
you were here to care about me.

98
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,110
I...

99
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,030
I was afraid to come and see you.

100
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,180
You shouldn't have come to see me.

101
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,230
How can you have the face
to come and see me?

102
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,910
Have you ever cared about me?
I'm asking you.

103
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,060
Man.

104
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,288
Have you ever cared about me?

105
00:05:59,311 --> 00:05:59,977
Man.

106
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:00,888
Don't touch me!

107
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,820
Sorry, I'm wrong.

108
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,620
Don't touch me!

109
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm really wrong.

110
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,910
Stay away from me.

111
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,110
Do you hate me so much?

112
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,820
- Let me touch you.
- Don't touch me!

113
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,110
I'm really wrong.

114
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,260
Do you hate me so much?

115
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,180
- Let me touch you.
- Don't touch me!

116
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,910
How can you

117
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,470
forgive me?

118
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,550
I...

119
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,740
I... I'll come and cook
for you every day,

120
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,620
okay?

121
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,150
I've been thinking about you.

122
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,500
Leave.

123
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,420
Leave!

124
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,180
Leave!

125
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,470
Keep the fruits and have them.

126
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,140
Are you okay?

127
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:24,977
You heard everything?

128
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,540
Not really.

129
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,020
So

130
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,070
the lady just now is...

131
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,470
My mom.

132
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:38,533
I've never heard you mention your mom.

133
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,140
Not on good terms?

134
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,860
In over ten years,

135
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:46,711
this is the first time
we've seen each other.

136
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,470
When I was a kid, my family was poor

137
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,740
and every time I passed a claw machine,

138
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
I wanted to play it.

139
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,710
But my mom always told me

140
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,540
those were all cheats.

141
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,620
No matter how many coins I put in,

142
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,755
I couldn't catch anything.

143
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,710
Then one time I cried so hard,

144
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,190
that she comforted me and said

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,977
she'd bring me there on my birthday

146
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,350
for a good time.

147
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,900
But she left

148
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,590
before then

149
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,540
and never came back.

150
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,830
For years after she left,

151
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,110
I was asking for my mom

152
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,140
every day.

153
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,500
Then, my dad

154
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,830
couldn't do anything about it,

155
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,422
so he brought me there to catch dolls.

156
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,350
He told me

157
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,860
he'd take me to my mom

158
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,140
if I could catch one.

159
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Did you catch it?

160
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,430
No.

161
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:04,022
But it doesn't really matter.

162
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,430
Why?

163
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,990
Because my dad told me

164
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,430
she ran off with someone else.

165
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,230
But today, she

166
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,860
came to me and told me

167
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,430
that my dad was at fault first.

168
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,260
I'm confused.

169
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,380
So she came over here today
to tell you that?

170
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,260
No.

171
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,740
She said she had some

172
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,070
business difficulties

173
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,260
and needed money.

174
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,110
Funny, right?

175
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,710
In our first meeting,

176
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,260
she actually came to ask me for money.

177
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,470
Anyway,

178
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,260
whether you admit it or not,

179
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,470
you must still care about her.

180
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:05,950
How about this?

181
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,870
You go and play the claw machine again.

182
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:13,466
If you catch one this time,

183
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,500
go and have a nice chat with her.

184
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,590
When I couldn't catch a doll,

185
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:43,430
I thought I was unlucky

186
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,190
and couldn't get

187
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,500
what I wanted.

188
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,620
Now I've figured it out.

189
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,140
If something doesn't belong to me,

190
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,430
then I don't want it.

191
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,133
Instead of wasting my time with someone

192
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,266
who doesn't deserve it,

193
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,990
I'll trade it

194
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,310
for something that makes me happy.

195
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,533
Thanks for buying me a Coke.

196
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,900
(Four years of university)

197
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,400
(has really come to an end
with these papers.)

198
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,380
As soon as the thesis debate ended,

199
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,044
it seemed that the graduation mood

200
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,350
hit us all at once.

201
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,190
Times flies.

202
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,070
In a flash, we'll all

203
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,310
be going our separate ways.

204
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,620
These four years of university

205
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,830
have been the easiest

206
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,860
and most enjoyable

207
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,070
of my school life.

208
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,660
Easiest and most enjoyable?

209
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,070
Have you forgotten

210
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,911
when you were struggling
with Advanced Math?

211
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,140
That's you.

212
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,644
I passed the test at a close call

213
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,600
and was the lucky girl.

214
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,500
You're just like me.

215
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,540
I'll bite you.

216
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,111
Say that again if you dare.

217
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,310
How about you, Huixin?

218
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,350
You and Zhou Ye...

219
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:20,430
We haven't broken up yet.

220
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,190
But maybe soon.

221
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,020
I still don't understand.

222
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:25,830
Huixin,

223
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,780
you're obviously so good

224
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,830
that you deserve a bigger city,

225
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,110
and a better stage.

226
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,110
Why are you all looking like this?

227
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,380
Like I'm going to be married off
to the mountains.

228
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,830
It's not as bad as it is in my hometown.

229
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,710
It's a good city to live in.

230
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,380
I'll work in the pharmaceutical company
as a researcher.

231
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,622
It's a good way
to put my studies to good use.

232
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,844
Then you'll have to come
to Wu'an more often

233
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,222
or we'll all come to you.

234
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,430
Then you must come to see me too.

235
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,860
Or I'll get angry.

236
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,540
Sure, Li.

237
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,950
Alright, get some sleep.

238
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,355
You guys go ahead and sleep.

239
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,140
Get some rest.

240
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,020
Right,

241
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,710
when will Jing come back?

242
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,950
Will he come back

243
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,177
for your graduation photos?

244
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,740
He's been busy

245
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,140
with the website launch lately.

246
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,990
I don't know if he'll have time.

247
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,020
Alright,

248
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,177
let's go to bed.

249
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,230
Can you do it?

250
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,110
I can.

251
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,230
Look, is it perfect?

252
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,190
Right?

253
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:41,470
I'll leave it to you.

254
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,710
Okay, no problem.

255
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,990
Huan'er.

256
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,755
Where is Jing? Is he not coming?

257
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,230
Maybe he can't make it.

258
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,511
Alright. Let's not wait for him.

259
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,020
Take photos.

260
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,830
Zhang Yang.

261
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,870
Come on, let's take graduation photos.

262
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,230
Let's take graduation photos.

263
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,620
Huan'er,

264
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,620
smile.

265
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,500
Be happy.

266
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,620
Come on.

267
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,990
Get ready.

268
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,350
Okay, ready.

269
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,350
Look at here.

270
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,900
Why are you so slow?

271
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:23,190
You'll get a beating.

272
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,500
Ready.

273
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,740
Gather

274
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,590
to the middle.

275
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,990
Come on, get ready.

276
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,830
Alright, ready.

277
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,740
Three, two, one.

278
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,500
Chen Huan'er, happy graduation!

279
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,540
(Compared to the chaos
of the rest of the world,)

280
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,950
(my graduation season)

281
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,266
(is going very smoothly.)

282
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,540
(Jing Xichi's appearance)

283
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,710
(also brought my university life)

284
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,230
(to a perfect closure.)

285
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,110
One, two, three.

286
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,660
Happy graduation!

287
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,060
(As for why Jing Xichi)

288
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,060
(was able to come back
for the graduation photos?)

289
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,340
(I heard it's because things
have been reversed.)

290
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,300

291
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,752
(Huandao Technology)

292
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,470
Five...

293
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,950
(Yangwu, Secondhand Book Trading Site)
Four, three,

294
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:51,990
two,

295
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,060
one.

296
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,390
It's passed.

297
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,340
Our project is officially live!

298
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,100
Go, go.

299
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,780
Come on.

300
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,580
Congratulations.

301
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,822
Thanks for your hard work.

302
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,100
Thanks for your hard work.

303
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,300
Actually,

304
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,000
it's been a hard time for all of you.

305
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,820
This is now the result

306
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,100
of all of us working together.

307
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,950
Thanks!

308
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,133
Thanks for your hard work.

309
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,990
Jing,

310
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:31,540
I'll formally introduce you to him.

311
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,860
The project leader of Huandao Science
and Technology Department

312
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:35,020
who is also one of the founders,

313
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,780
Dr. Gong Hongliang.

314
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,800
You may call him Mr. Gong.

315
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,580
Hi, Mr. Gong.

316
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,710
Just call me Dr. Gong.

317
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,820
I was a tech major too.

318
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:41,950
You're Jing, right?

319
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,870
Before I came here,
I heard from Jiang Sen

320
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,620
that you're still
in undergraduate studies.

321
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:48,000
What a young talent.

322
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,020
Congratulations.

323
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,580
Young man,

324
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,100
you'll have a bright future.

325
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,100
You flatter me.

326
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,540
- Happy graduation!
- Happy graduation!

327
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,020
I've finally graduated.

328
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:07,150
Chen Huan'er, congratulations on getting
into the graduate school

329
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,430
of your favorite tutor.

330
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,060
And congratulations to you.

331
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,377
Congratulations on the successful launch
of your project

332
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:13,955
with more than 500,000 users.

333
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:15,820
Dig in now.

334
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,500
Okay.

335
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,300
Come on, give me your bowl.

336
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:24,400
Here you go.

337
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,230
I'm going back

338
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,820
to Tianhe in a few days.

339
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,430
I've learned

340
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:34,990
a few Cantonese Stewed Soups
from Li.

341
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,377
I've bought all the ingredients

342
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,755
and I'll show you in a few days.

343
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,540
But if you want it,

344
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,710
you have to make a deal.

345
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:43,430
You have to wash your socks by yourself

346
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,710
and on time.

347
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,540
I hope you'll carefully consider

348
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
the company's decision

349
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,870
to bring Yangwu

350
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,355
to the headquarters in Jing City.

351
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,990
There are talents and markets.

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,533
There are more opportunities
for cooperation and exchange.

353
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,300
You should know

354
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:57,300
that compared to Wu'an,

355
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,670
you and Yangwu

356
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,950
will have a bigger stage

357
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,780
and development in Jing City.

358
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:07,950
Huan'er,

359
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,390
I have something

360
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,470
to discuss with you.

361
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,340
What's it? Say it.

362
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,950
The headquarters thinks highly of Yangwu

363
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,340
and wants me to bring the project
to join them.

364
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,533
They asked me to meet with them

365
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,044
at the company this weekend.

366
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,540
Isn't that a good thing?

367
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,540
Jing Xichi,

368
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,066
you've made a name for yourself.

369
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:34,622
You're on your way to the top.

370
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:37,422
The headquarters is in Jing City.

371
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,260
Well,

372
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,740
what do you think?

373
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,820
I'm not sure now.

374
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:57,822
But the opportunity
is certainly a good one.

375
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,470
Look,

376
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,580
Mr. Jiang,

377
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,780
Fu Ying,

378
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,740
and Zhou Ye

379
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,688
want me to think about it carefully.

380
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,390
But if I do decide

381
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,340
to go,

382
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,630
it's not three months away...

383
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,060
It's three years.

384
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,190
Let's flip a coin and decide.

385
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,540
Are you serious?

386
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,266
Aren't you going to Jing City
for an interview?

387
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,340
Front side means going by plane.

388
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:39,844
And on the other side
means going by train.

389
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,870
I'll go with you.

390
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,150
Whatever you choose,

391
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:45,133
you'll have to go and see it, won't you?

392
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,870
If something goes wrong,

393
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,150
we'll run immediately.

394
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,020
Okay?

395
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,230
Let's try it.

396
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,780
By plane or by train?

397
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,020
It's plane.

398
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,710
It's expensive.

399
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,780
Why don't we take a train?

400
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,740
Take a plane.

401
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,190
Let's take a train.

402
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,910
The train would be nice.

403
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,470
By train, I can still

404
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,340
see the sights with you on the way.

405
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,500
I didn't expect
your company headquarters

406
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,950
to be so big and luxurious.

407
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,820
Right?

408
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,490
This is the first time I've seen it too.

409
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,260
Jing City is a big city indeed.

410
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,580
Don't you think I'm a bit sloppy

411
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,060
in this outfit today?

412
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,870
It's alright. Take it easy.

413
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,670
Go upstairs.

414
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:46,644
Aren't you coming with me?

415
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,540
Take this.

416
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,540
I'll wait for you here.

417
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:53,470
I'll get going now.

418
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:54,950
Go.

419
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,022
I'll be right back.

420
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,500
Bye.

421
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,430
Piggy Jing, go for it.

422
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,088
I can do it.

423
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,910
We meet again, Jing.

424
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,340
Mr. Gong,

425
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,430
thank you for taking time out

426
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,060
of your busy schedule to see me.

427
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,990
Jing, what have you thought

428
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,260
about my offer?

429
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,950
Thank you.

430
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:29,990
Mr. Gong,

431
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,260
well,

432
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,780
I'm still considering it.

433
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,780
It's okay.

434
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,910
I've invited you here

435
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,630
so you can see

436
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,100
the Huandao headquarters

437
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,740
and learn about

438
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,740
our business structure.

439
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:44,555
But you have to make a decision soon.

440
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,150
As you can see,

441
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:48,100
there are so many applicants out there

442
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,470
trying to get in.

443
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,020
Sorry.

444
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,430
I'll take a call.

445
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,100
Wait a minute.

446
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,430
Okay.

447
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,340
(Are you done?)

448
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,000
You've been waiting impatiently,
haven't you?

449
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,800
I was just about to send you a message.

450
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,630
Did you go to a tech company

451
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,911
or the cave of a silken web?

452
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:56,177
It took you so long.

453
00:24:56,222 --> 00:24:57,340
The cave of a silken web?

454
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,390
How is it?

455
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:01,100
I spent the afternoon
listening to them describe

456
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,150
their business

457
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,020
and their strategy

458
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,820
for the future.

459
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,060
A big company is different indeed.

460
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,430
Their business and layout

461
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,430
really opened my eyes.

462
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,150
Well,

463
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,820
have you decided to stay?

464
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Not yet.

465
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,740
But I do think

466
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,990
Yangwu would have got
a better development

467
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,580
if it was

468
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,630
in the headquarters.

469
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,300
That's true.

470
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,710
What's wrong?

471
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,950
Nothing.

472
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,060
I...

473
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,100
I think

474
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,690
Jing City is quite big.

475
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,580
Let's go back.

476
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,200
You're thinking of going back now?

477
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,710
We're meeting Du Man and Song Cong
for hot pot tonight.

478
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:10,666
You have forgotten about it?

479
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:11,870
Yes.

480
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:13,390
I was too busy.

481
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,430
Let's go.

482
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,430
Come on, quick.

483
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:16,340
Have they arrived?

484
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,100
Yes, they have.

485
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
I've sent them a message

486
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,444
asking them to wait for us.

487
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,870
Add the vegetables.

488
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,780
This too.

489
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,670
Man.

490
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,580
Song.

491
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,190
Come on.

492
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,990
It's almost cooked.

493
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,780
I'm starving.

494
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,260
Come on.

495
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,422
Are you tired of interning now?

496
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:31,820
A little.

497
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,800
Let me have a bite first.

498
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,870
Come on, have some meat.

499
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,910
It smells so good.

500
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,670
I spend every day

501
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,870
in the hospital.

502
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:38,190
I even smell the disinfectant

503
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,260
in this hot pot now.

504
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,820
Dr. Du

505
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,500
studies hard when she's studying,

506
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,990
works hard when she's working,

507
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,630
and is a top student everywhere.

508
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,430
Dr. Song, with you around,

509
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,020
I'm always the second best.

510
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,150
Enough.

511
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,740
You're high achievers.

512
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,644
It looks like I'm destined
to be surrounded

513
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:55,190
by you geniuses for the rest of my life.

514
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,000
You flatter us.

515
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,820
Maybe you'll be the first one among us

516
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,888
to achieve your goal.

517
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,710
Then I'll

518
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
hire you high achievers

519
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,630
to work for me.

520
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,870
Who's working for who?

521
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,020
I'll work for you.

522
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:08,060
You want some vinegar?

523
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,020
I want a Coke.

524
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,500
When are you getting married?

525
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,300
Who's marrying him?

526
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,740
Chen Huan'er,

527
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,630
we're at outside.

528
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,990
Can you save me some face?

529
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:29,488
Come on.

530
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,990
Have a bite.

531
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:34,355
Come on, open your mouth.

532
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,390
Dig in.

533
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:42,100
Have they always been like this?

534
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:45,300
They've already restrained themselves.

535
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:48,222
You didn't see how mushy they were
when they first got together.

536
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:49,230
This is good.

537
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,430
Not bad.

538
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:53,340
Stop chatting, guys.

539
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,020
Cheers.

540
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:54,470
Come on.

541
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,100
Cheers.

542
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,820
Cheers.

543
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,740
Welcome.

544
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,470
Thank you.

545
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,540
It's on me today.

546
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,740
I'll order more.

547
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,470
Go ahead.

548
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,020
(Man,)

549
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,910
(I was wrong last time.)

550
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,340
(I'm sorry.)

551
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:20,740
(I won't borrow money from you anymore.)

552
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,190
(As long as you're well,)

553
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,870
(I'm happy.)

554
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:26,950
Man,

555
00:28:27,977 --> 00:28:30,066
it's been a long time since we last met.

556
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:32,333
You're not going
to have a nice chat with me?

557
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,150
What do you want to ask again?

558
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,990
Go ahead.

559
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,060
I'll ask

560
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,470
but you can't be mad.

561
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,230
Is it a coincidence

562
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,670
that you and Song

563
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,670
live next door to each other?

564
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,340
24K pure coincidence.

565
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,470
But to be honest,

566
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,100
you and Du Man

567
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,390
have an amazing destiny.

568
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,020
You went to high school together,

569
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,540
then university together,

570
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:06,670
and now that you graduated,

571
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,340
you're interning

572
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,470
at the same hospital.

573
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,500
What's the word now?

574
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,150
It's called

575
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,060
a mutual pursuit.

576
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,470
Isn't that you two?

577
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,340
All we can

578
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,780
think about now is work.

579
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,150
Enough.

580
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,740
I know you very well.

581
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,870
Is there something new going on

582
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,333
at your new hospital?

583
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:26,570
Are you asking for a beating?

584
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,333
I'll stop asking.

585
00:29:27,422 --> 00:29:28,260
I'll stop asking.

586
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,020
How was your visit

587
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,190
to Huandao today?

588
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:39,230
I haven't thought about it yet.

589
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,000
But I've been listening to them

590
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,660
introducing their structure
all afternoon.

591
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,500
I think

592
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,820
it might not be a bad thing

593
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,430
to bring Yangwu

594
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,470
to Jing City.

595
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,020
If you really want to come,

596
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,100
you can stay with me first.

597
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,630
The rent here is not cheap.

598
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,622
Let's talk about it later.

599
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:58,300
By the way,

600
00:29:58,956 --> 00:29:59,950
did you talk to Huan'er?

601
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,230
What does she think?

602
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,230
Yangwu is his heart and soul.

603
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,500
Of course I have to support him.

604
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,100
But...

605
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,020
It's just that he and I

606
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,020
were never that far apart.

607
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,820
So you're afraid

608
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,100
you won't pass

609
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,020
this first trial?

610
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,540
I'm sure I can handle it.

611
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,500
I'm mostly worried about Huan'er.

612
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,580
I can sense

613
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,150
that she's afraid that our relationship
will fade if we're far apart.

614
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,430
Have you ever thought
about why you created Yangwu?

615
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,870
I did it

616
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,150
in the first place to sell

617
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,555
our high school revision materials,

618
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,422
didn't I?

619
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,020
Who knew

620
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,710
it could be possible?

621
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,710
I now think

622
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,020
that if there's a chance

623
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,540
to give my mom

624
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,100
and Huan'er a better life

625
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,910
through Yangwu,

626
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,100
why not?

627
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,540
I need to make money.

628
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,670
You're looking out for them,

629
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,710
but they're hoping

630
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,630
you'll be better.

631
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,780
Instead of making money,

632
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,430
they want you to go after

633
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,740
what you really want.

634
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,870
I don't know anything
about relationships.

635
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,340
But I think

636
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,060
all relationships

637
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,260
should be mutual,

638
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,060
no matter if it's a family member

639
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,470
or a lover.

640
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,100
Mutual tolerance,

641
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,500
and mutual trust.

642
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,910
I think

643
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,430
this is the meaning

644
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,540
of an intimate relationship?

645
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,430
I agree with you.

646
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,470
Thank you, Du Man.

647
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
What's the thanks?

648
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,580
Sleep early.

649
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:05,630
Okay, let's sleep early.

650
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,260
Let's sleep.

651
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:07,630
I'll turn off the light.

652
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,230
Good night.

653
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,100
Good night.

654
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,860
(Song Cong: I'm done here.
How's your side?)

655
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,340
(I'm done too.)

656
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,140
(Bank Card Transfer)

657
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,940
(Confirm Transfer, Yes)

658
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,311
(Successfully Transferred 25,000 yuan)

659
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,190
We're going back to Wu'an tomorrow.

660
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:01,288
Is there anywhere else you'd like to go?

661
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:08,990
What's wrong?

662
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,150
Jing Xichi,

663
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,100
you should stay.

664
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,470
If you come back to Wu'an with me,

665
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,260
you'll have regrets.

666
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,630
But I don't want those regrets

667
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,950
to be because of me.

668
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,820
What if

669
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,230
I make the wrong choice?

670
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,060
If it's wrong,

671
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,020
we'll correct it together.

672
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,580
We're still young.

673
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,260
We still have time,

674
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,020
right?

675
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:18,830
I'll pack some thick coats

676
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,990
for you.

677
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,100
Remember to wear it at night
when you're there.

678
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:23,666
Large diurnal temperature variation.

679
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:25,511
You have to remember to wear coats.

680
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,140
Is this T-shirt okay?

681
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,430
I'll pack it for you.

682
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,990
You've been transferred

683
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,350
suddenly.

684
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,310
Without prior notice...

685
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,100
So sudden.

686
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,870
I told you to take this jumper with you.

687
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,620
Why did you come

688
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,700
and hang it up here?

689
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:42,711
What are you doing?

690
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:43,660
Just reporting for duty.

691
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,220
I don't need all that stuff.

692
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,060
Remember to eat more.

693
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,470
What's wrong?

694
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,830
I'll come to see you

695
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,310
once I'm off on May 1st, okay?

696
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,140
What are you doing? Stop it.

697
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,830
Coming.

698
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,180
I'm here.

699
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,500
Leave it to me.

700
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,044
I can do it.

701
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:53,600
Let me do it.

702
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,270
Where are shoes?

703
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,020
Here.

704
00:35:55,044 --> 00:35:55,955
Change them yourselves.

705
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:57,266
You've got it all ready?

706
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,111
You're heading out?

707
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,180
I'm going to work.

708
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,620
Okay.

709
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,177
Here you go.

710
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,311
I put the key here for you.

711
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:01,933
Help yourself.

712
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,350
Okay.

713
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,910
I'm leaving.

714
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,350
Bye.

715
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:15,377
I'd like to introduce you
to these three

716
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:17,540
from the Wu'an Yangwu team.

717
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,270
Jing Xichi,

718
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,100
Fu Ying,

719
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,910
and Zhou Ye.

720
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,310
Today you are

721
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,830
officially joining our family.

722
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,350
First of all, I would like to thank
Mr. Gong for appreciating Yangwu

723
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,990
and giving our team a chance

724
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,020
to learn

725
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,540
from so many excellent seniors.

726
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,620
I hope we can work together happily
in the future.

727
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,470
Thank you.

728
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,750
Let's save the formalities

729
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,990
for later.

730
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,310
Next, let me introduce

731
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,470
the future development plan of Yangwu.

732
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,270
We are going to expand

733
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,580
the business scale of Yangwu.

734
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,020
Yangwu used

735
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:54,380
to be a second-hand book dealer.

736
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,350
Now we are ready to merge

737
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,430
with publishers' direct sales of e-books

738
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,700
and physical books.

739
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,020
By the end of this year,

740
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:05,022
we'll complete the transformation
to selling all kinds of books.

741
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:05,540
I've already

742
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,870
gone through this plan.

743
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,500
I've also presented it
to our planning team.

744
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:10,873
It's

745
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,620
very likely

746
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,750
to be approved.

747
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,470
This plan...

748
00:37:16,664 --> 00:37:19,224
In response to today's discussion,

749
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:20,430
hand it over to the teams.

750
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,060
Mr. Gong.

751
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,700
Let them...

752
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:23,100
Get back to your work.

753
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,910
Mr. Gong,

754
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,790
the plan you just mentioned

755
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,470
seems to be a bit different

756
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,430
from what you told us

757
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,700
at the beginning.

758
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,660
This plan

759
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,177
is the result of the joint research

760
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:35,100
of several colleagues

761
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,777
with rich experience in related products

762
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:37,660
at the headquarters,

763
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,990
which can be said

764
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,660
to be very perfect and mature.

765
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,870
I know.

766
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,500
But if we

767
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,310
revise it according to this plan,

768
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,870
Yangwu will lose its features

769
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,140
and blur the distinction

770
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,580
between it and other competitors.

771
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,430
Jing,

772
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,866
I'm really optimistic about Yangwu.

773
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,870
But you've seen the limitations

774
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,660
of Yangwu.

775
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,100
If we don't transform it,

776
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:57,180
with its daily activity,

777
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,430
it's hard to break through.

778
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,430
I'm sure you don't want to see

779
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:02,644
it stop being
a half-formed product, right?

780
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,950
Mr. Gong.

781
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,020
Mr. Gong,

782
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:10,870
well,

783
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,350
if I could give you a

784
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,270
better plan,

785
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,140
would you consider

786
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,430
not transforming first?

787
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,580
Jing, I admire you.

788
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,430
But in business,

789
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,220
a company needs a product
to make a profit.

790
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,733
You've read the terms and conditions

791
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:26,060
of the acquisition by Huandao, right?

792
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,430
The headquarters has the right
to make decisions.

793
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,870
I know.

794
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,577
But I still don't want to go back
on my original intention

795
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,910
of making it in the first place.

796
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,950
Alright, tell me.

797
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,644
What's your original intention?

798
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,910
Mr. Gong,

799
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,060
sorry,

800
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,020
I can't answer you right now.

801
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:50,470
But definitely not

802
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,060
turning it into a selling platform.

803
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,620
Can you give me a few days?

804
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:57,100
I will definitely give you an answer.

805
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,430
Okay.

806
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,060
I'll give you half a month

807
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,180
but you need to give me

808
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,688
a plan that will convince everyone.

809
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:04,180
Okay.

810
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,020
But if you can't convince
the decision-making team,

811
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,430
you'll have to leave Huandao.

812
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,270
Think about it.

813
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,430
Opportunities come with risks and costs.

814
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,430
Come on.

815
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,660
Professor Qiu.

816
00:39:43,844 --> 00:39:45,100
Let me introduce her to you.

817
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,000
This is my postgraduate student
this year,

818
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,910
Chen Huan'er.

819
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,870
She's from our school too.

820
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,430
This is Gao Ang.

821
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,430
It's your senior
who's in the first year of his PhD.

822
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,620
From now on,

823
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:56,990
if you have any questions,

824
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,870
ask him.

825
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,700
Hi, Gao Ang.

826
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,620
Hi.

827
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,470
Gao Ang,

828
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,060
lead Huan'er.

829
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,660
Don't worry, sir.

830
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,430
Do your work.

831
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,140
Okay.

832
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,311
Thank you, Professor Qiu.

833
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Sit here.

834
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,350
Okay.

835
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,470
I'll help you pick a good spot

836
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,390
when we're really
in the experimental phase.

837
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,350
Okay.

838
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,430
Huan'er,

839
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,990
I heard you went to the lab today.

840
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,700
How did you know?

841
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,700
Gao Ang told me.

842
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,660
I was going to go today,

843
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,540
but something came up

844
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,600
and I took the day off.

845
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,100
You wanted to go too?

846
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,180
We're in the same lab.

847
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,100
I'm here to tell you

848
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,750
that we'll meet again,

849
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,790
so

850
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,140
I hope

851
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,310
you don't mind.

852
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,990
Mind what?

853
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,470
We used to...

854
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,620
We didn't

855
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,830
have anything before.

856
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,660
You're thinking too much.

857
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,990
That's good.

858
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,060
I'll be going.

859
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,700
Okay.

860
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,830
According to the current data,

861
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,180
the biggest bottleneck of Yangwu

862
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:45,666
is due to the low user viscosity
caused by the single service.

863
00:41:45,688 --> 00:41:47,750
So even if the number
of registrants increases,

864
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,933
it won't solve the problem
of the number of visitors.

865
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,100
But our website

866
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,200
is at most a marketplace
for second-hand books.

867
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:56,140
Who would have nothing better to do

868
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,990
than to visit
a second-hand bookstore every day?

869
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,540
Among all of our users,

870
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,100
the frequency

871
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,060
of visits is not high,

872
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,270
but some of them

873
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,220
can maintain

874
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,140
a frequency of one
to three visits a day.

875
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,430
I suggest to do a research

876
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:08,839
to analyze the users' psychology.

877
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,450
Then based on the results
of the research

878
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,377
to discuss how to improve
the user viscosity.

879
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,060
Jing,

880
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,700
you really want

881
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,750
to go against the leaders?

882
00:42:17,644 --> 00:42:18,700
After all, I created

883
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,910
Yangwu with my own hands.

884
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,430
I don't want to give it away.

885
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,430
Besides,

886
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,430
how can we know if we don't try?

887
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,140
What do you think?

888
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:32,660
I...

889
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,777
Of course I'm okay with it.

890
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:34,444
I'm with you.

891
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,830
Anyway,

892
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,220
if I really

893
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,430
lose my job because of this,

894
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,500
you're responsible for me.

895
00:42:41,822 --> 00:42:43,111
Fu Ying, what do you think?

896
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:44,533
You won't be responsible for me.

897
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,022
You can't afford to support me.

898
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,620
Get to work.
