00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:20,950


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,930
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:59,360
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,170
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 	♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,350
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver.  ♫

15
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,260
   

16
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,700
   

18
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,220
Jing.

19
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,670
 Hello? What's the matter? 

20
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,990
What are you doing?

21
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,620
 I just got back to the dorm. 

22
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,070
How are you after joining a big company?

23
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,900
 I'm all right. 

24
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,830
Why does your tone sound a little down?

25
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,010
I just have a small problem.

26
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,300
Currently, the company wants Yangwu to transform.

27
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,650
Transform?

28
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,790
But that’s not what they said when they brought you in.

29
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,250
 Why the sudden transformation? 

30
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,420
From the company's perspective, projects are about making money.

31
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,110
I can understand that, but I don't want to compromise.

32
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,890
Don't compromise then.

33
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,140
I believe in you.

34
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,230
Got it.

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,700
How about you? How are you?

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,110
 Me? 

37
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm fine.

38
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,830
I ran into Tian Chi just now.

39
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,870
 We're under the same supervisor. 

40
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,888
 Maybe we'll do experiments together in the future. 

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,660
Do your experiments then.

42
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,180
Would you mind?

43
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,833
- If you mind, then... 
  - I'm not that stingy. 

44
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:28,290
As long as it's good for your studies, I support it.

45
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,066
- Okay. 
  - All right. 

46
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,230
I'll go back to work now.

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,005
Take care of yourself. Don't exhaust yourself.

48
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,130
- You too. 
  - I love you. 

49
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,350
Love you too.

50
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,660
- Bye. 
  - Bye. 

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,835
Senior Gao.

52
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:47,555
I've sorted out the data you want.

53
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,411
- I'll leave it here. 
 - Okay.

54
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,480
By the way, Chen, did you collect the packages?

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,650
They're here. Here.

56
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,670
Check this out.

57
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,111
Help me check the thesis data.

58
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,844
Get it to me as soon as possible.

59
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:03,740
Also, help me organize my petri dish observation records from the next two weeks.

60
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,180
- Sure. 
 - And help me write two research reports.

61
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,120
Make sure there are no typos.

62
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,260
Senior Gao.

63
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,500
That's inappropriate.

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,820
You have to write it yourself.

65
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,380
Just write it when you're told to.

66
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,000
But this is against the rules.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,043
I'll do everything else you ask me to do.

68
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:32,420
But if this matter is discovered, we'll all get criticized.

69
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,400
What do you want then?

70
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,670
Sorry, Senior Gao. I can't help you with this.

71
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,380
I'm really sorry.

72
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:53,110
Senior Gao.

73
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,990
Huan Er didn't mean to offend you.

74
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,350
She just speaks her mind.

75
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,550
Don't take it to heart.

76
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,820
Tian Chi,

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,577
what's your business here?

78
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:05,440
How about this? I'll help you when I'm done.

79
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,110
You'll help me do it?

80
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,830
Did I assign it to you or to her?

81
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,590
Why can others do it but she can't?

82
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,688
She's a girl. Take extra care of her.

83
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,522
So what if she's a girl?

84
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,550
If you think the work I arranged is unreasonable, you can talk to the professor.

85
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,260
Senior Gao. That's not what I meant.

86
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,911
Enough. You don't need to attend the clinical pharmacy forum at the end of the year.

87
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,816
- Why? 
 - You tell me.

88
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:35,030
Because you have to take care of your junior!

89
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,940
Take good care of her.

90
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,640
 I still remember how ambitious we were when we first entered the campus, 

91
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,620
 until we lost our shelter and really embarked on the journey. 

92
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,060
I'm leaving.

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,740
 Facing the reality of life, I realized how naive I was at that time. 

94
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,690
 There's no other place that can tolerate us as unconditionally 

95
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,590
 as home and school. 
   

96
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,790
 We stumble as we experience the inevitable path of growth. 

97
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,150
 Not only in work, but also in relationships. 

98
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,590
What is it? You're acting all mysterious.

99
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,280
You can find out when you open it.

100
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,820
What's all this?

101
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,260
Why did you send these to me?

102
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,300
 I'm afraid that you'll miss me. 

103
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,670
 All's good now. 

104
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,820
 You can see me around you when you open your eyes. 

105
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,540
♫  You are my blue  ♫

106
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,680

132
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,430
Hello?

133
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,360
 Hello? Is this Du Man? 

134
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,498
Yes.

135
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:11,500
 This is Jing City's Tinghu District Police Station. 

136
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,510
 Do you know Zhang Wan Fang? 

137
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,380
Thank you.

138
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,420
Don't you think I'm stupid?

139
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,730
She deceived me with just a few words.

140
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,590
I even gave her all my savings.

141
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,190
It's her fault, not yours.

142
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,680
That's why people should be more rational.

143
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,430
Do you want to try again?

144
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,900
Try again.

145
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,640
Yes!

146
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,660
 Only after growing up do we understand that we're just ordinary people in life. 

147
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,500
 Right and wrong sometimes become blurred. 

148
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,920
 And some answers don't seem that important. 

149
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:43,780
   

150
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:52,880
Thank you for telling me so many things.

151
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,488
Do you think there's anything that can be improved on our website?

152
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:57,730
 What's wrong with you? 

153
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,110
 Don't you see what time it is? 

154
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,830
Sorry.

155
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:06,677
   

156
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,940
   

157
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,900
Xi Chi.

158
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,422
We only have this left to call.

159
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,188
Let's stop here today.

160
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:23,500
It's too late. We'll disturb people.

161
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,130
Besides, we've basically gone through all the users.

162
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,890
Most of them are owners of second-hand bookstores.

163
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,950
They have no real value.

164
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,330
I have an interesting one here.

165
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,410
Highly active, but doesn't have a lot of transactions. They mostly buy niche books.

166
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,111
I'll send it to the group for you to take a look.

167
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,020
The final decision-making meeting is just around the corner.

168
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,500
We haven't gotten any idea yet.

169
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,111
Are we packing up and leaving just after joining?

170
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,055
It's late.

171
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:54,955
Let's take a break first.

172
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,140
Goodbye, Fu Ying.

173
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,120
Light Messenger?

174
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,340
What a pretentious name.

175
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,830
Xi Chi, are you not leaving?

176
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,060
   

177
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,900
Hello?

178
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,780
 - Good morning.  
 - Good morning.

179
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,500
Well... I was too busy yesterday.

180
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,960
I didn't see your message in time.

181
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,680
You're not mad at me, right?

182
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,020
I'm mad.

183
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,920
Just kidding.

184
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,430
By the way, how have you been these past two days? Have you solved it?

185
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,150
Not yet.

186
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:00,422
What about you? You called me yesterday.

187
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:02,088
What do you need?

188
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,020
Nothing.

189
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,080
I just wanted to hear your voice.

190
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,590
 You missed me? 

191
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,140
How about I record a wake-up call, or a phone ringtone for you?

192
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,350
 Forget it. 

193
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,280
 If I hear your voice, 
   

194
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,880
I won't be able to get out of bed.

195
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,800
- These two days, I somehow... 
  - Huan Er, I'm sorry. 

196
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,080
I have another meeting here. 
    

197
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,930
I'll go to the meeting first. Can I call you back?

198
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,230
Get to work then.

199
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,660
I'm going to the lab soon.

200
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,830
 Okay, bye. 

201
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,740
What's wrong? Do you have a stomachache?

202
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,010
Maybe I'm hungry.

203
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,590
I'll eat something once I get back.

204
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:29,322
Why don't you go back and rest?

205
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,010
- I'll take care of the rest. 
 - I'm fine. I also need this data.

206
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,140
Huan Er.

207
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,870
Huan Er.

208
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,020
Huan Er!

209
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,640
Huan Er!

210
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,150
Huan Er!

211
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,540
Huan Er!

212
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,470
Fu Ying, still no word from Light Messenger?

213
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,111
No, I contacted them. They're always out of the service area.

214
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:47,000
It's time for lunch. Eat first.

215
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,090
I'm so busy that I forgot.

216
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,740
I'll go eat first.

217
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,300
Go ahead.

218
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,580
 The number you've dialed is currently unavailable. 

219
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,160
 Please call again later. 

220
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,990
 The number you've dialed is currently unavailable. 

221
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,130
 You finally picked up. 

222
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,688
 What are you doing? Why did you keep... 

223
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,620
Are you in the hospital?

224
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,030
You're not feeling well?

225
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,166
My gastroenteritis has flared up.

226
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,910
I feel much better after getting an IV drip.

227
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,244
Gastroenteritis?

228
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,673
Why did you suddenly get gastroenteritis?

229
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:53,200
Did you eat something that upset your stomach?

230
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,952
My stomach was upset yesterday.

231
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:58,711
I thought I'd be fine after a good night's sleep.

232
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,670
Why didn't you tell me?

233
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,920
I didn't think it was a big deal.

234
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,020
How are you feeling now?

235
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,810
- If I could be by your side... 
  - Huan Er. 

236
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,680
I just bought you some porridge. Eat it while it's hot.

237
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,470
Thank you.

238
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,340
Tian Chi, I thought you left.

239
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,820
No.

240
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,440
Is it Jing Xi Chi?

241
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,060
 Yes. 

242
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,592
Eat it while it's hot. Eating it will make your stomach feel better.

243
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:45,850
 You can't faint again. 

244
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,440
 Thank you, Tian Chi. 

245
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,390
 I've troubled you enough today. 

246
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,820
You should go back and rest.

247
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,100
Sure. You should rest early too.

248
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,740
Thank you.

249
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,990
You fainted?

250
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,130
In the lab today.

251
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,950
Tian Chi happened to see me, and sent me to the hospital.

252
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,637
Which hospital are you in?

253
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:17,060
I'll ask Yan Mu to accompany you.

254
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,950
No. I can take care of myself.

255
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,820
You should handle Yangwu's affairs.

256
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,200
Rest a bit longer then.

257
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,630
 Call me if anything happens. 

258
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,890
Bye.

259
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,710
Bye.

260
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,177
Why are you back so early today?

261
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,400
What's wrong?

262
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,514
Chen Huan Er fainted due to gastroenteritis.

263
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,710
Tian Chi took her to the hospital.

264
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,880
Why were they together?

265
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,290
This won't work.

266
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm really worried.

267
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,280
I have to go back to see her.

268
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,560
Isn't your decision-making meeting the day after tomorrow? Are you going back now?

269
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,633
Chen Huan Er needs me the most right now. I have to go back to see her.

270
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,100
Well... It's late, and there's no train. How are you going to go back?

271
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,500
Driving license.

272
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,830
I'll rent a car.

273
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,218
Okay, go ahead.

274
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,920
You have my support.

275
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,440
I'll go now.

276
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,630
Take your time.

277
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,440
Go slowly!

278
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,670
Press it.

279
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,300
Thank you.

280
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,290
Huan Er.

281
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,710
Tian Chi, why are you still here?

282
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,360
I was worried about you being here alone.

283
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,740
Let me take you home.

284
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,433
I feel much better now.

285
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,470
I can walk on my own.

286
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,100
Let's go.

287
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,710
We're here.

288
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,820
Sorry for bothering you today.

289
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,300
I'll head up now.

290
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,290
Okay. If you don't feel well again, remember to tell me.

291
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,710
Thank you for taking care of my girlfriend.

292
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,670
Sorry to bother you.

293
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,610
Huan Er is my junior.

294
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,090
It's my job to take care of her.

295
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,680
I will take good care of Chen Huan Er.

296
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,430
Next time this happens, you don't need to worry.

297
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,670
Are you sure?

298
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,430
If Chen Huan Er faints in front of me again, you want me to ignore her?

299
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,480
Jing Xi Chi.

300
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,755
If you really love Chen Huan Er, how come you didn't even know she was sick?

301
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,733
You weren't by her side during her most difficult times.

302
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,755
You have no right to stop others from being nice to her.

303
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,922
Hello? Senior Gao, what's wrong?

304
00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:01,111
 Hurry up and pack your things. 

305
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:02,455
 Follow me to Tonglin City tomorrow 

306
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:04,240
 for a growth survey of medicinal plants in the wild. 

307
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,092
 We'll be staying over, so bring some change of clothes. 

308
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:09,780
Why so sudden?

309
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,290
Can I skip this one?

310
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,060
 No. It's been arranged. 

311
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,810
Here's the thing, Senior Gao.

312
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,200
I just got back from the hospital, and I'm not feeling well.

313
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,470
Can I go in two days instead?

314
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,500
 Our experiment can't be postponed just because you want to rest. 

315
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,640
Senior Gao, what do you mean by that?

316
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,820
Even if it's delayed, it's because you didn't plan or notify in advance.

317
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,400
 Fine, Chen Huan Er. 

318
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,440
 If you really don't want to go, I'll find someone else. 

319
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,530
 But I'm not sure whether you can get the credit for this project. 

320
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,255
No.

321
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:41,400
I did everything I was supposed to do, and even things I wasn't supposed to.

322
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,160
Why shouldn't I be credited?

323
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,111
 Because I'm the one in charge of this research. 

324
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,710
Okay.

325
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,470
Got it.

326
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:04,733
 I'm downstairs. 

327
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,330
Why are you here?

328
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,540
When did you come?

329
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,555
You're sick. I wanted to come back to see you.

330
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,877
How are you?

331
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:31,540
Still feeling unwell?

332
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,500
I'm fine now.

333
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,955
By the way, how's your proposal going?

334
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:40,870
I haven't finished writing it yet.

335
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,060
Well... Why don't you hurry back to work?

336
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,530
So you don't want me to come back and see you?

337
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,090
No. That's not what I meant.

338
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,020
What I mean is, I don't want you to miss work because of me.

339
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,740
Chen Huan Er.

340
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,800
I don't want to be the last one to know when you're sick.

341
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,645
I don't want Tian Chi to be the one who takes you to the hospital

342
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:08,300
and walks you back to the dorm instead of me.

343
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,050
I didn't ask him to.

344
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,290
He was waiting at the hospital.

345
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,480
What do you mean by that?

346
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
You don't trust me?

347
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,488
I trust you.

348
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:28,880
I think you're the one who doesn't trust me.

349
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,430
- Why are you getting so worked up? 
 - I'm not worked up.

350
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,400
Didn't you say it yourself?

351
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,142
If it weren't for Tian Chi, would you have come?

352
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:38,030
Of course I would have.

353
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,160
With you being so busy, will you usually come?

354
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,792
When I said I miss you, did you come?

355
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:43,800
So do you think I came back because of Tian Chi?

356
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,560
Yes!

357
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,810
Do you realize we haven't had a proper talk in a long time?

358
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:05,311
I also don't want to learn about your life through Fu Ying's social media.

359
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,680
Chen Huan Er.

360
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,580
I've tried very hard.

361
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,920
I'm under great pressure every day just to finish it quickly and come back to see you.

362
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
And then what?

363
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,610
As soon as I got back, I saw Tian Chi walking you back!

364
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,390
I've tried very hard to control my emotions.

365
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,577
And then what? The first thing you say to me when we meet

366
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,720
is to tell me to leave?

367
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,320
That's not what I meant!

368
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,840
Can you grow up a little, Jing Xi Chi?

369
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,630
Are you the only one who's tired every day? I'm tired too.

370
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,340
I attend classes and do experiments every day.

371
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,710
I also have to go to the mountains for research tomorrow.

372
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,190
I'm really tired.

373
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,920
Answer it.

374
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,990
Hello?

375
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,150
 We found Light Messenger. They're in Wuan. 

376
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,060
Send me the address.

377
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,230
I'll go find them.

378
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,670
 Okay, I'll send you the address. 

379
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,160
All right. Bye.

380
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,950
Huan Er.

381
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,670
I don't want to fight with you.

382
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,720
You should hurry back.

383
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,960
I know Yangwu's project is important to you.

384
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,190
Don't delay your work because of me.

385
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,150
I'll go back to pack my things.

386
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:21,980
♫  You are silent, tangled in lies  ♫

387
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:29,540
♫  And indifferent, lost in winding suspicion  ♫

388
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:36,860
♫  We've circled through a story of unions and partings  ♫

389
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,660
♫  Stripped away by regret  ♫

390
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,280
♫  You clearly miss me too  ♫

391
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,281
♫  Why didn't you say a word?  ♫

392
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,620
♫  Your tenderness fell from your gaze  ♫

393
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,440
♫  Wrapping time and me in its embrace  ♫

394
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,080
♫  You clearly love me too  ♫

395
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,620
♫  So don't let it pass again  ♫

396
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,360
♫  Gather roses and fireworks  ♫

397
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:20,900
♫  Stay with me to see the sun rise and the moon fall  ♫

398
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,740
Excuse me. Are you Light Messenger?

399
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,640
Hello?

400
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,810
Hello.

401
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,910
Light Messenger?

402
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,680
Hello. My name is Jing Xi Chi. The founder of Yangwu.

403
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,470
Sorry to bother you.

404
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,060
My colleague should have told you why I'm here, right?

405
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,255
It's mainly because Yangwu encountered some difficulties recently.

406
00:32:16,255 --> 00:32:17,580
We're facing transformation.

407
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,780
You've been a regular user of our website.

408
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,530
Among all users, your login rate and activity level have always been very high.

409
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,870
That's why I want to see if you can give us any advice.

410
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:33,190
Actually, I wanted to meet you too.

411
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,580
Meet me?

412
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,150
Why?

413
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,300
I want to thank you.

414
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,565
I'm not very good at dealing with others.

415
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,300
I used to stay at home every day.

416
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,836
I'm not talkative either.

417
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,810
I'm either reading a book, or looking at the stars with a telescope.

418
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:59,890
I first registered Yangwu because I lacked money.

419
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,740
Astronomy books are quite expensive.

420
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,720
I can't afford it.

421
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,710
I can only look for old books that are sold at a discount.

422
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:14,730
I didn't expect to meet a group of like-minded buddies on Yangwu by accident.

423
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:23,910
I used to like astronomy very much because I think every star is far away.

424
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,522
Distant and lonely.

425
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:28,470
Just like people.

426
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,850
But Yangwu gave me friends.

427
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:35,000
It made me realize that if every star shines for each other,

428
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,540
they can form the most brilliant galaxy in the night sky.

429
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,555
 The Meteorological Observatory issues an orange warning. 

430
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:54,700
 There will be typhoons and heavy rains in some areas. 

431
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,600
 Please stay safe when you're out. 

432
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,350
 Sorry, the number you dialed is currently unavailable. 

433
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,580
 Please call again later. 

434
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,040
 Sorry, the number you dialed is currently unavailable. 

435
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,410
 Please call again later. 

436
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,560
 - Hello?  
 - Hello.

437
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,100
Do you have Tian Chi's phone number?

438
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,660
 - Yes. What's the matter?  
 - Send it to me.

439
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,460
I can't get in touch with Chen Huan Er.

440
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,160
 Okay, I'll send it to you. 

441
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,250
 - Hello?  
 - Hello? Tian Chi?

442
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,900
I'm Jing Xi Chi.

443
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,477
Do you know where Chen Huan Er is?

444
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:54,870
 She went to Tonglin Village to do research. 

445
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,520
Tonglin Village?

446
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,120
   

447
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,040
By the way, Chen Huan Er, take a work photo for me.

448
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,750
Three, two, one.

449
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,800
All done.

450
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,170
- Okay. 
 - Take a look.

451
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,730
Not bad.

452
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,100
Okay. Stay here and keep an eye on things.

453
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,060
Wait. What about you?

454
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,810
I'll go to the village and hand out the questionnaires.

455
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,100
Handle this first. I'll come find you later.

456
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,660
- Okay? Lu. 
 - Wait...

457
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,500
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

458
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,200
Hello? Jing?

459
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,790
 I have Yangwu's proposal for the meeting, but I can't go back. 

460
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,390
Go to the meeting with Zhou Ye.

461
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,310
 Me? 

462
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,840
Where did you go?

463
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,890
Something happened to Huan Er. I'm going to find her.

464
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,644
 But you're the one in charge of Yangwu. 

465
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:13,180
Is it appropriate for me to take your place?

466
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,209
 It's okay. 

467
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:15,810
We're all a team.

468
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,400
Besides, you've done no less for Yangwu than I have.

469
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,520
If it weren't for you, Yangwu wouldn't be where it is today.

470
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,580
What should I say then?

471
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,418
It's raining so hard, but you're going up for scientific research?

472
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,470
It's too dangerous.

473
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,100
The weather was fine just a moment ago.

474
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,480
Who knew the weather on this mountain would change so quickly?

475
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,180
Yeah.

476
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,245
The mountains around Tonglin Village are too dangerous.

477
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:18,430
There was a wildfire here many years ago.

478
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:23,170
A firefighter was trapped in the mountains, and never came out.

479
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,160
He never came out?

480
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,920
 Who is it? 

481
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,232
Where's Chen Huan Er?

482
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,480
She went up the mountain to collect samples. No news of her after that.

483
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,750
- I can't reach her. 
 - You let her go alone today?

484
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,360
The weather was fine this morning. Who knew it would suddenly start to rain?

485
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,000
Don't worry. Maybe her phone just doesn't have a signal.

486
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,743
What is wrong with you?

487
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:02,829
You... You...

488
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,960
Asshole!

489
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,680
Chen Huan Er!

490
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,340
Chen Huan Er!

491
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,640
Chen Huan Er!

492
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,040
Chen Huan Er!

493
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,970
Chen Huan Er!

494
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,100
 Retreat first. 

495
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,060
 Retreat. 

496
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,540
 Hurry up! Catch up. 

497
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,320
 Hurry. 

498
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,320
 Hurry and retreat! 

499
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,330
 Xi Chi. 

500
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,360
 Xi Chi. 

501
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,340
 Thank you for your hard work over the years. 

502
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,550
 You're really an adult now. 

503
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,830
Drink something hot. Warm yourself up.

504
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,900
Thank you.

505
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,820
There's no signal here. I just tried.

506
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,712
It's late now. It's dangerous to descend the mountain.

507
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:08,200
Let's wait till dawn.

508
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,438
What is this place?

509
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,660
This is our supply station for sample collection.

510
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,970
Why did you come here suddenly?

511
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,020
I couldn't get in touch with you.

512
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,310
So I called Tian Chi.

513
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,540
He said you went to Tonglin Village.

514
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,440
I heard and couldn't care about anything else.

515
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,914
Are you okay?

516
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,800
You're not hurt, are you?

517
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,430
I'm fine.

518
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:48,550
What happened to you... just now?

519
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,420
I'm fine.

520
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,890
Wait here.

521
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,060
Take this.

522
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,850
What's this?

523
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,870
It's post-wildfire vegetation soil.

524
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:27,350
After a fire, the time it takes for plant life to recover can be as short as a dozen years,

525
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,470
or as long as several decades.

526
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:36,910
It's a very long process, but it continues to grow even if it looks barren.

527
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:42,560
One day, it will return to its original lush appearance.

528
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,870
Huan Er.

529
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,120
Sorry.

530
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:57,180
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you yesterday.

531
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,800
It's all over now.

532
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,840
Let's not mention it anymore.

533
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,250
This is nice.

534
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:20,990
It seems like we haven't sat together quietly like this for a long time.

535
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,620
In these past few days, I've been thinking...

536
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:36,220
whether my decision to leave Wuan for Beijing was right or wrong.

537
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,990
It's true that I've been busy this month,

538
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:50,755
but it's also true that my heart feels empty.

539
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,220
When I was in Wuan,

540
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:01,040
my favorite thing of the day was to take the subway for half an hour at 6:30 p.m.

541
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:11,550
and change buses three times, so that I could go across the city to see you.

542
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,140
But after arriving to Beijing,

543
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,370
there's no bus or subway...

544
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:27,150
that can take me to you.

545
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,010
I feel the same way.

546
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,170
I've already regarded Wuan as my other home.

547
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:58,500
But since you left, I just feel that even the most familiar places have become unfamiliar.

548
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,180
Chen Huan Er,

549
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:11,250
do you ever regret being with me?

550
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,570
Have you lost your mind?

551
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:22,260
Do you know why I'm called Chen Huan Er?

552
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,212
Because I was always hospitalized when I was a kid.

553
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:27,660
The nurses wouldn't call patients' names.

554
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,390
They only called the patient in bed 3, or the patient in bed 5.

555
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:37,790
Whenever my mom heard these words, she would be frightened.

556
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:45,250
 But my mom said since we're stuck with it, we'll try to turn the bad into good. 

557
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,620
That's why those words became my name. 
  (T/N: Patient sounds like Huan Er in Chinese) 

558
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:57,310
She wanted me to grow up happy and full of laughter.

559
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,950
I've been thinking about it over the years.

560
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,070
Am I happy?

561
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:11,500
I didn't know before, but now I know.

562
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,660
I'm quite happy.

563
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,470
Especially after meeting you.

564
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,270
You never reject my weird ideas.

565
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,660
You always quietly supported me.

566
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,870
 Maybe you're a little unreliable in the eyes of outsiders. 

567
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:49,240
 But in my eyes, your unreliability is exactly what I need. 

568
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:59,550
That's why I'm grateful to have met you.

569
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,520
I also cherish our relationship.

570
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,600
I don't regret it.

571
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,580
Chen Huan Er.

572
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,680
I love you.

573
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,410
Why are you so sentimental?

574
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,960
Jing Xi Chi.

575
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,000
I love you too.

576
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:05,770


577
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:10,870

♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

579

♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

582
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:44,450
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

583
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,280
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

584
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,860
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

585
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:04,560
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

586
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,520
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

587

♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

589

♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

590
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:27,190
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

591
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:32,180
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

592
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,980
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

593
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:40,120
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

594
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,610
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

595
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,250
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

596
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,660
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

597
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:58,840
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

598
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,740
♫  At the right time  ♫
