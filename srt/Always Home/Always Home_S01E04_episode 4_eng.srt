00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:20,560


2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,780
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,160
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,260
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,730
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver.  ♫

15
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,980
   
   

17
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,700
 Maybe no one would believe it. 

18
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,930
 I always talk about how much I love soccer, 

19
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,900
 how I'm not afraid of anything. 

20
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,930
 But if it weren't for my dad, 

21
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,920
 I would have given up when I got injured before the tryouts. 

22
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,770
 Coach, I know you mean well. 

23
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,100
 However, I won't let Xi Chi play soccer, 

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,140
 let alone attend a soccer academy. 

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,450
He's trained so hard for years.

26
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,640
At least let him stick it out until the very end.

27
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,570
 He reignited my motivation and convinced my mom to let me continue playing. 

28
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,460
 Of course, only if I don't get hurt again. 

29
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,610
Dad, you're really getting old.

30
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,010
You couldn't keep up earlier.

31
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,140
Those passes were all set up for you.

32
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,040
Watch your words.

33
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,940
Xi Chi.

34
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,050
Promise me.

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,700
You can play soccer, but remember. You promised Mom.

36
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,290
If you get injured again, you won't be able to play anymore.

37
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,770
Got it.

38
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,660
But Dad...

39
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,820
we need to go home now.

40
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,520
Mom will be back soon.

41
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,687
I'll get going first.

42
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:57,760
You brat! I'm afraid of getting caught by your mom too!

43
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,570
Dad.

44
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,490
Stay alert.

45
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,140
Mom could be back any time now.

46
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,440
Don't slip up when she asks.

47
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,050
What are you doing?

48
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,780
We've been home all day. How is our house so clean?

49
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,810
You're sneaky indeed.

50
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,330
Let's watch the match.

51
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,370
It's starting.

52
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,370
What's wrong with you two?

53
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,199
Did you really have to turn the house upside down just to watch a match?

54
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,200
You're so difficult.

55
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,400
What's that smell?

56
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,050
Yunnan Baiyao! 
  (T/N: herbal pain relief medicine.) 

57
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,880
Xi Chi, did you play...

58
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,320
I need to spray some more medicine on it later.

59
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,560
Dear,

60
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,818
if you're not feeling well, just go see Song.

61
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:08,080
- Yes, exactly. 
 - What if you hurt your bones?

62
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,290
- Yes. 
 - Okay, okay.

63
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,730
I heard you have sports day coming up.

64
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,890
You had better not register for anything.

65
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,440
But Mom!

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,130
Please. Please, Mom. Please, I beg you.

67
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,610
My legs are perfectly fine.

68
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,900
That's final.

69
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,690
Mom, please let me go.

70
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,020
I'm the sports representative. I have to set an example.

71
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,250
Just get your classmates to join.

72
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,580
I will talk to your teacher.

73
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,370
Mom, this affects our class performance.

74
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,690
I have to compete.

75
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,460
I'm the best in class at sports.

76
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,340
What about your leg?

77
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,420
It was injured.

78
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,130
It may have healed, but your knees are still weak.

79
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,420
Do you understand?

80
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,540
Don't worry, Mom. I know how to take care of myself.

81
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,220
I can still run.

82
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,460
How can I not worry?

83
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,170
Song said you need to rest and avoid strenuous activity.

84
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,540
Did you hear me?

85
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,490
Mom, please, I beg you.

86
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,980
Beg? How pathetic.

87
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,810
Mom!

88
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,460
Our class has no other athletes.

89
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,800
If I don't compete, we have no chance of winning.

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,420
Besides, I'm terrible at academics. I've always dragged the class down.

91
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,980
This is my chance to contribute.

92
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,660
I don't want to be the laughing stock of the other classes.

93
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,220
Jing Xi Chi, stop arguing with me!

94
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,250
Save your energy for studying,

95
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,660
then you won't be a disappointment.

96
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,690
Gosh.

97
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,370
- Go study. 
 - Mom!

98
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,790
Let me compete.

99
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,490
 I'll join. 

100
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,690
Chen Huan Er!

101
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,690
Are you serious? I'm very weak now. Don't lie to me.

102
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,250
I'm serious.

103
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,170
You're the best!

104
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,400
I'll join regardless.

105
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,050
Are you hungry? Here, have some.

106
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,250
I made it myself. I learned the recipe from Aunt Hao.

107
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,370
You cooked this?

108
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,640
That's right. Open up.

109
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,840
How is it?

110
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,020
Not bad.

111
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,340
Didn't you say you don't like it?

112
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,250
I never said that.

113
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,130
I ate everything you rejected.

114
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,780
I think the vegetable dumplings are good.

115
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,370
Listen. My mom wasn't thinking straight yesterday.

116
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,980
She won't let me compete.

117
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,490
Thank goodness you agreed.

118
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,690
However, why'd you change your mind?

119
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,540
That's none of your business.

120
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,960
Don't try to read a girl's mind.

121
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,490
By the way, please don't tell my mom that I'm competing.

122
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,690
Don't snitch on me.

123
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,490
Why all the secrecy?

124
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,130
I told you. Stop guessing my thoughts.

125
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,220
Fine. I won't say anything.

126
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,130
We need to start intensive training now.

127
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,730
Okay.

128
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,300
Are you that happy?

129
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,920
Our class has a secret weapon.

130
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Hurry, we're almost there.

131
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,890
I don't want to run anymore.

132
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,410
- I can't keep going. 
 - You can't stop abruptly after the run.

133
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,160
Come on. Walk slowly. Let's walk slowly.

134
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,330
Song Cong.

135
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,820
I'm joining the 800m race. Help me train.

136
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,890
You've competed since junior middle school.

137
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,610
Are you joining this round too?

138
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,100
Not this time.

139
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,700
I'm the announcer.

140
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,060
Ask Xi Chi to train you then.

141
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,920
He's a professional.

142
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,210
Never mind then. Goodbye.

143
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,320
Speed up, Chen Huan Er.

144
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,250
This is your orange, your favorite.

145
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,890
- What are you doing? 
 - You can eat it at the finish line.

146
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,650
Secret weapon? Her?

147
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,980
Don't push her too hard.

148
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,180
She's just like you. A high school team captain is still just an amateur.

149
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,980
You think you're better?

150
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,820
You're just a ball boy.

151
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,440
Ignore him. Focus on running.

152
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,680
- You can eat this when you finish. 
 - Put it down. Put it down!

153
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,180
Come on, Chen Huan Er!

154
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,310
Almost there!

155
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,580
Slow down. Are you okay?

156
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,700
How is it?

157
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,800
You just need to complete the run. Why push yourself so hard?

158
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,250
I want to challenge myself.

159
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,860
Regulate your breathing. Come on.

160
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,610
Drink some water.

161
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,820
Drink slowly.

162
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,560
Slowly.

163
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,850
- I'm home. 
 - You're back.

164
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,680
Why are you late today?

165
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,490
What happened to your face?

166
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,040
Why is your hair tangled?

167
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,460
I had cleaning duty today.

168
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,100
I was sweating buckets.

169
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,360
Cleaning duty? Tell your teacher to give you lighter tasks next time.

170
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,820
Your body can't handle strenuous work.

171
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,960
- You shouldn't be doing manual labor. 
 - Okay. Don't worry, Mom.

172
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,300
I'm in top condition.

173
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,410
Nonsense.

174
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,410
Oh, right. After your Sports Day, come to my workplace for lunch.

175
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,340
- Don't come home for food. 
 - All right.

176
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,560
All right, noted.

177
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,880
Gosh.

178
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,180
Get ready.

179
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,700
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

180
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,370
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

181
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,980
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

182
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,410
 Come on, Class 6! 
   

183
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,980
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

184
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,460
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

185
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,940
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

186
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,100
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

187
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,490
What’s wrong, Huan Er? Do you have a stomachache?

188
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,090
Sort of. I'll just drink some water.

189
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,460
Gosh, what's wrong with our school?

190
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,490
Why are they holding Sports Day on such a gloomy day?

191
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,820
It's so chilly.

192
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,370
I don't get it. What's the point of Sports Day?

193
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,770
I'd rather have a half-day off.

194
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,250
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

195
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,770
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

196
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,450
- Class 6! 
  - Come on! 

197
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,933
Look at them. So arrogant!

198
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,520
Class 6 is always full of themselves on Sports Day.

199
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,360
Well, they do have more athletes.

200
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,100
We have one too.

201
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,600
Our hopes are on Xi Chi.

202
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,130
I heard his mom won't let him compete.

203
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,800
Really?

204
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,660
If he doesn't compete, we're doomed.

205
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,210
Jing Xi Chi is joining.

206
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,220
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on! 

207
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,010
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on! 

208
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,890
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on! 

209
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,390
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on! 

210
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,410
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on! 

211
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,080
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on! 

212
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,580
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on! 

213
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,340
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on!  
 - On your marks.

214
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,520
- Jing Xi Chi! 
  - Come on! 

215
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,970
Get ready!

216
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,280
   

217
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,180
 - Jing Xi Chi! 
 - Come on! 

218
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,180
 All the best! 

219
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,610
 You can do this! 

220
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,010
Go for it!

221
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,420
   

222
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,610
   

223
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,200
Women's 1500m Race will start.

224
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,900
Huan Er, they're taking attendance.

225
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,770
- They're calling for the 1500m race. 
 - I'm going.

226
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,490
It's Huan Er's turn. Let's cheer for her!

227
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,220
 All the best! 

228
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,490
 You got this! 

229
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,730
Come on!

230
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,850
All the best!

231
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,980
- Over here. 
 - Yes.

232
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,580
Don't get ahead of yourself just yet.

233
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,100
You should just give up on the Women's 1500m race.

234
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,290
Our class never gives up.

235
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,490
Don't stress about it.

236
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,410
I won earlier.

237
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,920
Just follow your rhythm.

238
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,840
You're a winner as long as you finish the race.

239
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,520
Don't worry. Trust me.

240
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:35,036
All the best!

241
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,770
Huan Er, Huan Er, you can run!

242
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,820
Lock in first, get it done!

243
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,650
Huan Er, Huan Er, you're the best!

244
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,840
Pride of Class 5, no less!

245
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,655
 Pride of Class 5, no less! 
   

246
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:58,280
 Pride of Class 5! 

247
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,130
 You got this! 

248
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,900
Get ready!

249
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,220
Set!

250
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,300
 Come on, Chen Huan Er! 

251
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,340
 Come on! 

252
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,250
Come on!

253
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,580
 Come on, Chen Huan Er! 

254
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,490
 Come on! 

255
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,240
   

256
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,280
   

257
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,650
 You just need to complete the run. Why push yourself so hard? 

258
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,010
 I want to challenge myself. 

259
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,560
Huan Er!

260
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,280
Huan Er!

261
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,780
She has low blood sugar. It's nothing serious.

262
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,580
I gave her a glucose injection.

263
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,970
Doctor, does she really not need to go to the hospital?

264
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,610
No, she'll be fine.

265
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,650
But she's quite weak.

266
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,860
If you're really worried,

267
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,720
you can take her to the hospital for a check-up later.

268
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,320
Is Huan Er okay?

269
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,410
She's okay. The doctor said she has low blood sugar.

270
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,860
That's right. She was too nervous this morning and skipped breakfast.

271
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,040
I'll get her something to eat.

272
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,600
Huan Er.

273
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,020
Qi Qi.

274
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,930
How are you feeling?

275
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,800
I think I just got my period.

276
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,490
Did you forget to bring pads?

277
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,300
It's okay, I'll buy them for you.

278
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,170
Get some rest.

279
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,020
- Why are you here? 
 - I'm buying something for Huan Er.

280
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,040
Come on, I'll pay for both.

281
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,300
No, it's fine.

282
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,380
- It's okay. 
 - It's really fine, just pay for yours.

283
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,130
Give it to me.

284
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,540
You pay first.

285
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,210
- You first. 
 - Let's just pay together.

286
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,800
It's really okay.

287
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,650
Just buy yours.

288
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,210
That'll be 27 yuan.

289
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,650
   

290
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,490
 Chen Huan Er. 

291
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,250
Get up.

292
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,740
Are you okay?

293
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,500
Xi Chi.

294
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,210
- Would this be considered a work injury? 
 - Is it serious?

295
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,070
I think so.

296
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,760
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

297
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,600
I'm just joking.

298
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,450
- Don't get mad. 
 - I was really worried about you.

299
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,410
What exactly happened?

300
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,070
It's nothing serious.

301
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,260
By the way, how did our class do? Did we win?

302
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,210
I don't know. I came straight here after my race. I didn't check the scores.

303
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,877
Are you okay, Huan Er?

304
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,930
The results for the 1500m race are out. You placed third.

305
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,500
I got third?

306
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,510
Our class is the champion?

307
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,260
You need to accept your prize. Can you walk?

308
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,300
Of course!

309
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,410
Wait. What about the IV drip?

310
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,260
Where's the school doctor?

311
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,370
I don't see her around.

312
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,760
No need to find her.

313
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,904
Anyone can remove a needle.

314
00:22:56,904 --> 00:22:58,580
- Can you? 
 - Of course.

315
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,370
- Here. 
 - Okay. Then remove it for me.

316
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,840
Hurry, I want to watch the match.

317
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,020
Press it.

318
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,610
I'm heading out first!

319
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,610
My shoes.

320
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,600
Be careful.

321
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,960
- She's going to the toilet. 
 - Come on.

322
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
Let's receive your prize.

323
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:33,957
Chen Huan Er!

324
00:23:33,957 --> 00:23:35,127
 Pride of Class 5! 

325
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:37,127
 - Chen Huan Er! 
 - Pride of Class 5! 

326
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:38,997
 - Chen Huan Er! 
 - Pride of Class 5! 

327
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:40,477
 - Chen Huan Er! 
 - Pride of Class 5! 

328
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,037
 - Chen Huan Er! 
 - Pride of Class 5! 

329
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,567
 - Chen Huan Er! 
 - Pride of Class 5! 

330
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:46,437
 - Chen Huan Er! 
 - Pride of Class 5! 

331
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:51,887
 Chen Huan Er! 

332
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,437
Don't get too full of yourselves.

333
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:55,037
You're just lucky

334
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:56,972
to have Ms. Kaosign there, even if you can't speak properly.

335
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:59,167
What are you saying? Are you looking for trouble?

336
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,246
You didn't win anything. Why are you acting so smug?

337
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:04,127
Sounds like you are just sore losers.

338
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:08,437
Not only did we beat you at the competition, we'll also destroy you in exams.

339
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:10,407
You just can't handle losing. So classless.

340
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,400
- Sore losers. 
 - Say that again!

341
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,757
 Sore losers! 

342
00:24:15,757 --> 00:24:18,120
 Sore losers! 

343
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,477
 Turns out everyone has a hidden side. 

344
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:27,197
 I never expected someone as reserved as Qi Qi 

345
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:30,847
 to step up and stand against provocations from other classes. 

346
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:36,237
 The same classmates who used to mock my accent now stood united. 

347
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:43,997
 Maybe the first time people make their own choices is always a little difficult. 

348
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:46,477
 Jing Xi Chi is right. 

349
00:24:46,477 --> 00:24:48,907
 I can do this. 

350
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:00,067
   

351
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:03,847
Mom told us to wait here. She will pick us up.

352
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:06,277
You both are so obedient.

353
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:08,477
You're going to the canteen for lunch as instructed?

354
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:10,547
I was thinking of getting something fancy.

355
00:25:10,547 --> 00:25:11,957
Whatever.

356
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:14,367
I want KFC.

357
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:15,957
You can get it here too.

358
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:18,677
I gave the chicken stew a nickname, KFC.

359
00:25:18,677 --> 00:25:21,087
Stop trying to fool me.

360
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,160
You're here. You must be starving.

361
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,717
Mom.

362
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:27,387
- Auntie, hello! 
 - Look at this.

363
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:30,077
What happened to your hand?

364
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:33,237
- I'm fine. 
 - I'll have a look.

365
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:34,367
I'm fine.

366
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,347
Let me see.

367
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:39,327
Did you get an IV drip?

368
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:41,477
Why did you need one?

369
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:44,167
Well, I had low blood sugar.

370
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,477
Did you faint?

371
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:52,107
I'm fine, Mom, really.

372
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:56,237
You joined Sports Day, didn't you?

373
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:58,887
I told you not to. You need to take care of yourself.

374
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:00,440
Why won't you listen?

375
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,647
- You're lucky nothing happened. What if— 
 - No, Aunt. She actually...

376
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:07,557
I'm fine, Mom. I'm really fine, Mom.

377
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:15,087
Did the school doctor give you the IV? It's swollen.

378
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,197
This has nothing to do with her.

379
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:19,677
Don't go blaming the school.

380
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:21,087
It has nothing to do with them, too.

381
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:24,127
I just wanted to watch the matches, so I pulled it out myself.

382
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:27,037
You clumsy thing!

383
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,477
Aunt.

384
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:30,237
Actually, Huan Er...

385
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:32,197
Mom.

386
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:35,037
I'm sorry.

387
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:38,407
Let's eat first, okay?

388
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:39,477
I'm hungry.

389
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:40,607
- Okay. 
 - I'm so hungry.

390
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:42,387
Let's go eat.

391
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,907
- Something's off… 
 - Jing Xi Chi.

392
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,557
Did you join the race too?

393
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:58,167
I knew it.

394
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,677
All kids are the same.

395
00:26:59,677 --> 00:27:02,107
They never listen.

396
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,567
Mom, don't be upset.

397
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:07,757
I'm sorry.

398
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:09,927
What are we eating today? I'm craving...

399
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:13,477
Don't you think Aunt Li Na was overly sensitive?

400
00:27:14,477 --> 00:27:16,237
That's true.

401
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:22,077
Aunt Li Na is usually easygoing, but today she seemed really anxious.

402
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:25,587
Let's eat first.

403
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:32,966
 Okay, this is his chance. 

404
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:35,437
 Good shot! Bravo! 

405
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,517
You're back, Mom.

406
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:45,147
I have a question, Mom.

407
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:47,600
- Go ahead. 
  - Let me introduce him again. 

408
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
What is it?

409
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,437
Well...

410
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:54,927
I'd like to ask you...

411
00:27:54,927 --> 00:28:00,327
in most cases, how do you remove a needle without causing swelling?

412
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,167
Aunt Li Na told me.

413
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:03,997
You're so bold.

414
00:28:03,997 --> 00:28:06,087
You're lucky nothing serious happened.

415
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:08,557
If it had, who would be responsible?

416
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:15,200
What happened to Huan Er? Why is everyone so nervous about her?

417
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,677
Stop prying. Just don't let her participate in any strenuous activities.

418
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:20,557
Do you hear me?

419
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:24,717
Is she sick?

420
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:28,827
It's nothing. It happened years ago.

421
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:31,277
It's nothing serious.

422
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:35,567
Just don't ask about it, especially in front of Aunt Li Na.

423
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,317
Okay.

424
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,147
Give me your hand.

425
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:49,477
Look at the blood vein.

426
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:55,277
To remove a needle properly, be gentle, act quickly, and press firmly.

427
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,607
Gently, quickly, and press firmly.

428
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:58,517
Pull it out in the same direction as the vein.

429
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:03,627
Never move it back and forth, or you'll hit the vein wall, which causes swelling.

430
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,277
You look great.

431
00:29:10,277 --> 00:29:13,757
You seem happier after switching classes.

432
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:15,797
Things are okay.

433
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:18,847
Mom.

434
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:22,997
I didn't tell you before I requested a class transfer.

435
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,607
Now that you've switched classes, you're trying to sweet-talk me?

437
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:31,037
That won't work.

438
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:34,237
I'll be frank with you:

439
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:37,197
just because I allowed it doesn't mean I'm spoiling you.

440
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:40,037
My bottom line is this. You must never study medicine.

441
00:29:40,037 --> 00:29:42,887
I know it all too well. Being a doctor is exhausting.

442
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:44,887
I don't want you to end up like your dad.

443
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:46,757
After eight years of medical school,

444
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:51,167
there are still endless courses, tests, surgeries, and evaluations.

445
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:55,087
It never stops. You won't even have time for your own family.

446
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,477
I'm not saying other jobs are easy,

447
00:29:57,477 --> 00:30:01,557
but at least some careers are less demanding than being a doctor.

448
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:05,187
I know, Mom.

449
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:25,367
 Huan Er, are you feeling all right? 

450
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,237
I'm okay.

451
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:29,807
 Come eat. 

452
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:33,277
Mom, where's my red and white towel?

453
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,717
 It's hanging on the balcony. 

454
00:30:39,757 --> 00:30:41,757
 Come eat. 

455
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,667
Okay.

456
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,407
 You should rest well, Huan Er. 

457
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:55,985
 You're incredible, Huan Er! 

458
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,407
 Are you all right? 

459
00:30:57,407 --> 00:31:00,280
 We left the school clinic before checking if you were feeling all right. 

460
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,580
 If you're not feeling well, just take the day off. 

461
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:19,277
Chen Huan Er.

462
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:33,647
What's the matter?

463
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:35,647
Are you feeling better now?

464
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:37,437
I'm okay.

465
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,997
I...

466
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:44,187
My mom was just being overly protective.

467
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:47,717
Rest early.

468
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,517
Good night.

469
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:57,757
 Come eat, Huan Er. 

470
00:31:57,757 --> 00:31:59,667
Coming.

471
00:32:10,377 --> 00:32:11,807
 Chen Huan Er. 

472
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:15,037
 Why can't she participate in Sports Day? 

473
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:16,677
She was sick as a kid.

474
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:17,927
She has a weak constitution.

475
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:19,567
We live in the same compound.

476
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:22,587
You should look out for her.

477
00:32:28,087 --> 00:32:32,437
 Please don't tell my mom that I'm competing. Don't snitch on me. 

478
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:34,717
 Why all the secrecy? 

479
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,037
 Did you get an IV drip? 

480
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:40,147
 Did you faint? 

481
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:42,807
 I told you not to. You need to take care of yourself. 

482
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:45,187
 Why won't you listen? 

483
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,327
Come on.

484
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:11,417
Breakfast.

485
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:12,517
Thanks.

486
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:13,927
This candy is for you too.

487
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:15,647
To prevent low blood sugar.

488
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:17,957
You mustn't faint again.

489
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:34,127
She's not sick. What are you doing?

490
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:37,237
That's right. I'm perfectly healthy now.

491
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:40,387
Do you hear me? Stop treating her differently.

492
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,037
By the way, we have a test today. We need to hurry.

493
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:46,277
A test? Today?

494
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:47,757
Mr. Xu mentioned it yesterday.

495
00:33:47,757 --> 00:33:52,437
The school is so cruel, giving us a test right after Sports Day.

496
00:33:52,437 --> 00:33:55,517
You really didn't listen to the teacher.

497
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,647
 I was grateful for Jing Xi Chi. 

498
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:03,807
 He eased my awkwardness with a joke. 

499
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:06,437
 Perhaps he's right. 

500
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:10,367
 I just want to be normal, like everyone else. 

501
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:12,407
Chen Huan Er!

502
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:14,147
Coming.

503
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,747
Liang.

504
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:31,557
- What is it? 
 - Are you watching the match?

505
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:38,147
Didn't we make a bet before Sports Day?

506
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,157
Big Boss Chi.

507
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:48,327
Stop it. I wasn't serious about that.

508
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:51,837
Liang. Let me tell you something...

509
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,997
Big Boss Chi...

510
00:35:00,997 --> 00:35:02,627
Big Boss Chi.

511
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:11,437
This is about the Cultural Festival.

512
00:35:11,437 --> 00:35:13,887
There's going to be a Book Exchange Event.

513
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:17,437
Go home and pick your favorite book.

514
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:22,287
You can leave a message for the next student who gets your book.

515
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,487
After you finish reading, remember to reply to the message you receive, too.

516
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:28,060
The class president will collect the books and send them to the Reading Room.

517
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,637
Mr. Xu. Does that mean the class president will know what books we choose?

518
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:34,957
But this way, she will find out who we like.

519
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:37,117
Who do you like?

520
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:38,997
I mean, she'll pick the book that she likes.

521
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:41,877
I'll throw yours in the bin first.

522
00:35:42,847 --> 00:35:46,157
Well, if that's the case, you can submit your book directly to the Reading Room.

523
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:49,477
This Friday afternoon during study hall, there won't be any mandatory work.

524
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:53,077
You'll have plenty of time to read.

525
00:35:54,437 --> 00:35:56,557
- All right. 
 - What nonsense.

526
00:35:56,557 --> 00:36:00,682
By the end of this month, you need to submit an 800-word reflection on the book.

527
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,427
All right. You can study on your own now.

528
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:08,887
Huan Er.

529
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:11,157
Do you want to grab milk tea together after school?

530
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:12,477
We can talk about book selection.

531
00:36:12,477 --> 00:36:14,627
Sure.

532
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:18,787
Let's invite them too.

533
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:23,997
Qi Qi is asking if you want to get milk tea after school.

534
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:26,207
Just an invitation, or are you treating us too?

535
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:27,327
It's on me.

536
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:30,887
I want to thank you for helping me with studying.

537
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,117
Wait!

538
00:36:32,117 --> 00:36:33,727
Am I included?

539
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:36,637
Look at you, suddenly all energetic when there's free stuff.

540
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:37,957
Yes, you can join.

541
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:40,077
You're truly my friend.

542
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:47,537
   

543
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:51,557
Song Cong, have you thought about what book to bring?

544
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,600
Well... not yet.

545
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,957
What do you usually read?

546
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,287
Normally...

547
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:00,287
I don't have a particular preference.

548
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:02,467
I read all sorts of books.

549
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,377
Qi Qi.

550
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:08,937
What book did you choose?

551
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:12,667
Don't tell me it's another melodramatic youth novel.

552
00:37:14,517 --> 00:37:16,360
That's none of your business.

553
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,057
Besides, participation matters more than the book itself.

554
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:19,997
What about people like you who don't even own a book?

555
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:23,097
Don't drag me into this. I have books.

556
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:27,157
- What book? 
 - Even though I don't like studying,

557
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:31,657
I actually enjoy reading.

558
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:37,478
Come here, Huan Er.

559
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:40,997
Let's pick books at my place.

560
00:37:40,997 --> 00:37:42,327
Won't that trouble you?

561
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,477
- No worries. 
 - Let's go.

562
00:37:44,477 --> 00:37:46,117
- I'll take it. 
 - We're leaving.

563
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:48,613
- Goodbye. 
 - Bye!

564
00:37:58,077 --> 00:38:00,827
Since when did you take an interest in reading?

565
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,077
Come on in.

566
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:19,627
Your house is huge!

567
00:38:26,327 --> 00:38:29,357
And your piano, it looks magnificent.

568
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:32,837
This?

569
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:37,957
My mom forced me to play the piano.

570
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:42,437
I wanted to learn the ukulele, but she wouldn't allow it.

571
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:44,997
She said it wasn't presentable.

572
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:47,037
Ukulele?

573
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:48,637
What's that?

574
00:38:48,637 --> 00:38:50,327
Why did you want to learn it?

575
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:55,807
A ukulele is a small musical instrument that you can carry anywhere.

576
00:38:55,807 --> 00:39:02,610
I wanted to play it because... I dream of wandering the world with it.

577
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,267
Wandering the world?

578
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:09,157
You really dream big.

579
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:13,077
If I had the chance, I'd love to travel the world too.

580
00:39:13,077 --> 00:39:14,477
Really?

581
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:19,077
But for now, I want to focus on the present.

582
00:39:19,077 --> 00:39:20,887
You're back, Qi Qi.

583
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:23,327
Greetings, Aunt.

584
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,927
Have some fruits.

585
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,517
Thank you. Thank you, Aunt.

586
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:30,287
Qi Qi,

587
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:32,997
your mom is really kind.

588
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:37,807
That's our housekeeper.

589
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:41,267
If you met my mom, you wouldn't say that.

590
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:45,917
Let's go pick a book.

591
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:51,227
Take a look here.

592
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:53,247
Qi Qi.

593
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:56,157
You have so many books at home!

594
00:39:56,157 --> 00:39:57,560
Did you know?

595
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,320
I used to love reading as a kid, mostly because I loved the smell of books.

596
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:07,037
They smell great. Try it.

597
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,837
Really?

598
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,367
I'm sorry.

599
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:19,997
I have a nose allergy.

600
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:23,187
It's okay. I'll take this. Go ahead and pick a book.

601
00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:27,807
There are too many!

602
00:40:27,807 --> 00:40:30,407
I don't know which one to choose.

603
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:32,287
Qi Qi, how about this?

604
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:33,847
Just help me pick one book.

605
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:35,517
That won't do.

606
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:38,957
Your favorite book says a lot about you.

607
00:40:38,957 --> 00:40:44,157
The person who chooses your book likely shares the same taste.

608
00:40:44,157 --> 00:40:46,957
You might even be soul mates.

609
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,247
Huan Er.

610
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:56,517
Which books did Song Cong and Jing Xi Chi pick?

611
00:40:56,517 --> 00:40:58,767
Tell me.

612
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,997
I don't want to choose the same one.

613
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:05,687
That's very unlikely. There's no way we'd pick the same books.

614
00:41:05,687 --> 00:41:07,327
No.

615
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:10,207
Song Cong might have some of these at home.

616
00:41:10,207 --> 00:41:12,357
I'll ask them later.

617
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:00,117
Qi Qi.

618
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,847
You're right.

619
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:04,957
I should pick a book from my own collection.

620
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:08,157
That way, it truly represents me.

621
00:42:08,157 --> 00:42:09,787
Okay.

622
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:16,687
Mom!

623
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:18,997
Mom.

624
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:21,880
Mom...

625
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,133
My school is organizing a Book Exchange Event.

626
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,847
Do you have any books I can borrow?

627
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:29,707
Why not take one of your own?

628
00:42:31,997 --> 00:42:35,997
Well, mine are too basic.

629
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:37,557
Mom, listen.

630
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:39,727
I went to Qi Qi's place today.

631
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,327
Her house is really massive. She has so many books.

632
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:45,807
I couldn't even understand some of the titles.

633
00:42:45,807 --> 00:42:48,687
No wonder she's so good at writing.

634
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:55,437
If I recommend one of my books, it'll seem boring in comparison.

635
00:42:55,437 --> 00:42:57,367
You want something interesting?

636
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,077
Come on, check my bookshelf.

637
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,927
My books are impressive.

638
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:02,109
It's surely interesting.

639
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:04,487
Your classmates would be impressed. Pick whichever you like.

640
00:43:04,487 --> 00:43:08,157
It's not impressive, it's depressing.

641
00:43:08,157 --> 00:43:10,307
   

642
00:43:10,307 --> 00:43:11,437
How can I recommend this?

643
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:14,147
What's wrong with them? These are all proper medical texts.

644
00:43:14,147 --> 00:43:16,157
Look, this book is about gynecology.

645
00:43:16,157 --> 00:43:18,597
Girls like you should learn about it.

646
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,207
If you ever have symptoms, or anything...

647
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:23,787
Mom, could you please not say those words out loud?

648
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:25,467
I can't recommend this.

649
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:29,587
Why can't you recommend these? It's about the human body.

650
00:43:30,437 --> 00:43:32,117
This one's on acupuncture.

651
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:35,807
We're only in high school. We can't do acupuncture!

652
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,587
Well...

653
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,728
What about this?

654
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:44,287
The Compendium of Materia Medica. A classic.

655
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:47,477
Teach my classmates about herbal medicine? Never mind.

656
00:43:47,477 --> 00:43:48,887
Mom.

657
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,287
Don't you have any normal books?

658
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:56,517
That's right. I've only read half of this one, but I can lend it to you.

659
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:01,767
Neuropsychology.

660
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:04,327
Or I have another one about abnormal psychology.

661
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:05,727
It's even more compelling. Where did I put it?

662
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,477
Forget the abnormal one.

663
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:09,887
I'd rather choose the neuro book.

664
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:12,400
Didn't you say you wanted something different? My books are full of surprises.

665
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,927
Trust my taste!

666
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:16,307
I'll have a look.

667
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:51,290


668
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,850
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

669
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:03,770
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

670
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,840
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

671
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:17,070
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

672
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:23,360
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

673
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:31,370
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

674
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,200
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

675
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,780
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

676
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:51,480
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

677
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,440
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

678
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,560
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

679
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,380
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

680
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,840
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

681
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,110
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

682
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:19,000
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

683
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,900
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

684
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,840
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

685
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,530
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

686
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,170
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

687
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,580
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

688
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:45,760
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

689
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,160
♫  At the right time  ♫
