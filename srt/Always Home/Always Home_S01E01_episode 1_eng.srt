1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,180
   
   

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:24,780


3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,439
Huan Er!

4
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,040
It's time to go.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,959
I'm coming.

6
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,259
Goodbye, Da Huang!

7
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:33,650
 ­  

8
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,139
- Is that the one? 
 - Yes. That's her.

9
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:46,359
Yi Fan!

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,519
Mister, stop the car here.

11
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,339
Yi Fan!

12
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,100
- Mister, turn the car around. 
 - Thanks, Mister.

13
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,900
- The house is just over there. 
 - All right, no problem.

14
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,380
Yi Fan! It's been so many years.

15
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,590
I'll help you get the key.

16
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,079
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

17
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,920
Huan Er, do you remember Aunt Lin Yi Fan?

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,860
She used to hold you when you were little.

19
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,420
- Say hello. 
 - Hello, Aunt Yi Fan.

20
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,260
She doesn't remember.

21
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,360
She was so little back then. How could she remember?

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,140
This way.

23
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,600
No problem. I'll finish the paperwork before I get off work.

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,700
- Thank you. See you later. 
 - Okay.

25
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,200
Huan Er, I'm going to the hospital. Watch over things for me.

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,140
- Li Na, I'll go with you. 
 - Okay, Yi Fan.

27
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:56,160
Watch my stuff for me.

28
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,819
Hey...

29
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,280
There's bird poop on your head.

30
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,660
Here. Use this to wipe it off.

31
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,879
Thanks.

32
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,760
Did you just move in?

33
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,860
I haven't seen you before.

34
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,280
My home is right here. I guess we're neighbors now.

35
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,980
Thanks. Nice to meet you.

36
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,120
- My name is— 
 - Bye-bye.

37
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,580
 This guy... why is he so weird? 

38
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,020
 My name is Chen Huan Er. 

39
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,020
 I'm sixteen years old. 

40
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,000
 Before this, I lived in Sishui County, on the far west side of Tianhe. 

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,140
 Don't underestimate me just because I come from a small town. 

42
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,079
 I'm fully confident that I can handle this new chapter in my life. 

43
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:46,080
 After all, when I was a kid, I had my share of big moments. 

44
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,023
 Let's all congratulate Chen Huan Er. 
   

45
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:52,100
 She overcame every challenge, performed outstandingly in this academic competition, 

46
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,299
 and won the title of "Star of Sishui." 
   

47
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,619
 Chen Huan Er, tell us how you feel. 

48
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,020
 I... I'm so excited. 

49
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,959
 Louder. 

50
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,440
 I... I'm so excited! 

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,879
 Excited about what? 
   

52
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,519
 Excited to become... the Flower of Sishui. 

53
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,060
I was young back then.

54
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,940
But now, I definitely won't stumble over my words.

55
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,280
 Tianhe No. 1 High School, get ready to welcome the Star of Sishui. 

56
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,820
Students.

57
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,480
- Everyone— 
 - Quiet down.

58
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,859
Settle down.

59
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,279
I have an announcement.

60
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,240
Our class has a new student.

61
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,639
Her name is Chen Huan Er.

62
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,299
Everyone's busy studying, so I won’t give a long introduction.

63
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,600
Chen Huan Er, there's an empty seat in the second-to-last row.

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,739
- You can sit there. 
 - Okay, sir.

65
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,299
You guys, get to know each other after class.

66
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,779
- Hello. 
 - Hey, new girl!

67
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:12,099
Hello, I'm the class president. Just call me Xin Yan.

68
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,460
Where did you transfer from?

69
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
Sishui.

70
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,180
Where's Sishui? Out of town?

71
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,900
Sishui is a county.

72
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,280
Never heard of it.

73
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,900
You're just bad at geography.

74
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,300
It's the county on the far west side.

75
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,460
Class, stand up!

76
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,950
 Good morning, teacher! 

77
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,680
Good morning, students. Please sit down.

78
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,240
Students, for this month's exam we will only cover up to Required Course 3,

79
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,200
so in this class I won't review previous topics.

80
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,959
Let's get straight into the trigonometric functions of arbitrary angles.

81
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,260
Please open your math textbooks to page 53.

82
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,160
Students, we've covered these key points, tricky parts, and exam topics

83
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,920
in the previous lessons.

84
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,960
Today, we'll mainly discuss... 
    

85
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,279
how the x-coordinate stretches to four times its original length,

86
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,000
 while the y-coordinate remains unchanged. 

87
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,360
Hey, why aren't you guys eating in the cafeteria?

88
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
The school doesn't have a cafeteria.

89
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,220
Then where can I buy food outside?

90
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,400
You didn't bring lunch?

91
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,880
Let's go buy lunch together.

92
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,079
Isn't that not enough food?

93
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,639
Not for both of us. Let's go.

94
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,040
By the way, I still don't know your name.

95
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,839
Qi Qi.

96
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,179
Bring me a meat sandwich while you're out.

97
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,380
- Get it yourself. 
 - I have training.

98
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,140
Just bring it over when you're done. Thanks.

99
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,190
Jing Xi Chi. Our class's sports committee member.

100
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,180
Sports committee?

101
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,434
No wonder he looks so athletic.

102
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,514
Do you guys know each other?

103
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,600
No.

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,680
You've been so quiet all morning. I thought you were shy.

105
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:43,885
What kind of competition is the "Flower of Sishui"?

106
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,100
I saw the note you wrote this morning.

107
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,780
It's just a local academic competition.

108
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,780
Actually, it's called the "Star of Sishui," not the "Flower of Sishui."

109
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,800
I heard students from the suburban county areas are all really smart.

110
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,979
Are students from your area all academic geniuses?

111
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,879
Where did you hear that rumor?

112
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,799
I get it. You top students are all so modest.

113
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,399
To be honest, my grades are a mess.

114
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,419
Can you help a desk mate out?

115
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,700
No, you've got the wrong idea.

116
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,019
I... I'm really not that smart.

117
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,080
The Flower of Sishui... I'm counting on you for tomorrow's exam.

118
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,981
   

119
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:31,390
   

120
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,420
The new girl and her desk mate really are a perfect match.

121
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,240
One ranked dead last, the other second to last.

122
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,490
Look. Li Tian is in first place again.

123
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,420
   

124
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,020
   

125
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,519
Sorry, Qi Qi.

126
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,060
If you hadn't copied from me, you wouldn't have ended up like this.

127
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,345
Qi Qi.

128
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:11,225
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,340
I accidentally did too well.

130
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,360
If I had scored just a little lower, our names would have been right next to each other.

131
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,420
Huan Er, Qi Qi, and the sports representative. The homeroom teacher wants to see you.

132
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,340
Qi Qi.

133
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,000
What should I even say to you?

134
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,960
If you're going to copy answers, at least be a bit more discerning.

135
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,600
Her answers were completely wrong. Didn't you even notice?

136
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,840
Always trying to be clever.

137
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,440
Chen Huan Er...

138
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,879
This doesn't add up.

139
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,799
Your mom told me that back in your old school your grades were pretty good.

140
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,320
So why is it that now you don't even know the basics?

141
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,699
Give me your parents' phone number.

142
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,939
I need to call and ask.

143
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:08,779
But sir...

144
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,800
And you.

145
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,000
You did well this time.

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,799
Keep it up.

147
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,480
Whether our class average improves depends on you.

148
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,799
Don't worry, sir.

150
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,110
From now on, I won't be ranked last again.

151
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,399
Don't just stand there.

152
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,339
- Get to class. 
 - Bye, sir.

153
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,360
Jing Xi Chi.

154
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,960
- Keep it up. 
 - Got it, sir.

155
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,939
 Off to a bad start. 

156
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,220
 I have to go all out now. 

157
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,320
Mom...

158
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,480
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,540
I totally messed up my exam.

160
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,440
The school might call you.

161
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,559
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,400
 Not bad. My acting skills are still sharp. 

163
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,120
 The Flower of Sishui is back. 

164
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,540
 Go wash up and eat. I bought your favorite salt-baked chicken. 

165
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,779
Oh no...

166
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:16,280
What if I can't cry?

167
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,419
Mom...

168
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,639
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
I failed the exam.

170
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,540
If you can't cry, don't force it. Don't waste water. Your teacher called.

171
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,880
Come and eat.

172
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,740
I didn't cry.

173
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,919
Nope.

174
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,679
Good, then.

175
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,431
Sit down and eat.

176
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,680
Here.

177
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,620
It's not a big deal, right?

178
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,179
School is tough.

179
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,639
Having classmates who are better than you is a good thing.

180
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,960
The Flower of Sishui can't just wither so easily.

181
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,980
Here, eat more.

182
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,679
I'm a wilted flower now.

183
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,600
What wilted flower? You're still a budding blossom.

184
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,080
All right, enough drama. Hurry up and eat!

185
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,220
Also, next time you don't do well, don't waste water.

186
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,150
Here, have some vegetables.

187
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,220
Eat more veggies.

188
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,039
Hurry up.

189
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,279
Huan Er!

190
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,100
- Quick. 
 - Mom, where are we going?

191
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,320
To Aunt Yi Fan's house. She called and invited us over.

192
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,500
By the way, her son goes to Tianhe High School too.

193
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,779
Same age as you.

194
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,300
We'll take this chance to get some study tips.

195
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,500
Hurry up and eat.

196
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,639
Come on, hurry up.

197
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,860
This kid...

198
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,759
Coming.

199
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,600
Yi Fan!

200
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,859
Come on in, sweetie.

201
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,790
What do you have there?

202
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,320
You shouldn't have! No need to be so formal.

203
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,120
Come on. Have a seat.

204
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,200
It's getting late, where's Li Qiang?

205
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,040
He's in a meeting. The Fire Department is always busy.

206
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,019
Son, come out. Aunt Li Na is here.

207
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,919
Xi Chi, right?

208
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,360
Hello, Ma'am.

209
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,879
- You've grown up. 
  - Why is it him again? 

210
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,800
So handsome!

211
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,080
- Today, I brought Huan Er over 
  - I'm speechless. 

212
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,640
to visit. You two must be in the same school.

213
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,340
Why are you standing? Sit down.

214
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,020
Here, have a drink.

215
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,060
Look, he's back from his meeting.

216
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,200
- Speak of the devil. 
 - Jing Xi Chi!

217
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,500
How many times have I told you? Stop leaving your stinky shoes everywhere.

218
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,720
We have guests. How embarrassing!

219
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,000
Li Qiang.

220
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,039
Li Na is here.

221
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,100
Come, Huan Er.

222
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,620
- Say hello. 
 - Hello, sir.

223
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,340
Is she your daughter?

224
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,340
I can hardly recognize her now.

225
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,840
She was so young back then. Hadn't even started primary school yet.

226
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,220
- So many years have passed. 
 - Sit down.

227
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,900
- Sit, sit. 
 - Now, our kids are finally together.

228
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,470
That's right. But if that's the case, don't let our rascal corrupt her.

229
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

230
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,640
Like Li Na just said, kids need encouragement.

231
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,600
Li Qiang, you can't talk like that.

232
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,980
They're all good kids.

233
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,119
Today, I brought Huan Er here to learn from Xi Chi.

234
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,239
Since school just started, she's having a little trouble keeping up.

235
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,780
You're asking the wrong person. When it comes to studying, my son—

236
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's just say he's good at sports.

237
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,380
Xi Chi, hurry up.

238
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,159
Go to the kitchen and wash the fruit that Aunt Li Na brought us.

239
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,939
All right.

240
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,700
Huan Er, be a good girl and go help him.

241
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,220
I suppose you're staying here for good?

242
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,939
That's right. We're finally together now.

243
00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:00,220
It's good to have someone living in the same complex to rely on.

244
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,919
The knife's over there. Cut it.

245
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,580
Don't forget to wash it first.

246
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,640
Huan Er.

247
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,939
Your eyes look a little swollen.

248
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,460
Don't tell me you cried because you didn't do well on the exam?

249
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,699
- I was just— 
 - No need to explain.

250
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,800
It's fine. Nothing to be ashamed of.

251
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,160
It's just that there's no need to cry over a test.

252
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,219
Want to guess what I scored on my high school entrance exam?

253
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,079
Dead last?

254
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,880
Good guess.

255
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,340
So, just so you know...

256
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,699
I was always a mid-tier student in middle school.

257
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:41,839
You're already doing great.

258
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,419
You and Qi Qi... are you close friends?

259
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,780
Why are you asking?

260
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:57,338
You acted like you didn't want to know me at school.

261
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,335
That was because you acted like you didn't want to know me.

262
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:05,440
Come on, answer me. Are you two close?

263
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,160
Yes.

264
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,997
Stop eating. There won't be any left for our parents.

265
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,020
- Mind your own business. 
 - Jing Xi Chi!

266
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,640
Stop bullying her.

267
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,880
- Act like a man, will you? 
 - I didn't, Dad.

268
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,979
I was just having a discussion with Huan Er.

269
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:30,900
Starting tomorrow, she can walk to school with me and Song Cong.

270
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,060
It's safer.

271
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,680
That's wonderful!

272
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,019
- The apples are ready. 
 - I heard that Song's kid is a top student.

273
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,100
Of course.

274
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,796
Let me tell you, he's exactly like his father.

275
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,780
Always ranked first in every exam.

276
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,367
Do you think academic success is genetic?

277
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,739
I really think so. It's all in the genes.

278
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:54,699
Aunt Li Na, how about I ask Song Cong to tutor Huan Er?

279
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,140
That would be great.

280
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,780
If you need any help, just let me know. No need to be shy.

281
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,300
Now that's more like a real man.

282
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,460
 I'm running late. 

283
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,080
 Mom, I'm off to school! 

284
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:54,900
Everyone's here today.

285
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,819
Let me introduce you.

286
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:01,320
This here is Chen Huan Er, Aunt Li Na's daughter.

287
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,360
She's under my care.

288
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,060
She'll be walking to school with us from now on.

289
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,799
Hello.

290
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,340
Hello.

291
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,980
She's the one who helped you get out of last place?

292
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,526
Did you all have breakfast?

293
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:20,820
These are wild vegetable buns from Sishui.

294
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,340
- Want to try one? 
 - Sure.

295
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,100
What kind of vegetable is this? It tastes weird.

296
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,629
My grandpa grew these himself.

297
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,180
- If you don't like it, give it back. 
 - I never said it.

298
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,170
- Give it back. 
 - It's pretty good. Let's go.

299
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,020
We're running late.

300
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,380
If you don't like it, just leave it here.

301
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,620
- It's fine. 
 - Leave it...

302
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,450
It's really good.

303
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,410
Song Cong, when you have time, tutor her a bit.

304
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,060
You should join too.

305
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,300
I'll think about it.

306
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,460
All right. I'll find some time to list out this semester's key topics.

307
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,480
Then we can all study together.

308
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,559
Well then, thank you, Mr. Song.

309
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,200
What are you standing there for? Hurry up and thank our teacher.

310
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,060
If you don't, he might charge you.

311
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,900
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Song.

312
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,226
No problem.

313
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:25,540
Isn't my little brother obedient?

314
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:28,119
Who's your little brother?

315
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,859
Chen Huan Er!

316
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,200
Qi Qi.

317
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,820
Why are you coming from that way?

318
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,699
I thought you lived in the new district.

319
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:00,600
Did you move?

320
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,340
You guys...

321
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,500
The three of us live in the same residential compound.

322
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,580
Hello.

323
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,540
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

324
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,660
I'm Qi Qi. Huan Er is my desk mate.

325
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,100
I went to No. 3 Middle School too.

326
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,780
I knew about you back then.

327
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,920
I remember your essay was even selected as an exemplary piece, right?

328
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,900
You guys went to the same middle school?

329
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,019
Why do you act like strangers?

330
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:27,300
There were hundreds of students in our grade. Not every place is a tiny town like Sishui.

331
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,140
We had hundreds of students in Sishui too.

332
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,940
Oh wow, impressive! So did you know every single person in your grade?

333
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,860
Why does that mean they had to know each other?

334
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,891
All right, enough. Can you stop teasing her?

335
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:38,060
You want to speak up for her?

336
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,699
If so, then join us commoners in the regular class.

337
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,400
Not happening.

338
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,790
My grades aren't bad enough.

339
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:49,460
By the way, my dad just sent these from abroad.

340
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,259
I thought I'd share them with my classmates. Here.

341
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:54,500
Try one.

342
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,841
Are those Danish butter cookies?

343
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:01,900
Delicious.

344
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,431
Song Cong, have one too.

345
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,642
I've had them before.

346
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm heading off now.

347
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,334
Why is he walking that way?

348
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:13,754
Didn't you hear me?

349
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:16,140
He's not an ordinary student. He's in the international program.

350
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,269
His classes are in another building.

351
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,420
Let's hurry. The homeroom teacher is giving a public lecture.

352
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,300
We mustn't be late.

353
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,540
- Let's go. 
 - No way.

354
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,620
Mr. Xu is giving a public lecture again?

355
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,560
Now I'll never get the chance to take a nap.

356
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,419
And that little guy with glasses is going to try to stand out again.

357
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:34,900
For sure, he's going to be like, "Sir! Sir!"

358
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,060
So annoying!

359
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,219
What does he mean?

360
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,459
You'll find out later.

361
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:44,112
All right, class. Turn to page 51.

362
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:45,699
Sir, I know this one! I know the answer, sir!

363
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:48,533
Sir, I can do this one!

364
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:54,832
Why don't we give other students a chance?

365
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:01,732
Chen Huan Er, explain how to solve this problem.

366
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:18,912
Since A equals 4, B equals 3, and C equals 2, the largest angle is A.

367
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:25,932
According to the rule, we can deduce that kaosign A equals B...

368
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,713
What are you laughing at? What's so funny?

369
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:35,173
Math exams don't test pronunciation.

370
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,293
Chen Huan Er, continue.

371
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:50,632
Equals... B squared plus C squared, minus A squared, divided by 2AB.

372
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:54,432
Equals negative one-fourth.

373
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:58,813
So... so the answer is D.

374
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:09,212
Uncle, where are my instant noodles? I have training later.

375
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,292
Thanks, Uncle.

376
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:13,932
No problem.

377
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,060
Didn't we say we'd study together?

378
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,965
I said I'd think about it.

379
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:22,560
Stop thinking. You agreed to help Chen Huan Er.

380
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,052
- Hurry up and go study. Come on. 
 - No, I have training later.

381
00:25:26,052 --> 00:25:27,073
I have things to do.

382
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:28,700
You help her first, okay?

383
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,260
She's struggling with her studies. Help her out. Just go.

384
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,103
Don't come back, just go.

385
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,653
- Help her out, all right? 
 - Fine, carry on.

386
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:36,813
She really needs help. Go and tutor her.

387
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:44,872
Daniel Lin was waiting at the airport.

388
00:25:46,853 --> 00:26:02,580
And her cousin, Liu Qian, went on a trip to Canada to visit their cousins.

389
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,692
A lot of Chinese family...

390
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,352
Families...

391
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:10,492
- Celeb— 
 - Chen Huan Er.

392
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:15,173
Celebrate... Celebrate the New Year.

393
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,133
 Did you hear? Some country bumpkin in the regular class 

394
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:21,173
 pronounced "cosine" as "kaosign" during the public lecture. 

395
00:26:21,173 --> 00:26:23,432
 - Who? 
 - Someone named Chen Huan Er. 

396
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:26,393
 Kaosign? That's hilarious. 

397
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:32,673
Celebrate...

398
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:35,473
Celebrate...

399
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:36,632
Celebrate...

400
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:43,872
A lot of Chinese celebrate the New Year together.

401
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:45,832
Ce—

402
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,020
What are you doing?

403
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,380
I'm listening to a recording.

404
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,173
Are you coming up?

405
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:55,892
Let's go.

406
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,497
- I'll get your shoes. 
 - Oh, thanks.

407
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:11,333
Have a seat.

408
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:13,313
Where's Jing Xi Chi?

409
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:16,020
Why isn't he here yet?

410
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,452
Xi Chi said we'd study together so you wouldn't feel awkward.

411
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:19,713
He's focused on training.

412
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:21,913
- He's not coming to study. 
 - What?

413
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,740
Just sit tight for a bit.

414
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:34,293
Here, this tape is for you.

415
00:27:34,293 --> 00:27:36,532
It should help you a little.

416
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:39,012
Thanks.

417
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:41,292
   

418
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,713
It seems everyone here is so good at English.

419
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:48,952
We had a head start, that's all.

420
00:27:48,952 --> 00:27:52,153
Practice more, and you'll catch up in no time.

421
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,732
- Let's start with the questions. 
 - Okay.

422
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:06,513
Try solving this question first.

423
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,241
Thanks.

424
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,872
So, in this problem...

425
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:22,713
you have to look at this triangle.

426
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:27,873
In triangle ABD, we use the cosine rule to get...

427
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,933
   

428
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:31,333
I'll write it down for you.

429
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,572
Okay.

430
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,912
Who hasn't turned in their math homework yet?

431
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:41,193
Hand it in now.

432
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,913
   

433
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,713
Isn't this Song Cong's notebook?

434
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,558
I must've taken the wrong one. I need to get it back to him.

435
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,552
- Xiao Yu, here you go. 
 - Thanks.

436
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:14,192
Song Cong.

437
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:15,913
Mr. Fu.

438
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:20,613
Can I skip this competition?

439
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:23,333
Skip it?

440
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,080
Why?

441
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,760
I've been really busy with schoolwork lately.

442
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:30,860
Song Cong, stop trying to fool me.

443
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,464
I know you too well.

444
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:38,340
For an international competition like this, whether it's English or math, besides you,

445
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,173
who else do you think I can send?

446
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:43,192
Plus, the competitors in this contest are all top-tier.

447
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:44,933
Don't take it lightly.

448
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,752
Winning first place isn't guaranteed.

449
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:53,913
Excuse me, is Song Cong in your class?

450
00:29:54,732 --> 00:29:57,993
 Why are the international class students so weird? 

451
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,953
- Excuse me, is Song Cong here? 
 - No idea.

452
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:07,672
Huan Er.

453
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,793
There you are.

454
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:10,993
Sorry, I accidentally took your notebook.

455
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:12,300
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

456
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,421
It's fine.

457
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:15,100
- Oh right, today— 
 - Song Cong.

458
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,620
I heard from Mr. Fu that you don't want to participate in the math competition.

459
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,547
Why?

460
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:22,056
- I just don't want to. 
 - If you don't want to join,

461
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:24,513
then give me your spot.

462
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,620
What were you about to say?

463
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,733
I wanted to say that I have a test after school today.

464
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,233
I might be half an hour late.

465
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,740
You and Jing Xi Chi should go home without me.

466
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,619
It's fine. We'll wait for you.

467
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:45,233
How about this? I'll hand in my paper early. You guys wait for me at the back gate.

468
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,413
You can do that?

469
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:50,352
All right then.

470
00:30:50,972 --> 00:30:52,613
Good.

471
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,872
 Got some fresh gossip about Ms. Kaosign from Class 5. Do you want to hear it? 

472
00:31:24,872 --> 00:31:26,313
Spill it.

473
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:29,780
She may look all innocent, but she's not that simple.

474
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,785
 How so? 

475
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:33,349
 She went to the international class this morning to return Song Cong's notebook. 

476
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,513
 For real? 

477
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:36,140
Why would I lie?

478
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,292
I think she went there on purpose, just to get noticed.

479
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:42,620
So people would think something is going on between them.

480
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,993
 She's only been here a few days, and she's already hanging out with Qi Qi. 

481
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:47,672
 Now she's cozying up to Song Cong too. 

482
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,112
 She's definitely not that simple. 

483
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:52,352
One hand grabs the smart ones, and the other grabs the rich ones.

484
00:31:52,352 --> 00:31:53,780
Who?

485
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,228
Class 5's social butterfly, Ms. Kaosign.

486
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:57,353
The new girl in Class 5?

487
00:31:57,353 --> 00:31:59,740
 Doesn't stand out at all, but turns out she's a socialite? 

488
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,963
 That's why she's impressive. 

489
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:05,740
No wonder the area outside the bathroom smells worse than inside.

490
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,713
 Turns out it's because some people have filthy mouths. 

491
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:10,813
What do you mean? Who are you talking about?

492
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:15,452
I'm talking about you, Class 6 guys.

493
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:19,752
Not everyone is as dark-hearted as you.

494
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,573
Jing Xi Chi.

495
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:31,112
Stop looking for trouble here.

496
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:37,413
I am looking for trouble today.

497
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,972
What about it?

498
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,532
Chen Huan Er is my friend.

499
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:49,473
Next time you gossip behind her back,

500
00:32:51,492 --> 00:32:53,352
think twice.

501
00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:56,452
Why are you acting so arrogant?

502
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:07,112
Try touching me again.

503
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,833
Jing Xi Chi, is this really necessary?

504
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,672
We were just casually talking.

505
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:16,100
Qin Liang, keep your classmates' mouths in check.

506
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,833
You should spend more time practicing instead of getting dominated by me on the soccer field,

507
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,073
then trying to act tough at school.

508
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:24,540
Forget it, Qin Liang.

509
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,772
Let's not lower ourselves to Class 5's level.

510
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,433
- Let's go. 
 - Yeah.

511
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,839
You heard everything just now, didn't you?

512
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,560
You're not crying in the bathroom, are you?

513
00:34:16,912 --> 00:34:21,293
If you had arrived a second later, I would've already thrown hands.

514
00:34:22,572 --> 00:34:24,132
Impressive.

515
00:34:25,153 --> 00:34:26,512
Don't believe me?

516
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:29,153
- My dad is a martial arts coach. 
 - Impressive.

517
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:30,953
For real.

518
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,335
I'm sorry for the wait. I came right after handing in my paper.

519
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:39,313
We've been waiting forever.

520
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:43,472
You had better make up for it, especially to our dear Huan Er.

521
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,500
What's wrong?

522
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,380
I'm fine.

523
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,597
It's all because of you.

524
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,780
You must be the last person to leave the school.

525
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,713
What? All my classmates are still here.

526
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:55,092
- What are they doing? 
 - Comparing answers.

527
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,653
They're already checking the answers right after finishing the test?

528
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,700
Just my answers.

529
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,299
So arrogant...

530
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,401
You guys are such good friends.

531
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:07,193
How come one of you is a top student and the other a slacker?

532
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:11,912
Didn't Darwin say we should respect species diversity?

533
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:13,740
Darwin never said that.

534
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,198
I'm not arguing with you.

535
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:18,033
I'm off to training. You two be careful.

536
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:26,313
Did the tape I gave you help at all?

537
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:30,052
Yeah. Thanks.

538
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:32,533
How are you adjusting to Tianhe?

539
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:36,372
Not bad.

540
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:40,353
Just now Xi Chi said I need to make it up to you.

541
00:35:40,353 --> 00:35:42,060
Did I really keep you waiting too long?

542
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,546
No. Don't listen to his nonsense.

543
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:48,253
Let's continue tutoring after dinner.

544
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,762
No need for now.

545
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,593
I don't want to trouble you.

546
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,253
I'll head home now.

547
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:18,072
I'm home.

548
00:36:36,313 --> 00:36:38,153
 I have to work overtime today. 

549
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:40,912
 I've arranged with Aunt Hao. You can have dinner at her place. 

550
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:44,152
 Let me know when you're home. 

551
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:01,392
Hello? Dad?

552
00:37:02,572 --> 00:37:04,293
What's the matter?

553
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:10,460
Yes, I've had my dinner.

554
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,313
Don't worry. Everything is going well here.

555
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:17,532
My classmates?

556
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:19,893
They're all pretty nice to me.

557
00:37:19,893 --> 00:37:22,293
All right, let's stop here for now. I need to do my homework.

558
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:24,012
Bye-bye.

559
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,872
Song Cong.

560
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:33,593
Send a message to Huan Er: ask her to come over for dinner.

561
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:35,092
Aunt Li Na is working late today.

562
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:36,772
All right.

563
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:45,933
 Huan Er, your mother wants you to come over for dinner. 

564
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:52,173
 I've already eaten. I won't come over. 

565
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:53,293
   

566
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:55,673
   

567
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:13,353
♫  I remember some beautiful things  ♫

568
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,733
Mom.

569
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:18,452
She said she already ate. She won't be coming.

570
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:20,273
What did she eat? This girl...

571
00:38:20,273 --> 00:38:24,813
♫  But happiness fades too fast  ♫

572
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:27,452
Come on, eat up.

573
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:29,393
Not coming, right?

574
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:39,713
♫  It has arrived, there's nowhere to escape anyway  ♫

575
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:46,753
♫  It has arrived, well... inexplicably  ♫

576
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:51,313
♫  I don't want to speak or eat  ♫

577
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,133
Hello.

578
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:04,573
 Where are you? 

579
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:07,452
I'm at home.

580
00:39:07,452 --> 00:39:08,572
 Liar. 

581
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:10,933
 The lights aren't even on. 

582
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,720
What's the matter? Why are you calling me?

583
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,753
 Song Cong told me you seemed a little depressed after school, 

584
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:22,153
 so I thought I'd call and check to make sure you're okay. 

585
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:23,813
Yeah.

586
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:26,800
Right now, I'm standing on top of the hospital building.

587
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,933
Looking down, it's pretty spacious. The height is just right.

588
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,693
It's perfect for jumping off.

589
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:35,333
 Don't jump off yet. 

590
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:38,972
 I need to let my dad and the others know so they can prepare for the rescue. 

591
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:40,733
I'm fine, really.

592
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:41,933
Don't worry.

593
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:43,813
 I know you're fine. 

594
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:47,132
 But look at you, after just a few laps, you're already this exhausted. 

595
00:39:47,132 --> 00:39:50,632
Your physical fitness is seriously lacking.

596
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:59,000
- What are you doing here? 
 - What am I doing here?

597
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,406
Are you kidding? This is my turf.

598
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:03,493
I've just finished my practice.

599
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:09,532
Anyway, about what happened today...

600
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,393
Thank you.

601
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,761
You're my little brother.

602
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,532
Who else would I look out for?

603
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:18,112
Fine, I owe you one then.

604
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:26,072
Have you eaten?

605
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:28,593
I have.

606
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,072
I ate a ton.

607
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:34,532
- I was just having my post-meal run. 
 - No, you haven't.

608
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,933
Fine. I'm feeling generous today.

609
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:38,972
I'll take you somewhere nice.

610
00:40:38,972 --> 00:40:40,253
Where?

611
00:40:40,253 --> 00:40:41,452
Just follow me, you'll see.

612
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:43,083
If you don't tell me, I'm not going.

613
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,813
Come with me, and I'll tell you.

614
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:46,713
Such a tease.

615
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:48,363
Come on, this way.

616
00:40:57,213 --> 00:40:59,172
Where are you taking me?

617
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:02,093
Almost there. You'll know soon enough.

618
