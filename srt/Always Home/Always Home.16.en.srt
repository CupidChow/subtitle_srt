I've finished filling it out.

18
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,340
You...

19
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,990
You check it.

20
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,630
I can't.

21
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,910
No.

22
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,620
Check it with your eyes closed.

23
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,230
Check it.

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,420
(Chen Huan'er, Overall Score: 602)
I got 602.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,790
602.

26
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,670
Is 602 awesome?

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,790
602.

28
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,700
602.

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,180
602!

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,070
You're awesome!

31
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,390
- Dad!
- Coming.

32
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,960
Dad, hurry up.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,900
Check the applications.

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,460
Here.
Check the applications.

35
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,510
Dad, we just got the score,

36
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,860
and we're choosing applications?

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,670
This is a big deal.

38
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,580
- Selecting early will make you secure.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,390
Look.

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,860
Don't you want to study pharmacy?

41
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,350
I think the major

42
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,760
(Pharmacy)
at Wuan University is great.

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
Your score is alright too.

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,700
What do you think?

45
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,230
Yeah.

46
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,740
Besides pharmacy,

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,620
there are

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,700
other easier majors.

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,020
Yes.

50
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,620
It's not that stressful.

51
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,020
And the admission score is lower.

52
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,140
You'll get admitted for sure.

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,600
Yes.

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,580
Why am I

55
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,880
only applying to this university?

56
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,140
I want to check out others.

57
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,000
Others are fine too.

58
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,620
Look.

59
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,510
This one.

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,700
My scores are enough for this.

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:58,990
Well...

62
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,460
No.

63
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,950
Not okay.

64
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,270
Yes.

65
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,580
Their

66
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,700
campus environment is average.

67
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,300
Yes.

68
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:03,700
No.

69
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,020
How did you know?

70
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,460
We've investigated it

71
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,350
thoroughly.

72
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,110
Yeah.

73
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,800
We don't think this university is good.

74
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,300
(Pharmacy)
What about this one?

75
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,140
I can get into this.

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,350
No.

77
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:16,740
Well...

78
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,670
This is not good either.

79
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,180
It's hard to graduate from this school.

80
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,510
Yes.

81
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,050
And the schoolwork pressure is too much.

82
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,180
No.

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,510
This one then.

84
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,420
I heard that this...

85
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,140
No.

86
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,740
Look at the name of this major.

87
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,670
It's really weird.

88
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,360
I think you won't be able to find a job.

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,020
- Right?
- Yes.

90
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,990
No.

91
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,300
What's going on?

92
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,220
So I can only apply to universities
within the province and not outside?

93
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,300
No.

94
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,460
She's asking you.

95
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,350
What's going on?

96
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,700
She's asking you.

97
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,950
Dad, what's going on?

98
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,950
No, Huan'er.

99
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,670
Well...

100
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,900
It's not that we're forcing you
to go to universities in the province.

101
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,510
Yes.

102
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,420
It's mainly because

103
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,020
we're a little worried.

104
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,110
Think about it.

105
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,350
If you have a headache,

106
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,830
right?

107
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,180
I can come over immediately.

108
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,830
Besides,

109
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,830
if I can't go,

110
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,860
Aunt Hao Mei,

111
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,790
Aunt Yifan,

112
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,900
and Uncle Song can go over.

113
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,180
Yes.

114
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,900
You...

115
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,390
I...

116
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,900
You're so far away from me. You...

117
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,860
You're outside.

118
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,300
Don't cry.

119
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,230
Calm down.

120
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,740
If you're really sick,

121
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,820
I can't see you

122
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,150
even if I want to take care of you.

123
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,990
Alright.

124
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,500
Don't...

125
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,500
Actually, universities outside
the province aren't bad either.

126
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,260
It's just that what should I do
if I miss you?

127
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,500
Mom, I'm just going to university.

128
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,260
I'll come back often, okay?

129
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,380
Okay?

130
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,550
Don't cry.

131
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,670
If there's no other way, I...

132
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,860
I'll apply to Wuan University, okay?

133
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,380
Wuan University?

134
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,180
Wuan University is actually quite good.

135
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,550
Yes.

136
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,470
Really.

137
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:49,820
Yes.

138
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,150
I think Wuan University is good.

139
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,180
What would you like to eat?

140
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,760
I'll make it for you right away.

141
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,350
Let's go.

142
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,710
Hurry.

143
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,860
How comfortable.

144
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,220
How did you all
fill out your university applications?

145
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,030
Jing Xichi.

146
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,670
I haven't made up my mind.

147
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,180
I'm lost.

148
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,520
Song, what about you?

149
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,790
I'm considering

150
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,760
whether to apply to Tianhe University.

151
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,500
With these scores,
you're applying to Tianhe University?

152
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,300
Why don't you go to Yenching University?

153
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,300
It's near home.

154
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,740
I can take care of my mom.

155
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,940
No. Your mom
has your dad to take care of her.

156
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,790
Besides, Aunt Hao

157
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,620
has almost recovered.

158
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,280
Haven't you wanted to go
Medical School of Yenching University?

159
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,300
Song,
why do I feel like you've changed?

160
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,380
You weren't like this before.

161
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,030
What about your ideas?

162
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,220
Out of all three years
of senior middle school,

163
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,670
you're the one who's most eventful.

164
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,640
It's you
who transferred to another class.

165
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,380
It's you
who transferred to another school too.

166
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,660
It's also you who keeps saying
you want to study medicine.

167
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,320
Why are you so timid now?

168
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,790
Yeah, Song.

169
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,420
I think Jing Xichi's right.

170
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,150
You can't give in just because

171
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,380
you're afraid to tell your mom

172
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,620
you want to study medicine.

173
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,990
Enough about me.

174
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,380
What about you?

175
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,860
Me?

176
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,180
A captive bird like me

177
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
will probably never

178
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,380
be able to escape

179
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,860
the cage of my mom's love.

180
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,740
What do you mean?

181
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,420
It means

182
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,800
my mom wants me
to apply to Wuan University,

183
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,380
saying it's close and convenient for her
to take care of me.

184
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,880
Song,
she's being sarcastic with you.

185
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,060
Don't sow discord.

186
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,940
Song.

187
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,300
That's not what I meant.

188
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,940
I really think

189
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,030
you need to think it through again.

190
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,820
I'll talk to my mom.

191
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:19,590
Go.

192
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,350
What about you?

193
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,260
Are you really
going to give in to your mom?

194
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,420
Not really.

195
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,790
I think

196
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,710
that Wuan University
is the most suitable.

197
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,860
Besides,

198
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,350
I didn't have

199
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,940
any ideas about the future.

200
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,060
I was just taking things
one step at a time.

201
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,860
But Jing,

202
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,670
I didn't expect

203
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,670
your Gaokao score

204
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,940
to be so much higher than mine.

205
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,470
Didn't Mr. Xu say

206
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,740
that grades can't determine your life?

207
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,820
But it can decide that we can have fun

208
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,840
this summer holiday.

209
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,500
How about we go out and play
this weekend?

210
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:05,790
Sure.

211
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,760
Where are we going?

212
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,040
Who do you want to invite?

213
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,060
Just tell me
who you don't want to invite.

214
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,640
I don't want to invite you.

215
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,380
Master of irony.

216
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,230
No.

217
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,080
You're stubborn.

218
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,790
No.

219
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,710
Go on being stubborn.

220
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,380
No.

221
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,460
You're still stubborn.

222
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,860
You're back.

223
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,620
What's wrong?

224
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,590
Mom, I want to

225
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,430
discuss university applications
with you.

226
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,070
No need to discuss.

227
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,430
I've discussed it with your dad.

228
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,500
We'll enroll you in Medical School

229
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,660
of Yenching University.

230
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,710
Medical school?

231
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,500
What's wrong?

232
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,430
Haven't you always
wanted to study medicine?

233
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,710
How did you know?

234
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,350
You're my son.

235
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
How could I not know?

236
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,590
You're always secretly

237
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,920
reading your dad's medical books.

238
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,860
I already noticed.

239
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,990
You father and son

240
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,620
really never give me a moment of peace.

241
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,500
One says he wants to quit smoking

242
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,680
but ends up smoking secretly
in the kitchen every day.

243
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,990
He doesn't even clean the ashes

244
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,780
after smoking.

245
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,260
The other one

246
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,430
insists on studying medicine.

247
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,430
You two teamed up to lie to me.

248
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,830
Sorry, Mom.

249
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,780
Enough.

250
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,500
Why are you apologizing?

251
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,430
Let go.

252
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,070
Let go.

253
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,830
I know why you

254
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,020
want to stay in Tianhe.

255
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,900
I'm recovering well now.

256
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,540
I don't need you to take care of me.

257
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,900
I don't want to be

258
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,500
a burden to any of you.

259
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,710
If you stay here for me,

260
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,960
I will feel guilty
for the rest of my life. You know?

261
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,470
Son.

262
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,780
You'll always make me proud.

263
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,590
Your world

264
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,160
can't be limited to just this place.

265
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,350
Mom.

266
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,230
Don't move.

267
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,007
(Name: Jing Xichi, University)

268
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,460
(First Choice: Yenching University,
Major: Computer Science)

269
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,860
Here, fruit and milk.

270
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,900
Drink some.

271
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,310
Rest earlier.

272
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,740
Stop looking at the computer.

273
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,470
Mom.

274
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,740
Tell me which university
I should apply to?

275
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,020
It's up to you.

276
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,440
I support you no matter what.

277
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,280
Even if you want to repeat your studies,

278
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,070
I support you.

279
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:23,990
Help me

280
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,780
with some advice.

281
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,620
Other parents are concerned about this.

282
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,780
Really?

283
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,430
If I make the decision,

284
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,640
will you listen to me?

285
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,190
But you can't just ignore me.

286
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,620
You've grown up.

287
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,710
I believe in your choice.

288
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,230
You'll definitely

289
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,190
choose the major that suits you best.

290
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,860
With your current score,

291
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,310
even the worst school isn't bad.

292
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,110
Just let him

293
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,430
study whatever he wants to study.

294
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,470
Enough said.

295
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,830
Let's be realistic.

296
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,760
At least study
something related to medicine

297
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,750
so that I can help him
pave the way in the future.

298
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,660
Won't that be good?

299
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,780
Go and tell him then.

300
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,740
I won't tell him.

301
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:25,100
(Certificate of Merit)

302
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,580
(English Speech Contest,
First Prize, Li Tian)

303
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,140
(English Speech Contest,
First Prize, Li Tian)

304
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,580
(Name: Chen Huan'er, University)

305
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,190
(At that time,)

306
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,190
(I had no idea)

307
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,950
(how much impact my decision)

308
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,230
(would have on my future.)

309
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,830
(I also don't know)

310
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,540
(how each of them decided in the end.)

311
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,950
(But I think)

312
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,500
(we all listened)

313
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
(to our inner voices)

314
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,990
(at that moment.)

315
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,780
(First Choice: Yenching University,
Major: Computer Science)

316
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,860
My mom wants me
to apply to Wuan University,

317
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,110
saying it's close

318
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,000
and convenient for her
to take care of me.

319
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,940
(Second Choice: Wuan University,
Computer Science)

320
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,780
I can't stand it anymore.

321
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,540
What a lousy place

322
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,190
Jing Xichi has picked.

323
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,540
The car can't even drive up.

324
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,860
How is this a graduation trip?

325
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,500
Isn't this military training?

326
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,620
Qi Qi.

327
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,990
What's in your bag?

328
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,430
It looks heavy.

329
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,380
I brought some film discs.

330
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,260
Who knew we would be hiking?

331
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,780
No.

332
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,470
I can't hike anymore.

333
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,110
I need a break.

334
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,260
I can't hike anymore either.

335
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,470
Whoever

336
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,900
wants to hike can go ahead.

337
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,470
Let me call them

338
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,110
to pick us up.

339
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,620
How did it go?

340
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,110
No one answered.

341
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,740
I'll call Li Tian.

342
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,540
I'll call Song Cong then.

343
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,310
Are we really not answering?

344
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,470
No need.

345
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,990
Would they really be fine?

346
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,310
I can guess

347
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,800
what Chen Huan'er is going to say.

348
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,830
Jing Xichi.

349
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,830
Are you out of your mind?

350
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,500
Jing Xichi.

351
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,140
What a lousy place you picked.

352
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,950
Jing Xichi, come pick us up.

353
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,260
Why don't we answer their calls?

354
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,020
Go ahead then.

355
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,740
Jing Xichi.

356
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,900
Are you out of your mind?

357
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,340
What a lousy place you picked.

358
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,260
I'll give you one minute

359
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,500
to come down and pick us up.

360
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,470
You hear me?

361
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,950
Hello?

362
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,470
Say something.

363
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,910
Victory is just ahead.

364
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,390
Good luck.

365
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,360
We'll wait for you.

366
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,060
Hello?

367
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,150
He hung up on me.

368
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,990
He's doomed.

369
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,740
When the three of them arrive,

370
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,060
we'll set off some fireworks

371
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
and surprise them.

372
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,260
Sure.

373
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,500
You're almost done blowing it, right?
Wash the fruits.

374
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,390
Jing Xichi.

375
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,800
Did you call me here just
to make me do the hard labor?

376
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,640
What's the matter?

377
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,500
You want to leave?

378
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,100
Go home
and continue to be scolded?

379
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,230
Fine.

380
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,870
I'll wash it for you now.

381
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,820
Say, if we don't invite him,

382
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,880
he'll hold a grudge.

383
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,710
We invited him, yet he still grumbled.

384
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,710
Jing Xichi.

385
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,020
Do I need to wash these oranges?

386
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,670
Why are you washing oranges?

387
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,470
You bought oranges?

388
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,580
Isn't it Chen Huan'er's favorite?

389
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,910
You know

390
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,200
what Chen Huan'er likes to eat.

391
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,520
Do you know what I like to eat?

392
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,300
I didn't know before,

393
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,710
but today I know.

394
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,710
You get jealous easily.

395
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,230
Alright.

396
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,260
Song.

397
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,390
We're the best buddies.

398
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,230
Chen Huan'er

399
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,060
is at most second.

400
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,500
I know the order

401
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,580
of first come, first served.

402
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,190
Fine.

403
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,480
I guess you have a conscience.

404
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,430
My buddy will always be in my heart.

405
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,630
Can you two say things like that

406
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,020
behind my back instead?

407
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,260
Is it here?

408
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,710
Number 33.

409
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,260
Let's go.

410
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,100
We're here.

411
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,580
They're here!

412
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,910
Phone.

413
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,060
Jing Xichi.

414
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,150
Song Cong.

415
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,990
Li Tian.

416
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,990
Is no one here?

417
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,300
Did they stand us up?

418
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,150
Jing Xichi must be

419
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,220
up to something again.

420
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,740
Let's go.

421
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Jing Xichi!

422
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,580
Jing Xichi.

423
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,710
Happy graduation!

424
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,870
What do you think? Are you happy?

425
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,780
Do you think it's funny?

426
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,710
Surprise!

427
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,230
Surprise!

428
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,780
Li Tian.

429
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,990
Don't just eat oranges
and not help with the chores.

430
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,230
Orange peel.

431
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,190
Throw here.

432
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,020
Aren't we here for holiday?

433
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,700
Let me do it.

434
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,150
After finally hiking all the way up,

435
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,470
we still have to clean up.

436
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,470
Xinyan.

437
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,870
Don't you usually love

438
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,470
having everyone clean the class?

439
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,910
Now that we're all united
in doing chores,

440
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,150
you're upset?

441
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,500
I spent two hours

442
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,300
putting on my makeup.

443
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,820
You put on makeup?

444
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,740
Let me see.

445
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,820
I drew my eyebrows
and wore blush and lipstick.

446
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,670
I can't tell at all.

447
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,910
Xinyan, you're still young.

448
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,250
Yet you're already wearing makeup.

449
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
What's wrong with that?

450
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,300
We're not
in senior middle school anymore.

451
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,060
So you're now...

452
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,390
A university student.

453
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,390
A university student?

454
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,910
Which university are you admitted to?

455
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,470
What are we then?

456
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,740
We're

457
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,300
society's idlers.

458
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,470
I agree.

459
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,150
What are we eating tonight?

460
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,340
I'm starving.

461
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,580
Work hard.

462
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,100
Work hard and you'll have food to eat.

463
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,430
Speaking of,

464
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,990
where did you all apply for university?

465
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,710
I applied to Subei Normal University.

466
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,100
Did anyone apply to Subei?

467
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,190
But I'm close.

468
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,990
Medical School of Hu University.

469
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,470
Song Cong, what about you?

470
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,150
Medical School of Yenching University.

471
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,190
Huan'er, what about you?

472
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:23,710
Me?

473
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,230
I applied to Wuan University's Pharmacy.

474
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,700
Qi Qi's going to Jing City
University of Political Science and Law

475
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,820
Jing Xichi, what about you?

476
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,870
I'm the same as Song.

477
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,430
What major?

478
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,260
Medicine?

479
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,100
No way.

480
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,340
I'm studying computer science.

481
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,470
Everyone's going

482
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,540
so far away.

483
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,910
I'm here.

484
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,300
Come over and pick a movie
you want to watch.

485
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,910
Qi Qi.

486
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,470
Why don't all of you choose first?

487
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,580
I'll go cook.

488
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,820
Huan'er, don't go.

489
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,300
Don't we have a lot of food here?

490
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,500
I specially prepared it.

491
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,670
Just give me a minute.

492
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,540
In the Mood for Love.

493
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,990
Chungking Express.

494
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,950
Buddha Mountain.

495
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,020
Qi Qi.

496
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,150
These are all art films.

497
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,580
Choose one.

498
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,150
Song Cong.

499
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,630
What do you usually watch?

500
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,190
I

501
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,630
don't know much about movies.

502
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,910
I can watch anything.

503
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,740
I'll choose then.

504
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,950
I don't watch horror movies.

505
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,260
Let's watch this one.
I've wanted to watch it for a long time.

506
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,870
Why don't we watch something else?

507
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,500
I think you guys are scared.

508
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,260
Who's scared? Let's watch it.

509
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,470
Well...

510
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,630
I'll go check on Huan'er.

511
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Chef Chen.

512
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,710
Do you need any help?

513
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,820
What are you making?

514
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,500
Is it edible?

515
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,060
I'm not telling you.

516
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,580
We have such a good relationship,

517
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,620
yet you won't tell me.

518
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,340
What relationship?

519
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,260
We're

520
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,540
buddies for life, of course.

521
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,910
Make way then, buddy.

522
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,500
I wonder how Huan'er and Xichi

523
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
are doing.

524
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,060
Let me check on them.

525
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,190
I'll check on them too.

526
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,780
Me too.

527
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,340
Pour the juice in here.

528
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,780
Wait.

529
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,260
Is this a strand of your hair?

530
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,990
How is it my hair?

531
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,800
You're laughing at me.

532
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,380
- Chen Huan'er.
- You're laughing at me.

533
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,910
Chen... You're tough.

534
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,200
You're tough now, Chen Huan'er.

535
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,470
How dare you laugh at me?

536
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,230
Why don't you wear an apron?

537
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,630
Yes, an apron.

538
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,300
The apron's...

539
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,230
Is...

540
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,340
Is this an apron?

541
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,580
Yes, I'll wear it.

542
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,820
Wear an apron.

543
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,500
Well...

544
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,670
Can you help me tie it?

545
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,390
Sure.

546
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,910
All done.

547
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,100
All done?

548
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,390
Huan'er.

549
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,260
What are you doing?

550
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,470
Do you need help?

551
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,150
I'm almost done.

552
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,780
Well... Jing Xichi.

553
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,150
Help me get the cookies out.

554
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,990
Wear gloves.

555
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,500
Okay.

556
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,340
What's this?

557
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,190
I want to play too.

558
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,950
Me too.

559
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,390
Come in.

560
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,630
Crack the eggs first.

561
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,470
I'll teach you.

562
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,710
Here.

563
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,300
Okay.

564
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,580
I'll put it here.

565
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,260
Take the eggs.

566
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,740
Add it in here?

567
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,500
Yes. Then, throw the trash in...

568
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,020
You didn't wear gloves?

569
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,470
I didn't.

570
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,670
Why didn't you wear gloves?

571
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,340
Are you okay?

572
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:46,990
I'm fine.

573
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,630
Are you okay?

574
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,780
Leave it there.

575
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,780
Or leave it here instead.

576
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,100
Here they come, friends.

577
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,150
We're drinking this today.

578
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,060
You only prepared this much liquor?

579
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,470
Are these not enough?

580
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,740
I didn't expect Xinyan
to be able to handle her liquor.

581
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,390
But it's okay.

582
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,150
We have more.

583
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,910
I don't drink this.

584
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,990
Drinking will only affect
personal cultivation

585
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,820
and social harmony.

586
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,780
Yes, you're right.

587
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,150
Coming.

588
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,670
Here.

589
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,190
Put it here.

590
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,910
Here.

591
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,340
What are these?

592
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,950
Qi Qi.

593
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,500
This is yours.

594
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,780
This

595
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,190
is a rabbit.

596
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,060
Yes, it's the rabbit you like.

597
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,910
Looks quite similar.

598
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,430
Xinyan.

599
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,990
This is yours.

600
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,390
This is

601
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,990
a flower?

602
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Yes.

603
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,630
I know you like roses,

604
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,260
but I made it

605
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,300
into a tulip.

606
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,820
It looks good.

607
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,910
Song Cong.

608
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,740
This is yours.

609
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,340
What's this?

610
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,150
Doraemon?

611
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:55,950
Yes.

612
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,150
How is this Doraemon?

613
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,150
None of your business.

614
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,260
Because you always respond to requests,

615
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,630
just like Doraemon,

616
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,740
who is powerful.

617
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,230
Chen Huan'er.

618
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,100
Making a dog bone

619
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,230
for Li Tian

620
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,820
doesn't seem like a good idea.

621
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,780
Li Tian.

622
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,540
This elephant is for you.

623
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,670
I hope you can bravely pursue

624
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,910
your great ambitions.

625
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,580
Thank you.

626
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,190
Is this dog bone

627
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,870
mine?

628
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,300
Yes, it's yours.

629
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,580
I made two more.

630
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,500
There's also a piglet.

631
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,180
Which one?

632
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,420
I don't want any of them.

633
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,260
Forget it then.

634
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,220
I'll eat them myself.

635
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,940
I'll choose one.

636
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,080
I'll choose the piglet.

637
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,580
It really looks like you.

638
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,630
Burping and farting.

639
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,580
Huan'er.

640
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,840
You put so much thought into this

641
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,300
that I'm a little reluctant to eat it.

642
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,880
Yeah.

643
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,950
Actually,

644
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,950
I have a lot to tell all of you.

645
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,430
I'm actually very envious of you

646
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,100
for being able to go to universities

647
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,340
so far away from home.

648
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,740
I...

649
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,190
I want to say

650
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,950
I hope we can always be friends

651
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,870
and be together.

652
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,020
Huan'er.

653
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,390
Here's a toast.

654
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,240
I understand.

655
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,100
Li Tian.

656
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,320
Here's a toast to you too.

657
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:26,780
Okay.

658
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,740
Let's toast together.

659
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,740
Together.

660
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,780
- Here. Cheers.
- Cheers.

661
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,100
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

662
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,910
Cheers.

663
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,540
Huan'er.

664
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,580
Actually,

665
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,740
transportation is so convenient now.

666
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,630
If you want to meet

667
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,670
everyone,

668
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,710
we can meet anytime.

669
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,820
Huan'er.

670
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,950
People who really care about you

671
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,910
won't be defeated by distance.

672
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,990
Everyone.

673
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,190
Don't make the vibe

674
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,260
so sentimental.

675
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,100
Here. Keep drinking.

676
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,500
Here.

677
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,300
Drink.

678
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,230
- Here.
- Wait.

679
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:04,820
Wait.

680
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,900
Didn't you say you wouldn't drink

681
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,520
because you were worried it might
affect your personal cultivation?

682
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,190
Why are you

683
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,420
the one drinking the most now?

684
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,950
Alcohol really makes cowards brave.

685
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,100
Who are you calling a coward?

686
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,470
I'm calling you a coward, Li Tian.

687
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,630
Do you dare to drink with me?

688
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,340
What's there that I'm afraid of?
Here, drink.

689
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,230
- Come on.
- Come on.

690
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:19,870
Together.

691
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,580
Cheers.

692
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,910
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

693
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,820
- Happy Graduation!
- Happy Graduation!

694
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,190
Eat one.

695
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,100
Here, Jing Xichi.

696
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,870
Continue drinking.

697
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,870
Hurry up.

698
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,260
Drink.

699
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,470
You make so much noise, Li Tian.

700
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,020
Drink.

701
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,780
Hurry up.

702
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,540
Shut up.

703
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,990
If you ask me,

704
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,060
everyone here

705
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,390
except me...

706
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,950
Everyone counts.

707
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,710
You're all cowards.

708
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,870
Do you really think

709
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,670
I can't see through your schemes?

710
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,820
I'm the third-best in class.

711
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,190
I'm smart.

712
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,060
What are you laughing at?

713
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,470
What are you laughing at?

714
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,670
You.

715
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,540
And you.

716
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,710
You.

717
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,150
And you.

718
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,670
You.

719
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,300
And you.

720
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,470
Why are you laughing? Xinyan.

721
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,150
You.

722
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,470
And you.

723
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,630
And me?

724
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,300
Do you really think I can't tell?

725
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,190
I saw through

726
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,470
all your schemes.

727
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,470
You didn't think

728
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,190
you hid it well, did you?

729
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,020
Song.

730
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,260
Your ABCs.

731
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,740
You're a coward.

732
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,950
What are you pretending to be?

733
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,910
Wait.

734
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,300
Is there anyone who can tell me

735
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
what on earth is he talking about?

736
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,300
Li Tian.

737
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,740
What's gotten into you?

738
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,390
What about you?

739
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,710
I...

740
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,740
A wise man never falls in love.

741
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,910
Drink with me. Here.

742
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,340
Here. Drink.

743
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,020
It's too hot.

744
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,740
I'm going out to get some fresh air.

745
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,540
Here.

746
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,300
Drink.

747
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,020
I'll go with you.

748
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,230
Let's go.

749
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,520
Did you finish drinking yours?

750
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,780
Stop drinking.

751
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,910
What's the matter?

752
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,330
Let's go upstairs
and get some fresh air.

753
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,340
Getting fresh air is a good idea.

754
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,990
Keep drinking, Jing Xichi.

755
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,340
No, drink later.

756
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,100
Wait for me to come back.

757
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,910
Are you giving up?

758
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,670
Are you giving up?

759
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,720
Let him accompany me upstairs
to get some fresh air.

760
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,820
Let's drink, Xinyan. Come on.

761
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:53,870
Let's drink.

762
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,820
Slow down.

763
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,910
Here. Go.

764
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,670
I... Song.

765
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,950
Let me sit down for a while.

766
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,470
Sit over there.

767
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,950
Are you okay?

768
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,060
No.

769
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,390
Jing Xichi.

770
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,220
How long have we known each other?

771
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,830
Quite a long time.

772
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,540
What's wrong?

773
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,790
Then you should know

774
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,060
my character.

775
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,140
If you ask me about others,

776
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,390
I'm really not too sure.

777
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,750
But you...

778
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,750
You're just

779
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,350
a big bad wolf

780
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,750
pretending to be innocent.

781
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,990
Yes.

782
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,950
Since I was little,

783
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,790
I would always work hard to get

784
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,700
what I wanted.

785
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,500
But it's different this time.

786
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,660
I have concerns this time.

787
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,750
Because you're my best friend.

788
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,100
So here's a question

789
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,700
I have to ask you.

790
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,580
Do you like Chen Huan'er?

791
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,060
Huan'er.

792
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,830
I like Song Cong.

793
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Actually,

794
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,500
I already knew.

795
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,060
Is it that obvious?

796
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,270
No.

797
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,470
It's not.

798
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,470
Actually,

799
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,990
it's quite obvious.

800
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,470
I know.

801
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,660
Do you like Song Cong?

802
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,660
Song Cong and I?

803
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,220
We're just friends.

804
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,310
Well...

805
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,950
In your eyes,

806
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,870
are Song Cong and Jing Xichi

807
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,390
the same kind of friends to you?

808
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,750
Let me ask this.

809
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,060
If Song Cong and Jing Xichi

810
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,740
fell into the water at the same time,

811
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,000
who would you save first?

812
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,060
Your question is so old-fashioned.

813
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,620
Look at the era we're in.

814
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,310
Answer it seriously.

815
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,790
Well...

816
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,180
Well, I...

817
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,390
I will take out my phone

818
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,700
and film them.

819
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,790
I will save

820
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,830
whoever pays me.

821
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,700
Qi Qi.

822
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,060
Is it because of Song

823
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,580
that you have a grudge against me?

824
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,100
Yes,

825
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,580
but not much.

826
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,060
It was mainly because

827
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,140
you were so close back then.

828
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,580
I felt like an outsider.

829
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,620
Haven't I told you

830
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,870
about this?

831
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,270
Let's not talk about the past then.

832
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,910
What do you think of Jing Xichi?

833
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,270
What do you mean?

834
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,310
I mean...

835
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,020
Do you think he likes you?

836
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,060
He likes me?

837
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,270
Why will he like me?

838
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,660
He and I are just buddies.

839
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,620
Are you two

840
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,830
buddies like us?

841
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,910
How...

842
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,950
How could we

843
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,350
be the same?

844
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,700
Besides,

845
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,700
no matter who I like,

846
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,500
it definitely won't be Chen Huan'er.

847
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,500
I'll go find her then.

848
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,830
Who are you going to find?

849
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,620
Huan'er.

850
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,350
Song.

851
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,140
Jing Xichi.

852
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,240
I have something to talk to you about.

853
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,350
Chen Huan'er.

854
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,750
Song.

855
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,180
Huan'er.

856
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,470
Well, I have something else to do.

857
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,790
Qi Qi, talk to Song first.

858
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,180
I got to go.

859
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,790
Huan'er.

860
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,060
I have something to say to you alone.

861
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,060
You and me?

862
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,310
I'll step away then.

863
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,790
I also have something to tell you.

864
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,140
Qi Qi.

865
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,180
No, Qi...

866
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,100
What's the matter, Song?

867
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,470
Chen Huan'er.

868
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,430
I like you.

869
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,990
What did you say?

870
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,180
You're the most optimistic

871
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,140
and cheerful person

872
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,580
I've ever met.

873
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,830
I've liked you

874
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,100
for a long, long time.

875
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,790
I

876
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,660
deliberately asked Song Cong questions

877
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,100
just to get closer to you.

878
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,990
Now,

879
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,310
Gaokao has ended.

880
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,470
I want to ask you

881
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,060
if you would be my boyfriend.

882
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,390
I should have told you this
a long time ago.

883
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,140
In my eyes,

884
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,620
you have always been
the most special one.

885
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,270
Huan'er, I'm serious.

886
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,060
I don't want to be Doraemon

887
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,580
and be nice to everyone
indiscriminately.

888
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,620
I just want to be good to you.

889
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,830
No, Song. I...

890
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,180
I always thought

891
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,310
the two of us

892
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,870
were just friends.

893
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,870
I think

894
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,620
we should just stay friends.

895
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,060
I'm sorry.

896
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,020
Xinyan.

897
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,580
Jing Xichi, I hate you.

898
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,660
You...

899
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,950
Don't... You...

900
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,540
I... Where are you going?

901
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,310
Liao Xinyan.

902
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,700
Xinyan.

903
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,140
Hurry back.

904
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,620
Where are you going?

905
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:36,950
Song Cong.

906
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,620
Qi Qi.

907
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,270
Can your matter

908
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,350
wait until tomorrow?

909
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,350
I just want to ask you a question.

910
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,060
If it's Huan'er

911
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,310
that you like,

912
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,910
why did you leave that sentence

913
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,990
in my notebook?

914
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,910
What sentence?

915
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,660
I hope it will last forever

916
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,830
in my time.

917
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,470
You mean The Fountainhead?

918
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,870
I...

919
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:16,990
I wrote that

920
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,020
for a friend.

921
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,540
I'm sorry.

922
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
(That night,)

923
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,750
(I rejected Song Cong.)

924
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,470
(Song Cong rejected Qi Qi.)

925
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,950
(Jing Xichi rejected Liao Xinyan.)

926
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,140
(Only Li Tian)

927
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,870
(had a good chat with Shakespeare.)

928
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,830
Cupid is blindfolded

929
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,350
but breaks into people's hearts.

930
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,870
Cupid.

931
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,140
Li Jianjun.

932
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,060
I'm going to put it out there today.

933
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,580
I won't study medicine.

934
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,060
(Sure enough.)

935
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,100
(It's a truth that a wise man
doesn't fall into the river of love.)

936
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,220
(But even if there's no river of love,)

937
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,180
(there will always be other rivers)

938
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:27,180
(that we need to cross ourselves.)
