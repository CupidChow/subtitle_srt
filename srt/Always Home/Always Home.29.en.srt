Jing.

18
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,990
Hello? What's the matter?

19
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,510
What are you doing?

20
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,110
I just got back to the dorm.

21
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,400
How are you after joining a big company?

22
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,900
I'm alright.

23
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,390
Why does your tone

24
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:20,830
sound a little down?

25
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,222
I just have a small problem.

26
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,950
Currently,

27
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,230
the company wants Yangwu to transform.

28
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,350
Transform?

29
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,950
That's not their attitude

30
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,350
when they recruited you.

31
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,990
Why the sudden transformation?

32
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,990
From the company's perspective,

33
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,990
projects are about making money.

34
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,270
I can understand that,

35
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,460
but

36
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:44,866
I don't want to compromise.

37
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,180
Don't compromise then.

38
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,740
I believe in you.

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,860
Got it.

40
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,300
How about you? How are you?

41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,390
Me?

42
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm fine.

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,830
I ran into Tian Chi just now.

44
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,990
We're under the same supervisor.

45
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,088
Maybe we'll do experiments together
in the future.

46
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,860
Do your experiments then.

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,070
Would you mind?

48
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,670
If you mind,

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,510
then...

50
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,390
I'm not that stingy.

51
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,390
As long as it's good for your studies,

52
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,790
I support it.

53
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,790
Okay.

54
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,790
Alright.

55
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,088
I'll go back to work now.

56
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,200
Take care of yourself.

57
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,150
Don't exhaust yourself.

58
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:33,900
You too.

59
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,700
I love you.

60
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,790
Love you too.

61
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,830
Bye.

62
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,860
Bye.

63
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,990
Senior Gao.

64
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,460
I've sorted out the data you want.

65
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:48,377
I'll leave it here.

66
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,110
Okay.

67
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:50,110
By the way, Chen,

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,422
did you collect the packages?

69
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,140
They're here.

70
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,550
Here.

71
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,460
Check this out.

72
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,350
Help me check

73
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,070
the thesis data.

74
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,222
Give me as soon as possible.

75
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:02,090
Also, help me organize my petri dish
observation records

76
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,155
in the next two weeks.

77
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,140
Sure.

78
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,830
And

79
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,700
help me write

80
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,990
two research reports.

81
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,900
Make sure

82
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,020
there are no typos.

83
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,950
Senior Gao.

84
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,500
That's inappropriate.

85
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,820
You have to write it yourself.

86
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:23,180
Just write it when you're told to.

87
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,940
But this is against the rules.

88
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,620
I'll do everything else
you ask me to do.

89
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,860
But if this matter

90
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,110
is discovered,

91
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,550
we'll all get criticized.

92
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,500
What do you want then?

93
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,150
Sorry, Senior Gao.

94
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,550
I can't help you with this.

95
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,380
I'm really sorry.

96
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:52,777
Senior Gao.

97
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,940
Huan'er

98
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,350
didn't mean to offend you.

99
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,990
She just speaks her mind.

100
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,350
Don't take it to heart.

101
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,230
Tian Chi.

102
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,150
What's your business here?

103
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:02,180
How about this?

104
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,470
I'll help you

105
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,620
when I'm done.

106
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,180
You'll help me do it?

107
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,129
Is the work I assigned her

108
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,950
appropriate
for a first-year graduate student?

109
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,977
Why can others do it

110
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,940
but she can't?

111
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,300
She's a girl.

112
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:14,622
Take extra care of her.

113
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:15,822
So what if she's a girl?

114
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,300
If you think the work
I arranged is unreasonable,

115
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:20,740
you can talk to the professor.

116
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,110
Senior Gao.

117
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,060
That's not what I meant.

118
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,710
Enough.

119
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,866
You don't need to attend
the clinical pharmacy forum

120
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,311
at the end of the year.

121
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,350
Why?

122
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,180
You tell me.

123
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,800
Because you have to
take care of your junior!

124
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,940
Take good care of her.

125
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,670

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,430
Do you want to try again?

192
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,900
Try again.

193
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,140
Yes!

194
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:38,578
Yes!

195
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,470
(Only after growing up)

196
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:50,070
(do we understand)

197
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,660
(that we're just
ordinary people in life.)

198
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,540
(Right and wrong)

199
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,140
(sometimes become blurred.)

200
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,660
(And some answers)

201
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,020
(don't seem that important.)

202
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:43,780
(What are you doing? I'm going to bed.)

203
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:52,500
Thank you for telling me so many things.

204
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,860
Do you think

205
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,860
there's anything

206
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,266
that can be improved on our website?

207
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:57,600
What's wrong with you?

208
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,110
Don't you see what time it is?

209
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,830
Sorry.

210
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:05,977
(Babe:
What are you doing? I'm going to bed.)

211
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,940
(Sorry, I was busy
and didn't see the notification.)

212
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,860
Xichi.

213
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,590
We only

214
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,622
have this left to call.

215
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,500
Let's stop here today.

216
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:21,822
It's too late.

217
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,990
We'll disturb people.

218
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,310
Besides,

219
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,350
we've basically

220
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,500
gone through all the users.

221
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,230
Most of them are owners

222
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,380
of second-hand bookstores.

223
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,140
They have no real value.

224
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,260
I have an interesting one here.

225
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,230
Highly active,

226
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,844
but doesn't have a lot of transactions.

227
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:37,309
They mostly buy niche books.

228
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,311
I'll send it to the group for you
to take a look.

229
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:43,755
The final decision-making meeting
is just around the corner.

230
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,500
We haven't gotten any idea yet.

231
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,860
Are we packing up

232
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,311
and leaving just after joining?

233
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,590
It's late.

234
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:54,155
Let's take a break first.

235
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,140
Goodbye, Fu Ying.

236
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Light Messenger?

237
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,260
What a pretentious name.

238
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,830
Xichi, are you not leaving?

239
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,060
(User Data, User ID: Light Messenger)

240
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,350
Hello?

241
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,430
Good morning.

242
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,500
Good morning.

243
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,020
Well...

244
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,830
I was too busy yesterday.

245
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,260
I didn't see your message in time.

246
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,190
You won't be mad at me, right?

247
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,070
I'm mad.

248
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,990
Just kidding.

249
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,590
By the way,

250
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,200
how have you been these past two days?

251
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:55,190
Have you solved it?

252
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,350
Not yet.

253
00:14:58,244 --> 00:14:58,900
What about you?

254
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,350
You called me yesterday.

255
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:01,288
What do you need?

256
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,780
Nothing.

257
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,780
I just wanted to hear your voice.

258
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:08,990
You missed me?

259
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,260
How about I

260
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,230
record

261
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,190
a wake-up call

262
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,860
or a phone ringtone for you?

263
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,350
Forget it.

264
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,244
(Backend Homepage, User Data)
If I hear your voice,

265
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,780
I won't be able to get out of bed.

266
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,780
These two days,

267
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,260
I somehow...

268
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:27,900
Huan'er.

269
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,860
Sorry.

270
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,279
(User Data)
I have another meeting here.

271
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,430
I'll go to the meeting first.

272
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,430
Can I call you back?

273
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,140
Get to work then.

274
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,590
I'm going to the lab soon.

275
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,070
Okay.

276
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,830
Bye.

277
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,190
What's wrong?

278
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:22,488
Do you have a stomachache?

279
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,710
Maybe I'm hungry.

280
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,590
I'll just go back and eat something.

281
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,200
Why don't you go back and rest?

282
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,444
I'll take care of the rest.

283
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,110
I'm fine. I also need this data.

284
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,740
Huan'er.

285
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,670
Huan'er.

286
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,780
Huan'er.

287
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,540
Huan'er!

288
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,150
Huan'er.

289
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,540
Huan'er.

290
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,780
Fu Ying.

291
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,300
You haven't found Light Messenger?

292
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,710
No, I contacted them.

293
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,311
They're always out of the service area.

294
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:45,844
It's time for lunch.

295
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,710
Eat first.

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,190
I'm so busy that I forget.

297
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,911
I'll go eat first.

298
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,300
Go ahead.

299
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,300
The number you dialed is unanswered.

300
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,060
Please call again later.

301
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,740
Sorry.

302
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,190
The number you dialed is unanswered.

303
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,150
You finally picked up.

304
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,888
What are you doing? Why did you keep...

305
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,430
Are you in the hospital?

306
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:41,630
You're not feeling well?

307
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,670
My gastroenteritis has flared up.

308
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,844
I feel much better
after getting an IV drip.

309
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,910
Gastroenteritis?

310
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why did you suddenly
get gastroenteritis?

311
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,311
Did you eat something
that upset your stomach?

312
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,340
My stomach was upset yesterday.

313
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:58,111
I thought I'd be fine
after a good night's sleep.

314
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,630
Why didn't you tell me?

315
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,820
I didn't think it was a big deal.

316
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,020
How are you feeling now?

317
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,150
If I could be by your side...

318
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,910
Huan'er.

319
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:25,644
I just bought you some porridge.

320
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,777
Eat it while it's hot.

321
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,630
Thank you.

322
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,390
Tian Chi.

323
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,990
I thought you left.

324
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,820
No.

325
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,430
Was it Jing Xichi?

326
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,060
Yes.

327
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,990
Eat it while it's hot.

328
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,750
Eating it
will make your stomach feel better.

329
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:44,711
You can't faint again.

330
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,950
Thank you, Tian Chi.

331
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,100
I've troubled you enough today.

332
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,820
You should go back and rest.

333
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,780
Sure.

334
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:54,488
You should rest early too.

335
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,740
Thank you.

336
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,990
You fainted?

337
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,020
In the lab today.

338
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,710
Tian Chi happened to see me

339
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,950
and sent me to the hospital.

340
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,390
Which hospital are you in?

341
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll ask Yan Mu to accompany you.

342
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,060
No.

343
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,670
I can take care of myself.

344
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,820
You should handle Yangwu's affairs.

345
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,820
Rest

346
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,150
a bit longer then.

347
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:29,444
Call me if anything happens.

348
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,150
Bye.

349
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,710
Bye.

350
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,377
Why are you back so early today?

351
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,300
What's wrong?

352
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,430
Chen Huan'er fainted
due to gastroenteritis.

353
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,780
Tian Chi sent her to the hospital.

354
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,780
Why were they together?

355
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,150
No.

356
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,390
I'm really worried.

357
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:25,511
I have to go back to see her.

358
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,820
Isn't your decision-making meeting
the day after tomorrow?

359
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,733
Are you going back now?

360
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,340
Chen Huan'er

361
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,430
needs me the most right now.

362
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:32,733
I have to go back to see her.

363
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,780
Well...

364
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,200
It's late, and there's no train.

365
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,600
How are you going to go back?

366
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:40,600
Driving license.

367
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,230
I'll rent a car back.

368
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,910
Okay, go ahead.

369
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,200
You have my support.

370
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,540
I'll go now.

371
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,630
Take your time.

372
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,340
Take your time.

373
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,910
Press it.

374
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,300
Thank you.

375
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,190
Huan'er.

376
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,710
Tian Chi.

377
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,300
Why are you still here?

378
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,580
I'm worried about you being here alone.

379
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,150
Let me send you back.

380
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,260
I feel much better now.

381
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:37,400
I can walk on my own.

382
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,100
Let's go.

383
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,710
We're here.

384
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,430
Sorry for bothering you today.

385
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,950
I'll go upstairs first.

386
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,780
Okay.

387
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:04,266
If you don't feel well again,

388
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,390
remember to tell me.

389
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:43,755
Thank you
for taking care of my girlfriend.

390
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,870
Sorry to bother you.

391
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,230
Huan'er is my junior.

392
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,990
It's my job to take care of her.

393
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,430
I will take good care of Chen Huan'er.

394
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,340
Next time this happens,

395
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,630
you don't need to worry.

396
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,670
Are you sure?

397
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,060
If Chen Huan'er

398
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,300
faints in front of me again,

399
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,430
you want me to ignore her?

400
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,780
Jing Xichi.

401
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,020
If you really love Chen Huan'er,

402
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:21,955
how come you didn't even know
she was sick?

403
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,470
You weren't by her side

404
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,933
during her most difficult times.

405
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,230
You have no right

406
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,955
to stop others from being nice to her.

407
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,540
Hello? Senior Gao.

408
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,390
What's wrong?

409
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:01,020
Hurry and pack your things.

410
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:02,555
Follow me to Tonglin City tomorrow

411
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:04,480
for a growth survey
of medicinal plants in the wild.

412
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:06,666
We'll be staying over,
so bring some change of clothes.

413
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,630
Why so sudden?

414
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,190
Can I not go first?

415
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:11,820
No.

416
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:12,870
It's been arranged.

417
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,230
Here's the thing, Senior Gao.

418
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,300
I just got back from the hospital.

419
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,710
I'm not feeling well.

420
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,630
Can I go in two days?

421
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,260
Our experiment

422
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,377
can't be postponed
just because you want to rest.

423
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,950
Senior Gao.

424
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,390
What do you mean by that?

425
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,670
Even if it's delayed,

426
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,230
it's because

427
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,260
you didn't plan

428
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,580
and notify in advance.

429
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,020
Fine. Chen Huan'er.

430
00:25:31,088 --> 00:25:32,390
If you really don't want to go,

431
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,430
I'll find someone else.

432
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,670
But I'm not sure

433
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,600
whether you can
get the credit for this project.

434
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,340
No.

435
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:39,733
I did everything I should have done

436
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:41,880
and things I shouldn't have done
in this experiment.

437
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,060
Who are you to deny my credit?

438
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,311
Just because I'm the person in charge
of this project.

439
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,060
Okay.

440
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,470
Got it.

441
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:03,933
(I'm downstairs.)

442
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,340
Why are you here?

443
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,670
When did you come?

444
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,230
You're sick.

445
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,755
I want to come back to see you.

446
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,340
How are you?

447
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:30,780
Still feeling unwell?

448
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm fine now.

449
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,190
By the way,

450
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,580
how's your proposal going?

451
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,870
I haven't finished writing it yet.

452
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,260
Well...

453
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,060
Why don't you hurry back to work?

454
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:48,190
So you don't want me

455
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,244
to come back and see you?

456
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,390
No.

457
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,670
That's not what I meant.

458
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,100
What I mean

459
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,550
is that I don't want you to miss work

460
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:55,377
because of me.

461
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,740
Chen Huan'er.

462
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,150
I don't want to be

463
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:01,888
the last one to know that you're sick.

464
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,955
I don't want Tian Chi to be the one
to take you to the hospital

465
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:06,300
and accompany you back to the dorm

466
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,300
instead of me.

467
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,710
I didn't let him send me.

468
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,190
He was waiting at the hospital.

469
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,630
What do you mean by that?

470
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
You don't trust me?

471
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,390
I trust you.

472
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:28,740
I think you just don't trust me.

473
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:30,044
What are you agitated about?

474
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:31,060
I'm not agitated.

475
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,910
Didn't you say it yourself?

476
00:27:34,244 --> 00:27:35,555
If it weren't for Tian Chi,

477
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:36,377
would you have come?

478
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,444
I'll come, of course.

479
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,230
With you being so busy,
will you usually come?

480
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,222
When I said I miss you,

481
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:41,866
did you come?

482
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:43,020
So do you think I came back

483
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,933
because of Tian Chi?

484
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,577
Yes!

485
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,150
Do you know we haven't

486
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,910
had a good talk for a long time?

487
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,020
I also don't want

488
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,060
to have to see your updates

489
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,511
through Fu Ying's social media.

490
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,910
Chen Huan'er.

491
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,060
I've tried very hard.

492
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,066
I'm under great pressure every day

493
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,060
just to finish it quickly

494
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,066
and come back to see you.

495
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:14,777
And then what?

496
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,710
As soon as I came back,

497
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,488
I saw Tian Chi
sending you back to the dorm!

498
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,670
I've tried very hard

499
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,020
to control my emotions.

500
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:21,990
And then what?

501
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,580
When I came back

502
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,500
and we met,

503
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,466
the first thing you said
was to let me leave!

504
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,340
That's not what I meant!

505
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,190
Can you be more mature?

506
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,260
Jing Xichi.

507
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:35,190
Are you the only one
who's tired every day?

508
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,630
I'm tired too.

509
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,300
I attend classes

510
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:42,311
and do experiments every day.

511
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,622
I also have to go to the mountains
for research tomorrow.

512
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,190
I'm really tired.

513
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,820
Answer it.

514
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,150
Hello?

515
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,100
We found Light Messenger.

516
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,150
They're in Wu'an.

517
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,780
Send me the address.

518
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,820
I'll go find them.

519
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,580
Okay, I'll send you the address.

520
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,230
Alright.

521
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,260
Bye.

522
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,340
Huan'er.

523
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,670
I don't want to argue with you.

524
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,390
You should hurry back.

525
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:45,780
I know that Yangwu's project

526
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,950
is important to you.

527
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,190
Don't delay your work because of me.

528
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,950
I'll go back to pack my things.

Are you Light Messenger?

543
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,540
Hello?

544
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,910
Hello.

545
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,710
Light Messenger?

546
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,470
Hello.

547
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,710
My name is Jing Xichi.

548
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,870
The founder of Yangwu.

549
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,300
Sorry

550
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,020
to bother you.

551
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,230
My colleague

552
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
should have told you

553
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,060
why I'm here, right?

554
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,060
It's mainly because

555
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,910
Yangwu encountered
some difficulties recently.

556
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:17,311
We're facing transformation.

557
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,340
You've been a regular user
of our website.

558
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,950
Among all users,

559
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,780
your login rate

560
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,820
and activity level

561
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,990
have always been very high.

562
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,670
That's why I want to see

563
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,390
if you

564
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,555
can give us any advice.

565
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,670
Actually,

566
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,190
I want to see you too.

567
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,580
Meet me?

568
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,190
Why?

569
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,300
I want to thank you.

570
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,500
I'm

571
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,540
not very good

572
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,580
at dealing with others.

573
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,950
I used to stay at home every day.

574
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:51,390
I'm not talkative either.

575
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:52,540
I'm either reading a book

576
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,300
or looking at the stars
with a telescope.

577
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,910
I first registered Yangwu

578
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:57,990
because

579
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,020
I lacked money.

580
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,580
Astronomy books are quite expensive.

581
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,710
I can't afford it.

582
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,300
I can only look for old books

583
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,670
that are sold at a discount.

584
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,230
I didn't expect

585
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:12,300
to meet a group of like-minded buddies
on Yangwu

586
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,630
by accident.

587
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,990
I used to like astronomy very much

588
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,100
because I think

589
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,710
every star is far away.

590
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,870
The stars are lonely.

591
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,022
The same goes for people.

592
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,060
But Yangwu gave me friends.

593
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,820
It made me realize

594
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,710
that as long as each star

595
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,780
illuminates one other,

596
00:33:34,844 --> 00:33:36,644
they can gather
into the brightest galaxy

597
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:37,540
in the dark night.

598
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:52,540
(The Meteorological Observatory
issues an orange warning.)

599
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:54,822
(There will be typhoons and heavy rains
in some areas.)

600
00:33:54,844 --> 00:33:56,844
(Please stay safe when you're out.)

601
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,140
Sorry.

602
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,700
The user you're calling

603
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,140
is temporarily unavailable.

604
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,580
Please call again later.

605
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,870
Sorry.

606
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,500
The user you're calling

607
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,830
is temporarily unavailable.

608
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,310
Please call again later.

609
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,620
Hello?

610
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,390
Hello?

611
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:33,911
Do you have Tian Chi's phone number?

612
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,990
Yes. What's the matter?

613
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:35,660
Send it to me.

614
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,190
I can't get in touch with Chen Huan'er.

615
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,060
Okay, I'll send it to you.

616
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:47,910
Hello?

617
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,790
Hello? Tian Chi?

618
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,100
I'm Jing Xichi.

619
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:52,266
Do you know where Chen Huan'er is?

620
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:54,555
She went to Tonglin Village
to do research.

621
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,620
Tonglin Village?

622
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,555
(Soil Fertilizer
Nutrient Level Rapid Tester)

623
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:05,177
By the way, Chen Huan'er,

624
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,222
take a work photo for me.

625
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,500
Three,

626
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,350
two,

627
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,430
one.

628
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,270
All done.

629
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,180
Okay.

630
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,270
Take a look.

631
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,620
Not bad.

632
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,100
Okay.

633
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,140
Keep an eye on it here.

634
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,540
Wait.

635
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,620
What about you?

636
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,990
I'll go to the village and hand out
the questionnaires.

637
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,620
Handle this first.

638
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:38,777
I'll come find you later.

639
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,540
Okay?

640
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,270
Lu.

641
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,620
No...

642
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,500
- Let's go.
- Okay.

643
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,950
Hello? Jing.

644
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:02,600
I have Yangwu's proposal
for the meeting,

645
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
but I can't go back.

646
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,111
Go to the meeting with Zhou Ye.

647
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,020
Me?

648
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,140
Where did you go?

649
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,888
Something happened to Huan'er.
I'm going to find her.

650
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,580
But you're the one in charge of Yangwu.

651
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:13,466
Is it appropriate
for me to take your place?

652
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:14,311
It's okay.

653
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:15,220
We're all a team.

654
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,990
Besides, you've done no less for Yangwu
than I have.

655
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:19,270
If it weren't for you,

656
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,777
Yangwu wouldn't be where it is today.

657
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,580
What should I say then?

658
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,755
It's raining so hard,

659
00:37:03,777 --> 00:37:05,510
but you're going up
for scientific research?

660
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:06,580
It's too dangerous.

661
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,060
The weather was good just now.

662
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,577
Who knew the weather on this mountain
would change so quickly?

663
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,470
Yeah.

664
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,700
The mountains around Tonglin Village

665
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:15,620
are too dangerous.

666
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,060
There was a wildfire here
many years ago.

667
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,470
A firefighter

668
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:20,700
was trapped in the mountains

669
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,180
and never came out.

670
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,060
He never came out?

671
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,580
Who is it?

672
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:47,844
Where's Chen Huan'er?

673
00:37:47,977 --> 00:37:49,769
She went up the mountain
to collect samples.

674
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,750
No news of her after that.

675
00:37:50,755 --> 00:37:51,622
I can't reach her.

676
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:52,750
Letting her go alone today?

677
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,020
The weather was fine this morning.

678
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,690
Who knew
it would suddenly start to rain?

679
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:56,533
Don't worry.

680
00:37:56,555 --> 00:37:58,311
Maybe her phone
just doesn't have a signal.

681
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,377
Do you even have a heart?

682
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,350
You...

683
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:01,700
You...

684
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,060
Jerk.

685
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,580
Chen Huan'er!

686
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,140
Chen Huan'er!

687
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,140
Chen Huan'er!

688
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,540
Chen Huan'er!

689
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,870
Chen Huan'er!

690
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,350
(Retreat first.)

691
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,660
(Retreat.)

692
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,790
(Hurry up!)

693
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,830
(Catch up.)

694
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,220
(Hurry.)

695
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,020
(Hurry and retreat!)

696
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,700
(Xichi.)

697
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:42,990
(Xichi.)

698
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:45,830
(Thank you for your hard work
over the years.)

699
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,750
(You're really a grown-up now.)

700
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,750
Drink something hot.

701
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,620
Warm yourself up.

702
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,500
Thank you.

703
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,830
There's no signal here.

704
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,830
I just tried.

705
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,200
It's late now. It's dangerous
to descend the mountain.

706
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,488
Let's wait till dawn.

707
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:14,220
What is this place?

708
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,660
This is our supply stop

709
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,660
for sample collection.

710
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,870
Why did you come here suddenly?

711
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:26,133
I couldn't get in touch with you.

712
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
So I called Tian Chi.

713
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,750
He said you went to Tonglin Village.

714
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,470
I heard

715
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:34,244
and couldn't care about anything else.

716
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,270
Are you okay?

717
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:37,700
You're not hurt, are you?

718
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,430
I'm fine.

719
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,270
What happened to you

720
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,950
just now?

721
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,220
I'm fine.

722
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,790
Wait here.

723
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,060
Take this.

724
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,950
What's this?

725
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,540
This is the vegetation soil
after the fire.

726
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,790
After the fire,

727
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,540
the vegetation restoration period

728
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,000
can be as short as a dozen years

729
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,790
or as long as several decades.

730
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,060
It's a very long process,

731
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,910
but

732
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,500
it continues to grow

733
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,310
even if it looks barren.

734
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,990
One day,

735
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,220
it will return

736
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:41,660
to its original lush appearance.

737
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:46,870
Huan'er.

738
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,020
Sorry.

739
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,060
I shouldn't have

740
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:56,180
lost my temper with you yesterday.

741
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,540
It's all over now.

742
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,022
Let's not mention it anymore.

743
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,180
This is nice.

744
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,500
It seems like

745
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,700
we haven't sat together
quietly like this

746
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,990
for a long time.

747
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,220
In these past few days,

748
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,620
I've been thinking

749
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,060
whether my decision to leave Wu'an

750
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,430
for Jing City

751
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,020
was right or wrong.

752
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,310
It's true

753
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,990
that I've been busy this month,

754
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,430
but it's also true

755
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,955
that my heart feels empty.

756
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,220
When I was in Wu'an,

757
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,620
my favorite thing of the day

758
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:00,140
was to take the subway for half an hour

759
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,580
at 6:30 PM

760
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,790
and change buses three times

761
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,310
so that I could go across the city

762
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,750
to see you.

763
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,140
But after arriving in Jing City,

764
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,910
there's no bus

765
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,470
or subway

766
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,350
that can take me to you.

767
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,910
I feel the same way.

768
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,830
I've already regarded

769
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,270
Wu'an as my other home.

770
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,700
But since you left,

771
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,350
I just feel

772
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,350
that even the most familiar places

773
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,500
have become unfamiliar.

774
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,180
Chen Huan'er.

775
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,870
Will you regret

776
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,950
being with me?

777
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,470
Have you lost your mind?

778
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,470
Do you know

779
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,060
why I'm called Chen Huan'er?

780
00:45:23,422 --> 00:45:25,733
Because I was always hospitalized
when I was a kid.

781
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:27,540
The nurses wouldn't
call patients' names.

782
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,180
They only called the patient in bed 3

783
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,620
or the patient in bed 5.

784
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,500
Whenever my mom

785
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,870
heard these words,

786
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,430
she would be frightened.

787
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:38,830
But my mom said

788
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,660
since we're stuck with it,

789
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,830
we'll try to turn the bad

790
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,350
into good.

791
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,950
That's why

792
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,390
those words

793
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,400
became my name.
[*Patient sounds like Huan'er in Chinese]

794
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,990
She hopes I can

795
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,660
grow up happily

796
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,310
amidst laughter and joy.

797
00:45:58,955 --> 00:46:00,977
I've been thinking about it
over the years.

798
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:02,870
Am I happy?

799
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,310
I didn't know before,

800
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,500
but now I know.

801
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,660
I'm quite happy.

802
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,470
Especially after meeting you.

803
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,020
You never reject

804
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,270
my weird ideas

805
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,350
and always

806
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,660
support me silently behind me.

807
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,310
(Maybe you're a little unreliable)

808
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,870
(in the eyes of outsiders.)

809
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,350
(But in my eyes,)

810
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,910
(your unreliability)

811
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,140
(is exactly what I need.)

812
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,660
That's why

813
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,750
I'm grateful to have met you.

814
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,620
I also cherish our relationship.

815
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,500
I don't regret it.

816
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,580
Chen Huan'er.

817
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,830
I love you.

818
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,310
Why so sentimental?

819
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,060
Jing Xichi.

820
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,140
I love you too.
