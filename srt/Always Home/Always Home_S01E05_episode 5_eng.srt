1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:20,790


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,720
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver.  ♫

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,980
   
   

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,160
Cong! Xi Chi!

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,320
- Aunt Chen. 
 - Are you waiting for Huan Er?

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,420
- Were you doing grocery shopping? 
 - Yes.

20
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,080
What are you cooking for lunch?

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,780
Stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs.

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,370
Chen Huan Er!

23
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,810
Look at the time. What took you so long today?

24
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,327
I pulled an all-nighter reading.

25
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:11,927
Are you that diligent?

26
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:14,167
   

27
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,557
Neuropsychology?

28
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:19,007
I think you're pretty neurotic.

29
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:22,237
You don't know. This book is earth-shattering.

30
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:25,237
Whoever gets it is so lucky.

31
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:29,507
- What do you mean? 
 - Do you know what the Einstellung effect is?

32
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:33,287
What nonsense are you talking about? That sounds like a swear word.

33
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,047
The Einstellung effect.

34
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:40,487
It's a mechanized state of mind that will affect how you act later.

35
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:41,797
Amazing.

36
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:42,837
You even know that.

37
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:45,487
As expected from the top student.

38
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:48,227
So what does it mean?

39
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:50,677
Let me show you.

40
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:53,507
Fine. But do you know how to do that?

41
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:03,047
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't move.

42
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:06,597
That's painful, Chen Huan Er! What are you doing?

43
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,927
What are you doing, Chen Huan Er?

44
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,637
This is the Einstellung effect.

45
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:16,197
In layman's terms, it's called predisposition.

46
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:19,107
You could've just told me. Why did you attack me?

47
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,607
I was afraid you wouldn't understand.

48
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:24,077
Young man, you should study more.

49
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,667
Let's go.

50
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:29,007
Cong, what book did you choose?

51
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,117
The Catcher in the Rye.

52
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,287
What kind of book is that?

53
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:35,487
No, Chen Huan Er.

54
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:38,807
You just wanted to attack me, right?

55
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:48,947
Lin Shuang, this is for you. I hope you like it.

56
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,757
What can you achieve with romance?

57
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,237
Don't just spray it.

58
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:13,927
First, you need to find out what scent the person you want to give the book to likes.

59
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:16,157
You have to get it right.

60
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,727
You should cut it out.

61
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:29,757
You're making the air all musty with this nonsense. I can already feel my allergies acting up.

62
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,237
I made this scent myself.

63
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,647
I just sprayed it.

64
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,797
The after-note smells amazing.

65
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:36,197
You have no taste at all.

66
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,847
I don't want to have the same taste as you.

67
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,087
You are so annoying!

68
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:41,237
Why are you so different from Song Cong?

69
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,557
Song Cong, do you want to decorate your book?

70
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,997
I'm just going to hand it in as it is.

71
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:49,317
Jing Xi Chi, do you have any newspapers?

72
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,727
I want to decorate my book too.

73
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:54,137
Thank you.

74
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:56,997
Does anyone need a book wrapper?

75
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,287
Give me one.

76
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:00,437
- Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

77
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:12,647
 This book makes me understand my mind even better. 

78
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,757
 It sounds weird, right? 

79
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:16,487
 You'll understand after reading it. 

80
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:21,197
 I hope you have as much fun reading it as I did. 

81
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:53,197
Qi Qi.

82
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:54,997
What are you looking for?

83
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,967
Is there a book you want to find?

84
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,147
Let me help you with that.

85
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,287
It's okay. I just don't know which book to choose.

86
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,877
Have you made up your mind?

87
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,437
Not yet.

88
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,757
I still want to look around.

89
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:16,197
Are you sure Song Cong chose The Catcher in the Rye?

90
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:17,560
You've already asked me so many times.

91
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,847
I'm sure. He told me himself.

92
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:21,437
So, I'm sure.

93
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:25,277
By the way, why do you care so much about him?

94
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,640
I'm not.

95
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,797
Our class is about to start soon. Let's go.

96
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:33,487
I'll choose this one. This book is huge.

97
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,527
Huan Er, let's go.

98
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,147
I'm coming.

99
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:40,027
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:49,467
   

101
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:01,357
   

102
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:02,757
Are you kidding me?

103
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:05,572
Who chose these College Entrance Examination Mock Tests?

104
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:08,040
We study three years of senior high for the college entrance exam.

105
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,437
May you score well after getting this book.

106
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:15,317
Li Tian. Are you crazy? You're too obsessed with studying.

107
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,927
I won't read this book. I'll return it later.

108
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:21,997
I'll let others suffer through it.

109
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:31,167
The Catcher in the Rye?

110
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,647
You have quite good taste.

111
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:37,447
But unfortunately, Salinger is not one of the leading English literature authors.

112
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:40,347
Mind your own business. I like it.

113
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,147
    
  (T/N: Counting in fives using the character 正.) 

114
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,807
   

115
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:59,477
 She took the long way around just to talk to him. 

116
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:03,957
 It was just a simple question, but she made him spend so much time teaching her. 

117
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:08,277
 She even used her position to secretly keep his book for herself. 

118
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:21,477
 It feels like my favorite dress in the display window is being coveted by someone else 

119
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:22,887
 who has paid the deposit for it. 

120
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:25,157
 She is already one step ahead. 

121
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:41,517
   

122
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:45,307
   
   
   

123
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,547
   

124
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,527
   

125
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,670
 Is she talking about me? 

126
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,747
   

127
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:34,277
What does this even mean?

128
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:41,899
According to the class group, the Book Exchange Event will end soon.

129
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,187
Remember to return the book.

130
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:48,587
I'm still at the prologue.

131
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,167
Help me return this book.

132
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:59,267
I have a match in two days, and I think we'll have extra training every day.

133
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:01,987
You actually took a book from the exchange?

134
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,167
It's none of your business.

135
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,587
I haven't asked you. What book are you reading?

136
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,317
History of Medicine?

137
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:12,837
It looks like a book from one of our classmates.

138
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:14,647
This is my book.

139
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,957
I didn't pick up any book from the Book Exchange Event.

140
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,407
I didn't find anything I wanted to read.

141
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:22,797
I couldn't find that Neuropsychology book either.

142
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:28,067
What is this smell in the book? It's choking me.

143
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,220
It's perfume. You don't understand.

144
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,747
You don't understand the beauty of perfume.

145
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:34,247
I thought you disliked perfume.

146
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,837
Yes.

147
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:42,477
I just don't like the type of perfume that’s too overwhelming.

148
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:44,827
This one is different.

149
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,197
This is the smell of knowledge.

150
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:53,827
After smelling it, it can purify and resonate with my soul.

151
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:56,957
I'll get going now.

152
00:12:56,957 --> 00:13:00,557
Write something meaningful on the front of my book.

153
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:05,477
Make it look sincere and deep.

154
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,367
Make sure your writing is nice too.

155
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,347
You can write it now.

156
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,347
Why so serious all of a sudden?

157
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:16,007
What should I write?

158
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:19,767
Let me see. Find a good quote.

159
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,187
What about this?

160
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:24,107
This one? I don't think it's good enough.

161
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:26,207
Then let's choose another.

162
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:29,597
This one. This one. What do you think?

163
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:32,297
I think this will do.

164
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,560
Where can it be?

165
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:41,597
I lost my nerve...

166
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:44,007
Aren't your nerves in your mind?

167
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,597
No.

168
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:49,047
I'm talking about that amazing book of mine.

169
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,557
Maybe they haven't returned it yet.

170
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:53,747
Where is my nerve-book?

171
00:13:57,407 --> 00:14:00,527
Isn’t this Song Cong's book?

172
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:04,437
I don't know who took it. I haven't read it.

173
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,347
You can read it now.

174
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:12,867
It's shameful to spy on someone else's privacy...

175
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,197
   

176
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:23,987
"Make sure you marry someone who laughs at the same things you do..."

177
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:36,077
Qi Qi.

178
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:39,627
Qi Qi.

179
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:43,837
What's wrong?

180
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:45,797
Nothing.

181
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:48,597
Have you found your book?

182
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,947
No.

183
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:54,127
It must be because my book is too interesting.

184
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,347
So that person doesn't want to return it.

185
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:01,957
By the way, what book did you choose?

186
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:04,557
Can I read it?

187
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:06,757
Go ahead.

188
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:09,767
   

189
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:14,197
"Thank you for showing me how to be true to myself.

190
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:19,527
I hope I can be a star in the light of your life."

191
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,317
This comment is good.

192
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,917
And the handwriting is...

193
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,837
Isn't this Song Cong's handwriting?

194
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:30,197
Really?

195
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:34,027
Yes. It looks exactly like the handwriting in Song Cong's notes.

196
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:35,917
Show me.

197
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:54,490
 That time, I didn't understand why Qi Qi 

198
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,820
 would be so happy over a short paragraph. 

199
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:27,717
Well... After my training later, I'll go to Cong's house to study.

200
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:29,957
Bye, Huan Er.

201
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,797
Qi Qi.

202
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,560
Are you reading?

203
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,120
Bye.

204
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,717
Huan Er, are you going to study later?

205
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,517
Can I join?

206
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:46,557
The tuition class my mom signed me up for isn't good.

207
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:49,000
Sure. This is great!

208
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,517
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

209
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:09,127
Song Cong.

210
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:13,327
Can you lend me The Catcher in the Rye that you offered at the Book Exchange Event?

211
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,147
Sure.

212
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,327
I love this book too.

213
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:24,907
I think you can resonate well with the protagonist, right?

214
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,187
I'm coming.

215
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,437
You're here quite early today.

216
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,557
Where were you?

217
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,757
I went to buy a handbook.

218
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:45,517
You bought a handbook?

219
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:47,237
Mind your own business.

220
00:17:47,237 --> 00:17:48,367
What did you buy? Show me.

221
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,407
- Wait. 
 - Show me.

222
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:52,277
Wait. I bought it to improve my grade.

223
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:54,040
I can't show it to you. You can buy it yourself.

224
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,887
You're so petty. Fine. I won't read it.

225
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:59,627
- It's not that precious. 
 - Then don't look.

226
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,167
Qi Qi, you must be tired after all that studying.

227
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,600
I bought these chicken wings for you.

228
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,197
Eat some and keep studying hard after.

229
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,640
Thank you.

230
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,864
But I don't think I need them this time.

231
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:28,037
I got a pretty good grade this time.

232
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:31,327
It means those chicken wings actually worked.

233
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,647
If I can improve after eating these wings, I want to try them too.

234
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,167
Wait. What are you doing?

235
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,607
They may work for Qi Qi, but they may not work for you.

236
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:41,887
Qi Qi, can you give me one?

237
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,647
Let's share them.

238
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:45,520
See? Qi Qi agreed to give me one.

239
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,480
- Eat it. 
 - Eat.

240
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,847
Qi Qi.

241
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:54,237
How many people did you surpass this time?

242
00:18:54,237 --> 00:18:55,717
Didn't you check?

243
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,647
Around ten people.

244
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:59,807
That's good.

245
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,557
That's good.

246
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,347
What about you?

247
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:11,717
I failed again this time.

248
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,477
I got last place.

249
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:15,437
Pray for yourself.

250
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:17,967
There'll be a parent-teacher conference this time.

251
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,127
A parent-teacher conference?

252
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,477
Says who?

253
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:24,807
Mr. Xu.

254
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:27,957
You all know about that?

255
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,807
I'm doomed.

256
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,037
Here goes my new phone.

257
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,275
This is delicious.

258
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:42,167
Of course.

259
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,997
It costs five yuan.

260
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,237
Eat more.

261
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:01,480
Mom.

262
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,023
You won't attend the parent-teacher conference, right?

263
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:06,677
I have a business trip tomorrow.

264
00:20:06,677 --> 00:20:09,517
I'll inform your homeroom teacher about it.

265
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:23,860
   

266
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,107
   
   

267
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:01,997
My fellow parents,

268
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:05,037
have you read the transcript? 
    

269
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:08,327
We can objectively check your children's

270
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,407
current learning progress. 
    

271
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:14,127
Song Cong in our class always has good grades.

272
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:15,607
His performance is consistent.

273
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:20,037
There are also some students like our new transfer,

274
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:21,167
Chen Huan Er.

275
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:23,887
Although her foundation isn't as good,

276
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:27,647
she has been catching up and improved tremendously.

277
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:32,407
However, there are a few students in our class who aren't doing well.

278
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:36,867
Their grades fluctuate like our blood pressure.

279
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:40,717
Their grades show exactly how much they must be slacking off.

280
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,517
Don't think that sending your children to school will solve everything.

281
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:48,200
Don't just count on the teachers to educate them.

282
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,113
You have to supervise them at home too.

283
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:54,237
Jing Xi Chi's mom.

284
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,107
What do you think?

285
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,747
Mr. Xu.

286
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:10,567
I think it's quite normal that their examination results

287
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,080
fluctuate from time to time.

288
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,237
Although Li Tian doesn't have that issue.

289
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:18,037
He did quite well this time.

290
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:21,647
How about I share with everyone how we did it?

291
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:24,077
Okay. Please go ahead.

292
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:34,087
Actually, when it comes to educating our children,

293
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,717
we have to be supportive and encouraging.

294
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:39,347
It's very important to pay attention to their mental well-being.

295
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:42,237
We cannot break their confidence.

296
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,167
Li Tian has always been proactive in his studies.

297
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,167
I'm really thankful to you today.

298
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,407
Just now, my mind went blank.

299
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:51,957
I would be the same if I were you.

300
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:53,807
I can't believe their homeroom teacher.

301
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,327
How can he be so callous?

302
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:57,887
Moreover, this kind of ranking is problematic too.

303
00:22:57,887 --> 00:23:01,087
In my opinion, they should do this in private.

304
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:05,237
Exposing everyone's results like this is like a public trial.

305
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:07,517
Actually, the teachers are doing it for the students.

306
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:09,347
There's a reason for this ranking.

307
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,327
I can only blame my son for being too bad at his studies.

308
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,237
I'll teach him a lesson when I get back.

309
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:16,997
I feel so embarrassed today.

310
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:18,717
You can't be like this.

311
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:20,887
No matter what, he is your son.

312
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:24,367
Your child will never look down on you, so you shouldn't look down on him either.

313
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:29,517
Li Tian only got second place this time. But what can I say?

314
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:32,907
Is second place not good enough?

315
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,957
Oh, yes.

316
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,087
A family of doctors should aim for first.

317
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,367
So, it's expected of him.

318
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,087
Yes.

319
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:47,927
Getting second place is like failing the imperial examination.

320
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:54,277
Dr. Li wants me to organize a family meeting to come up with a solution.

321
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:59,807
If it wasn't for Dr. Li's reputation, I wouldn't make him study so hard.

322
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:03,567
Yes, it's not easy for you either.

323
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,477
Let's go.

324
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:16,587
I'll get going now. Bye.

325
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:19,567
What are you doing?

326
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,517
You bought me milk tea and strolled around with me.

327
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:23,957
Huan Er.

328
00:24:23,957 --> 00:24:26,437
I treat you fairly.

329
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:28,517
Right?

330
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:30,657
Are you sure?

331
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:33,477
I bought chicken wings for you yesterday, right?

332
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:35,127
Did you buy them for me?

333
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:38,037
- Did you eat them or not? 
 - I just ate a wingtip.

334
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:39,197
What about the milk tea?

335
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:41,197
I treated you twice.

336
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:44,907
Shouldn't you do me a favor?

337
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:49,647
What do you need?

338
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:51,607
You don't have to do anything.

339
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:54,927
You just have to come with me and leave everything to me.

340
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:58,427
Anyway, my life is in your hands now.

341
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,437
No.

342
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:04,997
- Chen Huan Er, just give me a hand. 
 - I want to go home.

343
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:06,757
Your home is just nearby.

344
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:07,847
Let's go.

345
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:10,087
Huan Er, help me. I really need your help.

346
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:11,167
What are you doing?

347
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:13,197
I swear I'll take you home right after this.

348
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:14,387
- Mom. 
 - Don't worry.

349
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,927
Mom.

350
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:17,867
Let's go.

351
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,427
   

352
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:31,887
Jing Xi Chi.

353
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:34,880
How dare you come back?

354
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,710
You...

355
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,167
You are here too, Huan Er.

356
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,997
Aunt Lin.

357
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,567
I don't understand.

358
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:52,167
How did you score so badly?

359
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,807
Studying is easy.

360
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:54,957
You just have to study.

361
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:57,407
How did you get this result? Tell me.

362
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:58,757
I'm sorry, Mom.

363
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,087
I'm an unfilial child.

364
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:01,847
I've embarrassed you.

365
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:05,367
But look, I brought Huan Er over to help me study.

366
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:07,477
I want to study hard too.

367
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:09,037
We'll get back to studying now.

368
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:10,287
We have to study now.

369
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:12,047
- I... 
 - Let's go and start studying.

370
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:14,667
- What are we studying? 
 - We'll study now.

371
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:24,107
Have a seat.

372
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,437
Why did you bring me to your house?

373
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:36,677
Isn't it obvious?

374
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:38,037
To help me with my studies.

375
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:39,647
I didn't do well on the exam this time.

376
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:42,757
But I need to placate my mom.

377
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:46,037
If I ask Cong, he'll be very serious about it.

378
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,407
But I don't expect you to teach me anything.

379
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,717
You can just do your homework here.

380
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:52,407
Are you looking down on me?

381
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:55,907
I'm more than capable of tutoring you.

382
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:12,317
What is this?

383
00:27:12,997 --> 00:27:16,127
You left this political history question blank.

384
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:18,567
I take it you were too lazy to memorize it.

385
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:22,740
But what about the physical chemistry questions?

386
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,277
They asked the same thing.

387
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:28,120
You got the multiple-choice questions right, but you failed the longer problem-solving ones.

388
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,101
You expect me to believe you're that dumb?

389
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:33,237
I am that dumb.

390
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:38,037
Why did you get bad grades on purpose?

391
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:40,080
Chen Huan Er, tutor me if you can.

392
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,080
If not, don't blame me.

393
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:45,757
Aunt Lin.

394
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:49,007
- Aunt Lin. 
 - Chen Huan Er.

395
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,087
Hurry up and come back.

396
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,477
What are you doing? Why are you so nervous?

397
00:27:52,477 --> 00:27:54,717
Why are you so nervous?

398
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,327
Actually, it was like this.

399
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:01,957
I just randomly picked the answers for the multiple-choice questions.

400
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:05,520
I was just lucky to get them right.

401
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,220
Are you not going to tell me the truth?

402
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,237
- Aunt Lin. 
 - Chen Huan Er.

403
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,717
I don't want to get better grades than Qi Qi.

404
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:23,567
Don't tell Qi Qi about it.

405
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:27,127
Don't tell anyone.

406
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:28,920
Promise me.

407
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,550
Okay.

408
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,693
That's more like it.

409
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:34,513
Do your homework.

410
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:47,880
 Although Jing Xi Chi told me his secret, 

411
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,840
 I don't know why my heart feels heavy. 

412
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:57,757
 It seems like everyone's relationships have become complicated. 

413
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:04,327
 Sometimes, ignorance is bliss. 

414
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:22,277
Neuropsychology.

415
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:23,367
Huan Er.

416
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,387
Are you looking for a book?

417
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,807
I still can't find the book I offered at the Book Exchange Event.

418
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,887
By the way, my book is called Neuropsychology. Have you seen it?

419
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:34,327
I looked around to see what everyone took.

420
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:36,437
But I didn't see yours.

421
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:39,517
Did someone from another class take it?

422
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:41,757
Really?

423
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,367
The Catcher in the Rye. 
    

424
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,167
You put this book in the exchange too?

425
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,277
Yes.

426
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:56,087
I saw someone offer the same book.

427
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:57,887
So I chose that person's book too.

428
00:29:57,887 --> 00:30:02,237
I wonder if he chose mine as well.

429
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:03,677
But you already have this book.

430
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,847
Why did you choose the same book?

431
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,957
The content isn't important.

432
00:30:07,957 --> 00:30:13,927
What matters is choosing the same book, or having someone choose your book.

433
00:30:13,927 --> 00:30:15,757
How do I explain it?

434
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:17,437
Although talking about fate is tacky,

435
00:30:17,437 --> 00:30:21,907
don't you think it's precious when the probability is so low?

436
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:29,717
 I only vaguely understood what Xin Yan said. 

437
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:35,607
 I only understand those words after many years. 

438
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:36,527
   

439
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:41,220
 Two sentences on the same page, appearing together in a single moment... 

440
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,750
 That might be the closest two people will ever be. 

441
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:15,050
   

442
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:30,587
   

443
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:37,767
   

444
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,797
   

445
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:43,107
   

446
00:31:58,987 --> 00:32:00,647
   

447
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:03,827
   

448
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:13,997
Jing Xi Chi.

449
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:16,717
Which book did you offer at the Book Exchange Event?

450
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,567
I didn't offer any books.

451
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:21,717
With how little I have, what book can I offer?

452
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:24,607
Then why did you go to the library?

453
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,797
I was just helping Cong out.

454
00:32:30,277 --> 00:32:31,437
 Qi Qi. 

455
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:32,677
 What book did you offer? 

456
00:32:32,677 --> 00:32:34,127
 It's called The Fountainhead. 

457
00:32:34,127 --> 00:32:37,107
 It's my favorite novel. 

458
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:41,717
 Wait. I bought it to improve my grade. 

459
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:43,520
 I can't show it to you. You can buy it yourself. 

460
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,520
 You're so petty. Fine. I won't read it. 

461
00:32:57,327 --> 00:32:58,960
 Xin Yan, come forward. 

462
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,887
Distribute these science or art stream application forms to your classmates.

463
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:03,407
- Okay. 
 - Students.

464
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:06,087
After you get your science or art stream application form,

465
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:09,567
go back and discuss it with your parents.

466
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:13,607
It will affect your college major selection

467
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,237
and your future career.

468
00:33:16,237 --> 00:33:20,800
If there's anything you don't understand, you can come to me.

469
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,440
Class dismissed.

470
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,560
Song Cong, you and Xi Chi will choose the science stream, right?

471
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,760
We will both choose the science stream.

472
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,367
Huan Er.

473
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:42,600
What stream do you want to choose?

474
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,401
It's obvious I'll do better in the science stream.

475
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:46,440
So I'll choose science.

476
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,826
I'll choose science too.

477
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,237
My grades in science subjects this time aren't bad.

478
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,717
That way, we won't be separated.

479
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:56,160
Don't you have to discuss it with your mom?

480
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,037
It's fine. I can imitate my mom's signature very well.

481
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,477
Are you sure?

482
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:03,997
Imitating her signature is not the safest option.

483
00:34:03,997 --> 00:34:06,997
The safest option is to sign it yourself from the start.

484
00:34:06,997 --> 00:34:08,687
That's enough.

485
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:11,557
How dare you discuss such blasphemy right in front of us?

486
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:14,787
Don't influence my kind and pure Huan Er.

487
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:25,587
Mr. Xu.

488
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:30,957
   

489
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:32,077
   

490
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:33,467
   

491
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:35,087
   

492
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:46,080
   

493
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,303
I hope I can also be a star in the light of your life.

494
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:52,170
   

495
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:02,437
I asked the nanny to cook pig heart soup especially for you.

496
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:03,957
Why haven't you drunk it?

497
00:35:03,957 --> 00:35:05,917
It's good for your mind.

498
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:09,227
I was studying just now.

499
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,767
I know your class will soon split into art and science streams.

500
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:15,997
I've already signed it with your homeroom teacher.

501
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:17,957
You'll go into the art stream.

502
00:35:24,927 --> 00:35:26,837
Mom.

503
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,557
There are more science majors at universities.

504
00:35:30,557 --> 00:35:33,727
I can go to a better university if I enter science.

505
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:36,437
That doesn't make sense.

506
00:35:36,437 --> 00:35:40,640
If you can't do well, you can't get into a good university, no matter the stream.

507
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,727
Objectively, science isn't for you.

508
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:46,707
Besides, you like writing and want to be an author, right?

509
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:51,847
Are you asking me to take art so you can be an author?

510
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:55,227
You just want me to be a lawyer like you.

511
00:35:57,557 --> 00:36:01,347
All your friends chose science, right?

512
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:03,997
Let me tell you.

513
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,207
This isn't about loyalty.

514
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:09,287
You're not taking your future seriously.

515
00:36:09,287 --> 00:36:11,517
Friends are just passing figures in life.

516
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:14,157
They won't be responsible for your future.

517
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:17,360
Changing your life for them is just wishful thinking.

518
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,653
I can be responsible for my own wishful thinking.

519
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:21,887
How are you going to do that?

520
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:24,117
- I... 
 - You are my daughter.

521
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:26,957
That's why I'm saying this.

522
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:29,427
Back then, you said private schools weren't good.

523
00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:30,767
So I sent you to a public school.

524
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,229
You said the experimental high school was bad, so I sent you to Tianhe.

525
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:34,880
I will not tolerate you anymore.

526
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,674
If you throw a tantrum over class selection,

527
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:39,637
I'll send you abroad immediately.

528
00:36:39,637 --> 00:36:41,920
You can go abroad, attend their high school,

529
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,487
and then you won't have to choose a stream.

530
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,707
Fine.

531
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,287
Can I invite my classmates over for my birthday?

532
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:03,847
Just for a meal.

533
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,517
It won't affect my studies.

534
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,847
You can celebrate it this Sunday.

535
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:13,207
You have a tuition class on Friday and a piano class on Saturday.

536
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:15,437
But my birthday is on Friday.

537
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:17,517
As long as you celebrate it,

538
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:20,157
it doesn't have to be on the day itself.

539
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:22,517
You have more time on Sunday.

540
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:25,307
That's it. Drink it. It's getting cold.

541
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:58,437
Mom, I'll choose science.

542
00:38:10,597 --> 00:38:12,967
   

543
00:38:20,477 --> 00:38:23,077
 Huan Er, I'm sorry. 

544
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:25,787
 My mom asked me to choose art. 

545
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:38,090
   

546
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,037
It's better for us who chose art to be ready in advance.

547
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:49,327
Is it based on our year-end exam results, or will there be another exam?

548
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,667
Will there be only one group of art stream students?

549
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:59,887
Are you choosing art?

550
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:03,367
For those choosing art, you'd better think twice.

551
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:06,437
If you take art, there will be fewer options for you.

552
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:08,997
It may sound harsh, but people choose art

553
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:11,247
because science is too hard for them.

554
00:39:11,247 --> 00:39:12,997
Little Four-Eye.

555
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:15,437
People can choose whatever they want.

556
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,917
Who are you to judge?

557
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,200
Should we record it again? I think I smiled too widely just now.

558
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,957
It's fine. Everyone looks awkward in front of the camera.

559
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,661
Qi Qi, it's your birthday this week. How will you celebrate it?

560
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:39,412
I have tuition on my birthday.

561
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:41,927
So, I won't celebrate.

562
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:43,727
Enough. Stop talking.

563
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:45,680
Selecting art or science

564
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,437
is just to give you a clearer direction for your future.

565
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:51,827
You'll still be in the same school where you see each other every day.

566
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:55,227
Now, take out your textbook.

567
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,230
Turn to page 75.

568
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:06,460
   

569
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:23,287
 Although the teacher is right, when it comes to choosing art or science, 

570
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:29,837
 the choice isn't as important as the separation that follows. 

571
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:39,327
 The separation comes so quickly that I can't even process it 

572
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:42,887
 because it has happened too fast. 

573
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:46,437
 It feels unreal. 

574
00:40:58,407 --> 00:40:59,807
My fellow students.

575
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:02,367
That's it for this term.

576
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,517
Go back and get ready for your year-end exam.

577
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:08,147
Xin Yan, stay back to arrange the exam room later.

578
00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:21,235
Please give me a moment. Stop packing.

579
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:24,227
The school has asked us to play a video.

580
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:34,847
 Qi Qi, we haven't really talked much. 

581
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:36,927
 It's not because you're "cold" or anything. 

582
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:42,637
 It's because I don't know much about the books you read or the authors you mention. 

583
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:47,247
 But whenever I read your essays, I think they're so well written. 

584
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:50,687
 I hope you become an author soon so your dream comes true. 

585
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:52,887
 Qi Qi, happy birthday! 

586
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:54,787
 All the best! 

587
00:41:57,077 --> 00:41:58,627
 Should we record it again? 

588
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:01,477
 - I think I smiled too widely just now. 
 - It's fine. 

589
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,707
 I've always thought you're the most beautiful girl in our class. 

590
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:09,007
 What are you talking about? This is a video for her birthday. 

591
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:10,647
 It's not for you to confess to her. 

592
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:14,707
 Qi Qi, I wish you a happy birthday! 

593
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:17,727
 Qi Qi. 

594
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:22,477
 Do you still remember when you spoke up during sports day? 

595
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:24,477
 You shocked everyone. 

596
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:28,687
 We never thought you would say something like that. 

597
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:32,847
 Qi Qi, you are a warm person. 

598
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:36,247
 You just need someone to approach you first. 

599
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:39,997
 You're not as cold or arrogant as you seem. 

600
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:45,667
 I hope Qi Qi and Huan Er remain friends forever. 

601
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:55,437
 Qi Qi, may you overcome all obstacles and become the person you dream of being. 

602
00:42:55,437 --> 00:42:57,267
 All the best. 

603
00:43:05,437 --> 00:43:07,267
 Happy birthday. 

604
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:13,337
 This may be the last time you see us art students on camera. 

605
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:16,477
 Yes. So don't be angry, Qi Qi. 

606
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:21,780
 Although we haven't talked much, we'll always be classmates. 

607
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,200
 Okay, say happy birthday now. The main thing is her birthday. 

608
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,327
 Happy birthday, Qi Qi! 

609
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:30,037
 Happy birthday! 

610
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:32,207
 Hello, Qi Qi. Happy birthday. 

611
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:34,117
 May you have a joyous birthday every year. 

612
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:36,080
 - Happy birthday, Qi Qi. 
 - Happy birthday, Qi Qi. 

613
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,600
 Happy birthday. 

614
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,067
 - Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday. 

615
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:41,847
 - Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday. 

616
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:44,697
 Happy birthday. We love you. 

617
00:43:47,247 --> 00:43:49,727
Three. Two. One.

618
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:54,587
 Happy birthday! 

619
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,077
Thank you, everyone.

620
00:44:12,077 --> 00:44:15,787
This is the most meaningful birthday I've ever had.

621
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:21,997
For those going to the art stream,

622
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:24,687
we won't see each other as often after this.

623
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:28,077
But I still want to say this:

624
00:44:28,077 --> 00:44:30,117
Come back and visit us often.

625
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:33,157
The door of Class 5 will always welcome you.

626
00:44:33,157 --> 00:44:37,787
 Class 5 will always be here! 

627
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:46,077
Class 5, what are you doing?

628
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:48,307
Turn off the projector now.

629
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:57,477
Bye.

630
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:25,110


631
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:30,370
