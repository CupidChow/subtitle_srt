1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:20,880


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,820
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,940
   
   

17
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,870
Qi Qi.

18
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,680
Qi Qi.

19
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,790
This is for you.

20
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,510
Surprised?

21
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,400
This is a gift from the three of us.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,620
Qi Qi, we hope you can freely pursue what you love.

23
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,390
The video was your idea, right?

24
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,230
That wasn't me. That was Jing Xi Chi.

25
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,640
He did all the editing and video work.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,900
Didn't I tell you not to say that?

27
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,140
Don't be so modest.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,540
The bakery said they couldn't make a big cake in time.

29
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,300
This one is small, but it's really delicious.

30
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,020
Thank you.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,340
Editing the video must've been tough.

32
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,950
Also...

33
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,550
I didn't understand before.

34
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,550
I shouldn't have said those things.

35
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,430
You'll definitely keep getting better at soccer

36
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,460
and achieve your dream.

37
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,900
I've already forgotten about it.

38
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,340
Thank you all so much.

39
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,110
Don't mention it.

40
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,300
Qi Qi, how about a hug?

41
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,470
Let me hold that for you. You two, hug.

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,180
Qi Qi, don't forget me after you transfer classes.

43
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,580
I won't. I'll never forget you.

44
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,300
You mustn't forget me.

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,120
I'll never forget you.

46
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,911
No crying.

47
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,521
All right, all right.

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,340
I won't forget you guys either.

49
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,670
Let's have a hug too.

50
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,270
After all, we're parting ways.

51
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,550
Thank you.

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,620
It's nothing.

53
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,790
- It's no big deal. 
 - I'll get going now.

54
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,140
- All right, text me when you get home. 
 - Don't mention it.

55
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,180
- Bye-bye. 
 - I'll get going.

56
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,260
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,790
Be careful on your way home.

58
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,600
 You're pretty good with computers. 

59
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,380
I never thought about it before.

60
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,430
I always thought that you couldn't do anything else besides playing soccer.

61
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,740
Well, it depends on whether I actually want to do it.

62
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,990
If I don't do something well, it's simply because I'm not interested.

63
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,230
You don't want Qi Qi to transfer, do you?

64
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,160
Why are you suddenly asking this?

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,640
Nothing, I just feel like you treat Qi Qi differently.

66
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,380
Once Qi Qi transfers to art class, stop deliberately doing poorly on exams.

67
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Hello, Huan Er?

68
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,690
Qi Qi, did you see the field trip info I sent you?

69
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,300
 Yeah, I saw it. 

70
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,080
 I really want to go, but my mom definitely won't let me. 

71
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,670
She just told me I have a bunch of tutoring classes in the summer.

72
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,790
 But it's school break. Why won't she let you go? 

73
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,180
It's not just a trip. It's an educational trip.

74
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,110
We'll visit museums to learn.

75
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,300
Besides, everyone's going.

76
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,430
Me, Jing Xi Chi, Xin Yan, Song Cong... everyone.

77
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,590
 Are you coming? 

78
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,350
Liao Xin Yan is going too?

79
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,010
 Yeah. 

80
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,040
Are you coming?

81
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,790
I probably won't be able to go.

82
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,640
All right then.

83
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,460
Bye-bye.

84
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,490
How much?

85
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,820
Ten yuan.

86
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,380
Here.

87
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,620
Hey, you two didn't wait for me.

88
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,210
- Huan Er. 
 - Xin Yan!

89
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,440
I didn't see you the entire break. I kept asking you out. Where were you?

90
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,680
I went back to my hometown for a few days.

91
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,820
I talked to the group leader earlier.

92
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,940
We're sharing a room. We can have a nice chat tonight.

93
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,260
This is really good.

94
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,860
Huan Er.

95
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,300
Qi Qi?

96
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,910
You signed up?

97
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,590
I thought you weren't coming.

98
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,080
Yeah, I signed up. I signed up the day after you told me about it.

99
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,500
I was worried I might not make it, so I didn't tell you.

100
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,550
That's amazing. How did you convince your mom?

101
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,740
I have my ways.

102
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,430
- This is great. 
 - Looks like everyone is here now.

103
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,260
Driver, let's go.

104
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,600
- The bus is leaving, sit down. 
 - Xin Yan, I wanted to...

105
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,740
Sit down...

106
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,870
We'll talk later.

107
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,590
- Okay. Sit down. 
 - Okay.

108
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,880
Jing Xi Chi, you should be the class president for this trip.

109
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,300
You're really good at organizing.

110
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,360
No way. Let Song Cong do it.

111
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,100
All right, students, get off the bus. Grab your luggage.

112
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,870
You still haven't told me how you convinced your mom.

113
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,380
Me? I told my mom I'm going on an educational tour with my classmates.

114
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,740
It's for learning, not for fun.

115
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,350
Huan Er, can I borrow some of the mosquito repellent you were using?

116
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,140
That's Qi Qi's.

117
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,900
Qi Qi, can you share your mosquito repellent with Xin Yan?

118
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,020
Thanks.

119
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,900
Xin Yan, spray some on me, too.

120
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,970
- Sure. 
 - Here, look.

121
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,900
That's enough.

122
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,100
Song Cong, do you want some?

123
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,004
- I'll do it myself. 
 - All right.

124
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:26,070
Thanks.

125
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,990
All right, students, your room keys are ready.

126
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,350
Let me do a roll call.

127
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,310
- Chen Huan Er. 
 - Here.

128
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,660
Liao Xin Yan.

129
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,050
Okay, you two are sharing a room.

130
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,470
There was one more person who came later. Qi Qi.

131
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,600
You'll have a room to yourself.

132
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,740
Sir, what about us?

133
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,830
Come with me for a moment.

134
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,500
Qi Qi, if you don't mind, you can share a bed with me.

135
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,470
It's fine; let's just go with the arrangement.

136
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,880
Don't be like that.

137
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
I really didn't know you were coming. How about this:

138
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,260
you take the bed, and I'll sleep on the floor.

139
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,560
No need, I can stay alone.

140
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,900
- Come on, let's share a room. 
 - Qi Qi!

141
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,620
Don't be shy. Actually, you two can take the bed, and I'll take the floor.

142
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,210
I roll onto the floor in my sleep anyway.

143
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,230
Let's stay together, please...

144
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,780
All right then.

145
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,740
Okay. Song Cong, the mosquito repellent.

146
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,220
- I'll put it here. 
 - Thanks.

147
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,900
Looks like everyone else is heading that way.

148
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,110
- Let's go. 
 - Yeah, let's go.

149
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,000
- Thanks, sir. 
 - You're welcome.

150
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
We're sharing a room.

151
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,660
What are you looking at?

152
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,070
I feel like there's some tension between them.

153
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,860
Tension?

154
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,540
Stop making things up.

155
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,260
You don't understand. Girls do everything holding hands.

156
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,510
What? Are you jealous?

157
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,600
Finally, we're at the park.

158
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,740
What is this, a study trip?

159
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,380
We've been learning all day.

160
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,500
Honestly, this isn't much different from regular school.

161
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,590
Hey, there are boats.

162
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,990
Wouldn't it be fun to go boating?

163
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,740
Let's pair up and race.

164
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,070
That'll be even better.

165
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,830
I'm not feeling well today.

166
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,990
I'll team up with Huan Er.

167
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,540
Huan Er...

168
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,620
How about mixed-gender teams?

169
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,070
That way, it'll be safer.

170
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,640
Sounds good.

171
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,084
Xin Yan, since you're not feeling well, you team up with Jing Xi Chi.

172
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,230
He's a sportsman.

173
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,190
Qi Qi, you team up with Song Cong.

174
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,710
Is that okay?

175
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,020
What about you?

176
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,590
Me?

177
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,830
I'll be a one-person team.

178
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,190
I can take you all on by myself.

179
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,380
Let's go.

180
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,420
Chen Huan Er, you think you're so tough?

181
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,600
- I'm going to crush you. 
 - Hurry up!

182
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,760
Jing Xi Chi, what do you like to do in your free time?

183
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,070
Winning, of course.

184
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,860
Pedal harder. Come on, catch up to her.

185
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,620
I'm coming for you, Chen Huan Er.

186
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,710
Let's just go at a steady pace.

187
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,770
Safety first. No need to compete with them.

188
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,740
Chen Huan Er.

189
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,260
I'm coming for you!

190
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,950
Don't run!

191
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,230
Come at me.

192
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,590
Come on, pedal harder.

193
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,910
We're catching up...

194
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,000
No!

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,110
Chen Huan Er!

196
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,660
Huan Er!

197
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,950
Huan Er!

198
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,740
- Huan Er! 
 - Huan Er!

199
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,670
Climb on board.

200
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,190
Are you okay?

201
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,470
Huan Er, how are you?

202
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,170
Are you all right?

203
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,350
I swallowed too much water.

204
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,070
Are you okay?

205
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,740
- How are you? 
 - I'm fine.

206
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,590
You should take Huan Er back to her room.

207
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,230
She's definitely caught a cold.

208
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,830
I'll go buy her some medicine.

209
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,540
Thanks, Qi Qi.

210
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,740
You're welcome. Go on.

211
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,420
Qi Qi, where are you going?

212
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,020
I'm going to buy medicine for Huan Er.

213
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,230
I'll go with you.

214
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,470
No thanks. I can go by myself.

215
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,590
Jing Xi Chi, you were too competitive earlier.

216
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,900
Good thing Huan Er knows how to swim.

217
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,590
I didn't mean for that to happen.

218
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,710
How about I go apologize to her?

219
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,470
Then hurry up.

220
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,310
All right, I'll go.

221
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,780
Song Cong.

222
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,080
Do you know where the pharmacy is?

223
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,140
There's a pretty busy street near the hotel.

224
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,310
There should be one there.

225
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,990
Can you take me there?

226
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,900
I don't know the way.

227
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,950
Well... why don't you ask the front desk?

228
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,710
I've got something to do.

229
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,270
Okay.

230
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,260
 Song Cong, have one too. 

231
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,230
 I've had them before. 

232
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,470
 Let's have a hug too. 

233
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,830
What are you doing?

234
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,960
Why are you out here?

235
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,080
You might catch a cold.

236
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,990
I just took a hot shower.

237
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,880
I'm feeling warm.

238
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,780
Where's Xin Yan?

239
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,900
She just had dinner with me.

240
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,380
But she got caught up chatting with her clubmates

241
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,070
and I didn't have much to say, so I left.

242
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,660
Here, I bought these for you.

243
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,990
Why did you buy oranges?

244
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,990
I wanted to apologize to you.

245
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,500
You see, when we were boating earlier, I went overboard.

246
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,190
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,620
It's okay.

248
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:26,090
If anyone should apologize, it should be me.

249
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,470
I wasn't thinking clearly back at the park earlier.

250
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,110
I ended up splitting you and Qi Qi up.

251
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,020
Big Brother, I'm sorry.

252
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,070
I'm really sorry.

253
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,710
What are you saying? Just eat your orange.

254
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,990
I'm telling you, these oranges are amazing!

255
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,500
You haven't even tried them yet.

256
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,380
They're full of vitamin C and they help prevent colds.

257
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,470
You mustn't get sick now.

258
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,830
I'm perfectly healthy.

259
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,260
I run every day, and my dad teaches me martial arts.

260
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,327
Here it goes. I wonder if it's sweet.

261
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:58,417
You go first.

262
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,447
- Eat mine. 
 - It's too big.

263
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,177
Try it.

264
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,857
Why are you throwing it at me?

265
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,647
Just taste it, come on.

266
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:10,657
Wow, I picked some good oranges. 
    

267
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,707
- You ate it. 
 - Fine, I'll stop. You eat it.

268
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:13,947
You have a cold, so you eat it.

269
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,467
- Here, eat it. 
 - I don't want to.

270
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,267
- Eat it... 
 - I don't like oranges, but you do.

271
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:24,177
♫  Look at the planet on your left  ♫

272
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:28,077
 Since that day, I don't know if we became 

273
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:31,467
 closer or more distant. 
   

274
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:36,517
 It seemed like everyone had something on their mind. 

275
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:41,777
 But back then, I didn't notice it at all. 

276
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:47,527
♫  Alone when I drift  ♫

277
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:53,347
♫  I dreamed about you all night  ♫

278
00:17:54,807 --> 00:18:01,987
♫  You can see me so deep inside  ♫

279
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:06,647
♫  So deep inside  ♫

280
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:09,847
♫  Deep inside  ♫

281
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:19,527
   

282
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:36,107
Didn't you cry about wanting to go?

283
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:37,817
Why do you look like this coming back?

284
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,977
Didn't have fun?

285
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:44,097
It was great, just a bit tiring.

286
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:45,527
Then rest well tonight.

287
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:49,177
Tomorrow, get back to studying seriously. Don't forget your promise.

288
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:53,257
If I let you go, you'll make it into the top ten next semester.

289
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:55,537
All right.

290
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:10,027
   

291
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,410
Hey, old friend.

292
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,467
I'm not wearing the summer uniform because I haven't collected it.

293
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,597
Why aren't you wearing yours?

294
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,447
Uniforms are meant to make everyone look the same.

295
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,207
They erase individuality.

296
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,257
I don't want to wear it.

297
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,560
A kindred spirit, right?

298
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:12,257
 Did everyone get home safely? 

299
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,487
 I'm about to sleep. 

300
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,147
 Rest early, everyone. 

301
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:37,087
   

302
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:42,757
 - You ate it. 
 - Fine, I'll stop. You eat it. 

303
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:44,007
 You have a cold, so you eat it. 

304
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:46,607
 - Here, eat it. 
 - I don't want to. 

305
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,427
   

306
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:54,417
 Okay, good night. 

307
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,757
   

308
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:14,567
 Good night. 

309
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,047
   

310
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:41,147
   

311
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,515
Qi Qi.

312
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,265
Qi Qi.

313
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,660
Qi Qi.

314
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,678
I finally see you. I tried calling you over the holidays, but you never came out.

315
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:59,590
After that trip, I was stuck in tutoring classes.

316
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,780
How are you guys?

317
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,830
The three of us?

318
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,660
We're good. Just the same as always.

319
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,150
That's good.

320
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,340
Why do I get the feeling you've become colder toward Qi Qi after the holidays?

321
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,400
I realized that I'm a rare soul.

322
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,127
Maybe someone as proud as me was never meant to resonate with anyone.

323
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,180
You wouldn't understand.

324
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,280
Sure.

325
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,940
By the way, I forgot to ask which floor the art class is on.

326
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,540
They moved us to another building. They say it's for easier management.

327
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,270
All right then. I'll just run faster and visit you during breaks.

328
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,180
I'll visit you too. Let's go to that snack stall after school.

329
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,310
- Yes! 
 - All right, stop with the emotional moment.

330
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,030
Morning self-study is starting.

331
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,620
Ignore him.

332
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,150
We'll never be apart.

333
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,620
You're heading this way?

334
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,030
All right, I'm off.

335
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,510
Wait for me after class.

336
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,190
Bye. I'll come to find you.

337
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,270
Wait up, Jing Xi Chi!

338
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,620
I said wait up.

339
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,590
Chen Huan Er!

340
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
 That's all for today's lesson. 

341
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,010
Class dismissed.

342
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,590
 I conducted precise calculations. 

343
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,280
 As soon as the bell rings, I sprint outside following the planned route, 

344
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,239
 down three floors, across campus to the art building, 

345
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:38,240
 up two floors to reach Qi Qi's classroom. 

346
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,030
 Say five sentences, then rush back. This way, I won't be late. 

347
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,420
 Two conditions must be met in order for us to meet up. 

348
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,870
 Qi Qi and I must strictly control our speaking speed and sentence length. 

349
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,920
 And there can be no bathroom breaks, getting water, discussing problems, 

350
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,310
 or any other distractions. 

351
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,490
Huan Er!

352
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,440
Qi Qi!

353
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,700
Slow down.

354
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,680
How's it going? Are you getting used to the art class?

355
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,276
I'm fine. How about you?

356
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,790
How have you been? Tired?

357
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,990
I'm all right. Same as before.

358
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,140
So soon?

359
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,940
I'll come to find you after school, okay?

360
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,320
Hurry back to class.

361
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,070
Go on...

362
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,510
 Actually, deep down, I know these brief meetings are more symbolic than practical. 

363
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,750
 Class meetings, quizzes... 

364
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,650
 There will always be more important things than a quick chat. 

365
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,780
 But I still want to prove that we haven't drifted apart. 

366
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,840
So tired...

367
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,940
Everyone, quiet down!

368
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,620
Mr. Xu is in a meeting.

369
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,940
Class will start later.

370
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,700
While we wait, I have an announcement.

371
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,440
There will be a talent show this semester.

372
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,270
Every class must prepare a performance.

373
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,590
Who wants to sign up?

374
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,030
 - Not me. 
 - Not me. 

375
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,980
 Who has the time for this? 

376
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,420
I know everyone is busy with school.

377
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,080
How about we keep it simple?

378
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,394
Let's do a poetry recital.

379
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:13,790
 Another poetry recital? 

380
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,310
 How boring! 

381
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,550
Xin Yan! Xin Yan!

382
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,600
I think a poetry recital is fine.

383
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,310
- Song Cong should do it. 
 - Not me.

384
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,070
- Why not? 
 - Why would I do it?

385
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,310
- You're perfect for it. 
 - No, I'm not.

386
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,380
How about letting Jing Xi Chi do some freestyle football tricks?

387
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,140
At least it won't be as boring.

388
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,980
 Good idea... 

389
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,200
- I'm not doing it. 
 - Please.

390
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,510
- No. 
 - Just him doing tricks alone is pretty dull.

391
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,840
Right? It's boring. I'm out.

392
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,750
How about we get some of the girls from the aerobics team to be cheerleaders?

393
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,900
That way, it becomes a full act.

394
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,420
Why don't you do it? You're good at organizing.

395
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,660
Back when we asked everyone to join the sports day,

396
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,700
weren't you the one saying we need team spirit?

397
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,030
I think this works.

398
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,720
If there's no other idea, let's go with this.

399
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,170
 Sounds good... 

400
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,030
Xin Yan!

401
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,380
I'll join.

402
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,030
But only if Song Cong joins.

403
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,140
I don't even play soccer.

404
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,220
You don't need to.

405
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,620
- Then what do I do? 
 - Be a cheerleader.

406
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,140
You're pretty strong for a cheerleader.

407
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,030
Don't drag me into this embarrassment.

408
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,140
Everyone, did you hear that?

409
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,207
How is participating in a group activity embarrassing?

410
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:21,207
Your mindset is wrong.

411
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,007
What's wrong with it?

412
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:25,960
Think about it. Why do people say you're out of touch with reality?

413
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,860
Why did you transfer to our class in the first place?

414
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,520
Wasn't it because you wanted to join more group activities,

415
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,577
to experience a more interesting high school life?

416
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:34,727
- Am I right? 
  - Yes. 

417
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,997
Right? So should he join or not?

418
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:38,617
 - Yes, he should. 
 - Yes, he should. 

419
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:40,657
- Just go for it. 
 - Go, go, go.

420
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:41,907
Think about it.

421
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:44,000
Song Cong, trust me.

422
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,970
Your purpose in this class is to participate in group activities.

423
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:53,040
- Think about it. 
 - All right.

424
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,617
- I'll do it with you. 
 - You promise?

425
00:26:54,617 --> 00:26:56,080
- You promise? You're in? 
 - Yes...

426
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,097
Sign us both up. We'll do it together.

427
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:02,007
Can the girls from our aerobics team join?

428
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:04,767
 Yi Yi, Xiao Yu, go for it! 

429
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:05,817
Are you in?

430
00:27:05,817 --> 00:27:08,177
Aerobics?

431
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:11,487
- I've never done it before. 
 - You know martial arts, why not aerobics?

432
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:12,727
Besides, even Song Cong is in.

433
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:15,177
If you don't participate, you're not our friend.

434
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:16,967
Fine. I'll give it a try.

435
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,497
Good.

436
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:25,687
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

437
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:29,377
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

438
00:27:29,377 --> 00:27:32,967
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

439
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:36,527
Four, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

440
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:40,527
One, two, three, four, five, six.

441
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:44,097
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

442
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:47,687
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

443
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:51,287
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

444
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:54,337
Four, two, three, four.

445
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:55,627
Stop.

446
00:27:55,627 --> 00:27:57,337
Huan Er.

447
00:27:57,337 --> 00:28:00,367
What you're doing seems off.

448
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:04,527
Why don't we try extending your fists and give it another go?

449
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:07,727
Sorry, I'm just used to it.

450
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,247
Xin Yan.

451
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:12,007
I think maybe we should just drop these two.

452
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,720
They're really struggling with the dance.

453
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,247
Yeah, I agree.

454
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:19,480
I can help with miscellaneous tasks, cheer everyone on or something.

455
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,687
That works too.

456
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,767
All right, let's rearrange the positions.

457
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,080
Let's go again.

458
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,572
Why are you two still standing there?

459
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,137
Do you think you danced well?

460
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:30,097
Get off.

461
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:31,989
You don't have the talent to be a cheerleader.

462
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:33,417
Five, six, seven, eight.

463
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:37,137
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

464
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:39,615
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

465
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:41,007
This looks much better.

466
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:44,417
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

467
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:47,137
Four, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

468
00:28:47,137 --> 00:28:49,767
Qi Qi, what are you doing here?

469
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,207
Come on over.

470
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:52,527
Come on.

471
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:56,007
Are you guys rehearsing for the talent show?

472
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,327
Yeah, have a seat.

473
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,047
Aerobics?

474
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:03,500
Aerobics with freestyle football.

475
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,207
By the way, what's your class performing?

476
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:07,687
Are you participating?

477
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:10,897
- Jazz dance. 
 - Wow, that's impressive!

478
00:29:10,897 --> 00:29:13,000
Xin Yan, this is exhausting. Can we take a break?

479
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,447
All right, let's take a break.

480
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:17,617
Girls, are you thirsty?

481
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:18,937
Have a drink.

482
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:19,897
- Here. 
 - Thanks.

483
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:23,280
Huan Er, can you send my English quiz papers to the teacher?

484
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,850
I forgot to hand them in when I left earlier.

485
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,967
Right now?

486
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:27,857
The teacher needs them urgently, so hurry.

487
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:30,137
Quickly.

488
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:33,727
- Qi Qi, I have to... 
 - Why does she boss you around like that?

489
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:36,860
She's not bossing me around.

490
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,817
I volunteered to do it.

491
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:41,840
I can't really help with rehearsals, but I can at least run errands.

492
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,287
But she's making you help with her personal stuff, not for the talent show.

493
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:48,047
Why can't you just say no?

494
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,287
Xin Yan has a lot on her plate.

495
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:53,687
Now that all the artsy students have left, she has to handle everything.

496
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:55,727
She's under a lot of pressure.

497
00:29:55,727 --> 00:30:00,527
Forget it. If you want to be a pushover, I can't help you.

498
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:02,937
That's not it. Xin Yan is actually really nice.

499
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:04,097
She's helped me a lot.

500
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:07,487
I just want to return the favor. It's not a big deal.

501
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:10,047
I want to go eat that taro pastry we had before.

502
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:12,567
- Are you coming? 
 - Now?

503
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:15,937
All right. Let me drop this off first.

504
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:18,527
Forget it. Just go do your errand. I'm leaving.

505
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,217
Qi—

506
00:30:30,857 --> 00:30:32,287
Xin Yan, I'm going now.

507
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:33,937
Hurry up.

508
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:49,657
Why are you suddenly transferring to the art class?

509
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:52,207
I think I'm more suited for it.

510
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:54,247
Goodbye. I'll come back to visit.

511
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:56,537
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

512
00:30:58,617 --> 00:31:01,547
She says she's more suited for it, but the truth is she couldn't keep up.

513
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:03,247
I saw her crying the other day.

514
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:05,400
- Really? 
 - She said if she kept going like this,

515
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,560
her future would be ruined.

516
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,000
It would be best to transfer.

517
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:15,727
There's an empty seat in the second-to-last row.

518
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:17,567
You can sit there.

519
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:31,037
New student?

520
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:33,407
Hello, new classmate.

521
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,657
 How much? 

522
00:31:40,657 --> 00:31:42,597
 Ten yuan. 

523
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:48,767
Haven't we met before?

524
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,297
No.

525
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:55,767
Chen Huan Er, your pick-up line is way too outdated.

526
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,727
Jing Xi Chi, are you trying to start something?

527
00:31:57,727 --> 00:31:58,967
I'm not.

528
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,177
So this is all it takes, right?

529
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:03,397
I was overthinking it.

530
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:05,937
Xin Yan.

531
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:09,077
Didn't you explain this question to me the other day?

532
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:11,137
You must be mistaken.

533
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,047
I didn't get the concept when the teacher explained it earlier.

534
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:17,307
Didn't get it, but still became class president?

535
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,617
 It felt weird. 

536
00:32:25,617 --> 00:32:30,907
 It seemed like everyone had started lying unconsciously. 

537
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,767
 But back then, I had no clue what Xin Yan was thinking. 

538
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:38,997
 My mind was only filled with my taro pastry date with Qi Qi. 

539
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:44,737
 Qi Qi, let's go have taro pastries after school today to make up for yesterday. 

540
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,527
 We'll see. 

541
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:52,337
 The teacher might extend the class. 

542
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,297
 It's fine. I'll wait for you. 

543
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:05,817
 To me, as long as Qi Qi said it was fine, everything was fine. 

544
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,947
 I was completely unaware of the subtext behind her words. 

545
00:33:16,617 --> 00:33:17,720
- Here you go. 
 - Thanks, Ma'am.

546
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,527
No cilantro in mine, please.

547
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,047
Got it.

548
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:23,237
Do you want chili?

549
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:25,377
Yes.

550
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:27,187
Thank you.

551
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,967
Hey. Have you seen Qi Qi?

552
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,817
I saw her walking that way after school.

553
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:35,567
That way?

554
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,567
- Thanks. 
 - No problem.

555
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:45,857
Isn't tutoring at six?

556
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,617
Why isn't Chen Huan Er here yet?

557
00:33:48,617 --> 00:33:52,087
She said she made plans to eat with Qi Qi.

558
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,097
Maybe they have something to talk about.

559
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,427
I'll call her and ask.

560
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,377
 Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off. 

561
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,857
 Please try again later. 

562
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:08,697
Her phone's off.

563
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:11,127
Her phone's off?

564
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,017
Call Qi Qi.

565
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,567
 Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off. 

566
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:23,167
- Hers is off too. 
  - Please try again later. 

567
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:28,047
A few days ago, my mom warned me that the area near our school has been a bit unsafe lately.

568
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:30,417
Could something have happened to them?

569
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,857
Chen Huan Er!

570
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,737
- What are you two doing here? 
 - What do you mean?

571
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:01,558
You tell me! We've been looking for you.

572
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,692
You didn't answer our calls. What were you doing with your phone?

573
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:07,007
- My battery died. 
 - Then what are you doing here?

574
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:09,007
I was waiting for Qi Qi, but she never showed up.

575
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,967
So I wandered around, and ended up here.

576
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,857
All right, enough talking. Let's go home first.

577
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:15,417
Your mom's going to be mad again.

578
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:16,417
Does my mom know?

579
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,697
Not yet. But I'm about to tell her.

580
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:20,440
- Don't you dare! Don't tell her. 
 - I'll tell her.

581
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,672
- Please, I'm begging you. 
 - I'm telling her.

582
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:25,497
- Slow down. Slow down. 
 - Okay, I'm sorry.

583
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:31,784
We've been looking for you all night.

584
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,377
I'm so thirsty.

585
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:36,687
So stingy. You only bought one can. What about me?

586
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,137
Here, Song Cong, pass the ball.

587
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:44,777
I want to try the "Hand of God."

588
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:47,447
What's the "Hand of God"?

589
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:49,337
You don't know?

590
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:52,967
In the 1986 Mexico World Cup quarterfinals,

591
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:57,607
Argentina vs. England, Maradona jumped into the air and scored a goal with his hand.

592
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:02,247
Just like that, Maradona used the "Hand of God" to save Argentina.

593
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:06,167
Still don't get it?

594
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:09,127
Let me show you. Come on, Song Cong, pass the ball.

595
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:13,207
Where were you throwing?

596
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,560
Hey, buddy.

597
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,870
- From Tianhe No. 1? 
 - Don't move.

598
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:29,167
Lend us some money.

599
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,337
I don't have any money.

600
00:36:30,337 --> 00:36:31,977
Check your pockets.

601
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,897
Take it out!

602
00:36:34,897 --> 00:36:36,087
Do you have any?

603
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:38,567
- I have no money. 
 - She doesn't have money.

604
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,287
Let me see.

605
00:36:52,707 --> 00:36:55,887
Run!

606
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:36,057
Get up!

607
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:42,087
I think we lost them.

608
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:48,121
Did you twist your ankle?

609
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:49,956
I'm fine.

610
00:37:49,956 --> 00:37:53,600
Good thing we practiced for the sports day. Otherwise, we'd have been caught.

611
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,090
Should we call the police?

612
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,360
They know we're from Tianhe No. 1. Will they come after us?

613
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,937
No, they won't.

614
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:01,167
We should just go home and tell our parents.

615
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,497
We can't tell my mom.

616
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,777
How about this?

617
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:10,377
Tomorrow, I'll talk to the teacher.

618
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:13,447
You two wait here. I'll go buy some medicine for Huan Er.

619
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:14,737
It's okay, Song Cong.

620
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:17,247
I'll be fine by tomorrow.

621
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,909
Chen Huan Er, did you have to grab me so tightly?

622
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:28,007
Look at this mark.

623
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,937
What if I let go of your hand and lose you?

624
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:37,967
I mean, what if you ran back to fight them?

625
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:40,360
I wouldn't be able to save you.

626
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,040
Come on!

627
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,646
Honestly, I might have been able to take on those three.

628
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:47,217
I was just about to strike back.

629
00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:48,337
Yeah, right.

630
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,857
You were almost put in a choke hold.

631
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:52,167
I'm a sportsman, you know.

632
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,857
My dad is a martial arts coach.

633
00:38:54,857 --> 00:38:57,400
Anyway, next time there's trouble, save Song Cong first.

634
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,180
I don't need your help.

635
00:39:03,737 --> 00:39:09,817
But I have to admit, you were actually pretty impressive just now.

636
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,770
Call me "Big Sis."

637
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:17,607
I just saved your life. Call me "Big Sis."

638
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:18,547
Big Sis.

639
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:19,647
Big Sis.

640
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:21,087
Big Sis.

641
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:23,087
Your foot is healed?

642
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:26,857
Ouch, ouch. Come.

643
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:27,967
Massage it for me.

644
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:30,047
Do it.

645
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:35,047
It hurts. It really hurts. So painful. So painful.

646
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:36,527
- Is it that bad? 
 - It hurts!

647
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:39,127
It really hurts. It's really twisted.

648
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,697
- Let me see. 
 - Really...

649
00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:44,048
I... I'm going to hit you!

650
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,297
That hurts, cut it out.

651
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:49,457
Mom, I'm off to bed.

652
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:22,607
 Actually, I don't even know why I suddenly reached out and grabbed Jing Xi Chi. 

653
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:27,337
 In that moment, I suddenly understood Xin Yan. 

654
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:34,937
 Sometimes, lying is just a way for our cowardly selves to feel bold, 

655
00:40:34,937 --> 00:40:39,767
 even if we're not very good at it. 

656
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,664
 I'm not going. 

657
00:40:46,664 --> 00:40:49,087
 I have to stay and practice with my classmates. 

658
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:11,890


659
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:17,260
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

660
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:23,503
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

661
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,300
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

662
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:36,630
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

663
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:42,920
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

664
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:50,930
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

665
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:57,660
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

666
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:04,340
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

667
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:11,040
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

668
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,000
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

669
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,120
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

670
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,840
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

671
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,300
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

672
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,670
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

673
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,560
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

674
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,460
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

675
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:47,400
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

676
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,090
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

677
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,630
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

678
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,040
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

679
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,220
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

680
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,720
♫  At the right time  ♫
