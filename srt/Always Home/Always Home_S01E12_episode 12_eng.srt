00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:20,860


2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,780
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,360
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,260
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,130
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,280
   
   

17
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,430
Eat up.

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,890
Come.

19
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,500
Chen Huan Er.

20
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,270
Thanks to your sharp sense of smell.

21
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,700
I was so scared.

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,260
It's the first time I've seen Aunt Hao like this.

23
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,620
As someone who's been through it before, I understand how Aunt Hao feels.

24
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,640
Aunt Hao just needs some time to accept it.

25
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,890
Song Cong seems pretty blue, too.

26
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,060
He sent me a message saying he bought an induction cooker

27
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,300
and even set up a small table for his mother.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,690
Won't your Aunt Hao feel even worse that way?

29
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,410
Why so, Mom?

30
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,020
Think about it. Aunt Hao was such a capable person.

31
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,270
Everything in the house depended on her.

32
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,040
Song Cong wants to be filial,

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,170
but in doing so he reminded Aunt Hao that she had become a burden to them.

34
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,240
What should we do then?

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,597
It's all right. Just eat up.

36
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:55,450
Don't worry about it.

37
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,900
Mom, this is the new induction cooker I got you.

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,950
From now on, you should use this to cook instead of the stove.

39
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,050
The stove is dangerous.

40
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,140
Mom,

41
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,650
if it doesn't work out, let's get a helper so you don't have to cook anymore.

42
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,870
Song Cong!

43
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,320
Huan Er wants to eat Aunt Hao Mei's pork knuckles.

44
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,820
She doesn't like my cooking.

45
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,450
Let me learn from you, too. How do you make pork knuckles?

46
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,820
You must teach me your Song family's secret recipe.

47
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,500
My daughter's mouth is too picky.

48
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,350
I've given it some thought.

49
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,840
I'll come to your house more often for meals.

50
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,600
I want to secretly steal your skills.

51
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,860
Song Cong, buy a bouquet of flowers for Huan Er.

52
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,380
Thank her for the flowers she bought for me.

53
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,590
- Sure. 
 - Go.

54
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,590
Talking about these pork knuckles, do I have to prepare the fried sugar syrup first?

55
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,790
I don't know what I'm doing—

56
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,590
Okay.

57
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,420
It's okay.

58
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,180
Life goes on.

59
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
These are just hurdles to overcome.

60
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
It's all right.

61
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,620
Stop crying.

62
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,300
Hurry up and teach me how to make pork knuckles.

63
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,590
Does it have to be fried in sugar syrup?

64
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,260
Huan Er said the one I made tasted too gamey,

65
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,990
but I did boil it in water.

66
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,000
Stop being pretentious.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,540
I've been hungry all day. I've been waiting for these.

68
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,890
Hurry up. How should I make it?

69
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,140
It won't taste good if you use an electric cooker.

70
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,260
Then let's use the stove. We won't use the induction cooker.

71
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,820
- Wash it first. 
 - Wash it first. Okay, wash it first.

72
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,570
Then what?

73
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,520
Come on, tell me quickly.

74
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,662
Do I need to add onion, ginger, and garlic?

75
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,370
- Should I marinate it? 
 - Yes.

76
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,440
Well, I'm done washing it now...

77
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,420
Looking to buy some flowers?

78
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,470
What kind are you thinking of?

79
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,740
 Why did you choose this flower? 

80
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,990
 Because chamomile adapts well. 

81
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,790
 Even in a barren environment, it can grow. 

82
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,590
 Its flower language is 'never bow to fate.' 

83
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,120
 No wonder. 

84
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,820
 It's very much like you. 

85
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,920
Chamomile.

86
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,150
- Okay. 
 - How much is it?

87
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,840
15 yuan, please wait a moment.

88
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,540
- Here are your flowers. 
 - Thanks.

89
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,960
Run, I don't care!

90
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,620
You have promised to run with me.

91
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,230
I'm barely off my crutches.

92
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,400
- Chen Huan Er, you're too much. 
 - At least try it, won't you?

93
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,590
- I tried. Didn't I run? 
 - Start warming up now.

94
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,710
Come, warm up with me.

95
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,200
Cong.

96
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,790
Did you buy chamomile again?

97
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,910
Is it for Aunt Hao?

98
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,280
Yes.

99
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,030
Did Aunt Li Na go today?

100
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,740
- Yes. 
 - How was it?

101
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
My mom was quite happy.

102
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,350
That's great.

103
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,300
Huan Er.

104
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,180
Thank you.

105
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,450
Why are you thanking me?

106
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm tired of my mom's dishes anyway.

107
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,620
She can learn to cook more.

108
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,540
If you say so, I have to get my mom to learn, too.

109
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,590
Aunt Hao will have something to do every day.

110
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,470
Song Cong, you should spend more time with Aunt Hao this weekend.

111
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,900
Sure.

112
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,880
I'll go home first.

113
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,540
What are you doing? Stand up!

114
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,640
- Quick. 
 - Wait a minute.

115
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,460
- Get up and run with me. 
 - Just five minutes.

116
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,960
- Hurry, you promised me! 
 - Let me rest a bit!

117
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,900
Wait a minute. Just five minutes. Let me take a break and sit down.

118
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,470
Get up and run.

119
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,520
- Run. 
 - It hurts. It's starting to hurt.

120
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,680
It's aching. Let me take five.

121
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,540
Just five minutes.

122
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,230
The weather's nice.

123
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,950
Very nice.

124
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,900
At this time, the flowers in the fields of Sishui should be blooming.

125
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,780
It must be very beautiful.

126
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,860
Then Sishui must be a beautiful place.

127
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,260
Very beautiful.

128
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,950
Sishui and Tianhe are beautiful in different ways.

129
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:36,500
Although Sishui is remote, it has mountains, a sea, and the fruits there are very delicious.

130
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,040
Wait...

131
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,160
Have you never been to Sishui?

132
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,440
- I haven't been there. 
 - Then how did you...

133
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,160
 Where is Sishui? Is it outside the country? 

134
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,780
 Sishui is a county. 

135
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,160
 It's the county on the far west side. 

136
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,892
That happened?

137
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,160
I don't remember.

138
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,620
Then how did you know about Sishui?

139
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,240
My mother told me before you came here.

140
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,973
She said she had a junior in college from Sishui.

141
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:11,440
Although they weren't in touch for long,

142
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,090
she was being transferred to the family housing compound.

143
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,480
She told me about their past. Things that happened back in school.

144
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,126
She also said Aunt Hao had always wanted to go to Sishui,

145
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,347
but she was too busy at the hospital to make time.

146
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:25,300
Did Aunt Hao want to go to Sishui?

147
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,860
We have time during summer break.

148
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,213
I can be her guide. She can relax over there.

149
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,518
Why don't all of us go on a trip?

150
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:32,760
Sure.

151
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,189
I'll go back, pack my bags, and tell my mom and dad.

152
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:37,250
Calm down.

153
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,540
I haven't asked Song Cong and Aunt Hao yet.

154
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,370
Just tell him this will help Aunt Hao relax.

155
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,630
He will definitely find a way.

156
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,680
That's true.

157
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,590
But what about our parents?

158
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,590
Will they go?

159
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,920
Don't worry about it. I'll handle it. Let's go.

160
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,970
First stop, your house.

161
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,540
Why are we going to my place?

162
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,680
You have to do me a small favor first,

163
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,570
and then I can guarantee I'll help you make this Sishui trip happen.

164
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,640
So you aren't tired anymore, right?

165
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,710
Running is tiring, but touring isn't. Let's go.

166
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,740
Why don't we run on the way back?

167
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,230
You should run.

168
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,360
- Run with me. 
 - You run.

169
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,908
- Run with me for a while. 
 - I'm not running.

170
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:20,230
- Just for a while. 
 - I'll become crippled again.

171
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,880
- No way. You need to recover now. 
 - Can we go to Sishui if I'm crippled?

172
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,590
- Come. 
 - Am I right?

173
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,540
I'll carry you. I'll give you a piggyback.

174
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,400
What exactly are you up to?

175
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,708
Why are you suddenly looking for old photos?

176
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,260
Just look for them.

177
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,010
Make sure you're looking for my parents' photos.

178
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,620
Found it.

179
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,620
Let me see.

180
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,018
Is this your childhood photo album?

181
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,262
Why are these all pictures of you as a kid?

182
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,760
What about your parents?

183
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,291
This is the only album I've seen at home.

184
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,210
Forget it. I can't count on you.

185
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,990
I'll get Cong.

186
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,990
 Speaking of this, my parents only liked taking my photos. 

187
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,540
 They never took pictures of each other. 

188
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,590
 I wonder if they never had the chance or just didn't like being photographed. 

189
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:24,440
 In short, their past seems to exist only in a story with me as the protagonist. 

190
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,900
Is there any?

191
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,180
- No. 
 - That's strange.

192
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,200
Your dad was still looking at it two days ago.

193
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,914
Is it this one?

194
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,460
Yes. That is the one.

195
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,140
Why does Xi Chi want our photo album?

196
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,500
He didn't tell me, either.

197
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,837
Tell him if he messes around and pisses off his mom, there's no one to save him this time.

198
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:02,090
Don't worry, Mom, he can't do that now.

199
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,795
By the way, the work manual Dad got from the admin office

200
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:11,260
is mostly about computer system operations.

201
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,190
I've made one for you.

202
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,740
Look.

203
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,620
   

204
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,260
   

205
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,430
I'm just old.

206
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,500
How will I learn how to use the computer?

207
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,430
It's too much effort.

208
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,350
I wasn't always like this.

209
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,710
I used to learn fast.

210
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,860
For any new drugs or equipment, I would master them in two days.

211
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,990
Mom, you can still master it.

212
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,500
Don't worry.

213
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,860
You still have some time before getting back to work.

214
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,300
These two days, why don't we go on a short trip?

215
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,740
Didn't you say you wanted to go to Sishui?

216
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,540
Maybe next time.

217
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,900
Doesn't Xi Chi need it urgently?

218
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,830
Send it to him.

219
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,660
Mom.

220
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,800
Actually, I really want to go to Sishui.

221
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:24,210
Okay. Why don't you help me pack my luggage when you're done with the album later?

222
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,680
Sure.

223
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,990
I'm leaving, Mom.

224
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,400
Okay.

225
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,340
   

226
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,900
 Chen Huan Er, you're too much. 

227
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,130
 - At least try it, won't you? 
 - I tried. Didn't I run? 

228
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,790
 Run! I don't care. Start warming up now. 

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,137
Wow, talk about perfect timing.

230
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:30,020
I was going to ask you about the final exam, then I saw you here.

231
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,318
- This— 
 - Hold on.

232
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:35,110
You are asking me?

233
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,520
Yes. Why not?

234
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,820
Do you only teach Chen Huan Er and her friends?

235
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,740
I want to ask you something first.

236
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,400
Ask me?

237
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,070
Go ahead.

238
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,800
Well...

239
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,900
I have a friend at my new school.

240
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,310
Did you make a new friend so quickly?

241
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,540
Just answer the question.

242
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,630
Three variables: A, B, and C.

243
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,110
A likes B.

244
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,280
B says they're just good friends with C,

245
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,700
but A found plenty of evidence that B likes C.

246
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,880
What do you think should be done?

247
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,210
That's a mathematical problem.

248
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,240
Firstly, you said B and C are just good friends, according to B.

249
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,620
Is that a true statement or a false one?

250
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,740
Let's say it's true.

251
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,515
That doesn't conflict with the fact that A likes B.

252
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:37,700
Something is wrong with the question itself.

253
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,190
How did transferring schools make you stupid?

254
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,840
I think A should think about it more.

255
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,260
What are you talking about?

256
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,140
Why haven't you come up?

257
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,560
You should talk to him first. I'll see you later.

258
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,990
Good night, A, and you, C.

259
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,500
Bye-bye.

260
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,360
What's this about A and C?

261
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,260
Is he sick or something?

262
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,660
I have no idea.

263
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,829
Did you find it?

264
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,260
Let me see.

265
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,080
I knew I could count on you.

266
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,820
Let's see. Is there anything good here?

267
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,230
This group photo is good.

268
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,500
   

269
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,740
What's this?

270
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,580
You're finally on vacation. Shouldn't you be doing something besides studying?

271
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,260
Mom, I'm a junior in high school.

272
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,340
As a parent, shouldn't you be cracking a whip and hitting me?

273
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,880
This is a great time. It's sunny and bright out there,

274
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,060
and you're sitting at home all alone, frowning over your books?

275
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,840
You know, a vacation is meant for resting.

276
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,560
Otherwise, why call it a vacation?

277
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,200
Mom, you're an anti-studying ambassador.

278
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,540
Balancing work and rest will improve your learning.

279
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,870
The day after tomorrow, we'll all go to Sishui.

280
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,950
It's all organized.

281
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,470
Do you want to pack your bags and get ready?

282
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,100
Buy some mosquito repellent or something.

283
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,580
Are we really going to Sishui?

284
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,190
Jing Xi Chi really organized it.

285
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,290
We'll all go.

286
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,040
If you decide to stay home and study hard, you'll be all alone.

287
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,300
No, Mom.

288
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,710
I'll study.

289
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,190
Even in Sishui, I can still study hard.

290
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,990
Am I right, Mom?

291
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,400
I won't force you.

292
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,640
No pressure.

293
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,990
- Just study hard alone at home. 
 - No, Mom.

294
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,190
Learning is important,

295
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,260
but if I don't go, won't our family seem unsociable?

296
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,760
Moreover, it would hurt our neighborhood relations in the compound.

297
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,060
- Am I right, Mom? 
 - No.

298
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,460
Your mom alone can represent our family.

299
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,150
No, M-M-Mom!

300
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,190
I'm part of the family, too. I'm your little baby! Bring me along.

301
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,530
Stop taking pictures of me.

302
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,240
In my state, what's the point of taking a photo?

303
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,150
You're so good.

304
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,630
Li Qiang, did you know that composition is the most important thing in photography?

305
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,150
For a beginner like you, just mastering the rule of thirds is enough.

306
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,190
I can also do composition.

307
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,740
Look at Song Hang. He hasn't made any progress in all these years,

308
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,340
but now his gear is new.

309
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,840
What's the use of more equipment?

310
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,920
He still doesn't have that talent.

311
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,870
Yi Fan, didn't you also like to take pictures? Why aren't you taking any now?

312
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,100
That was 20 years ago. I forgot about it long ago.

313
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,020
What are you doing?

314
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,320
This is blackjack, scientifically known as Bidens pilosa.

315
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,860
It's good for people with the three highs. 
  (T/N: blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar) 

316
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,120
Why not brew a cup for Li Qiang?

317
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,400
He won't drink it. He has a picky mouth.

318
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,825
Looking down on traditional Chinese medicine?

319
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:06,280
No.

320
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,174
Smile.

321
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,950
We got up early in the morning to join you. It's all true love.

322
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,470
True love.

323
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,820
The mountains are really nice.

324
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,720
The air here is good, too.

325
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,580
Cong, they're wearing the same scarves!

326
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,950
Yes.

327
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,230
This trip wasn't in vain.

328
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,150
If only Du Man and Li Tian were here too, it would be even more fun.

329
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,630
Chen Huan Er!

330
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,020
Are your legs healed? You're running so quickly.

331
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,240
- What? 
 - Kumquat. Try it. It's super sweet. Here.

332
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,390
- Is it sweet? 
 - Sweet, my foot. Sweet, my foot.

333
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,520
Stop.

334
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,820
- Be careful with his legs. 
 - It's fine.

335
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,600
Xi Chi is a boy. Just let them play.

336
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,670
Look at her.

337
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,840
A girl acting like a mischievous monkey.

338
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,500
- Who did she get that from? 
 - From you, of course.

339
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,430
She takes after her dad, okay?

340
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,680
She got her beauty from you.

341
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,500
- It hurts. 
 - You deserved it.

342
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,470
- Dad, help me. 
 - Huan Er, eat this.

343
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,340
This is sweet. Ignore him.

344
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,920
Dad, why are you helping outsiders instead?

345
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,190
Dad...

346
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,300
It's too sour.

347
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,850
This is great.

348
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,095
Uncle, why are you also...

349
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,340
Eat one.

350
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,520
No way.

351
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,100
Open your mouth.

352
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,000
Such a good son.

353
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,704
Let me take a look.

354
00:21:49,704 --> 00:21:52,010
Song Cong!

355
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,260
Cong, give him a good one!

356
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,870
- Okay, come take a photo. 
 - Look here.

357
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,360
I need to get a camera to learn from you.

358
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,580
How can I take a photo without a camera?

359
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,160
Am I right?

360
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,060
It feels like everything is starting to get better.

361
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,230
Come, raise your glass again.

362
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,670
Welcome to Sishui.

363
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,120
Welcome to my hometown.

364
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,470
 Welcome. 

365
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,710
- This environment is nice. 
 - Right?

366
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,320
The food is fresh, too.

367
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,120
I guarantee it's delicious, and you'll be full.

368
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,200
Here, Huan Er, it's your favorite.

369
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,000
Eat more, Huan Er.

370
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,330
- This is delicious, Mom. 
 - I'll go to the toilet.

371
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,910
Eat up.

372
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,430
Hao Mei, just leave him alone,

373
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,501
that's his hobby. Let him be.

374
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,908
Do you know how he keeps his figure? He doesn't eat.

375
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:52,682
He just wants to hold his camera.

376
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:55,430
He never eats, just like a ghost.

377
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,050
Mom, happy birthday!

378
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,540
Happy birthday!

379
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,080
- Thank you. 
 - Happy birthday, Yi Fan.

380
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,900
   

381
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
Wait a minute, Mom.

382
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,390
- Haven't made a wish yet. 
 - That's right.

383
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,990
- Right? 
 - Yes.

384
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,390
- Make a wish. 
 - Okay.

385
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,920
I hope you three have a smooth year as juniors.

386
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,430
I hope you stay peaceful, safe, and healthy.

387
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,490
Get good grades.

388
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,990
Is that it?

389
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,554
Besides the kids' health, adults need to be healthy too.

390
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:33,300
The health of the adults is a blessing for the children.

391
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,340
Yes, you're right. I hadn't thought of that.

392
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,740
Yes, we should be healthy. Everyone should be healthy.

393
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,020
Great.

394
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,720
Mom.

395
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,950
We haven't sung the birthday song yet.

396
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,990
Huan Er, you start.

397
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,430
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

398
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,710
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

399
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,190
- ♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪ 
 - Happy birthday, my dear!

400
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,060
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

401
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,710
Wait a minute, Mom. I have another surprise for you.

402
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,910
Look at my son.

403
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,150
How troublesome.

404
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,200
- You don't know how blessed you are. 
 - We envy you so much.

405
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,300
I wonder what he has up his sleeve.

406
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,720
Isn't that our old photos?

407
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,400
Yes, Mom. Isn't that you?

408
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,728
- Yes. This was from my medical school days. 
 - You found the photos to surprise her.

409
00:24:15,728 --> 00:24:17,096
They were taken back then.

410
00:24:17,096 --> 00:24:18,540
Is that me?

411
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,800
Yes, that one.

412
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,230
That was us. Wasn't Song Hang handsome?

413
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,520
Wearing a beige suit just like...

414
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,840
I said he looked like a returning overseas Chinese.

415
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,260
No, Shanghai Bund. He's like Xu Wen Qiang from Shanghai Bund.

416
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,580
Chow Yun Fat.

417
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,020
- That's right. 
 - That was his only presentable outfit.

418
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,340
He wore it every day.

419
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,910
- But didn't it attract you anyway? 
 - Exactly!

420
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,000
Xi Chi really put a lot of effort into this.

421
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,430
It seems he will celebrate with you every year.

422
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,990
That's why I want to remind him that I'm not too old, but not young either.

423
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,780
Why treat me like a child and celebrate my birthday every year?

424
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,430
Mom, you can't say that.

425
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,360
I know you've always done your best,

426
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,820
thinking that taking good care of our home is your duty.

427
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,990
I made this video to tell you that, Mom, your life has always been exciting.

428
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,580
You deserve a great birthday.

429
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,790
Correct.

430
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,910
All right. Stop it, I feel so embarrassed.

431
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,270
Li Qiang, hurry, get the knife. I'll portion the cake.

432
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,120
I'll go get it now.

433
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,990
I envy you so much.

434
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,240
When do you think our two families will have this kind of treatment?

435
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,419
By the way, Li Na, your birthday isn't far from Yi Fan's, right?

436
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:27,100
I...

437
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,390
Yes, your birthday is coming up soon.

438
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,080
Huan Er, you should celebrate your mom's birthday.

439
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,840
Just follow this standard.

440
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,780
What? I never celebrate my birthday.

441
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,260
- Should we do it? 
 - No.

442
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,910
Here, this big one is for Huan Er.

443
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,710
Take it.

444
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,150
This one is for Hao Mei's family.

445
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,720
- Cong, this is for you. 
 - Thank you.

446
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,710
Try it.

447
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,100
This is for my husband.

448
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,990
Thank you for your hard work.

449
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,020
Not at all.

450
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,990
This is for my son.

451
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,710
Jing Xi Chi, what are you doing on my rooftop this early in the morning?

452
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,230
A typhoon is coming.

453
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,190
These old tiles on your roof are breaking apart,

454
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,820
so I fixed them for you. No need to thank me.

455
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,120
- Why are you coming up? 
 - I want to see the scenery.

456
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,615
You don't know, but in my childhood, I used to climb up to play.

457
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,430
- Slow down. 
 - All right.

458
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,390
Chen Huan Er.

459
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,260
I know your secret now.

460
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,590
What secret?

461
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,854
How could anyone wish to be as strong as a bull?

462
00:27:13,854 --> 00:27:15,020
Give it back.

463
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,250
Why did you have such a wish?

464
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,100
Over here as well.

465
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,460
- Don't look at it. 
 - What's this? I haven't seen this yet.

466
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,840
   

467
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,480
I wrote this when I was a kid.

468
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,960
Then it seems your wish has come true.

469
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,519
My grandpa was right.

470
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,230
Just write your wish on the tiles, and it will come true.

471
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,144
Hold on.

472
00:27:53,144 --> 00:27:55,480
What do you want to do? Slow down.

473
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,085
Be careful, this ladder isn't very solid.

474
00:27:58,085 --> 00:28:00,460
I've repaired it, too.

475
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,830
- Wait for me. 
 - What are you going to do?

476
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,430
You'll see.

477
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,820
Why did you write so many wishes?

478
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,150
It's rude to look at others' wishes.

479
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,600
Didn't you write a lot, too?

480
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,482
Wishing is free anyway. Just write as many as you like.

481
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:45,580
Let me see what you wrote.

482
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,100
Nothing.

483
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,140
Okay, let's not look at each other's wishes.

484
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,240
So annoying...

485
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,470
By the way, you didn't tell me about Aunt Lin's birthday surprise.

486
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,340
Why so mysterious? Aren't we buddies?

487
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,048
What is a surprise?

488
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:01,430
What's the point of telling you in advance?

489
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,640
Let me tell you.

490
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,910
On the outside, my mom looks gentle and mild-mannered.

491
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,020
She always says it's too much trouble to celebrate her birthday at her age,

492
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,980
but if you prepare a surprise for her, she'll still be very happy.

493
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,340
True.

494
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,950
By the way, do you celebrate your mom's birthday every year?

495
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,100
This year's celebration is low-key.

496
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,260
What about last year?

497
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,880
It was... a bit more extravagant.

498
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,980
How so?

499
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,960
 Jing Xi Chi. 

500
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,020
 Happy birthday, Mom! 

501
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,340
   

502
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,339
 What are you doing? 

503
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:46,870
 Happy birthday! 

504
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,260
 Are there any cakes? 

505
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,300
 - Yes. 
 - Let me have some. 

506
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,780
 Ms. Lin, are there any cakes for us? 

507
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,617
She didn’t let me step into the hospital for months after that.

508
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:00,383
She must have been very angry.

509
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,440
She's just stubborn.

510
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,305
Anyway, it just has to be memorable.

511
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:09,360
I have to let my mom know on her birthday that she's the most important person in my heart.

512
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:16,990
So, what moms say isn't necessarily true.

513
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,100
Didn't you say that we shouldn't look at each other's wishes?

514
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,840
- No. You'll know later. 
 - Let me see.

515
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,020
- Don't be so stingy. 
 - No, it won't work if you see it.

516
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,140
- Just this once. 
 - No, absolutely not.

517
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,740
It won't work after you see it.

518
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,580
 Mom, why don't you want to celebrate your birthday? 

519
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,990
 What birthday? It's just another year passing by. 

520
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,040
 We'll just have a meal. Don't make a big fuss over it. 

521
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:30,690
So, what moms say sometimes isn't necessarily true.

522
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,510
 Hey, girl. 

523
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,950
Dad, are you busy?

524
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,150
Do you have the time to take a vacation and come home?

525
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,540
 What's wrong? 

526
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,340
Isn't Mom's birthday coming soon?

527
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,810
I'm thinking of celebrating it with you.

528
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,580
 Oh, is that so? 

529
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,180
 We've been practicing for the competition recently. 

530
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,120
 It's hard to say. 

531
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,540
Okay, I understand.

532
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,390
I understand.

533
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,600
So you just don't want to help?

534
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,340
Didn't you say all I know how to do is make videos?

535
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,820
Why ask me for help then?

536
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,730
- That's enough. 
 - Shut up.

537
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,990
I was wrong, okay? I'm sorry!

538
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,820
Big Brother.

539
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,580
Louder.

540
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,220
Big Brother!

541
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,990
What is it?

542
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,500
I just want to celebrate my mom's birthday.

543
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,430
I don't have any pictures of her in the album.

544
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,990
I want to ask you for your help.

545
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,820
Then I guess I have no choice but to help you.

546
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,390
Thank you, Big Brother.

547
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,720
Anyway, I looked through all the pictures.

548
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,440
I remember there are pictures of Aunt Li Na.

549
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,140
- Really? Where? 
 - It should be in Cong's album.

550
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,990
I'll find it.

551
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,470
Where is it? Isn't this the one?

552
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
So pretty.

553
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:58,120
When I saw it, I thought Uncle Song and Aunt Li Na were quite close.

554
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,777
There are so many photos of them together.

555
00:34:59,777 --> 00:35:01,262
Really?

556
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:03,962
Your dad must have taken this photo.

557
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,120
When I saw it, I thought

558
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,580
your dad and your mom's relationship must have been extraordinary.

559
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,850
Now, when I see this photo, I feel like...

560
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,000
I have discovered something incredible.

561
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,060
Even though it's hard to believe, hear me out first.

562
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,910
Let me analyze it for you.

563
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,620
Aunt Li Na was smiling so happily and brilliantly.

564
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,790
The love in her eyes overflowed.

565
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,980
Thank goodness your dad and your mom didn't end up together.

566
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,759
Otherwise, I would've lost two of my closest friends.

567
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:01,112
I'd be the only kid in the compound.

568
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:03,180
- Jing Xi Chi. 
 - Are you sick?

569
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,350
If you are, go see a doctor.

570
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,220
You two don't believe me?

571
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,660
There is concrete evidence.

572
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,400
Come here. Take a closer look.

573
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,500
 Have you finished shooting? 

574
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,320
 I'm done. 

575
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,950
 Does it look good? 

576
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,870
 Of course. 

577
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,870
 You are pretty. You're photogenic no matter how I take it. 

578
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,371
 Okay, I'll get it from you later. 

579
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:42,849
 No need. After I develop the photos, I'll send them to your department. 

580
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:44,700
 Thank you, Song Hang. 

581
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,120
 Yi Fan, let me take some for you as well. 

582
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,140
Look at this girl.

583
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,470
Doesn't she look like Huan Er?

584
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,850
Song Hang.

585
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,720
There's some resemblance.

586
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,900
I think if Huan Er dresses up a little, she wouldn't lose to these actresses.

587
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,120
Exactly. I think Huan Er just needs to dress up a little.

588
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,470
Actually, her facial features are pretty nice.

589
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,140
Exactly.

590
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,500
She's just like Li Na.

591
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,450
Born with good looks, she'll be fine.

592
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,870
Li Na was always the prettiest.

593
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,260
- Do still you miss her? 
 - What are you saying?

594
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,140
Our son is here.

595
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,950
What's wrong?

596
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,500
Nothing. I'm fine.

597
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,570
Have a kumquat.

598
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,400
What's wrong?

599
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,430
It's sour.

600
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,390
Has it gone bad?

601
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,280
It's not sour.

602
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,430
The photo.

603
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,720
The photo?

604
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,020
You really enlarged it.

605
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,100
How did you do it?

606
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,990
The guys at the photo studio did it.

607
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,660
They must have their own techniques.

608
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,120
Look.

609
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,790
Look at this picture of my mom.

610
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,920
She is so beautiful.

611
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,870
She was dressed in bright colors, wearing a big earring.

612
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,600
When my mom told me, I didn't believe her.

613
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,540
I looked through many photos when I went over them.

614
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,560
You haven't seen Aunt Hao yet.

615
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,140
When they were young, they wore matching outfits all the time.

616
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,870
Really?

617
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,210
What a pity.

618
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,020
They don't dress up much now.

619
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,360
My mom always says there's no need to dress up after becoming a mom.

620
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,290
Everyone says time kills beauty.

621
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:39,890
I think my parents' youth was stolen by us, not by time.

622
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,850
When I was a kid, I loved browsing our photo albums.

623
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:53,250
Then I thought my parents in the photos looked so energetic.

624
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:58,270
I just wanted to grow up quickly and be like them.

625
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:03,540
Chen Huan Er, when we become parents, will this happen to us too?

626
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,220
Us?

627
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,470
Becoming parents?

628
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,910
No.

629
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,620
I mean, when we both...

630
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,871
Not really.

631
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:28,140
Have you ordered the cake?

632
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,320
When I ordered the cake two days ago, they gave me a coupon.

633
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,470
- Do you want it? 
 - Why didn't you mention it earlier?

634
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,540
I'll look for it.

635
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,910
- Over here. 
 - Right. This one.

636
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,540
Thanks.

637
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,580
   

638
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,020
This looks so good.

639
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,100
Must be delicious.

640
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,220
It does look good,

641
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,260
but it should be quite expensive.

642
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,221
Let's go in and take a look first.

643
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,660
   

644
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,480
Hello there.

645
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,516
- Hello. 
 - I ordered a cake from here.

646
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:10,960
It was ordered by my dad. I want to pay for it.

647
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,231
Hold on, let me check.

648
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:14,830
Did Uncle Chen order it?

649
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,480
I thought you ordered it.

650
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,126
Last night, my dad sent me a message.

651
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:21,040
I was quite surprised.

652
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,317
Maybe he feels guilty for not coming,

653
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:27,470
but honestly, it doesn’t really matter who ordered it.

654
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,140
Let me confirm with you:

655
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,469
you've ordered the Fantasy Princess. 
    

656
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:33,020
Am I right?

657
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,270
This one?

658
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,120
Yes.

659
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,960
It seems like in Uncle Chen's eyes, Aunt Li Na is still a little princess.

660
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,140
I don't know...

661
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,930
It feels kinda tacky to me.

662
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,830
It's all right. Look.

663
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,870
It's all pink and tender.

664
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,620
Colorful. Vibrant.

665
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,950
Yeah, it's a bit much.

666
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,620
Right?

667
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,000
Sorry, can I switch to this one instead? This one looks good.

668
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,722
- Better than that. 
 - I want to order this one.

669
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:11,700
Sure. So just to confirm, you'll pick it up at 5 PM the day after tomorrow, right?

670
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,100
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

671
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,470
- That'll be 68 yuan. 
 - 68?

672
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,840
I have a coupon.

673
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,950
Can you give me a discount?

674
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,660
Sure.

675
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,020
Here you go.

676
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,370
- Thanks. 
 - No problem.

677
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,310
Excuse me. That cake on the display...

678
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,270
Do you sell it in slices?

679
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,349
I'm sorry. We only sell it whole.

680
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:38,220
We don't sell in slices.

681
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,620
Okay.

682
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,830
Let's go.

683
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,260
Thanks.

684
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,140
   

685
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,750
If you really like it, we could check out some other shops.

686
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,470
No, I was just looking.

687
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:24,690


688
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,960
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

689
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:36,131
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

690
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:42,801
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

691
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:49,331
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

692
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:55,721
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

693
00:43:57,411 --> 00:44:03,531
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

694
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:10,361
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

695
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:17,041
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

696
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:23,641
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

697
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:27,601
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

698
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:32,721
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

699
00:44:32,721 --> 00:44:37,441
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

700
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,001
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

701
00:44:41,001 --> 00:44:46,271
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

702
00:44:46,271 --> 00:44:51,261
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

703
00:44:51,261 --> 00:44:55,061
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

704
00:44:55,061 --> 00:45:00,101
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

705
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:03,691
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

706
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:08,331
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

707
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,741
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

708
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:17,921
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

709
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:23,321
♫  At the right time  ♫
