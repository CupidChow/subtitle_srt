I didn't mean that.

When I couldn't sleep,

42
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,580
I used to think

43
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,300
of something happy and relaxing,

44
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,270
and then I'd fall asleep.

00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,230
Did it work?

46
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,460

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,740
Actually,

98
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,740
you don't need to learn this now.

99
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,590
No,

100
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,590
I have to learn.

101
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,230
There are other students in our class

102
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,260
who are learning too.

103
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,260

I can't accept that others
are better than me.

106
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,422
I just want to be number one.

107
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,466
Why do you just want to be number one?

108
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,350
I have no idea.

109
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,710
I'm just used to being first.

110
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,030

111
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,150
No.

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,260
You're a lot

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,990
like the old me.

114
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,710
The old you?

115
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:54,500
From primary school to high school,

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,620
I never came second.

117
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,300
At that time,

118
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,520
I was a genius in the eyes
of both students

119
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,380
and parents.

120
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,688
Studying gave me a sense
of achievement.

121
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,990
As time went by,

122
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,110
I felt

123
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,590
I was born to be better than others.

124
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:14,550
But then I went to Yenching University

125
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,230
and I realized

126
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,710
that it wasn't like that at all.

127
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,550
Because you couldn't easily
be number one anymore?

128
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,620
That was the first time I found

129
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,380
studying to be painful.

130
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,430
(Then, I)

131
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,590
(studied day and night.)

132
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:41,470
(Finally, on one exam,)

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,310
(I came in second.)

134
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,230
(That's good.)

135
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,190
(You can be number one)

136
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,860
(after that.)

137
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,900
(I gave up.)

138
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,830
Why?

139
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,830
Because I found out

140
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,710
that the top student in our class

141
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:02,230
is a 15-year-old kid
who doesn't usually come to class.

142
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,660
A whiz-kid?

144
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,220
(Professional Ranking 2)

145
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,740
(That was the moment)

146
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,260
(I realized)

147
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:31,350
(that a lot of things
I had to work very hard for)

148
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,140
(were as easy as drinking water)

149
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,950
(for some people.)

150
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,710
From that moment on,

151
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,590
I gave up

152
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,244
my obsession with being number one

153
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,350
and accepted the fact

154
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,470
that I was just

155
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,380
an ordinary person.

156
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,900
Are you happy now?

157
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,140

158
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:57,070

161
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,990
They asked for a new teacher.

162
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,230
Thank you.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,020
Sorry to trouble you.

Aren't you surprised?

165
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,350
I could guess.

166
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,710
Can I ask why?

167
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,933
It's certainly not a matter
of professionalism.

168
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,740
If you can't teach them,

169
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,020
I don't know who to recommend.

170
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,230
I probably

171
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,470
can't satisfy their demands.

172
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,140

173
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,860
but who can be number one forever?

I'm buying.

178
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,830
Okay.

179
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,310
I told you I'd buy you a meal.

180
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:28,140
Why don't you let me
buy you a nice meal?

181
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,070
I think this is nice.

182

There's no need for formality.

183
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,860
Actually, you...

184
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,110
You didn't have to talk so much
to that kid.

185
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,590
If you hadn't talked
to him about life,

186
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,260
you wouldn't have lost your job.

187
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,020
I saw him

188
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:49,076
and thought of my old self.

189
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,590
I was also afraid
that he'd lose his self-confidence

190
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,755
if he entered an environment

191
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,088
like Yenching University.

192
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,380
But there are some things

193
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,620
you can't understand

194
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:02,155
until you've experienced them yourself.

195
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,590
I remember

196
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:08,260
you were always in the top three
in high school, right?

197
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,020
How did you adjust your mindset?

198
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,540
Do you know

199
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,377
how much I wanted to be number one?

200
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,990
But as long as you're around,

201
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,140
I'd never get it.

202
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,740
So, thanks to you,

203
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
I'm used to it.

204
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,590
Shouldn't you thank me?

205
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,310
I found you a job.

206
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,780
And I grew up knowing

207
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
that I don't always get

208
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,740
what I want.

209
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,590
This dish is quite tasty.

210
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,710
Eat more.

211
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,020
Hello, guys.

212
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,070
You're here.

213
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,019
What took you so long?

214
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,590
Sorry,

215
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,110
we're late.

216
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,350
You have no sense of time.

217
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,190
It's only five minutes late, Xinyan.

218
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,400
Did you order the food?

219
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,680
Yes. I thought I'd wait for you
before they serve the food.

220
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:04,800
Start with some appetizers.

221
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,222
Sure.

222
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:05,733
Okay.

223
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,590
Huan'er,

224
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,070
you and Jing Xichi

225
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,511
will stay in Wu'an from now on?

226
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,590
Highly probable.

227
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,177
I applied for graduate school
at my school.

228
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,430
He's handed over his person

229
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,190
and his website

230
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,310
to the company.

231
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,830
He'll be working for them.

232
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,900
Not bad, Jing Xichi.

233
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,190
Whether or not

234
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,310
the next Bill Gates
or Zuckerberg appears

235
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,070
in my circle depends on you.

236
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,066
I'll try my best.

237
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,110
Do well in university.

238
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:32,190
Don't think of dropping out.

239
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,955
Of course not.

240
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,140
Time flies.

241
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,710
A rebellious teenager
becomes a henpecked man.

242
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Who says otherwise?

243
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,710
You two are better.

244
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:45,266
Pursuing master's
and doctoral degrees consecutively.

245
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,688
You've seen the pigs getting fed,

246
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,266
but not them getting slaughtered.

247
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,900
I wish I could have graduated earlier.

248
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,500
Hello, everyone!

249
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,710
You're so late.

250
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,780
You're finally here.

251
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,260
Isn't this Mr. Li?

252
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,440
I heard you're going back
to Tianhe No.3 Central Hospital

253
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:01,240
for your internship.

254
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,350
Yes, that's the plan.

255
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,310
You're the most obedient.

256
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,140
What's wrong?

257
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,110
He's doing good.

258
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,620
He lives and eats at home,

259
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,488
and his immediate superior is his dad.

260
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,350
Unlike us,

261
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,620
we work hard every day for our future.

262
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,020
He's lying

263
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,430
on the finish line now.

264
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,740
He's a life winner.

265
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,900
Don't say that.

266
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,190
A life winner?

267
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,380
I haven't even had

268
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,470
a girlfriend.

269
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,620
Liao Xinyan, stop chatting on the phone.

270
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,860
It's a class reunion.

271
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:28,288
You can chat until you get home.

272
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:29,350
He's clingy.

273
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,860
No, no.

274
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,070
I suspect

275
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,110
my recent toothache

276
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,355
must be due to seeing too many

277
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:36,577
of your affectionate displays.

278
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:37,155
Pissed me off.

279
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,780
What? You want to fall in love?

280
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,710
You don't?

281
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,540
I don't.

282
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,740
You and Song go to the same university.

283
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,355
Why don't you two try to fall in love?

284
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:46,710
Why are you still such a talker?

285
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,900
What's wrong?

286
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,230
If you criticize me again,

287
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,110
I'll sing the alphabet song
for everyone.

288
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,555
What alphabet song?

289
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,740
A, B, C, D...

290
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,190
Come here.

291
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,020
E, F, G.

292
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,577
Keep singing.

293
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:57,020
What?

294
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:57,955
You still want to sing?

295
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,620
Don't touch me!

296
00:14:58,644 --> 00:14:59,555
Are you singing or not?

297
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,070
Sing loudly. Come on.

298
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,620
Come in.

299
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,780
Hi,

300
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,860
we got a call from a Mr. Bai.

301
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,780
He asked us

302
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,310
to give this to Ms. Liao Xinyan.

303
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,350
My tooth hurts even more.

304
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,310
It's been almost two and a half years.

305
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,710
Why is he still so sweet?

306
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,900
What?

307
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,540
Singles don't get to talk,

308
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,070
huh?

309
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,780
The one she's chatting with isn't this.

310
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,580
(My baby, I don't want
to break up with you)

311
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,020
No wonder they say

312
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,780
graduation season is break-up season.

313
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,190
Anyway, Xinyan,

314
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,780
we're in the second half
of our third year.

315
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,710
Isn't it a bit early for you

316
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,860
to break up?

317
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,190
I... I'm really fine.

318
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,733
I just want to graduate and take
the civil service exam back to Tianhe.

319
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,710
He's an only child.

320
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,380
His home is near our school,

321
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,511
and I can't come back.

322
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,500
I thought

323
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,190
I'd let go and be free.

324
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,070
I'm looking for my next romance.

325
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,260
If that's the case,

326
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,710
we'll wish you good luck
on your civil service exam.

327
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,190
Okay?

328
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:10,900
Sure.

329
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,430
Come on.

330
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,950
Wait.

331
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,620
We're drinking

332
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,844
before the food is served?

333
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,950
Jing Xichi,

334
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,990
we didn't decide
on a winner last time, did we?

335
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,620
Come on.

336
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,430
This time,

337
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,777
do you want to fight me again?

338
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,740
Put that drink down.

339
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,070
You can't get drunk today,

340
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,470
even if everyone else does.

341
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,990
Then let's cut the cake

342
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,260
to celebrate my happy breakup.

343
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:29,990
Cut the cake.

344
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,780
Come on.

345
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,900
Waitress.

346
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,190
Knife.

347
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,990
Knife.

348
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,577
I'll get her.

349
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,380
Miss.

350
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,260
What do you need?

351
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,990
Knife.

352
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,620
Waitress.

353
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,740
Here it is.

354
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,229
The knife is here.

355
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:43,555
I'm so speechless of you.

356
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,430
Xinyan, you're making a fool of us...

357
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,020
Be careful.

358
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,620
Cut the ties of love.

359
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,830
This knife is so big.

360
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,190
But I really didn't expect

361
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,900
Xinyan to take the civil service exam.

362
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,140
Maybe she's the one who knows

363
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,230
what she wants the most among us.

364
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,070
Jing Xichi,

365
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,350
do you think we'll change?

366
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,870
No matter how you change,

367
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,470
my love for you

368
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:09,580
will never change.

369
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,260
Be serious.

370
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,044
I'll go back now.

371
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:13,190
I'm very serious.

372
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,777
You're just leaving like that.

373
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:16,933
Where is my kiss?

374
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,710
Stop it.

375
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,990
What if my dad sees it?

376
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:21,573
There's no one here.

377
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,580
Don't.

378
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,300
Your dad already knew.

379
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,222
What are you afraid of?

380
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:27,911
Don't be late.

381
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,430
I'm leaving.

382
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:28,910
Go back now.

383
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,230
Get up early.

384
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,630
Got it.

385
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,100
(Second semester of third year)

386
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,311
(arrives in a rush.)

387
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,710
(Youth comes to a screeching halt)

388
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
(when it stumbles.)

389
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,340
(The note of parting is played.)

390
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,990
(We've reached)

391
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,430
(the point where we're facing society
and the future.)

392
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,950
(But life)

393
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,020
(is always full of surprises.)

394
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,390
I'll raise a toast.

395
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:57,022
There's a message from the counselor.

396
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,580
Let me see.

397
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:03,470
It's this late in the day

398
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,630
and he's still sending out

399
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:05,844
internship questionnaires.

400
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:07,020
The third year isn't over yet,

401
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,000
and we're already looking forward
to the future.

402
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,020
Right,

403
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,780
Lu,

404
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,500
I thought you said

405
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,133
you were looking for a job in advance.

406
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,950
How is it?

407
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,580
I've been thinking about it,

408
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,230
and I've got maybe
30 or 40 years of time

409
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,820
to work in the future.

410
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,780
But I only have

411
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,260
a year or so left to fall in love

412
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,710
in university.

413
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,430
So I've decided

414
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,710
not to rush into finding a job.

415
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm going to have

416
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,910
a good love affair

417
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,670
in university.

418
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,950
To be honest,

419
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,190
what are your plans?

420
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,710
It's senior year.

421
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,230
It's the norm for couples to break up

422
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,600
and go their separate ways.

423
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,260
Huan'er,

424
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,444
you've got to be careful.

425
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,580
Jing Xichi's work

426
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,580
is on track now.

427
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,260
I think I'll stay in Wu'an too.

428
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:50,022
You're going to graduate school?

429
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,910
I can't help it.

430
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,060
My grades aren't good.

431
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:53,630
Huixin is number one,

432
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:54,710
and I'm number five.

433
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,244
There are only four spots available.

434
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,950
Huixin,

435
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,710
the future of pharmacy

436
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,820
depends on you.

437
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,844
Don't talk about me.

438
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,580
Li,

439
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:05,430
what's your plan?

440
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,990
My parents found me a

441
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,955
pharmaceutical company.

442
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,950
Is it Guangfeng?

443
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,300
It's a dream place

444
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,910
for pharmacy graduates.

445
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,020
Their branch

446
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,710
has business with my parents,

447
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,060
so they helped me get in.

448
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,950
Don't forget us when you're doing great.

449
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,260
Researchers

450
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,020
depend on you.

451
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,260
Let's raise a toast?

452
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,430
Come on.

453
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,430
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

454
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,300
I'll take a call.

455
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,950
Are the exam questions hard?

456
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,500
Not too hard.

457
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,540
Come on, let's drink.

458
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,430
Bottoms up.

459
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:45,910
Cheers.

460
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,630
Huixin.

461
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,710
Huixin,

462
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,710
what took you so long?

463
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,710
Come here.

464
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,990
Come sit with me for a while.

465
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,020
I haven't had a good chat with you.

466
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,230
Huan'er,

467
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,933
do you still want
to go to graduate school?

468
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,430
What's wrong?

469
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,540
I

470
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,910
am not going to graduate school.

471
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,780
I'm going back to my hometown
to look for a job after graduation.

472
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,260
No.

473
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,020
Why do you want
to go back to your hometown?

474
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,100
Isn't it your ambition
to go to graduate school

475
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,500
since you entered university?

476
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,430
You work so hard every day.

477
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,340
You're just giving up like this?

478
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,777
My brother scored very well
in his senior year

479
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,780
of high school.

480
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,740
As an elder sister,

481
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,740
I have to do my part.

482
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,060
No.

483
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,740
What decade are we living in?

484
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,260
Do things like this still happen?

485
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,910
Don't you have a scholarship

486
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,870
and a grant?

487
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,710
You are not dependent

488
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,500
on your family.

489
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,577
How come your family
won't let you study?

490
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,300
My parents called me before.

491
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,710
They're getting old.

492
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:21,777
They can't afford to support
another university student.

493
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:23,540
So they want me to go home early

494
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,500
and help out,

495
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,710
and start working early.

496
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,340
Besides,

497
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,470
if I go home early,

498
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,190
I can take care of them

499
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,733
if anything happens to them.

500
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,150
As you know,

501
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:40,150
I had to repeat a year

502
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,020
to get in here.

503
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,740
Compared to my brother,

504
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,340
I don't have much talent for studying.

505
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,733
Huixin.

506
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,500
I now realize

507
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,950
that studying is the happiest thing

508
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,060
in the world.

509
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,200
There will be one more spot

510
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,780
for graduate school if I quit.

511
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:31,630
If you have made up your mind,

512
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,300
I can help you prepare the documents.

513
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,820
I don't want it.

514
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,340
Consider it

515
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,150
a way to repay you

516
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,222
for taking care of me
these past three years.

517
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,260
Huan'er,

518
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,500
actually, I know what you
and the girls did.

519
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,190
Like Li,

520
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,260
she's a rich girl,

521
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,910
but she asked for samples

522
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,150
when she bought things.

523
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,540
Lu is so lazy,

524
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:11,800
but she always got a part-time job

525
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,430
at the student union.

526
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:16,244
When she got back to the dorm,
she told me she was going home

527
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:18,177
and asked me to go in her place.

528
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,630
As for you,

529
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:23,780
you're afraid I won't
get enough to eat,

530
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:26,800
so you always buy an extra dish.

531
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,430
No...

532
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,710
Huixin...

533
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,780
Think about it again.

534
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,500
Huixin,

535
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,100
are you alright?

536
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,630
Why are you back?

537
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,020
Qiu Li sent me a message.

538
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:51,910
Dong Huixin,

539
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:53,644
are you willing to do that?

540
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,910
Yeah.

541
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:58,133
You don't get
to choose your background,

542
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,150
but you do get to choose

543
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,630
what kind of life you want to live.

544
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,340
Huixin, even if you don't go
to graduate school,

545
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,820
what can you do back home?

546
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:08,060
Why don't you stay in Wu'an

547
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,150
and prove yourself?

548
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,540
Yes, just stay.

549
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,950
Think about it.

550
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:15,222
Give me your parents' phone number.

551
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:16,066
I'll talk to them.

552
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,150
Stop it.

553
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,540
How do you know if you don't try?

554
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,190
Try it.

555
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,820
You're so young.

556
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,990
Okay.

557
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,950
I'll reconsider.

558
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,022
Let me think about it.

559
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,430
Let me think about it.

560
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,422
Let me think about it.

561
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,820
Stop drinking.

562
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,230
Come on.

563
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,390
We'll drink with you.

564
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:32,950
Come on.

565
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,288
- Qiu Li, get down.
- Qiu Li.

566
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:35,644
- Qiu Li.
- Let's drink.

567
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,230
Let's drink.

568
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,470
You girls...

569
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,100
Cheers!

570
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,540
Don't go back.

571
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,740
Don't go back.

572
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,340
Forget the unhappy things.

573
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,870
Let's drink. Come on, cheers!

574
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,390
Cheers!

575
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,540
Huixin.

576
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,740
Huixin.

577
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,100
Let's stay together, Huixin.

578
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,780
We love you.

579
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,190
Jing,

580
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,060
come on.

581
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,740
I'll talk to HR tomorrow.

582
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:17,950
You can work here for now.

583
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:18,710
Okay.

584
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,340
Mr. Jiang.

585
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,990
Jing, let me introduce them to you.

586
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,060
Cai Wenlong, Mr. Cai.

587
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:22,910
He's your senior.

588
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,230
I've sent you someone

589
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,740
this time.

590
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,820
These are the pillars

591
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,355
of our company's technical department.

592
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,222
Cherish the chance

593
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:29,060
and learn from them.

594
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,710
That's great.

595
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,470
Thank you.

596
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,060
Goodbye.

597
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,260
Hi, Mr. Cai.

598
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,820
Excuse me.

599
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:48,820
(The closer we get to graduation,)

600
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:52,990
(the more we feel that the previous
four years of university life)

601
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,950
(were like a party
with the purpose of saying goodbye.)

602
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,470
(Because once we step out
of the campus,)

603
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,670
(all the privileges and
advantages of being a student)

604
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,060
(will disappear.)

605
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,910
(Time)

606
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,630
(is like a whirlpool of great force,)

607
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,390
(silently)

608
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,780
(pushing us into the vastness
of mankind.)

609
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,230
(There are those
who wear out their feet)

610
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,630
(for a salary,)

611
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
(and those who run for the moon)

612
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,060
(in the sky.)

613
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,100
(No one knows)

614
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,422
(what will become of themselves
in the future,)

615
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,390
(only occasionally stopping)

616
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,630
(to see the ignorant)

617
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,710
(and happy)

618
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,060
(new students of the campus,)

619
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,150
(and vaguely remembering)

620
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,470
(that we were)

621
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,910
(also like this.)

622
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:56,460
(Huandao Technology)

623
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:00,910
Mr. Jiang asked me to remind you

624
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:02,977
that the project's go-live date
is confirmed.

625
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,950
The 31st.

626
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:06,000
It's set by the headquarters.

627
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:07,840
Didn't we agree on the middle
of next month?

628
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,333
Why is it half a month earlier?

629
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,060
What Mr. Jiang means is

630
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,600
that we have enough manpower now,

631
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,700
so he'd like to move it forward
as much as possible.

632
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,820
Enough manpower?

633
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,950
I'd like to ask Mr. Jiang

634
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,990
where he got

635
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,630
these men.

636
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,844
Do they count as manpower?

637
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,910
Alright,

638
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,910
I got it.

639
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,910
These men

640
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,710
were sent here to help,

641
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,260
but they didn't do anything to help.

642
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:37,910
They even treat me like a waiter

643
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,911
and make me grind coffee for them.

644
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:41,600
Why didn't they let me do latte art?

645
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,390
Mr. Cai,

646
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:56,600
I'd like to have a word with you.

647
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,470
Surprise!

648
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,820
Huan'er is here.

649
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,000
What brings you here?

650
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:21,711
Well,

651
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,230
I'm here to buy you a meal.

652
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:24,444
Let's go.

653
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:25,711
You haven't had dinner, right?

654
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,580
Go now.

655
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:28,390
I'm not going.
Just buy some food for me.

656
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:29,780
Zhou Ye,

657
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,300
you should hurry back too.

658
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,230
Huixin hasn't had much luck

659
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,355
in finding a job lately,

660
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:35,488
so she's not in a good mood.

661
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,150
Really?

662
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:37,710
I... I'll get going now.

663
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,340
Go, hurry up.

664
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,533
Don't talk to her directly.

665
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:40,155
Okay.

666
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,950
I'm leaving.

667
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,888
What are you waiting for?

668
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,430
Let's go.

669
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,022
Eat it while it's hot.

670
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:51,377
Your favorite
Stir-fried Pork with Chili.

671
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,780
Okay.

672
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,150
Thanks.

673
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,020
Come on.

674
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,430
Eat slowly.

675
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,430
Hello.

676
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,630
Mr. Jiang.

677
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,300
Are you having

678
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
any problems on your end?

679
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,711
The go-live date
has suddenly been moved up.

680
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,950
The workload's just too much.

681
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:20,430
So far, it's just me and Zhou Ye...

682
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,511
Why did you let Mr. Cai
and others leave the team?

683
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,820
They're not working anyway.

684
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,630
Why stay?

685
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,540
You want me

686
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,622
to serve them every day?

687
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,150
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang,

688
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,670
I can't do it.

689
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:41,777
I am obliged to provide you
with manpower.

690
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:43,222
It's your freedom to use them or not.

691
00:29:43,244 --> 00:29:44,100
Anyway,

692
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,580
you must accomplish the task

693
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,430
within the time limit.

694
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,870
I know.

695
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,177
By the end of the month.

696
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,710
Well,

697
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

698
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,340
Come on.

699
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,580
Eat it while it's hot.

700
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,820
I got rid of all those men
sent by Jiang Sen.

701
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,740
I think

702
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,540
if you think

703
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,740
they're not convinced of you,

704
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:19,780
then you need
to show them what you can do

705
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,710
to convince them.

706
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:23,777
You want them to be convinced of me?

707
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,100
It's not easy.

708
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,710
So you'd rather

709
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,630
get rid of them

710
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,430
than try?

711
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,820
Or do you think

712
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,780
you can't handle it?

713
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:34,820
No matter

714
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,580
how hard you try,

715
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,150
you can't

716
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,230
change their minds?

717
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,300
Jing Xichi,

718
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,800
do you remember
what you were like in high school?

719
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,711
The one who wouldn't
give up and move on,

720
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,150
no matter what?

721
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,910
Mr. Cai, Mr. Qian,

722
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:07,340
I bought your favorite

723
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:08,644
roast goose with crispy skin.

724
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:09,111
Is that so?

725
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,430
You've praised this place

726
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,060
out of all the restaurants in Wu'an.

727
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,222
Come on, eat it while it's hot.

728
00:31:13,244 --> 00:31:13,950
Fu, thank you.

729
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,470
We're in for a treat today.

730
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,020
Come on.

731
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,260
This...

732
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,260
Mr. Cai,

733
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,540
is this roast goose

734
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,190
to your liking?

735
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:26,540
They're the real hosts

736
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,020
of today's meal.

737
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,060
For this meal,

738
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,190
my junior has traveled

739
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,640
across the city to bring it back
from the restaurant himself.

740
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,711
It's full of sincerity.

741
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,500
I remember

742
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,710
when Mr. Jiang proposed

743
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,540
the Yangwu Website,

744
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,230
Mr. Cai,

745
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,540
you voted for it.

746
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,340
Why don't you listen to him

747
00:31:45,355 --> 00:31:46,933
for the sake of the Yangwu Website?

748
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,340
The first order from the Yangwu Website

749
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:52,390
was for me
and my two other best friends

750
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,040
to review for our three years
in high school.

751
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,177
(In bed, he watches the beam and writes)
Inside those materials

752
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,444
are not only the knowledge
we learned in high school,

753
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,190
but also the time we spent

754
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,100
with each other.

755
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,870
I think every old book

756
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,390
carries the memories and ideals

757
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,100
of many people.

758
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,470
I don't want these things

759
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,780
to be eroded by the passage of time.

760
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,780
Young man,

761
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,430
your story is interesting.

762
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,950
Unfortunately,

763
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,150
we don't

764
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,260
buy your story.

765
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,340
Let's go.

766
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:24,950
I know

767
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,150
it's naive

768
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,260
to ask you to fulfill

769
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,430
my wish with me.

770
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:29,580
Anyway, Mr. Cai,

771
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,300
don't you want to do something

772
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,190
for yourself?

773
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,740
What do you mean?

774
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,230
Hello,

775
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,430
Fu Ying.

776
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,230
Can you help me find out

777
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,422
about Mr. Cai's preferences

778
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,470
and the projects

779
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,100
he's worked on

780
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,020
over the years?

781
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:48,990
Okay.

782
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,100
Only his alone?

783
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,390
Yes.

784
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,990
Only his.

785
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,100
As I know,

786
00:32:57,777 --> 00:32:59,577
Mr. Cai, you've been working in Huandao

787
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,820
for seven years.

788
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,540
But you've only been promoted once.

789
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,580
In recent years,

790
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:07,870
you haven't even successfully
financed any of the projects

791
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,200
you're directly responsible for,

792
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,190
right?

793
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,190
I wonder

794
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,060
if it's your judgment
in selecting a project

795
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,710
or your ability that's at fault.

796
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,150
Young man,

797
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,230
mind your words.

798
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,710
I've seen all the projects
you've worked on in Huandao.

799
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,990
I don't question

800
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,990
your expertise.

801
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,100
Your expertise

802
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,260
is far superior to mine.

803
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,430
It's just that in recent years,

804
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,390
you've been discouraged by failure.

805
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,780
I also know

806
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,580
that in your mind,

807
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:42,910
you feel aggrieved

808
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,990
that the company sent you,

809
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,100
such an experienced senior,

810
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,820
to give me a hand.

811
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:48,990
But you need a project

812
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,100
that will go live quickly.

813
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,910
The Yangwu Website

814
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,910
needs your technical support.

815
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,190
Only if we work together can we win.

816
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:00,990
Mr. Cai,

817
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,910
please give me a chance

818
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:06,888
and give the Yangwu Website a chance.

819
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:08,540
At the same time,

820
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,500
give yourself a chance.

821
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,350
Do you live far from the hospital?

822
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,310
Not far.

823
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,990
It's only a five-minute walk.

824
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,333
I'm about the same.

825
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,911
Is there anything else you want
to see me about?

826
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,870
Boys must be careful

827
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,870
when they're out.

828
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,060
But don't be too nervous

829
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,220
or too self-absorbed.

830
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:42,900
(Inquiry about The Results
of Master's Examination Candidates)

831
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,777
(Congratulations, you have
been accepted by your first choice.)

832
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,700
How's it?

833
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,350
I...

834
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,140
I've been accepted.

835
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:54,066
(Congratulations, you have
been accepted by your first choice.)

836
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:54,844
That's great.

837
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,777
Your efforts have not been in vain.

838
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,790
Tonight,

839
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,977
I'm buying dinner.

840
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,750
(I just found out)

841
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,830
(that Dong Huixin
didn't keep looking for a job.)

842
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,390
(If you don't go on)

843
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,180
(to study pharmacy,)

844
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,620
(you can't do anything)

845
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,220
(as a pharmacist,)

846
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,870
(doctor,)

847
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,870
(or researcher in Wu'an.)

848
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:40,990
(Later,)

849
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,350
(Dong Huixin returned home)

850
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,270
(and found an ordinary job)

851
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:49,377
(to pay for her brother's
university education.)

852
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,060
(I didn't expect fate)

853
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,220
(to be so unfair.)

854
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:00,310
(In the blink of an eye,)

855
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,750
(my roommates and I)

856
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,430
(are going our separate ways.)

857
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,540
(I wonder)

858
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,140
(when we'll meet again.)

859
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:17,955
Plug in oxygen.

860
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,990
One milligram of adrenaline.

861
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,810
Three minutes once.

862
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,910
One milligram of adrenaline.

863
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:37,711
Three minutes once.

864
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,950
Time of death,

865
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,140
20:37.

866
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:08,955
Take the family
to get a death certificate.

867
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,540
Remember to calm the family down.

868
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,100
Who's it?

869
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,177
Your food delivery has arrived.

870
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,020
What?

871
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,377
I didn't order any food.

872
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,350
It's not my name.

873
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,620
I ordered it.

874
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,830
Thank you.

875
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,500
Have you eaten?

876
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,620
Thank you.

877
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,500
Just eat.

878
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,020
Okay.

879
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Your house has
the same floor plan as mine.

880
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,333
How much did you rent it for?

881
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,390
2,500 yuan.

882
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,470
What?

883
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,140
2,500 yuan.

884
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:50,540
What about you?

885
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:51,950
3,000 yuan.

886
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,350
The landlord told me

887
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,950
I got a great deal,

888
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,133
saying it was the lowest price
in the neighborhood.

889
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:02,577
It turns out
that a top student gets tricked too.

890
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,700
I've actually imagined countless times

891
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,470
a patient dying

892
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,470
in front of me.

893
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,060
I thought I was ready for it.

894
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,830
But when it came to that moment,

895
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,180
I realized I had overestimated myself.

896
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,620
Maybe

897
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,540
one day you'll get used to it.

898
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,020
Get used to facing death?

899
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,060
Get used to accepting

900
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,555
the cycle of life more openly

901
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,220
and face up to your responsibilities
as a doctor.
