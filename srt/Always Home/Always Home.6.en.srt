(One, Two, Three, Pinocchio)

00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,870
Qi Qi.

17
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,780
Qi Qi.

18
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,620
This is for you.

19
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,780
Surprised?

20
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,670
This is a gift from the three of us.

21
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,390
Qi Qi,

22
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,949
we hope you can freely

23
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,780
pursue what you love.

24
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,870
The video was your idea, right?

25
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,710
That wasn't me.

26
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,229
That was Jing Xichi.

27
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,940
He did all the editing and video work.

28
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,890
Didn't I tell you not to say that?

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,340
Don't be so modest.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,520
The bakery said they couldn't make
a big cake in time.

31
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,500
This one is small,
but it's really delicious.

32
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,220
Thank you.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,550
Editing the video must've been tough.

34
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,710
Also...

35
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,549
I didn't understand.

36
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,900
I shouldn't have said that.

37
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,550
You'll definitely get better
and better at soccer.

38
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,660
You'll reach your dream.

39
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,100
I've already forgotten about it.

40
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,030
Thank you all so much.

41
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,310
Don't mention it.

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,550
Qi Qi,

43
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,500
how about a hug?

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,779
Let me hold that for you.

45
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,470
You two hug.

46
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,340
Qi Qi,

47
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,150
don't forget me
after you transfer classes.

48
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,179
I won't.

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,430
I'll never forget you.

50
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,380
You mustn't forget me.

51
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
I'll never forget you.

52
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,990
No crying.

53
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,500
Alright, alright.

54
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,310
I won't forget you guys either.

55
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,870
Let's have a hug too.

56
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,470
After all, we're parting ways.

57
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,750
Thank you.

58
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,100
It's nothing.

59
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,299
It's no big deal.

60
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,620
I'll get going now.

61
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,259
Alright.

62
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,619
Text me when you get home.

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,550
Don't mention it.

64
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,549
Bye-bye.

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,179
I'll get going.

66
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,909
Bye-bye.

67
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,820
Bye-bye.

68
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,990
Be careful on your way home.

69
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,670
You're pretty good with computers.

70
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,379
I never thought about it before.

71
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,669
I always thought

72
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,139
that you couldn't do anything else

73
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,550
besides playing soccer.

74
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,259
Well, it depends

75
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,740
on whether I actually want to do it.

76
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,860
If I don't do something well,

77
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,990
it's simply because I'm not interested.

78
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,229
You don't want Qi Qi to transfer,

79
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,430
do you?

80
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,310
Why are you suddenly asking this?

81
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,620
Nothing, I just feel like

82
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,820
you treat Qi Qi differently.

83
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,580
Once Qi Qi transfers
to the humanities class,

84
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,580
stop deliberately doing poorly in exams.

85
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,139
Hello.

86
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,739
Huan'er?

87
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,430
Qi Qi,

88
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,589
did you see the field trip info

89
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,460
I sent you?

90
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,620
Yeah, I saw it.

91
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,670
I really want to go,

92
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,090
but my mom definitely won't let me.

93
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,909
She just told me

94
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,870
I have a bunch of tutoring classes
in the summer.

95
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,059
But it's school break.

96
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,550
Why won't she let you go?

97
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,029
It's not just a trip.

98
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,179
It's an educational trip.

99
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,349
We'll visit museums

100
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,910
to learn.

101
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,299
Besides, everyone's going.

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,869
Me, Jing Xichi,

103
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,140
Xinyan, Song Cong... everyone.

104
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,110
Are you going?

105
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,020
Liao Xinyan is going too?

106
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,110
Yeah.

107
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,940
Are you going?

108
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,790
I probably won't be able to go.

109
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,350
Alright then.

110
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,460
Bye-bye.

111
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,460
How much?

112
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,350
Ten yuan.

113
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,380
Here.

114
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,989
Hey,

115
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,580
you two didn't wait for me.

116
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,179
Huan'er.

117
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,110
Xinyan!

118
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,580
I didn't see you the entire break.

119
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,230
I kept asking you out. Where were you?

120
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,870
I went back to my hometown
for a few days.

121
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,810
I talked to the group leader earlier.

122
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,789
We're sharing a room.

123
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,140
We can have a nice chat tonight.

124
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,990
This is really good.

125
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,060
Huan'er.

126
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,820
Qi Qi?

127
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,550
You signed up?

128
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,589
I thought you weren't coming.

129
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,299
Yeah, I signed up.

130
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,200
I signed up the day
after you told me about it.

131
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,480
I was worried I might not make it,
so I didn't tell you.

132
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,290
That's amazing.

133
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,700
How did you convince your mom?

134
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,620
I have my ways.

135
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,620
This is great.

136
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,230
Looks like everyone is here now.

137
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,910
Driver, let's go.

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,699
The bus is leaving, sit down.

139
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,660
Xinyan, I wanted to...

140
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,500
Sit down...

141
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,869
We'll talk later.

142
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,379
Okay.

143
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,139
Sit down.

144
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,790
Okay.

145
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,909
Jing Xichi.

146
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,819
You should be the class monitor
for this trip.

147
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,299
You're really good at organizing.

148
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,299
No way.

149
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,260
Let Song Cong do it.

150
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,130
Alright, students, get off the bus.

151
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,100
Grab your luggage.

152
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,019
You still haven't told me

153
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,740
how you convince your mom.

154
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,739
Me?

155
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,189
I told my mom

156
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,420
that I'm going on an educational tour
with classmates,

157
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,580
that it's for learning,

158
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,739
not for fun.

159
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,409
Huan'er.

160
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,590
Can I borrow some
of mosquito repellent you were using?

161
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,820
That's Qi Qi's.

162
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,709
Qi Qi,

163
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,100
can you share your mosquito repellent
with Xinyan?

164
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,220
Thanks.

165
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,539
Xinyan,

166
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,899
spray some on me, too.

167
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,630
Sure.

168
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,860
Here, look.

169
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,940
That's enough.

170
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,030
Song Cong, do you want some?

171
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,060
I'll do it myself.

172
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,740
Alright.

173
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,820
Thanks.

174
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,989
Alright, students,

175
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,989
your room keys are ready.

176
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,190
Let me do a roll call.

177
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,379
Chen Huan'er.

178
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,309
Here.

179
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,310
Liao Xinyan.

180
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,150
Okay, you two are sharing a room.

181
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,800
There was one more person
who came later.

182
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,390
Qi Qi.

183
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,700
You'll have a room to yourself.

184
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:40,829
Sir,

185
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,739
what about us?

186
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,829
Come with me for a moment.

187
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,940
Qi Qi.

188
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,469
If you don't mind,

189
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,980
you can share a bed with me.

190
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,390
It's fine, let's just go
with the arrangement.

191
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,580
Don't be like that.

192
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,259
I really didn't know you were coming.

193
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,510
How about this,

194
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,740
you take the bed,
and I'll sleep on the floor.

195
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,060
No need, I can stay alone.

196
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,899
Come on, let's share a room.

197
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,779
Don't be shy.

198
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,510
Actually, you two can take the bed,
and I'll take the floor.

199
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,310
I roll onto the floor
in my sleep anyway.

200
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,310
Let's stay together, please...

201
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,310
Alright then.

202
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,109
Okay.

203
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,340
Song Cong, mosquito repellent.

204
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,419
I'll put it here.

205
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,220
Thanks.

206
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,890
Looks like everyone else
is heading that way.

207
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,510
Let's go.

208
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,100
Yeah, let's go.

209
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,949
Thanks, sir.

210
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,700
You're welcome.

211
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,790
We're sharing a room.

212
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,790
What are you looking at?

213
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,060
I feel like

214
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,860
there's some tension between them.

215
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,060
Tension?

216
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,510
Stop making things up.

217
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,390
You don't understand.

218
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,419
Girls

219
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,390
do everything holding hands.

220
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,510
What? Are you jealous?

221
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,220
Finally, we're at the park.

222
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,730
What is this, an study trip?

223
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,340
We've been learning all day.

224
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,619
Compared to school,

225
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,700
this isn't much fun either.

226
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,190
Hey, there are boats.

227
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,270
Wouldn't it be fun to go boating?

228
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,739
Let's pair up and race.

229
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,820
That'll be even better.

230
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,829
I'm not feeling well today.

231
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,030
I'll team up with Huan'er.

232
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,740
Huan'er...

233
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,619
How about mixed-gender teams?

234
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,069
That way, it'll be safer.

235
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,190
Sounds good.

236
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,430
Xinyan,

237
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,770
since you're not feeling well,

238
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,019
you team up with Jing Xichi.

239
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,150
He's a sportsman.

240
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,949
Qi Qi,

241
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,980
you team up with Song Cong.

242
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,910
Is that okay?

243
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,740
What about you?

244
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,940
Me?

245
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,829
I'll be a one-person team.

246
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,899
I can take you all on

247
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,860
by myself.

248
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,820
Let's go.

249
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,419
Chen Huan'er, you think you're so tough?

250
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,320
I'm going to crush you.

251
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,800
Hurry up!

252
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,150
Jing Xichi,

253
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,659
what do you like to do
in your free time?

254
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,790
Winning, of course.

255
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,829
Paddle harder.

256
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,060
Come on, catch up to her.

257
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,460
I'm coming for you, Chen Huan'er.

258
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,030
Let's just go at a steady pace.

259
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,419
Safety first.

260
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,670
No need to compete with them.

261
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,670
Chen Huan'er.

262
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,940
I'm coming for you!

263
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,150
Don't run!

264
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,910
Come at me.

265
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,510
Come on, pedal harder.

266
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,910
We're catching up...

267
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,550
No!

268
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,740
Chen Huan'er!

269
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,860
Huan'er!

270
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,390
Huan'er!

271
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,220
- Huan'er!
- Huan'er!

272
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,670
Climb onboard.

273
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,100
Are you okay?

274
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,390
Huan'er, how are you?

275
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,270
Are you alright?

276
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,550
I swallowed too much water.

277
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,460
Are you okay?

278
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,589
How are you?

279
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,790
I'm fine.

280
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,589
You should take Huan'er
back to her room.

281
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,229
She's definitely caught a chill.

282
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,580
I'll go buy her some cold medicine.

283
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,220
Thanks, Qi Qi.

284
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,139
You're welcome.

285
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,940
Go on.

286
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,670
Qi Qi.

287
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,980
Where are you going?

288
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,630
I'm going to buy medicine for Huan'er.

289
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,229
I'll go with you.

290
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,820
No thanks.

291
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,220
I can go by myself.

292
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,539
Jing Xichi,

293
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,340
you were too competitive earlier.

294
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,100
Good thing Huan'er knows how to swim.

295
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,190
I didn't mean for that to happen.

296
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,539
How about

297
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,060
I go apologize to her?

298
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,910
Then hurry up.

299
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,510
Alright, I'll go.

300
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,700
Song Cong.

301
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,510
Do you know where the pharmacy is?

302
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,899
Next to the hotel.

303
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,019
There's a busy street there.

304
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,030
Should be one there.

305
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,790
Can you take me there?

306
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,340
I don't know the way.

307
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,739
Well...

308
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Why don't you ask the front desk?

309
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,060
I've got something to do.

310
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,270
Okay.

311
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,030
Song Cong, try one.

312
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,430
I've had it before.

313
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,670
Let's have a hug too.

314
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,829
What are you doing?

315
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,700
Why are you out here?

316
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,190
You might catch a cold.

317
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,630
I just took a hot shower.

318
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,980
I'm feeling warm.

319
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,220
Where's Xinyan?

320
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,510
She just had dinner with me.

321
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,379
But she was chatting
with the club members.

322
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,989
I didn't feel like I had much to say,

323
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,270
so I left.

324
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,550
Here,

325
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,630
I bought these for you.

326
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,100
Why did you buy oranges?

327
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,190
I wanted to apologize to you.

328
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,340
You see,

329
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,190
when we were boating earlier,

330
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,220
I went overboard.

331
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,390
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,820
It's okay.

333
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,510
If anyone should apologize,

334
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,190
it should be me.

335
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,259
I wasn't thinking clearly

336
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,790
back at the park earlier.

337
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,310
I ended up splitting you and Qi Qi up.

338
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,740
Xichi, I'm sorry.

339
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,430
I'm really sorry.

340
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,189
What are you saying?

341
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,430
Just eat your orange.

342
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,740
Listen,

343
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,700
these oranges are really good.

344
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,499
You haven't even tasted them yet.

345
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,229
They're full of vitamin C,

346
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,379
and they help prevent colds.

347
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,469
You mustn't get sick now.

348
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,820
I'm perfectly healthy.

349
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,060
I run every day,

350
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,790
and my dad teaches me martial arts.

351
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,030
Here it goes, I wonder if it's sweet.

352
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,190
You go first.

353
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,030
Eat mine.

354
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,740
It's too big.

355
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,310
Try it.

356
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,789
Why are you throwing it at me?

357
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,780
Just taste it, come on.

358
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,580
(Red date ginger tea)
Wow, I picked some good oranges.

359
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,379
You ate it.

360
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,029
Fine, I'll stop.

361
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,640
You eat it.

362
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,790
You have a cold, so you eat it.

363
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,620
Here, eat it.

364
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,380
I don't want to.

365
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Eat it...

366
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,400
I don't like oranges, but you do.

380
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,110
Didn't you cry about wanting to go?

381
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,740
Why do you look like this coming back?

382
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,910
Didn't have fun?

383
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,110
It was great,

384
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,390
just a bit tiring.

385
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,459
Then rest well tonight.

386
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,350
Tomorrow, get back
to studying seriously.

387
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,940
Don't forget your promise.

388
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,300
If I let you go,

389
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,390
you'll make it into the top ten
next semester.

390
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,670
Alright.

(The Fountainhead)

392
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,830
Hey, old friend.

393
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,100
I'm not wearing the summer uniform
because I

394
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,070
haven't collected it.

395
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,630
Why aren't you wearing yours?

396
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,939
Uniforms are meant to make

397
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,070
everyone look the same.

398
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,910
They erase individuality.

399
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,390
I don't want to wear it.

400
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,780
A kindred spirit, huh?

401
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,390
(Did everyone get home safely?)

402
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,220
(I'm about to sleep.)

403
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,980
(Rest early, everyone.)

404
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,220
(Did everyone get home safely?
Rest early, everyone.)

405
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,419
You already ate it.

406
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,069
Okay, I'll stop.

407
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,789
You eat it.

408
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,939
You're the one with a cold.

409
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,459
You eat it.

410
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,540
I don't want to.

411
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,459
(Did everyone get home safely?
I'm about to sleep.)

412
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,350
(Okay, good night.)

413
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,789
(Rest early, everyone.
Okay, good night.)

414
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,700
(Good night.)

415
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,180
(Okay, good night. Good night.)

Qi Qi.

418
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,300
Qi Qi.

419
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,780
Qi Qi.

420
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,900
I finally see you. I tried
calling you over the holidays,

421
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,900
but you never came out.

422
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,860
After that trip,

423
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,350
I was stuck in tutoring classes.

424
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,780
How are you guys?

425
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,350
The three of us?

426
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,630
We're good. Just the same as always.

427
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,350
That's good.

428
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,780
Why do I get the feeling
you've become colder toward Qi Qi

429
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,540
after the holidays?

430
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,910
I realized

431
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,390
that I'm a rare soul.

432
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,410
The fact that I'm so noble

433
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,419
makes it impossible

434
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,150
for me to truly connect with anyone.

435
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,980
You wouldn't understand.

436
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,150
Sure.

437
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,109
By the way,

438
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,540
I forgot to ask which floor
the humanities class is on.

439
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,029
They moved us to another building.

440
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,740
They say it's to facilitate management.

441
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,460
Alright then.

442
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,419
I'll just run faster

443
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,780
and visit you during breaks.

444
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,219
I'll visit you too.

445
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's go to that snack stall
after school.

446
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,659
Yes!

447
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,309
Alright, stop with the emotional moment.

448
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,700
Morning self-study is starting.

449
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,070
Ignore him.

450
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,150
We'll never be apart.

451
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,500
You're heading this way?

452
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,670
Alright, I'm off.

453
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,350
Wait for me after class.

454
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,190
Bye.

455
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,390
I'll come to find you.

456
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,980
Wait up, Jing Xichi!

457
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,829
I said

458
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,619
wait up.

459
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,590
Chen Huan'er!

460
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,830
That's all for today's lesson.

461
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,110
Class dismissed.

462
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,480
(I conducted precise calculations.)

463
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,290
(As soon as the bell rings,
I sprint outside,)

464
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,460
(following the planned route,)

465
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,700
(down three floors, across campus
to the art building,)

466
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,420
(up two floors to reach
Qi Qi's classroom.)

467
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,860
(Say five sentences, then rush back.)

468
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,980
(This way, I won't be late.)

469
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,699
(Two conditions)

470
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,419
(must be met in order for us
to meet up.)

471
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,680
(Qi Qi and I must strictly control
our speaking speed)

472
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,860
(and sentence length.)

473
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,419
(And there can be no bathroom breaks,)

474
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,020
(getting water, discussing problems,)

475
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,260
(or any other distractions.)

476
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,390
Huan'er!

477
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,540
Qi Qi!

478
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,260
Slow down.

479
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,509
How's it going?

480
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,619
Are you getting used
to the art class?

481
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,179
I'm fine. How about you?

482
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,219
How have you been?

483
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,789
Tired?

484
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,190
I'm alright. Same as before.

485
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,070
So soon?

486
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,939
I'll come to find you
after school, okay?

487
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,220
Hurry back to class.

488
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,070
Go on...

489
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,829
(Actually, deep down, I know)

490
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,390
(these brief meetings
are more symbolic than practical.)

491
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,749
(Class meetings, quizzes...)

492
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,549
(There will always be
more important things)

493
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,430
(than a fleeting conversation.)

494
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,190
(But I still want to prove)

495
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,780
(that we haven't drifted apart.)

496
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,940
So tired...

497
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,939
Everyone, quiet down.

498
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,500
Mr. Xu is in a meeting.

499
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,830
Class will start later.

500
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,749
While we wait,

501
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,349
I have

502
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,699
an announcement.

503
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,070
There will be a talent show
this semester.

504
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,070
Every class must prepare a performance.

505
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,589
Who wants to sign up?

506
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,029
- Not me.
- Not me.

507
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,590
Who has the time for this?

508
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,220
I know everyone is busy with school.

509
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,979
How about we keep it simple?

510
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,269
Let's do a poetry recital.

511
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,789
Another poetry recital?

512
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,940
How boring.

513
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,309
Xinyan!

514
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,300
Xinyan!

515
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,110
I think a poetry recital is fine.

516
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,340
Song Cong will do it.

517
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,150
Not me.

518
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,179
Why not?

519
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,069
Why would I do it?

520
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,109
You're perfect for it.

521
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,309
No, I'm not.

522
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,379
How about letting Jing Xichi
do some freestyle football tricks?

523
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,110
At least it won't be as boring.

524
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,979
Good idea...

525
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,749
I'm not doing it.

526
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,219
Please.

527
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,789
No.

528
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,269
Just him doing tricks alone

529
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,500
is pretty dull.

530
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,670
Right? It's boring. I'm out.

531
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,789
How about we get

532
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,459
some of the girls from the aerobics team

533
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,749
to be cheerleaders?

534
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,500
That way, it becomes a full act.

535
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,749
Why don't you do it?

536
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,419
You're good at organizing.

537
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,549
Back when we asked everyone

538
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,659
to join the sports day,,

539
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,789
weren't you the one saying

540
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,500
we need team spirit?

541
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,029
I think this works.

542
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,960
If there's no other idea,
let's go with this.

543
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,260
Sounds good...

544
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,020
Xinyan!

545
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,350
I'll join.

546
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,390
But

547
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,870
only if Song Cong joins.

548
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,139
I don't even play soccer.

549
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,219
You don't need to.

550
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,179
Then what do I do?

551
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,220
Be a cheerleader.

552
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,130
You're pretty strong for a cheerleader.

553
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,700
Don't drag me into this embarrassment.

554
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,070
Everyone, did you hear that?

555
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,869
How is participating in a group activity

556
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,940
embarrassing?

557
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,139
Your mindset is wrong.

558
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,390
What's wrong with it?

559
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,899
Think about it.

560
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,040
Why do people say you're
out of touch with reality?

561
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,140
Why did you transfer to our class
in the first place?

562
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,080
Wasn't it because

563
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,800
you wanted to join
more group activities,

564
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,160
to experience a more interesting
high school life?

565
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,309
Am I right?

566
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,659
Yes.

567
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,029
Right? So should he join or not?

568
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,500
- Yes, he should.
- Yes, he should.

569
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,509
Just go for it.

570
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,540
Go, go, go.

571
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,430
Think about it.

572
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,029
Song Cong,

573
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,979
trust me.

574
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,219
Your purpose in this class

575
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,150
is to participate in group activities.

576
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,460
Think about it.

577
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,390
Alright.

578
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,460
I'll do it with you.

579
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,390
You promise?

580
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,219
You promise?

581
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,200
- You're in?
- Yes...

582
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,940
Sign us both up.

583
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,800
We'll do it together.

584
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,939
Can the girls from our
aerobics team join?

585
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,699
Yiyi, Xiaoyu, go for it.

586
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Are you in?

587
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,070
Aerobics?

588
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,139
I've never done it before.

589
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,179
You know martial arts,

590
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,300
why not aerobics?

591
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,659
Besides, Song Cong is going.

592
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,549
If you don't go,

593
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,460
you're not our friend.

594
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,939
Fine.

595
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,899
I'll give it a try.

596
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,630
Good.

597
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,619
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

598
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,309
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

599
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,899
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

600
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,459
Four, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

601
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,390
One, two, three, four, five, six.

602
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,029
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

603
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,619
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

604
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,219
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

605
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,220
Four, two, three, four.

606
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,150
Stop.

607
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,500
Huan'er.

608
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,940
What you're doing seems off.

609
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,740
Why don't we try extending your fists

610
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,390
and give it another go?

611
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,460
Sorry,

612
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,110
I'm just used to it.

613
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,700
Xinyan.

614
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,540
I think maybe

615
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,939
we should just drop these two.

616
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,670
They're really struggling
with the dance.

617
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,179
Yeah, I agree.

618
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,659
I can help
with miscellaneous tasks,

619
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,910
cheer everyone on or something.

620
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,350
That works too.

621
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,590
Alright, let's rearrange the positions.

622
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,740
Let's go again.

623
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,300
Why are you two still standing there?

624
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,020
Do you think you danced well?

625
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,390
Get off.

626
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,869
You don't have

627
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,139
the talent to be a cheerleader.

628
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,349
Five, six, seven, eight.

629
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,069
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

630
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,659
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

631
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,939
This looks much better.

632
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,349
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

633
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,069
Four, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

634
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,869
Qi Qi.

635
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,590
What are you doing here?

636
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Come on over.

637
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,260
Come on.

638
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,939
Are you guys rehearsing
for the talent show?

639
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,260
Yeah, have a seat.

640
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,300
Aerobics?

641
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,870
Aerobics with freestyle football.

642
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,349
By the way,

643
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,139
what's your class performing?

644
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,350
Are you participating?

645
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,379
Jazz dance.

646
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,830
Wow, that's impressive.

647
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,459
Xinyan,

648
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,100
this is exhausting. Can we take a break?

649
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,390
Alright, let's take a break.

650
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,190
Xinyan, are you thirsty?

651
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,670
Have a drink.

652
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,309
Here.

653
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:19,829
Thanks.

654
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,619
Huan'er,

655
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,349
can you send

656
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,179
my English quiz papers to the teacher?

657
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,040
I forgot to hand them in
when I left earlier.

658
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,870
Right now?

659
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,460
The teacher needs them urgently, hurry.

660
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,110
Quickly.

661
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,269
Qi Qi, I have to...

662
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,160
Why does she boss you around like that?

663
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,069
She...

664
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,540
She's not bossing me around.

665
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,749
I volunteered to do it.

666
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,589
I can't really help with rehearsals,

667
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,869
but I can at least run errands.

668
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,869
But she's making you help

669
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,219
with her personal stuff,

670
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,630
not for the talent show.

671
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,979
Why can't you just say no?

672
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,219
Xinyan has a lot on her plate.

673
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,349
Now that all the artsy students
have left,

674
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,619
she has to handle everything.

675
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,110
She's under a lot of pressure.

676
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,540
Forget it.

677
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,549
If you want to be a pushover,

678
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,700
I can't help you.

679
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,869
That's not it. Xinyan
is actually really nice.

680
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,029
She's helped me a lot.

681
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,240
I just want to return the favor.
It's not a big deal.

682
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,109
I want to go eat

683
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,029
that taro pastry

684
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,979
we had before.

685
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,699
Are you coming?

686
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Now?

687
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,699
Alright.

688
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,630
Let me drop this off first.

689
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,659
Forget it.

690
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,220
Just go do your errand. I'm leaving.

691
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,350
Qi Qi...

692
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,110
Xinyan, I'm going now.

693
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,070
Hurry up.

694
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,899
Why are you suddenly

695
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,590
transferring to the art class?

696
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,390
I think I'm more suited for it.

697
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,979
Goodbye.

698
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,179
I'll come back to visit.

699
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,789
Bye.

700
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,670
- Bye.
- Bye.

701
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,869
She says she's more suited for it,

702
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,540
but the truth is she couldn't keep up.

703
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,170
I saw her crying the other day.

704
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,910
Really?

705
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,420
She said if she kept going like this,

706
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,620
her future would be ruined.

707
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,940
It would be best to transfer.

708
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,589
There's an empty seat

709
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,659
in the second-to-last row.

710
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,700
You can sit there.

711
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,740
New student?

712
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,540
Hello, new classmate.

713
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,260
How much?

714
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,630
Ten yuan.

715
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,699
Haven't we met before?

716
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,430
No.

717
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,540
Chen Huan'er,

718
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,029
your pick-up line

719
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,300
is way too outdated.

720
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,659
Jing Xichi, are you trying
to start something?

721
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,630
I'm not.

722
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,070
So this is all it takes, huh?

723
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,430
I was overthinking it.

724
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,830
Xinyan.

725
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,379
Didn't you

726
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,110
explain this question to me
the other day?

727
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,069
You must be mistaken.

728
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,590
I didn't get the concept
when the teacher explained it earlier.

729
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,069
Didn't get it,

730
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,440
but still became class monitor?

731
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,940
(It felt weird.)

732
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,780
(It seemed like)

733
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,910
(everyone had started lying
unconsciously.)

734
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,300
(But back then, I had no clue
what Xinyan was thinking.)

735
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,419
(My mind was only filled with)

736
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,150
(my taro pastry date with Qi Qi.)

737
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,670
(Qi Qi,)

738
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,749
(let's go have)

739
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,500
(taro pastries after school today,)

740
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,670
(to make up for yesterday.)

741
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,390
(We'll see.)

742
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,940
(The teacher might extend the class.)

743
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,300
(It's fine.)

744
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,430
(I'll wait for you.)

745
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,870
(To me,)

746
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,460
(as long as Qi Qi said it was fine,)

747
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,500
(everything was fine.)

748
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,979
(I was complete unaware)

749
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,980
(of the subtext behind her words.)

750
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,109
Here you go.

751
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,900
Thanks, Ma'am.

752
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,300
No cilantro in mine, please.

753
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:19,980
Got it.

754
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,940
Do you want chili?

755
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,910
Yes.

756
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,220
Thank you.

757
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,830
Hey.

758
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,780
Have you seen Qi Qi?

759
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,110
I saw her walking that way after school.

760
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,700
That way?

761
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,789
Thanks.

762
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,500
No problem.

763
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,700
Isn't tutoring at six?

764
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,200
Why isn't Chen Huan'er here yet?

765
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,379
She said

766
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,020
she made plans to eat with Qi Qi.

767
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,190
Maybe they have something to talk about.

768
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,460
I'll call her and ask.

769
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,979
Sorry,

770
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,300
the number you dialed is powered off.

771
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,789
Please try again later.

772
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,630
Her phone's off.

773
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,670
Her phone's off?

774
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,150
Call Qi Qi.

775
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,539
Sorry,

776
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,499
the number you dialed is powered off.

777
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,229
Hers is off too.

778
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,470
Please try again later.

779
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,709
A few days ago, my mom warned me

780
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,070
that the area near our school

781
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,340
has been a bit unsafe lately.

782
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,550
Could something have happened to them?

783
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,990
Chen Huan'er!

784
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,740
What are you two doing here?

785
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,669
What do you mean?

786
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,499
You tell me!

787
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,580
We've been looking for you.

788
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,100
You didn't answer our calls.
What were you doing with your phone?

789
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,720
My battery died.

790
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,000
Then what are you doing here?

791
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,939
I was waiting for Qi Qi,
but she never showed up.

792
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,099
So I wandered around,

793
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,470
and ended up here.

794
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,869
Alright, enough talking.

795
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,789
Let's go home first.

796
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,190
Your mom's going to be mad again.

797
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,349
Does my mom know?

798
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,149
Not yet.

799
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,260
But I'm about to tell her.

800
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,340
Don't you dare!

801
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,660
- Don't tell her.
- I'll tell her.

802
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,430
- Please, I'm begging you.
- I'm telling her.

803
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,010
Slow down.

804
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,459
Slow down.

805
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,630
Okay, I'm sorry.

806
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,760
We've been looking for you all night.

807
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,590
I'm so thirsty.

808
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,309
So stingy.

809
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,820
You only bought one can. What about me?

810
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,970
Here, Song Cong, pass the ball.

811
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,630
I want to try the "Hand of God."

812
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,150
What's the "Hand of God"?

813
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,470
You don't know?

814
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,499
In the 1986 Mexico World Cup

815
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,899
quarterfinals,

816
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,379
Argentina vs. England,

817
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,869
Maradona jumped into the air

818
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,539
and scored a goal with his hand.

819
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,829
Just like that,
Maradona used the "Hand of God"

820
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,380
to save Argentina.

821
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,820
Still don't get it?

822
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,780
Let me show you.

823
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,260
Come on, Song Cong, pass the ball.

824
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,340
Where were you throwing?

825
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,550
Hey, buddy.

826
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,820
From Tianhe No. 1?

827
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,510
Don't move.

828
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,340
Lend us some money.

829
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,269
I don't have any money.

830
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,110
Check your pockets.

831
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,670
Take it out.

832
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,780
Do you have any?

833
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,829
I have no money.

834
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,860
She doesn't have money.

835
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,420
Let me see.

836
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,820
Run!

837
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,190
Get up.

838
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,220
I think we lost them.

839
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,590
Did you twist your ankle?

840
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,030
I'm fine.

841
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,490
Good thing we practiced
for the sports day.

842
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,030
Otherwise, we'd have been caught.

843
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,630
Should we call the police?

844
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,540
They know we're from Tianhe No. 1.

845
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,580
Will they come after us?

846
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,300
No, they won't.

847
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,869
We should just go home

848
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,099
and tell our parents.

849
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,630
We can't tell my mom.

850
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,990
How about this?

851
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,939
Tomorrow,

852
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,260
I'll talk to the teacher.

853
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,149
You two wait here.

854
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,740
I'll go buy some medicine for Huan'er.

855
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,669
It's okay, Song Cong.

856
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,380
I'll be fine by tomorrow.

857
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,900
Chen Huan'er,

858
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,059
did you have to

859
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,940
grab me so tightly?

860
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,930
Look at this mark.

861
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,789
What if I let go

862
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,070
of your hand and lost you?

863
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,939
I mean,

864
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,059
what if you ran back

865
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,899
to fight them?

866
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,300
I wouldn't be able to save you.

867
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,899
Come on.

868
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,669
Honestly,

869
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,579
I might have been able

870
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,539
to take on those three.

871
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,189
I was just about

872
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,149
to strike back.

873
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,269
Yeah, right.

874
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,260
You were almost put in a chokehold.

875
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,099
I'm a sportsman, you know.

876
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,420
My dad is a martial arts coach.

877
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,379
Anyway,

878
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,440
next time there's trouble,

879
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,420
save Song Cong first.

880
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,420
I don't need your help.

881
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,740
But

882
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,900
I have to admit,

883
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,630
you were actually

884
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,950
pretty impressive just now.

885
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,990
Call me "big sis."

886
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,829
I just saved your life.

887
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,030
Call me "big sis."

888
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,470
Big sis.

889
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,550
Big sis.

890
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,550
Big sis.

891
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,220
Your foot is healed?

892
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,579
Ouch, ouch.

893
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,700
Come.

894
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,740
Massage it for me.

895
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,740
Do it.

896
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,899
It hurts.

897
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,789
It really hurts.

898
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,869
So painful.

899
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,820
So painful.

900
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,749
Is it that bad?

901
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,459
It hurts.

902
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,579
It really hurts.

903
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,059
It's really twisted.

904
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,579
Let me see.

905
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,510
Really...

906
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,780
I...

907
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,410
I'm going to hit you!

908
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,630
That hurts, cut it out.

909
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,099
Mom,

910
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,590
I'm off to bed.

911
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,110
(Actually, I don't even know)

912
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,420
(why I)

913
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,220
(suddenly reached out
and grabbed Jing Xichi.)

914
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,630
(In that moment,)

915
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,510
(I suddenly understood Xinyan.)

916
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,900
(Sometimes, lying)

917
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,900
(is just a way for our cowardly selves)

918
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,740
(to feel bold,)

919
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,860
(even if we're not)

920
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,900
(very good at it.)

921
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,420
(I can't go.)

922
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,420
(I have to stay and practice
with my classmates.)
