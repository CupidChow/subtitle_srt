00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:20,930


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,360
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,600
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,210
   

16
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,280
   
   

17
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,890
 I dreamed of these woods. 

18
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,230
 In my dreams, I ask these trees over and over again if they've seen my dad. 

19
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,860
 But none of them answered me. 

20
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,620
 I wish the trees could talk... 

21
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,150
 Because they are the ones who saw you for the last time. 

22
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:20,520
 Now, I realize that perhaps the rustling of every leaf as the wind blows 

23
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,730
 is a goodbye you didn't get to say. 

24
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,990
 They will come together as the gentlest force to keep me from being afraid of the road ahead, 

25
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:33,960
 from dwelling on the past. 

26
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,020
   r

27
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,640
 Yangwu is a secondhand book trading website. 

28
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,990
This concept was born out of a book exchange event I did in high school.

29
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:35,160
That long-ago event proved the simplicity and sincerity of human feelings.

30
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,940
But when we enter society,

31
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,810
in this multi-dimensional world of convenient transport and communication,

32
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,300
we find that the distance between people is getting further and further away.

33
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,150
I've always believed that people are not isolated islands.

34
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,230
We spend our lives searching for a family to snuggle with, to warm up to,

35
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,590
as well as companions to reflect our souls.

36
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,620
They are the stars of the night sky,

37
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,420
 the lighthouse of the sea, and the everlasting sun. 

38
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:06,810
 They are the proof that we are alive, and the meaning of our existence. 

39
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,640
 It's when we start to burn for each other that the world becomes so bright and colorful. 

40
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,838
Therefore, a book is not just a book. 
    

41
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:20,260
It's the means of communication between people.

42
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,050
It is a shelter for the lonely,

43
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,260
a haven for the wandering, a home where warm lights are always on,

44
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,688
and the door is open for the return of the wanderer.

45
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,820
Fu Ying, I don't need this anymore. Keep it.

46
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,710
You...

47
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,111
How is it? Did you get the results from the meeting?

48
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,720
What are you doing?

49
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,260
I'm moving to the 10th floor.

50
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,960
To the 10th floor?

51
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,180
So our plan is approved?

52
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,577
To be precise, she'll go to the 10th floor, and I'll go to the ground floor.

53
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:17,130
What are you doing on the ground floor?

54
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,500
Take a cab and go home.

55
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,420
The plan didn't get approved.

56
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,659
You don't have to blame yourself.

57
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,840
It's not our fault that the plan didn't get approved.

58
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,500
A long time ago, I wanted to tell you.

59
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,340
No matter how well our plan is done, it will still be rejected by the company.

60
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,482
Huan Dao is a very mature organization.

61
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:45,610
Every project that is incorporated into the company's territory

62
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,980
and every piece of content that is produced

63
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,500
is closely related to the company's future development.

64
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,511
It's never going to shift at the will of some of us newcomers to the company.

65
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,080
So, they've been making us waste our time from the beginning?

66
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,633
The company already gave us a one percent chance.

67
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,860
It's just that we're all ordinary people.

68
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,788
And miracles don't always happen to ordinary people.

69
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,010
I still don't quite get it.

70
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,060
- And you... 
 - Want to ask me why I got to stay?

71
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,810
And why I got a promotion?

72
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,455
Well, actually, I got an offer letter from headquarters before you got here.

73
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:24,577
I was offered the position of department manager.

74
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,470
So, Fu Ying, you're the spy.

75
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,010
You're such a good actress.

76
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,320
But I don't understand why you've been working hard with us for a month,

77
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,950
doing this for nothing.

78
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,180
I have no idea.

79
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,380
Maybe I was still harboring illusions.

80
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,420
That we're the one percent that can survive.

81
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,080
It's not for nothing.

82
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,130
I was just trying to pull off one last silly romance with my companions.

83
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,840
Fu Ying,

84
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,020
thank you.

85
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,710
What about you?

86
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,960
Do you want to fight again to stay?

87
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,303
Xi Chi, I'm sorry.

88
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:29,600
It's impossible for me to stay.

89
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,080
Why?

90
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,240
 To sum up, in the future, Yangwu will not only be able to trade secondhand books, 

91
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,718
 but will also be able to build a community based on interests 

92
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:42,190
 and meet more like-minded people. 

93
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,820
 After all this time, this is what you've come up with? 

94
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,205
 Huan Dao is not a charity organization. 

95
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:53,574
 According to your plan, we need to invest a lot of time and manpower to manage the website. 

96
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,890
 If the cost-effectiveness of the website is so low, what is the use of keeping it? 

97
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,760
 Young man, having an idea and trying it out is a good thing. 

98
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,120
 How about this? I'm giving you one more chance. 

99
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
 - You can follow the original... 
 - No need. 

100
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:10,716
 What did you say? 

101
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,647
 I said, I don't need it. 

102
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:19,139
 I'm quitting. 

103
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,010
 You're all about money. 

104
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,230
 Doctor? 

105
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,600
 Engineer? Technician? 

106
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,281
 To put it bluntly, you're just a capitalist. 

107
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,600
 You are a wolf in sheep's clothing. 

108
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,960
 Zhou Ye, do you know what you're talking about? 

109
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,150
 Young man, I'd advise you to hold back your temper. 

110
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,500
 Don't think too highly of yourself. 

111
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
 You're just nothing. 

112
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,450
 Calm down. 

113
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,310
 I... 

114
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,450
 Let go! 

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,900
 You... Let me go! 

116
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,310
 I'll beat you to death! 

117
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,600
 Come back here! 

118
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,820
Starting today, I'm the first person to straighten out the workplace.

119
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,293
I'm the man Huan Dao can never have.

120
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:14,760
I stand by you.

121
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,090
Give me the box.

122
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,590
This one?

123
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,670
What do you need this for?

124
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,150
I'm leaving with you.

125
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,782
Actually, the boss doesn't necessarily want you to leave.

126
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,820
It's me who can't stay any longer.

127
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,582
After all, it's just that Huan Dao and I don't share the same philosophy.

128
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,690
Then I wish you both the best of luck in finding your own paths.

129
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,480
Thank you, Fu Ying.

130
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,471
Fu Ying, take good care of yourself.

131
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,620
Pack up.

132
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,640
The following are some of the data produced by our team.

133
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,910
The treated cells were stained, and the percentage of apoptosis

134
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,980
was detected by flow cytometry.

135
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,460
Among them, A and B represent the reference

136
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,190
- of control group and treated group... 
 - Is there anything wrong with these data?

137
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,100
No. I did it all by myself.

138
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,300
Nothing can go wrong.

139
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,835
Look at it carefully.

140
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:22,950
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

141
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,760
- Senior Gao... 
 - What's the matter?

142
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,070
Chen Huan Er, what's wrong?

143
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,170
The data must be the old version.

144
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,700
He must have opened the wrong file.

145
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,160
Even if you opened the wrong one,

146
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,100
can't you tell if your own experimental data is correct or not?

147
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,280
Tell me. How involved were you in this experiment?

148
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,580
I... Well...

149
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,190
Chen Huan Er, tell me.

150
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,580
Professor Qiu, the data was prepared by Tian Chi and I.

151
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,670
Senior Gao Ang...

152
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,580
usually just gives guidance.

153
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,460
You can't even understand the basics, so how can you mentor your juniors?

154
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,100
Get down. Chen Huan Er, present it.

155
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,590
Yes.

156
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,115
I'm sorry. Let me correct our experimental data for you.

157
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,950
You have no idea how embarrassing it was today.

158
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,800
So many people were in the hall.

159
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,500
Anyway, Gao Ang got what he deserved.

160
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,010
 That's good. I don't need to teach him a lesson for you. 

161
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,580
Don't bother doing that for me.

162
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,000
I can still handle it.

163
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,790
I'm going to have a feast today. I'm going to treat myself.

164
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,248
 Can you add a pair of chopsticks? 

165
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,560
Add a pair of chopsticks?

166
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,760
What do you mean?

167
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,493
 Look to the right. 

168
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,590
Piggy Jing!

169
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,740
Why are you here?

170
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,150
Zhou Ye and I left Huan Dao together.

171
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,500
From now on, we don't have to be separated anymore.

172
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,390
What do you mean?

173
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,440
That means I'm now unemployed.

174
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,430
I'll have to rely on you to support me from now on.

175
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,345
Okay. Then you have to be good to me from now on.

176
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,690
No problem.

177
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,800
Right, where are you staying tonight?

178
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,969
I'm still renting the same apartment as before.

179
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:43,850
The owner never got around to renting it out, so I got it.

180
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,360
Okay.

181
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,548
Wait here for me a while.

182
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:50,220
Where are you going?

183
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,566
I'll pack.

184
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,270
What are you packing for?

185
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,740
Why? Don't you want to live with me?

186
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,499
Go now.

187
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:00,770
- I'll wait for you here. 
 - Wait for me.

188
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,070
Okay.

189
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,730
Wait for me.

190
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,190
We're back.

191
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,130
We're back indeed.

192
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,330
- It's pretty clean this time. 
 - Of course.

193
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,515
Your little sheep slippers.

194
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,220
Let me unpack your things.

195
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,490
I can do it myself.

196
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,120
Listen. During the day, I'll go to school, and you and Zhou Ye will work here.

197
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,648
I need to get Zhou Ye a punch card machine.

198
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:38,500
He likes slacking off.

199
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,310
He's very motivated now.

200
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,880
He's determined to humiliate Huan Dao.

201
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,960
Really?

202
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,720
- Give it to me. 
 - You even bring this?

203
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,820
Don't look at it.

204
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,170
You let me set it up in the dormitory, so I brought it all back.

205
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,150
All right. Get me a glass of water.

206
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,070
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

207
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,700
 Why is the power out? 

208
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,640
Don't be afraid. We have candles.

209
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,700
 I'll look for the candles and light them. 

210
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,300
 Coming. The candles are lit. 

211
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm coming in.

212
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,990
Come... Come in.

213
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,900
Well, I'll leave the candle here. I'm going out now.

214
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,190
You...

215
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,820
Can you stay for a bit?

216
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,950
I'm scared.

217
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,530
Okay.

218
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,840
 Jing Xi Chi. 

219
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,790
Jing Xi Chi.

220
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,550
Yes?

221
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,190
Nothing.

222
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,300
I just want to say your name.

223
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,190
Jing Xi Chi.

224
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,950
Isn't "Xi" a polyphonic character?

225
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,990
It can also be pronounced as "Qi."

226
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,970
Qi Chi.

227
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,190
I'm poor and drifting, and I've got to drink to drown my sorrows.

228
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,670
Doesn't "Qi Chi" mean adrift?

229
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,190
In addition to what you said, there's actually another saying.

230
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,837
Under Heng Gate, you can have fun and rest.

231
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,460
Have you ever heard of it?

232
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,160
No.

233
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,190
It's from the Classic of Poetry.

234
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,190
It means that as long as your heart is calm,

235
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:16,110
no matter how bad the situation is, you can use it as a shelter from the wind and rain.

236
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,300
I see.

237
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,910
Why does everyone call you Xi Chi instead of Qi Chi?

238
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,760
When people see the word "Qi Chi," they think of adrift.

239
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,260
My mom thought it was bad luck, so she said she'd call me Xi Chi instead.

240
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,780
I got it.

241
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:44,920
Aunt Lin wants you to be able to find a home wherever you go, right?

242
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,840
So...

243
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,937
Have you found it now?

244
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,740
Jing Xi Chi.

245
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,730
We...

246
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,770
we've taken such a long detour,

247
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,100
But we made it back.

248
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,220
They haven't arrived yet, have they?

249
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,720
It's been a while.

250
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,180
Go over there and take a look.

251
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,493
Year of the Monkey.

252
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:10,990
- We have the same one. 
 - It hasn't changed much since we were here.

253
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,010
- Huan Er. 
 - Huan Er, Jing Xi Chi.

254
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,190
Fei Fan.

255
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,560
- Fei Fan. 
 - Fei Fan.

256
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,760
- Bei. 
 - Bei, hello.

257
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,482
It's been a long time.

258
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:22,040
- Why do you two... 
 - You two...

259
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,498
We've been together for a long time.

260
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:25,930
- Not that long. 
 - More than two years.

261
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,220
That's quite long.

262
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,634
When can we attend your wedding reception?

263
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:31,220
Yes.

264
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,740
Soon.

265
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,893
Okay.

266
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:35,590
- I've missed you so much. 
 - Me too.

267
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,430
It's been a long time.

268
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,326
Let's get together with our old classmates sometime.

269
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,240
- We've got to go. 
 - Okay.

270
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,980
- Keep in touch in the group chat. 
 - Keep in touch.

271
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,382
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

272
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:46,980
- What a coincidence. 
 - Yeah.

273
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,215
We ran into our classmates.

274
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:50,330
- They haven't changed much. 
 - Top Student.

275
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,910
What a coincidence.

276
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,020
We're here.

277
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,493
- Huan Er. 
 - We've got to go now. Bye.

278
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,820
- Okay. Bye. 
 - See you next time.

279
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,020
Bye.

280
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,220
What a coincidence.

281
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,360
Xin Yan. You're all dressed so beautifully.

282
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,274
It's been a long time.

283
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:05,182
Wait, not really. We can see you every day.

284
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:07,128
Jing Xi Chi shows affection on social media every day.

285
00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:09,910
Xin Yan, where do you work in that outfit?

286
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,760
I've passed the civil service exam this year.

287
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,010
They sent me to the countryside for training.

288
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,115
I got back from the county office, and had no time to get changed.

289
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,430
Xin Yan has a stable job from now on, okay?

290
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,360
Come in. We're all inside.

291
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,630
- Come on, let's go sit down. 
 - Let's go.

292
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,782
Sorry I'm late.

293
00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:28,540
- I was delayed by something. 
 - It's all right.

294
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,700
What is it?

295
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,820
Why don't you tell me?

296
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:33,500
It's been a long time.

297
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,600
- It's been a long time. 
 - It's been a long time, Tian.

298
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,860
What would you like to drink? I'll order.

299
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,930
Let me do it.

300
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,480
- Let me order. 
 - No, let me do it.

301
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,880
- I'd like to have some tea. 
 - Cong, we'd like to have hot drinks.

302
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,039
Okay.

303
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,740
- I thought you didn't like hot drinks. 
 - You want a hot drink, right?

304
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,960
You two are so sweet.

305
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,870
How is it?

306
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,160
- Just like that. 
 - We're good together.

307
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,960
So sweet. Nice.

308
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,200
Don't you watch my social media every day?

309
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,748
Didn't you say you wanted to collect all the zodiac signs?

310
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:01,360
I didn't know better when I was a kid.

311
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
- Here you go. 
 - My heart's locked up now.

312
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,860
No time for love, and even no time to eat.

313
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,870
You're a really busy, independent woman.

314
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,110
Let me do it.

315
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,430
Li Tian, what are you wearing?

316
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,950
Are you married?

317
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,861
This? I'm engaged.

318
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,150
When did you get engaged?

319
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,780
Why didn't you tell us?

320
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,690
Who said back then that wise men don't fall in love?

321
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,110
Have you gotten your relationship figured out yet? You're engaged?

322
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,740
Wait, isn’t the wedding ring supposed to go on a different finger?

323
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,220
It's an engagement.

324
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,300
With my dad's status, he didn't want to announce it, so I didn't tell you.

325
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,915
I'll give you invitations to the wedding, so you have to come.

326
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:37,739
Who's the bride? Someone from your hospital?

327
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,221
Yes, who is it?

328
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:40,290
Secret.

329
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,300
 Secret? 

330
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,200
To protect her. It's like hiding a beauty in his place.

331
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,673
What about you two?

332
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,360
- We're both doing internships. 
 - Doing internships.

333
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,943
You two are in the same hospital, and there's no chemistry between the two of you?

334
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,430
Yeah.

335
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,190
We are comrades in arms.

336
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,300
Colleagues.

337
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,780
Neighbors.

338
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,160
Okay.

339
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,242
Sorry I'm late.

340
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:03,720
Qi Qi.

341
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,337
You didn't reply to my messages. I thought you weren't coming.

342
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:07,560
It's a class reunion, isn't it?

343
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,220
I'll come. I just wanted to surprise you.

344
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,537
This is Du Man.

345
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,150
- Hi. I'm Du Man. 
 - Qi Qi.

346
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,130
- Hi, I'm Qi Qi. 
 - The one who switched classes.

347
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,605
- Yes, we met in school before. 
 - I know.

348
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:18,537
- Du Man was my desk mate. 
 - Yes. Du Man.

349
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,950
How are you doing abroad?

350
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,050
Not bad.

351
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,540
Are you still writing now?

352
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,490
I'm publishing my first book next year.

353
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,540
We'll definitely support you. I'll ask my juniors to get one.

354
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,700
- Okay. 
 - We'll give you a boost in sales.

355
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,740
Don't spend the money.

356
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,500
I'll give you as much as you want.

357
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,560
Generous. You're Princess Qi Qi indeed.

358
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,080
I'll give a copy to everyone in my office.

359
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,780
- Okay. 
 - You go ahead and chat.

360
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,740
Well, do you have a boyfriend now?

361
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,060
Yes.

362
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,450
Why didn't you tell me?

363
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,360
Didn't I come back here to tell you?

364
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,670
Congratulations.

365
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,350
Thank you.

366
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,780
Where did you meet your boyfriend?

367
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,670
I met him at an art exhibition abroad.

368
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,570
He's a music student. Then...

369
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,050
- What? You're envious again? 
 - I want to fall in love too.

370
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,350
I want to fall in love.

371
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,590
Go ahead.

372
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,840
Come on.

373
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,280
Look. Are these our books from the Book Exchange Event?

374
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
They look familiar.

375
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,258
"The Fountainhead"?

376
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:16,250
   

377
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,700
It really is.

378
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,690
Look.

379
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,007
It really is.

380
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:27,180
At that time, after I broke up with Song Cong, I donated this book through Yangwu.

381
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:35,360
Song Cong, I remember you said the other night that you wrote this line for a friend.

382
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,900
Now, can you tell me who this friend is?

383
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,600
- Sure. 
 - Who?

384
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,590
He's sitting here.

385
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,910
He's sitting here?

386
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,300
Seriously?

387
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,350
I wrote it.

388
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,780
You wrote it?

389
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Did you really?

390
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,660
- I didn't write it. I let him write it for me. 
 - Yes, I wrote it for him.

391
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,700
Then whose "Catcher in the Rye" do I have?

392
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,150
- You're the one who took it? 
 - This is Song Cong's.

393
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,460
This is Song Cong's?

394
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,700
Yes. So, at that time, I thought you liked Song Cong.

395
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,006
- Who liked him? 
 - How come I didn't know anything?

396
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:11,201
That's why I was so annoyed with you.

397
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,931
I wasn't looking for him because...

398
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:15,760
You're arguing?

399
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,160
That means she stole your book.

400
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,140
- And he said I had no class. 
 - Well, you kind of didn’t.

401
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,150
Do you want to look for your own book, Bro?

402
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,000
- What's wrong with mine? I— 
 - Who did he give that book to?

403
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,847
He gave... He gave it to Huan Er.

404
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:31,160
Yes. I was so pissed off.

405
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,348
It's because of your spell that I'm still studying.

406
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,104
You could not have studied so well

407
00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:38,490
without my College Entrance Examination Mock Tests.

408
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,590
Knowledge brings wealth,

409
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,830
and they bring beauty too.

410
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,770
I got him.

411
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,850
Gosh.

412
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,590
I can't stand it.

413
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,220
And we even had a falling out.

414
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,020
That's because of Du Man.

415
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,460
What's it got to do with me?

416
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,820
You don't know, do you?

417
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,350
It's been so long.

418
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,440
And we were kids. We didn't know that much.

419
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,870
Do you remember when we went boating?

420
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,580
We shared a boat. You had your own boat then.

421
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,540
Jing Xi Chi. It's all your fault, Jing Xi Chi.

422
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,970
It was very cold that day.

423
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,500
- You wanted to race. 
 - It was cold that day.

424
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,193
He even ran into her in the water.

425
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:13,050
Yeah, he chased me and ran into me. I fell into the water.

426
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,190
Do you remember the sports day?

427
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,780
- That day, you ran... 
 - 1,500 meters.

428
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,580
I felt my heart pounding, and then I fainted.

429
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,180
I was going around the whole class,

430
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,040
and begging everyone to help me run,

431
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,921
but no one participated

432
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:31,220
- at that time... 
 - It was just me.

433
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,550
Only me.

434
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,350
- Then, I asked you to go. 
 - And even Class 6 next door got involved.

435
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,350
- Yes. Class 6. 
 - We fought with them.

436
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,540
You even brought those tiny hand fans.

437
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,390
How can you remember so much?

438
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,010
I remember it very well.

439
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,910
On the sports day.

440
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,250
I was so touched.

441
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,404
At that moment, I had just come back from a run,

442
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:59,170
and then I saw you guys standing up for me, and I knew these were my sisters, and besties.

443
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,960
Do you remember the blackout when we were about to graduate?

444
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,830
- Yes, the night of the blackout. 
 - Right?

445
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,000
- And there was Xu. 
 - Mr. Xu.

446
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,980
Xu said something,

447
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,659
and I cried when I got back to my room!

448
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,690
- Did you go back and cry? 
 - Really, Jing Xi Chi?

449
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,760
You cried?

450
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,390
I... I didn't cry.

451
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,104
Wait. I switched classes then.

452
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:23,240
So what did Mr. Xu say that day?

453
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,512
What Xu meant was that actually, there's no standard in life.

454
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:28,980
- Grades don't matter. 
 - Yeah.

455
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,390
There are no standard answers in life.

456
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,770
Yes.

457
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,910
Are you living the life you yearn for?

458
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,405
Yes, we are.

459
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,188
Yes.

460
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,700
Me too.

461
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,190
For me, yes.

462
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,420
I think so.

463
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,020
Yes.

464
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,350
Living in the moment is the best.

465
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,640
Yes.

466
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
It's all good to look ahead.

467
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,740
- As long as you don't regret it. 
 - Yes.

468
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,480
Life is like a blank sheet of paper.

469
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,740
The paper is blank.

470
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,080
Fill it in with whatever colors you want, and it becomes your own painting.

471
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,260
Right?

472
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,980
You're not busy these two days, are you?

473
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,190
In a couple of days, come to my house.

474
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,770
- What's up? 
 - What's up?

475
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,250
You'll know it by then.

476
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,604
What's it? Good or bad?

477
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,670
We won't go to help you move.

478
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,580
   

479
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,260
 Hello, future Li Tian. 

480
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,700
 Have you gone to university in Cambridge by now? 

481
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,790
 If not, don't blame current me too much... 

482
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,710
 because I've done my best. 

483
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,460
Got it.

484
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,100
I have good news and bad news.

485
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,150
Let me start with the bad news first.

486
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:02,850
I didn't go to Cambridge, and I gave up on English Literature.

487
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:10,670
But I don't blame you because the good news is I've fallen in love with the life I have now.

488
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,610
I've realized that

489
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:23,260
life isn't just that one road we imagined as kids. There are many more paths we can walk.

490
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,740
 Hello, future Qi Qi. 

491
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,576
 I'd like to ask you, have you become your mother's pride? 

492
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:38,690
 Have you gained your mother's approval? 

493
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,670
 Whether you have or not, it doesn't matter. 

494
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,010
 You should be in charge of your own life now, right? 

495
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,870
 You... 

496
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:51,278
 Are you happy now? 

497
00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:01,490
I don't know if I have become my mother's pride, but it doesn't matter now.

498
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:08,210
I think she must have approved of me because I can understand her now.

499
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:13,060
Of course, I'm in charge of my own life.

500
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,220
As for me being happy now...

501
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,553
Yes.

502
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:25,910
At least happier than when I was a kid.

503
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,950
 Hello, future Du Man. 

504
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,910
 Are you making new friends now? 

505
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,700
 It's normal if you don't. 

506
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,010
 People are lonely. 

507
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,423
 The world changes all the time. 

508
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,390
 Remember to look ahead. 

509
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:54,910
Speaking of friends, I've found a lot of new friends among my old classmates.

510
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,950
Every day of my internship at the hospital is so busy

511
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,220
that I seem to be able to ignore the loneliness.

512
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,080
That's good, actually.

513
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,300
The world is still changing, and so am I.

514
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,880
That's life, right? Always a bit tired of it, yet always holding on.

515
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,339
Don't forget to try catching a claw machine prize again.

516
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:29,871
Sometimes, there are surprises.

517
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,840
 Hello, future Liao Xin Yan. I want to ask you a question. 

518
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,150
 Are you in love? 

519
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,646
 Are you in love with a handsome man? 

520
00:31:44,646 --> 00:31:48,990
 If he cheats first, will you break up without hesitation? 

521
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,870
 Remember, always be the strongest in love. 

522
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,530
 Don't lose. 

523
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,390
 If it's possible, collect all the signs of the zodiac. 

524
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,980
 That's it. 

525
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,400
Liao Xin Yan, I was in love.

526
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,110
There was a handsome man.

527
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,740
And with every breakup, I'm the one who dumps them.

528
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,110
Don't worry.

529
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,780
I've tried everything I wanted to try.

530
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,250
Now, I can finally focus on my career.

531
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:28,490
Besides, you must not confess to Jing Xi Chi.

532
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,640
It will be really awkward.

533
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,520
 Hello, future Song Cong, you should have accomplished your own goal by now. 

534
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,929
 Don't think too much. 

535
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,670
 You can definitely become what you want to be. 

536
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,750
The more precious something is, the less likely it is to be earned by effort alone.

537
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:10,020
Growing up, to me, meant accepting my own ordinariness.

538
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,460
I'm sorry I let down the wonderful person you were back then.

539
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,830
I've grieved over that.

540
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,940
However...

541
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,150
I'm finally ready to say goodbye to you now.

542
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,190
I'm so lucky to have met you.

543
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,950
Leave the rest of your life to me.

544
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,400
I'll walk the path for you.

545
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,500
 Hello. 

546
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,700
 Hello, future Chen Huan Er. 

547
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:50,360
 I don't know how you're doing in the future or if you've found your dreams and goals. 

548
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,500
 But I haven't yet. 

549
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:03,110
 In fact, I'm quite anxious to see that everyone has their own goals and dreams. Episod

550
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,700
 Do you think life is meaningless 

551
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:15,380
 if you don't find your dream or what you want to do in life? 

552
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,930
 That's it. 

553
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,540
 Bye. 

554
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,240
Hello, little Huan Er.

555
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:36,020
I know you're probably panicking about not being able

556
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,100
to find your goal and meaning in life.

557
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,230
But Jing Xi Chi was right.

558
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,230
Take life one step at a time.

559
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,140
Life is not a test.

560
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,310
There are no standard answers.

561
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,140
Everyone will answer differently.

562
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:58,540
I have my dad and mom around me.

563
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,600
The people I love, and the people who love me are all here.

564
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,340
I'm very happy.

565
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,310
 Song Cong, 

566
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:29,640
 I remember you used to say that friendships were just temporary. 

567
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,060
 Do you still think so? 

568
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,460
 Maybe some of our friends can only accompany us on a short journey. 

569
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:45,050
 But our lives are complete because of that short period of time. 

570
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,270
 Those who have been 

571
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:56,720
 in our lives will be part of our souls for the rest of our lives. 

572

577
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,950
 Xi Chi, Huan Er, come out now. It's time to make dumplings. 

578
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,430
Let's go. Coming.

579
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,910
Let's go. Let's make dumplings.

580
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,910
 It's no use running. 

581
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,675
 I'll be sure to get you on tape. 

582
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:27,030
 None of you will escape. 

583
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,815
 It's 3 p.m. today, September 17th, 2008. 

584
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,140
 It's a beautiful day. 

585
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,200
 The sun is shining. 

586
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,407
 It's quiet outside the family housing compound again. 

587
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:42,648
 I wonder what everyone is doing. 

588
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,310
 Li Tian must be studying. 

589
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,940
 He's been trying to surpass Cong. 

590
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,093
 I sometimes want to tell him to let himself go, to stop being so hard on himself. 

591
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,950
 And Cong... 

592
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,880
 Cong must be thinking about life. 

593
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,160
 I really don't know 

594
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,830
 what on earth does he have to think about all the time every day? 

595
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,270
 Chen Huan Er is carefree. 

596
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:15,180
 She must be either sleeping or having a good time for no reason. 

597
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,340
 Silly girl. 

598
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:26,610
 If I could, I'd like time to stop right now. 

599
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,810
 People say change is the norm in life. 

600
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,730
 So houses get torn down, friends get separated, 

601
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:45,390
 and even the ones closest to you eventually leave. 

602
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:51,230
 But I always think that even if that day comes, 

603
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:59,150
 the traces of those people and things will follow me, 

604
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:05,610
 and accompany me all the way to a faraway place. 

605
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,950
 Even if I've already forgotten this afternoon many years from now. 

606
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,110
 Anyway, 

607
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,040
 some things will change, 

608
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,490
 and some things... 

609
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:30,395
 will never change.

639
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,640
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

640
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,910
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

641
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:49,900
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

642
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,700
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

643
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,640
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

644
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,330
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

645
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,970
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

646
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,380
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

647
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,560
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

648
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,460
♫  At the right time  ♫
