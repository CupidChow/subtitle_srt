(Run! Speed: 140 miles per hour!)

16
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,080
(No one would believe me.)

17
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,690
(I always say I'm a soccer lover,)

18
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,210
(and I seem fearless.)

19
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,440
(But if it weren't for my dad,)

20
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,920
(I would have given up
when I got injured before the recruitment.)

21
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,570
Coach.

22
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,210
I know you mean well.

23
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,640
However,

24
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,419
I won't let Xichi

25
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,680
play soccer.

26
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,139
Let alone attend a soccer academy.

27
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,569
He's trained

28
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,960
so hard for years.

29
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,640
You should let him see it through.

30
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,640
(He reignited my motivation,)

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,050
(and convinced my mom
to let me continue playing.)

32
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,329
(Of course,)

33
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,360
(only if I don't get hurt again.)

34
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,960
Dad.

35
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,609
You're really getting old.

36
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,840
You couldn't keep up earlier.

37
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,920
I was literally feeding you marks earlier.

38
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,240
Watch your words.

39
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,400
Xichi.

40
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,360
Promise me.

41
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,640
You can play soccer,

42
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,049
but remember,

43
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,520
you promised Mom.

44
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,170
If you get injured again,

45
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,010
you won't be able to play anymore.

46
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,080
Got it.

47
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,520
But dad.

48
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,539
We need

49
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,680
to go home now.

50
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,379
Mom will be back soon.

51
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,859
I'll get going first.

52
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,960
Boy. I'm afraid of getting
caught by your mom too!

53
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:02,840
Dad.

54
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,240
Stay alert.

55
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,139
Mom could be back any time now.

56
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,640
Don't you spill the beans.

57
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,049
What are you doing?

58
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,129
We've been home all day.

59
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,520
How would our house look so clean?

60
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,770
You're sneaky indeed.

61
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,770
Let's watch the match.

62
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,570
It's starting.

63
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,369
What's wrong with you two?

64
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,199
Did you really have to turn the house
upside down just to watch a match?

65
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,400
You're so difficult.

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,600
What's that smell?

67
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,520
Yunnan Baiyao.

68
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,019
Xichi.

69
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,080
Did you play...

70
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,779
Ouch!

71
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,520
I need to spray this later.

72
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,489
Jing.

73
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,459
If you're not feeling well,
just go see Song.

74
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,339
Yes, exactly.

75
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,840
What if you hurt your bones?

76
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,809
Yes.

77
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,459
Okay.

78
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,289
Okay.

79
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,729
I heard you have
sports day coming up.

80
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,489
You better

81
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,890
not register for anything.

82
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,210
But Mom.

83
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,049
Please.

84
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,779
Please, Mom.

85
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,010
Please, I beg you.

86
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,609
My legs are perfectly fine.

87
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,840
That's final.

88
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,929
Mom.

89
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,689
Please let me go.

90
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,289
I'm the class sports representative.

91
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,019
I have to set an example.

92
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,249
Just get your classmates to join.

93
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,099
I will

94
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,579
talk to your teacher.

95
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,520
Mom.

96
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,369
This affects our class performance.

97
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,689
I have to compete.

98
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,810
I'm the best in class at sports.

99
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,770
What about your leg?

100
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,419
It was injured.

101
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,339
It may have healed,

102
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,129
but your knees

103
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,129
are still weak.

104
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,010
Do you understand?

105
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,729
Don't worry, Mom.

106
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,539
I know how to take care of myself.

107
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,219
I can still run.

108
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,459
How can I not worry?

109
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,840
Song said

110
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,169
you need to rest
and avoid strenuous activity.

111
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,400
Did you hear me?

112
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,570
Mom.

113
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,489
Please, I beg you.

114
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,770
Beg?

115
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,979
What a coward.

116
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,160
Mom!

117
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,459
Our class has no other athletes.

118
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,659
If I don't compete,
we have no chance of winning.

119
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,419
Besides, I'm terrible at academics.
I've always dragged the class down.

120
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,289
This is my chance

121
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,979
to contribute.

122
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,520
I don't want to be the laughing stock
of the other classes.

123
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,459
Jing Xichi.

124
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,219
Stop arguing with me.

125
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,019
Save your energy

126
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,249
for studying.

127
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,659
Then you won't be a disappointment.

128
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,600
Gosh.

129
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,659
Go study.

130
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,010
Mom.

131
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,690
Let me compete.

132
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,690
(I'll join.)

133
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,480
Chen Huan'er!

134
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,729
Are you serious?

135
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,609
I'm very weak now.

136
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,890
Don't lie to me.

137
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,450
I'm serious.

138
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,370
You're the best!

139
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,600
I'll join regardless.

140
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,690
Are you hungry?

141
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,930
Here, have some.

142
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,249
I made it myself.
I learned the recipe from Aunt Hao.

143
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,369
You cooked this?

144
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,840
That's right. Open up.

145
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,040
How is it?

146
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,040
Not bad.

147
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,570
Didn't you say you don't like it?

148
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,960
I never said that.

149
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,019
I ate everything

150
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,129
you rejected.

151
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,960
I think the vegetable
dumplings are good.

152
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,770
Listen.

153
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,369
My mom wasn't
thinking straight yesterday.

154
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,960
She won't let me compete.

155
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,040
Thank goodness you agreed.

156
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,289
However,

157
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,890
why'd you change your mind?

158
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,330
That's none of your business.

159
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,979
Don't try to figure out

160
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,160
a girl's thought.

161
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,720
By the way,

162
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,080
please don't tell my mom

163
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,489
that I'm competing.

164
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,689
Don't snitch on me.

165
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,120
Why all the secrecy?

166
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,369
I told you.

167
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,450
Stop guessing my thoughts.

168
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,000
Fine.

169
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,840
I won't say anything.

170
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,099
We need to start

171
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,760
intensive training now.

172
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,930
Okay.

173
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,810
Are you that happy?

174
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,120
Our class has a secret weapon.

175
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,690
Hurry, we're almost there.

176
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,889
I don't want to run anymore.

177
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,409
- I can't keep going.
- You can't stop abruptly after the run.

178
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:06,769
Come on.

179
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,099
Walk slowly.

180
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,360
Let's walk slowly.

181
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,530
Song Cong.

182
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,579
I'm joining the 800m race.

183
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,819
Help me train.

184
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,179
You've competed

185
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,880
since junior middle school.

186
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,570
Are you joining this round too?

187
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,840
Not this time.

188
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,880
I'm the announcer.

189
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,000
Ask Xichi to train you then.

190
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,120
He's a professional.

191
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,579
Never mind then.

192
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,410
Goodbye.

193
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,249
Speed up.

194
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,219
Chen Huan'er.

195
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,249
This is your favorite orange.

196
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,889
- What are you doing?
- You can eat it at the finish line.

197
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,649
Secret weapon? Her?

198
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,979
Don't push her too hard.

199
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,179
She's just like you. You're still an amateur
even if you're the soccer team leader.

200
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,979
And you're no leader.

201
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,290
You're just a ball boy.

202
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,129
Ignore him. Focus on running.

203
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,859
Let it go.

204
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,880
- You can eat this when you finish.
- Put it down!

205
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,080
Come on, Chen Huan'er!

206
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,410
Almost there!

207
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,409
Slow down.

208
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,290
Are you okay?

209
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,450
How is it?

210
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,699
As long as you finish.

211
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,000
Why are you so worked up?

212
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,960
I want to challenge myself.

213
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,859
Regulate your breathing. Come on.

214
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,810
Drink some water.

215
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,570
Drink slowly.

216
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,760
Slowly.

217
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,769
I'm home.

218
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,050
You're back.

219
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,880
Why are you late today?

220
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,489
What happened to your face?

221
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,240
Why is your hair tangled?

222
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,459
I was on duty today.

223
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,050
I was sweating buckets.

224
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,059
Duty?

225
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,409
Tell your teacher

226
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,360
to assign you something
less physically demanding.

227
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,819
Your body can't handle strenuous work.

228
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,160
- You shouldn't be doing manual labor.
- Okay. Don't worry, Mom.

229
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,930
I'm in top condition.

230
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,409
Nonsense.

231
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,099
That's right.

232
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,579
After your Sports Day,

233
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,409
come to my workplace for lunch.

234
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,530
Don't go home for food.

235
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,760
All right, noted.

236
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,080
Gosh.

237
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,330
Get ready.

238
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,699
- Class 6!
- Come on!

239
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,369

- Class 6!
- Come on!

246
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,249
What's wrong, Huan'er?

247
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,480
Do you have a stomachache?

248
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,600
Sort of.

249
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,290
I'll just drink some water.

250
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,170
Gosh, what's wrong with our school?

251
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,489
Why are they holding Sports Day
on such a gloomy day?

252
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,530
It's so chilly.

253
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,369
I don't get it.
What's the point of Sports Day?

254
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,769
I'd rather have a half-day off.

255
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,249
- Class 6!
- Come on!

256
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,769

- Class 6!
- Come on!

258
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,480
Look at them. So arrogant!

259
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,520
Class 6 is always full of
themselves on Sports Day.

260
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Well, their class has
a lot of student athletes.

261
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,720
We have one too.

262
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,649
Our hopes are on Xichi.

263
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,129
I heard his mom won't let him compete.

264
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,410
Really?

265
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,760
If he doesn't compete, we're doomed.

266
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,410
Jing Xichi is joining.

267
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,219
- Jing Xichi!
- Let's go!

268
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,009
- Jing Xichi.
- Come on!

269
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,889

- Come on!

278

Women's 1500m Race will start.

287
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,760
Huan'er. They're taking attendance.

288
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,769
- They're calling for the 1500m race.
- I'm going.

289

It's Huan'er's turn.

290

Yes.

297
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,760
Don't get ahead of yourself just yet.

298
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,889

She has low blood sugar.
It's nothing serious.

331
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,170
I gave her a glucose injection.

332
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,850
Doctor. Does she really not need
to go to the hospital?

333
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,170
No, she'll be fine.

334

But she's quite weak.

335
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,859
If you're really worried, when she's awake,

336
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,920
you can bring her in
for a check-up when she wakes up.

337
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,800
Is Huan'er okay?

338
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,929
She's okay.

339
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,059
The doctor said

340
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,240
she has low blood sugar.

341
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,129
That's right.

342
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,610
She was too nervous this morning
and skipped breakfast.

343
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,240

How are you feeling?

347
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,850
I think...

348
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,000
I just got my period.

349
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,690
Did you forget to bring pads?

350
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,090
It's okay, I'll buy them for you.

351
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,170

354
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,690
Come on, I'll pay for both.

355
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,299
No, it's fine.

356
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,019
It's okay.

357
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,480
It's really fine, just pay for yours.

358
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,450
Give it to me.

359
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,539
You pay first.

You first.

361
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,410
Let's just pay together.

362
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,000
It's really okay.

363
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,850
Just buy yours.

364
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,210
That'll be 27 yuan.

Xichi.

370
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,169
Would this be
considered a work injury?

371
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,209
Is it serious?

372
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,170
I think so.

373
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,960
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

374
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,800
I'm just joking.

375
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,850
- Don't get mad.
- I was really worried about you.

376
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,410
What exactly happened?

377
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,170
It's nothing serious.

378
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,539
By the way,

379
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,649
how did our class do?

380
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,259
Did we win?

381
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,299
I don't know.
I came straight here after my race.

382
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,410
I didn't check the scores.

383
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,360
Are you okay, Huan'er?

384
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,929
The results for the 1500m race are out.
You placed third.

385
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,130
I got third?

386
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,610
Our class is the champion?

387
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,299
You need to accept your prize.

388
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,259
Can you walk?

389
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,299
Of course!

390
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,090
Wait.

391
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,409
What about the IV drip?

392
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,520
Where's the school doctor?

393
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,369
I don't see her around.

394
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,560
No need to find her.

395
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,779
Anyone can remove a needle.

396
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,499
Can you?

397
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,579
Of course.

398
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:58,819
Here.

399
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,339
Okay.

400
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,369
Then remove it for me.

401
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,040
Hurry, I want to watch the match.

402
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,210
Press it.

403
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,320
I'll go first.

404
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,410
My shoes.

405
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,890
Be careful.

406
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,170
- She's going to the toilet.
- Come on.

407
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,850
Let's receive your prize.

408
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,889
Chen Huan'er!

409
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,059
Our Little Pride!

410
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,059
- Chen Huan'er!
- Our Little Pride.

411
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,929
- Chen Huan'er!
- Our Little Pride.

412
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,409
- Chen Huan'er!
- Our Little Pride.

413
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,969
- Chen Huan'er!
- Our Little Pride.

414
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,499
- Chen Huan'er!
- Our Little Pride.

415
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,370
- Chen Huan'er!
- Our Little Pride.

416
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,000
Chen Huan'er!

417
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,280
Don't get too full of yourselves.

418
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,969
You're just lucky.

419
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,904
You still have
to take the Plosives Test.

420
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:59,099
So? What's wrong with that?
We can be as proud as we want.

421
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,320
You didn't win anything.
Why are you acting so smug?

422
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,099
Keep whining,

423
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,610
losers.

424
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,779
Not only did we beat you
in this competition,

425
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,369
but we'll also win the Plosives Test.

426
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,689
What a sore loser!

427
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,339
How undignified.

428
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,889
Sore loser.

429
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,689
Say that again!

430
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,689
Sore loser!

431
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,929
Sore loser!

432
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,280
(Turns out everyone has a hidden side.)

433
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,129
(I never expected
someone as cool as Qi Qi)

434
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,210
to step up and stand against
other classes' provocation.)

435
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,170
(The same classmates
who used to mock my accent)

436
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,800
(now stood united.)

437
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,760
(Making your first decision alone)

438
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,690
(isn't easy.)

439
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,000
(Jing Xichi is right.)

440
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,040
(I can do this.)

441
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,099
(Tianhe No.3 Central Hospital)

442
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,739
Mom told us to wait here.

443
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,000
She will pick us up.

444
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,499
Hey, you.

445
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,130
You're so obedient.

446
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,409
You're going
to the canteen for lunch as instructed?

447
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,210
I was thinking of
getting something fancy.

448
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,410
Whatever.

449
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,130
I want KFC.

450
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,650
You can get it here too.

451
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,450
I gave the chicken stew a nickname, Kentucky.

452
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,960
Stop trying to fool me.

453
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,019
You're here. You must be starving.

454
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,739
Mom.

455
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,649
(Outpatient Building)

456
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,129
Good day.

457
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,520
Look at this.

458
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,210
What happened to your hand?

459
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,169
I'm fine.

460
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,169
I'll have a look.

461
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,240
I'm fine.

462
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,480
Let me see.

463
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,850
Did you get an IV drip?

464
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,800
Why did you need one?

465
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,099
Well, I had low blood sugar.

466
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,610
Did you faint?

467
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,240
I'm fine, Mom, really.

468
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,610
You joined Sports Day, didn't you?

469
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,819
I told you not to.
You need to take care of yourself.

470
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,269
Why won't you listen?

471
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,929
You're lucky nothing happened. What if...

472
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,449
No, Aunt.

473
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,579
She actually...

474
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,889
I'm fine, Mom.

475
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,690
I'm really fine, Mom.

476
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,019
Did the school doctor
give you the IV? It's swollen.

477
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,450
This has nothing to do with her.

478
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,850
Don't go blaming the school.

479
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,019
It has nothing to do with them too.

480
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,779
I just wanted to watch the matches,

481
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,059
so I pulled it out myself.

482
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,280
You clumsy thing.

483
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,890
Aunt.

484
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,169
Actually, Huan'er...

485
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,280
Mom.

486
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,170
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,339
Let's eat first, okay?

488
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,409
I'm hungry.

489
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:39,929
Okay.

490
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,539
I'm so hungry.

491
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,520
Let's go eat.

492
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,779
This is odd.

493
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,040
Jing Xichi.

494
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,690
Did you join the race too?

495
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,890
I knew it.

496
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,609
All kids are the same.

497
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,240
They never listen.

498
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,129
Mom.

499
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,499
Don't be upset.

500
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,689
I'm sorry.

501
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,859
What are we eating today?
I'm craving for...

502
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,689
Don't you think

503
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,610
Aunt Lina was overly sensitive?

504
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,650
That's true.

505
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:16,929
Aunt Lina

506
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,000
is usually easygoing,

507
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,210
but today she seemed really anxious.

508
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,720
Let's eat first.

509
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:31,998
(Okay, this is his chance.)

510
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,900
(Good shot! Bravo!)

511
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,650
You're back, Mom.

512
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,280
I have a question, Mom.

513
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,560
Go ahead.

514
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,760
(Let me introduce him again.)

515
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,520
What is it?

516
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,320
Well.

517
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,859
I'd like to ask you.

518
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,370
In most cases,

519
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,610
how do you remove
a needle without causing swelling?

520
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,960
Aunt Lina told me.

521
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,890
You're so bold.

522
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,850
You're lucky nothing serious happened.

523
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,690
If it had, who would be responsible?

524
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,169
What happened to Huan'er?

525
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,410
Why are you so worked up?

526
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,209
Stop prying.

527
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,609
Just don't let her participate
in any strenuous activities.

528
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,690
Do you hear me?

529
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,850
Is she sick?

530
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,859
It's nothing.

531
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,859
It happened years ago.

532
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,210
It's nothing serious.

533
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,449
Just don't ask about it,

534
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,890
especially in front of Aunt Lina.

535
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,450
Okay.

536
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,280
Give me your hand.

537
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,099
Look.

538
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,090
The blood vein.

539
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,969
To remove a needle properly,

540
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,690
you need to be gentle,

541
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:53,689
quick,

542
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,209
and press firmly.

543
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,539
Gently, quickly, and press firmly.

544
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,449
Pull it out
in the same direction as the vein.

545
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,019
Never move it back and forth,

546
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,739
or you'll hit the vein wall,

547
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,760
which causes swelling.

548
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,800
You look great.

549
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,520
You seem happier
after switching classes.

550
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,930
Well.

551
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,040
Mom.

552
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,209
I didn't tell you

553
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,890
before I requested a class transfer.

554
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,210
I'm sorry.

555
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,370
Now that you've switched classes,
you're trying to sweet-talk me?

556
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,170
That won't work.

557
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,850
I'll be frank with you.

558
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,760
Just because I allowed it
doesn't mean I'm spoiling you.

559
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,520
My bottom line is this,
you must never study medicine.

560
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,059
I know it all too well.

561
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,819
Being a doctor is exhausting.

562
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,560
I don't want you
to end up like your dad.

563
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,560
After eight years of medical school,

564
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,649
there are still

565
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,779
endless courses, tests,

566
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,099
surgeries, and evaluations.

567
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,650
It never stops. You won't even
have time for your own family.

568
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,689
I'm not saying

569
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,409
other jobs are easy,

570
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,929
but at least some careers

571
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,690
are less demanding than being a doctor.

572
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,320
I know, Mom.

573
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,779
Huan'er.

574
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,299
Do you feel any discomfort?

575
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,450
I'm okay.

576
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,410
Come eat.

577
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,689
Mom.

578
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,209
Where's my red and white towel?

579
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,850
It's hanging on the balcony.

580
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,320
Come eat.

581
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,800
Okay.

582
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,000
(You should rest well, Huan'er.)

583
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,480
(You're incredible, Huan'er!)

584
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,130
(Are you all right?)

585
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,579
(We left the school clinic)

586
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,169
(before checking if you were feeling all right.)

587
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,410
(You should take medical leave.)

588
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,410
Chen Huan'er.

589
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,480
What's the matter?

590
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,800
Are you feeling better now?

591
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,960
I'm okay.

592
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,130
I...

593
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,320
My mom was just being overly protective.

594
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,850
Rest early.

595
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,650
Good night.

596
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,689
Come eat, Huan'er.

597
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,800
Coming.

598
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,739
Chen Huan'er.

599
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,610
Why can't she participate in Sports Day?

600
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,410
She was sick when she was little.

601
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,760
She has a weak constitution.

602
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,450
We live in the same compound.

603
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,720
You should look out for her.

604
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,609
Don't tell my mom

605
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,889
I joined Sports Day.

606
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,369
Don't snitch on me.

607
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,850
Why the secrecy?

608
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,969
You had an IV drip?

609
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,080
Did you faint?

610
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,739
I told you not to join Sports Day.
You need to take care of yourself.

611
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,320
Why won't you listen?

612
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:08,960
Come on.

613
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,130
Breakfast.

614
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,280
Thanks.

615
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,560
This candy is for you too.

616
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,280
To prevent low blood sugar.

617
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,090
You mustn't faint again.

618
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,739
She's not a patient.

619
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,210
What are you doing?

620
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,059
That's right.

621
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm perfectly healthy now.

622
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:37,859
Do you hear me?

623
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,520
Stop treating her differently.

624
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,819
By the way. We have a test today.

625
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,969
We need to hurry.

626
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,410
A test? Today?

627
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,689
Mr. Xu mentioned it yesterday.

628
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,019
The school is so cruel,

629
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,370
giving us a test right after Sports Day.

630
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,339
You really didn't

631
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,650
listen to the teacher.

632
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,280
(I was grateful for Jing Xichi.)

633
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,339
(He eased my awkwardness)

634
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,000
(with a joke.)

635
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,760
(Perhaps he's right.)

636
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,819
(I just want to be normal,)

637
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,170
(like everyone else.)

638
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,280
Chen Huan'er.

639
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,280
Coming.

640
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:26,880
Liang.

641
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,690
- What is it?
- Are you watching the match?

642
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,089
Didn't we make a bet

643
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,280
before Sports Day?

644
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,720
Chi.

645
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,369
Stop it.

646
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,050
I wasn't serious about that.

647
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,089
Liang.

648
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,970
Well, listen.

649
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,650
Chi.

650
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,760
Chi.

651
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,369
This is about the Cultural Festival.

652
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,819
There's going to be
a Bookcrossing Event.

653
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,969
Go home

654
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,010
and pick your favorite book.

655
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,529
You can

656
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,049
leave a message for the next student

657
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,170
who gets your book.

658
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,369
After you finish reading,

659
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,320
remember to reply
to the message you receive too.

660
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,200
The class monitor will collect the books
and send them to the Reading Room.

661
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,569
Mr. Xu. Does that mean the class monitor
will know what books we get?

662
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,050
Of course
she will pick her favorite one.

663
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,690
Who do you like?

664
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,920
I mean, she'll pick
the book that she likes.

665
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,010
I'll throw yours in the bin first.

666
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,920
Well, if that's the case,

667
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,089
you can submit your book
directly to the Reading Room.

668
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,320
We won't force you to join the free study
period on Friday afternoons.

669
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,210
You'll have plenty of time to read.

670
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:54,929
Alright.

671
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,489
What nonsense.

672
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,464
By the end of this month,

673
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,815
you need to submit
an 800-word reflection on the book.

674
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,369
All right.

675
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,560
You can study on your own now.

676
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,440
Huan'er.

677
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,089
Do you want
to grab milk tea together after school?

678
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,409
We can talk about book selection.

679
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,760
Sure.

680
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,920
Let's invite them too.

681
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,440
Qi Qi is asking if you want
to get milk tea after school.

682
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,859
Pure invitation.

683
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,130
Are you treating us then?

684
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,170
Bill's on me.

685
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,739
I want to thank you

686
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,090
for helping me with revision.

687
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,880
A treat?

688
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,210
Am I included?

689
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,690
You always get excited
when someone treats.

690
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,889
Yes, you can join.

691
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,210
You're truly my friend.

692
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,569
(Open)

693
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,570
Song Cong.

694
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,720
Have you thought
about what book to bring?

695
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,139
Well.

696
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,490
Not yet.

697
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,050
What do you usually read?

698
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,010
Normally,

699
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,219
I don't have a particular preference.

700
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,600
(Open)
I read all sorts of book.

701
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,329
Qi Qi.

702
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,409
(Open)

703
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,454
What book did you choose?

704
00:37:08,455 --> 00:37:08,969
(Open)

705
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,969
Don't tell me

706
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,800
it's another melodramatic youth novel.

707
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,840
That's none of your business.

708
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,240
Besides, participation matters
more than the book itself.

709
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
What if someone doesn't have any books?

710
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,929
Don't drag me into this.

711
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,320
I have books.

712
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,859
What book?

713
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,800
Even though I don't like studying,

714
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,280
I actually

715
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,490
enjoy reading.

716
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,440
(Open)

717
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,699
Come here, Huan'er.

718
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,369
(Open)

719
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,440
Come to my house later
and pick a book.

720
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,090
Won't that trouble you?

721
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,179
No worries.

722
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,970
Come on.

723
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,490
- I'll take it.
- Come on.

724
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,569
Goodbye.

725
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,369
Bye!

726
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:58,009
(Open)

727
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,960
Since when did you
take an interest in reading?

728
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,210
Come on in.

729
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,760
Your house is huge!

730
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,490
And your piano, it looks magnificent.

731
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,970
This?

732
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,610
My mom forced me to play the piano.

733
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,170
I wanted to learn the ukulele,

734
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,210
but she wouldn't allow it.

735
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,130
She said it wasn't presentable.

736
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,969
Ukulele?

737
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,280
What's that?

738
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,970
Why do you want to play the ukulele?

739
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,760
A ukulele

740
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,049
is a small musical instrument

741
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,650
that you can carry anywhere.

742
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,409
I

743
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,970
wanted to play it because

744
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,840
I dream of wandering the world with it.

745
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,400
Wandering the world?

746
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,089
You really dream big.

747
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,739
If I had the chance,

748
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,840
I'd love to travel the world too.

749
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,090
Really?

750
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,779
But for now,

751
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,320
I want to focus on the present.

752
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,280
You're back, Qi Qi.

753
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,130
Greetings, Aunt.

754
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,440
Have some fruits.

755
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,449
Thank you.

756
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,650
Thank you, Aunt.

757
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,130
Qi Qi.

758
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,130
Your mom is really kind.

759
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,130
That's my housekeeper.

760
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,969
If you met my mom,

761
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,400
you wouldn't say that.

762
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,050
Let's go pick a book.

763
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,360
Take a look here.

764
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,179
Qi Qi.

765
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,320
You have so many books at home!

766
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,360
Did you know?

767
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,089
I used to love reading as a kid,

768
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,409
mostly because

769
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,440
I loved the smell of books.

770
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,130
They smell great.

771
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,969
Try it

772
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,970
Really?

773
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,130
I'm sorry.

774
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,929
I have a nose allergy.

775
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,699
It's okay.

776
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,320
I'll take this.
Go ahead and pick a book.

777
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,739
There are too many!

778
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,010
I don't know which one to choose.

779
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,210
Qi Qi.

780
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,219
How about this?

781
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,779
Just help me pick one book.

782
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,090
That won't do.

783
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,339
Your favorite book

784
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,219
says

785
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,889
a lot about you.

786
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,699
The person who chooses your book

787
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,089
likely shares

788
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,970
the same taste.

789
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,090
You might even be soul mates.

790
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,720
Huan'er.

791
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,440
Which books did
Song Cong and Jing Xichi pick?

792
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,720
Tell me.

793
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,720
I don't want to choose the same one.

794
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,929
That's very unlikely.

795
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,570
We've already picked our books...

796
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,440
No.

797
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,139
Song Cong might have that book at home.

798
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,490
I'll ask them later.

799
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,610
Qi Qi.

800
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,690
You're right.

801
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,739
I should pick a book

802
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,889
from my own collection.

803
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:05,619
That way,

804
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,280
it truly represents me.

805
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,920
Okay.

806
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,570
Mom.

807
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,650
Mom.

808
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,320
Mom!

809
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,009
My school is organizing
a Bookcrossing event.

810
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,049
Do you have any books

811
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,779
I can borrow?

812
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,840
Why not take one of your own?

813
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,320
Well, mine

814
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,490
are too basic.

815
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,409
Mom.

816
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,489
Listen.

817
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,659
I went to Qi Qi's place today.

818
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,080
Her house is really massive.

819
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,259
She has so many books.

820
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,369
I couldn't even

821
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,720
understand some of the titles.

822
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,130
No wonder she's so good at writing.

823
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,170
If I recommend one of my books,

824
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,800
it'll seem

825
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,369
boring in comparison.

826
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,090
You want something interesting?

827
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,726
Come on.

828
00:42:57,727 --> 00:42:59,009
Check my bookshelf.

829
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,859
My books are interesting.

830
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,480
(Goldman-Cecil Medicine)
It's surely interesting.

831
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,720
Your classmates would be impressed.
Pick whichever you like.

832
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,659
It's not impressing,

833
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,089
it's depressing.

834
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,139
(Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine)

835
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,369
How can I recommend this?

836
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,529
Why not?

837
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,179
It's Science.

838
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,610
Look, this book is about gynecology.

839
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,179
Girls like you

840
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,529
should learn about it.

841
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,929
If you ever have symptoms

842
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,139
or anything...

843
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,659
Mom.

844
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,619
Enough with the medical jargon.

845
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,299
I can't

846
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,299
recommend this.

847
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,049
Why can't you recommend these?

848
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,720
It's about the human body.

849
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,610
This one's on acupuncture.

850
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,010
We're only in senior middle school,
we can't do acupuncture!

851
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,720
Well.

852
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,650
What about this?

853
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,859
The Compendium of Materia Medica.

854
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,760
A classic.

855
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,610
Teach my classmates
about herbal medicine? Never mind.

856
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,210
Mom.

857
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,210
Don't you have any normal books?

858
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,010
That's right.

859
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,179
I've only read

860
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,409
half of this one,

861
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,650
but I can lend it to you.

862
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,050
Neuropsychology.

863
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,449
Or

864
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,299
I have another one,

865
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,259
abnormal psychology.

866
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,659
It's even more compelling.
Where did I put it?

867
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,130
Forget the abnormal one.

868
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,650
I rather choose the neuro book.

869
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,259
You sure you don't want something fresh?
My books are fresh.

870
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,760
Trust me.

871
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,440
