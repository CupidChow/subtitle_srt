(Unable to Hide)

16
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:00,940
Dad,

17
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,110
you're still up?

18
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,168
I was sorting out
your mom's medication.

19
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,110
Is Mom asleep?

20
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:09,080
Yeah, she's asleep.

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,110
Huan'er,

22
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,070
I've decided

23
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:19,000
to retreat to the back line.

24
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,270
I won't be going anywhere anymore.

25
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,900
I'll stay in Tianhe,

26
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:27,272
do some grocery shopping,

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,180
cook some meals,

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,110
be a stay-at-home husband,

29
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:32,424
and spend time with you and your mom.

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,620
Do you know

31
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,700
what the happiest thing

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,580
in life is?

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,700
What?

34
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,808
A false alarm.

35
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,950
I think your mom's illness

36
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,140
is most probably

37
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,620
caused by me stressing her out.

38
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,300
How could that be?

39
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,550
Back then, I was always

40
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,990
busy making money,

41
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,110
and your mom

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,420
handled everything at home.

43
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,110
Sometimes,

44
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,350
I even made her angry

45
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,390
and added to her troubles.

46
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,440
Do you know?

47
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,900
She talked about

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,390
divorcing me quite a few times,

49
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,390
but in the end,

50
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:19,560
she couldn't go through with it

51
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,020
because she's softhearted.

52
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,990
Now that I think about it,

53
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,110
I really owe her a lot.

54
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,350
When we got married,

55
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,950
there was no proposal,

56
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,900
no romance,

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,390
nothing at all.

58
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,070
We just muddled through the wedding,

59
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,110
and then

60
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,230
we had you.

61
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,110
At the time, I thought,

62
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,230
there's plenty of time.

63
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,990
So, I'll make it up to her later.

64
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,070
But now, looking back,

65
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,696
half a lifetime has passed.

66
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,140
How time flies!

67
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,820
Why are we here?

68
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,740
I want to

69
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,860
help my dad

70
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,150
to buy a diamond ring for my mom.

71
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,260
Consider it making up

72
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,060
for the wedding gift

73
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,380
when they were young.

74
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,648
Do you bring enough money?

75
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:34,550
I still have my scholarship
from last semester.

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,550
Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands,

77
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,910
Ten Thousand...

78
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:44,590
Wait.

79
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,990
Why is a tiny rock so expensive?

80
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:49,910
Huan'er,

81
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,180
how much money do you have?

82
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,030
Not much.

83
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,180
How much exactly?

84
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,110
3,000.

85
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,910
Can I try this one?

86
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,910
Sure.

87
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,500
You have great taste, Miss.

88
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,550
This is our store's latest design.

89
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,990
The price

90
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,710
is 94,800 yuan.

91
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,072
This is pretty nice.

92
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,879
I'll take this one.

93
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,020
Okay, I'll use a credit card.

94
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,192
Okay, please come over here.

95
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,590
It's not that nice.

96
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:34,710
Let's look around a bit more.

97
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,030
94,800...

98
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,180
She didn't even blink

99
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,710
before buying it.

100
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,790
Maybe for her,

101
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,696
it's just like buying a couple

102
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:47,790
of expensive outfits.

103
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,030
Jing Xichi,

104
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,230
how many cups of milk tea
can 90,000 yuan buy?

105
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,860
90,000...

106
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,300
If we assume

107
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,350
10 yuan per cup,

108
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,350
that is 9,000 cups.

109
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,910
If you drink one a day,

110
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,820
you can drink at least 24 years.

111
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,620
24 years...

112
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,230
What would you like to drink?

113
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:14,136
Just three glasses of water for now,

114
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,590
thanks.

115
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,150
Alright.

116
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,590
I was too naive.

117
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:23,864
I thought by gathering all
my Chinese New Year's money

118
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:24,820
from the past few years,

119
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,376
I could get that ring.

120
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,110
But, it turns out

121
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:30,648
that I can't even afford
the prong to hold the diamond.

122
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:33,550
It seems that the power
of adults in this world

123
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,420
has nothing to do

124
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,590
with the grades in school.

125
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,910
Qi Qi invited me to dinner.

126
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,940
I get to go now.

127
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,150
Bye.

128
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,590
By the way,

129
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:51,944
Happy Valentine's Day to you two.

130
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,936
Thank you.

131
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,820
Thank you.

132
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,940
Happy Valentine's Day.

133
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,420
Guess who I am.

134
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,500
Stop it.

135
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,470
Happy Valentine's Day.

136
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,230
Happy Valentine's Day.

137
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,470
I got you a present.

138
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,060
What is it?

139
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,300
I made it myself.

140
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,710
It's beautiful!

141
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,940
Do you want to try it on?

142
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,710
Yeah.

143
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,420
I can't find it.

144
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,380
Here.

145
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,500
Pretty?

146
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,790
Yes.

147
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,260
I'll wear the other one.

148
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,860
Is it done?

149
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,740
Yeah.

150
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,740
Thank you.

151
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,590
I got you something too.

152
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,230
This is...

153
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,920
Check it out when you get home.

154
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,968
I'm meeting my friends for a meal.

155
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,390
Let's go. Otherwise, we will be late.

156
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,464
Alright.

157
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,056
Let's go.

158
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,830
Are you hungry?

159
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,590
I'm okay.

160
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:34,380
What about you?

161
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,540
I'm okay too.

162
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,830
Qi Qi,

163
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,500
you are finally here!

164
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,110
Long time no see.

165
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,950
Wenwen.

166
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,070
Song Cong,

167
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,620
this is Wen Wen.

168
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,620
And, that's Dazhao.

169
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,200
Nice to meet you.

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,440
I heard you're studying medicine
at Yenching University.

171
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,430
Much respect.

172
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,590
If you open a private clinic abroad,

173
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:56,712
you'll make good money.

174
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,310
Public hospitals in China are great too.

175
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,848
You can only earn a little
in a public hospital here.

176
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,830
What are you saying?

177
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,430
Let's sit.

178
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,070
Let's sit.

179
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,260
I know you like this.

180
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,296
I saw it at a boutique overseas.

181
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,260
What is it?

182
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,310
Take a look.

183
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,950
It's this!

184
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,430
How did you know I like it?

185
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,780
It's gorgeous.

186
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,140
Put it on now.

187
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,950
Looks good.

188
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,710
Put this one on too.

189
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,710
Waiter,

190
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,860
we'd like to order.

191
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,744
Song Cong, over the years,
many people pursued Qi Qi,

192
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,969
but she never agreed to anyone.

193
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,912
- He'll pay the bill.
- You managed to win her over.

194
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:14,900
No matter what,

195
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:15,860
you have to treat us

196
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,830
to this meal today.

197
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,430
Aren't you embarrassed?

198
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,380
You invited them to eat,

199
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,560
and now you're making them pay?

200
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,070
Pay the bill.

201
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,464
It's my first time meeting everyone,
so I should treat you.

202
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:24,216
I'll pay the bill.

203
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,950
Cash or card?

204
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,740
Cash.

205
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,590
Alright, here's your bill.

206
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,500
I'll use my card.

207
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,230
Okay, one moment, please.

208
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,140
Yeah.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,536
Where are you guys heading afterward?

210
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,064
We've got something to do later,

211
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,140
so we won't be joining you.

212
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,020
Oh, come on.

213
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,110
What a killjoy you are!

214
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,352
I hardly come back here,

215
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:51,030
yet you prioritize
your boyfriend over me.

216
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:52,088
Nothing I can do about it.

217
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,620
Alright,

218
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,310
let's go.

219
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,768
Let's grab something warm to drink.

220
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,590
Hello.

221
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,900
Hey!

222
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,620
It's you!

223
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,900
You still remember me?

224
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,860
Of course!

225
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,430
We're selling our cakes

226
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,350
by the slice now.

227
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,430
Do you want to try some?

228
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,710
No, thanks.

229
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,800
Just two hot chocolates, please.

230
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,600
- Sure.
- Thanks.

231
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,740
What's up?

232
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:23,048
Are you acting serious now?

233
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,190
Nothing.

234
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm just thinking

235
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,860
that back in school,

236
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,260
we were taught that if we study hard

237
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,248
and get into a good university,

238
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,430
we'll definitely have a good life.

239
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,950
But now,

240
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,190
it doesn't seem that simple.

241
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,350
Maybe the school

242
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,110
just protected us too well.

243
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,540
Hold on.

244
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,500
Are you just

245
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,470
making excuses to avoid studying?

246
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,310
Aunt Lin told me specifically

247
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,500
to keep an eye on you.

248
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,430
If you dare skip class,

249
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:04,000
she won't let you off the hook!

250
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:04,740
You're so evil!

251
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,044
Here's your hot chocolate.

252
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,177
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

253
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,177
Happy Valentine's Day.

254
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,110
Wait.

255
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,070
Thank you.

256
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,079
I tell you, you better be kinder.

257
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,680
Or every Valentine's Day from now on,
you'll be spending it alone.

258
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,844
I won't keep you company.

259
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,866
What do you mean, you keep me company?

260
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:21,244
Obviously, I'm the one
keeping you company, okay?

261
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,710
Aren't you alone too?

262
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,110
Since

263
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,070
we're both alone...

264
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,070
Why...

265
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,900
Don't we...

266
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,990
Just go to McDonald's?

267
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,280
They have a buy-one-get-one
ice cream deal for today.

268
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:38,066
It's your treat.

269
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,644
Hey, you haven't paid
for your hot chocolate.

270
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,422
Oh, right!

271
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,540
How much?

272
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,430
Twenty.

273
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,533
Is there a Valentine's Day discount?

274
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:48,155
No.

275
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,190
Hao!

276
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,740
Hao!

277
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,000
Why did you come here alone?

278
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,710
I mainly came

279
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,900
to drop off some documents for you.

280
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,822
Your recovery seems to be going well.

281
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,950
Yeah, pretty good.

282
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,620
Let me take a look...

283
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,780
You haven't reached retirement age yet.

284
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,710
But, it's a work-related injury.

285
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,622
The hospital said
I can take early retirement.

286
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,400
Alright, let me check the documents...

287
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,660
(Internal Employee Early Retirement/
Pre-Retirement Leave Approval Form)

288
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,400
Why hasn't
the finance department signed it?

289
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,140
Finance said

290
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,310
HR can sign first.

291
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,260
That is not allowed.

292
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,577
They have to sign it first
before we can process it.

293
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,310
Finance said HR could go first.

294
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,222
But, Director Zhang
is out on a business trip.

295
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,444
He said he'll be back in two days,
then he'll sign for me.

296
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,800
Then, you can wait two more days.

297
00:13:36,822 --> 00:13:37,577
Once they sign it,

298
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,577
you can come again.

299
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,310
It's just that...

300
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,990
I'm not very mobile right now.

301
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,140
How about this?

302
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,350
I'll leave it with you for now.

303
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,830
Once Director Zhang returns,

304
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,310
could you help get it signed

305
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,500
and stamped for me?

306
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,430
Then,

307
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,310
I'll come pick it up.

308
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,250
Would that be okay?

309
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,070
Definitely not.

310
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,740
Look at my place.

311
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:53,500
How messy it is!

312
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,430
If I lose it,

313
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,230
I can't take responsibility.

314
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,740
Zhou, we've known each other for years.

315
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,860
It's just a small favor,

316
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,377
and this doesn't break any rules.

317
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,260
I've got all the documents ready.

318
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,430
This isn't standard procedure.

319
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,177
It puts me in a difficult condition.

320
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,020
Yan!

321
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,990
What brings you here?

322
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,555
You could have just called,
and I would have come to you.

323
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,020
This early retirement was
personally approved by the director.

324
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,500
Now, you check
if it can be processed now.

325
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,310
Alright.

326
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:33,533
Here you go, take it.

327
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,710
Thank you.

328
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,822
(Name: Hao Mei, Retirement Application
Unit: Tianhe No.3 Central Hospital)

329
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,710
Be careful.

330
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,070
I'm fine.

331
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,740
You're back.

332
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,470
Mom.

333
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,620
What are you holding?

334
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,380
This is

335
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,140
a Valentine's Day gift

336
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,310
from Qi Qi.

337
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:08,555
It looks nice.

338
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:09,950
Wash your hands first.

339
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,990
Dinner is ready.

340
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,590
It looks expensive.

341
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,470
What did you get for Qi Qi?

342
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,470
I gave her a pair of earrings

343
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,666
which I made them myself.

344
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,260
You can make earrings?

345
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,900
I think you should have

346
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,430
bought her

347
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,740
a standard gift.

348
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,780
Later,

349
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,140
you check how much this costs

350
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,410
(Retirement Certificate)
and buy something of a similar price

351
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:42,133
so we don't look too low-standard.

352
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,950
Did you hear me?

353
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,260
Alright.

354
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,430
Hurry up and eat.

355
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,740
Mom.

356
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,000
Did you go to handle
your retirement today?

357
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:03,422
Yeah, it's done.

358
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,830
Didn't you

359
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,830
want to continue...

360
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,230
Forget it.

361
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,266
I don't want to push myself anymore.

362
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,710
Is Qi Qi's family very wealthy?

363
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,020
What does her mom do?

364
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,230
Her mom

365
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,577
owns a law firm.

366
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,244
That's much better
than our family's situation.

367
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,380
Does her mom

368
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,310
know about

369
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,780
your relationship?

370
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,780
Qi Qi

371
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,780
hasn't had the chance to tell her yet.

372
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,710
Does Qi Qi

373
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,710
mind my current situation?

374
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,710
I know you young people

375
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,955
don't like hearing
about "matching social status",

376
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,950
but given our circumstances,

377
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,470
does it put a lot of pressure on you?

378
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,990
Mom, what are you talking about?

379
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,060
Alright.

380
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:15,000
I won't say anything.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,430
Can you stop bringing this up again?

382
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,230
Fine, fine.

383
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,870
Let's eat.

384
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,150
Let's eat.

385
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,860
(Men's Shirt: 8000 yuan)

386
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:11,630
Huan'er, you've been wearing

387
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,666
this shirt for so long.

388
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:13,755
I'll bring it for washing.

389
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:29,870
Huan'er,

390
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,111
I want to talk to you about something.

391
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,300
What's up, Dad?

392
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,780
I know that university life

393
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,740
is full of temptations,

394
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,580
but academics

395
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,933
should always come first.

396
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,430
Right?

397
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,710
I was young once too

398
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,710
and I know young people

399
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,910
are always impulsive,

400
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:54,977
acting without thinking things through.

401
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,150
But, I have to remind you,

402
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,630
don't get confused by your emotions.

403
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,540
Don't make rash decisions

404
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,150
without careful thought.

405
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,710
Who's confused by emotions?

406
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:06,990
Hold on,

407
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,580
Dad.

408
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,190
What exactly are you trying to say?

409
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,870
Do you have a boyfriend?

410
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,540
I don't have a boyfriend!

411
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,580
Stop making things up!

412
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,933
I really don't have a boyfriend!

413
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:17,990
Look yourself. What is this?

414
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:20,822
You've come to a stage of marriage
and need to buy a diamond ring?

415
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,300
No,

416
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,990
Dad.

417
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,150
I was planning
to buy you a diamond ring.

418
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:27,844
Buy me a diamond ring?

419
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,540
What?

420
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,190
Didn't you once tell me

421
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:33,822
that Mom didn't get a diamond ring

422
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:34,800
when you two got married?

423
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,622
And, you feel regret.

424
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,260
So, I thought

425
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,390
I'd buy one for you

426
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,100
to make Mom happy.

427
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,620
(True love is eternal.
Shining with light.)

428
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:43,990
Dad,

429
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:45,955
what do you think?

430
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,300
It's unnecessary.

431
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,260
This is an adult matter.

432
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,710
You little kid just stay out of it.

433
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,870
You should prioritize

434
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,820
your study.

435
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,888
Stop thinking
about buying diamond rings.

436
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,870
Go study in your room.

437
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,430
I wasn't meddling!

438
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,870
Mom has always said

439
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,990
she wanted a diamond ring!

440
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,911
Do you have money
for buying a diamond ring?

441
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:04,630
I have no money.

442
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:20,488
Why are you meeting me?

443
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,500
What's up?

444
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,300
Missing me already?

445
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,990
I came to return this to you.

446
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,580
I checked the price,

447
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,822
and it's too expensive.

448
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,870
I can't accept it.

449
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,710
It's just a gift.

450
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,870
Moreover,

451
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,990
didn't you also give me earrings?

452
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,020
The price is just a number.

453
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,733
What matters is the thought.

454
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:51,390
Price is price.

455
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,333
Thoughtfulness is thoughtfulness.

456
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,990
I appreciate your gesture,

457
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,580
but I really can't accept this.

458
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,780
Do you have to be like this?

459
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,710
Fine.

460
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,511
You won't accept it, right?

461
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,711
Then, I'll just throw it away.

462
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,820
Qi Qi!

463
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:08,990
Stop messing around, okay?

464
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,910
Then, just accept it this time.

465
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,488
I promise I won't gift this
to you again next time.

466
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,340
Okay?

467
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,910
Alright.

468
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:23,888
Let's order some drinks then.

469
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,580
Waiter, we'd like to order.

470
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:46,844
Don't stay up too late. Go to sleep.

471
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,710
Take a shower and go to bed.

472
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,820
Mom, can you slow down your voice?

473
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,740
You scared me.

474
00:21:57,422 --> 00:21:58,888
I have to go shower and sleep.

475
00:21:58,888 --> 00:21:59,470
I know.

476
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:01,190
You're going back
to university tomorrow.

477
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,111
And, you're still playing it.
Go to bed early.

478
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,380
(Hello, can I take
a moment of your time?)

479
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,578
(Hello, can I take
a moment of your time?)

480
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:18,060
(I'm Jiang Sen, head
of Wu'an Huan Dao Technology)

481
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,630
Hello.

482
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,580
Where is Mr. Jiang's office?

483
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,260
Thank you.

484
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,710
Please come in.

485
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,060
Hello.

486
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,230
I'm...

487
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,844
You're Jing Xichi, right?

488
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:43,470
Yes.

489
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,870
I'm Jiang Sen,

490
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:47,710
head of Huan Dao Technology
in Wu'an Branch.

491
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,511
Nice to meet you.

492
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:49,311
Have a seat.

493
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,311
I heard you're still in university.

494
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,470
Yes, I'm Year 1 student.

495
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,540
Just Year 1?

496
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,000
That's impressive.

497
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Your second-hand book

498
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,710
trading website has great potential

499
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,100
and a decent user base.

500
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,230
However,

501
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,377
your platform has been

502
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
operating as a non-profit.

503
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,311
If you upgrade it,
the future possibilities are limitless.

504
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:12,888
Thank you.

505
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,710
Alright.

506
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,333
I'll get straight to the point.

507
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,020
I have two proposals for you.

508
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,630
First,

509
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,780
we create

510
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,780
an identical platform.

511
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,190
With Huan Dao's team and technology,

512
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,500
we can launch quickly.

513
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:25,190
But when that happens,

514
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,150
we'll be competitors.

515
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:26,950
Second,

516
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,430
we provide you

517
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,020
with funding and technical support,

518
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,630
and you continue running the platform.

519
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,088
You'll receive dividends later on,

520
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,260
and if it does well,

521
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,820
it could be quite lucrative.

522
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,020
So,

523
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,910
you mean...

524
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,020
What I mean is that,

525
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:47,222
while your team is still inexperienced
in terms of technical part,

526
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,950
Huan Dao values your potential.

527
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,500
Alright.

528
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,540
I'll think about it.

529
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:57,990
Sure.

530
00:23:58,177 --> 00:23:59,422
I'll wait for your response.

531
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,020
See you.

532
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:02,844
Alright.

533
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,150
Hello,

534
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,470
Jing Xichi.

535
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,066
Are you free these next few days?

536
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,990
I have my last final exam tonight.

537
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:19,222
After that, I'm free.

538
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,540
Why?

539
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:21,430
Let's head back together
after your finals.

540
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,500
What happened?

541
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,260
(A semester passed quickly.)

542
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,820
(Mom has fully recovered.)

543
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,710
(It's time to make)

544
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,230
(the surprise plan happen.)

545
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:35,430
Mom, let's go inside
and pick out some clothes.

546
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:35,910
Yeah.

547
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,555
We don't even have a photo together.

548
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:38,150
Let's go.

549
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,990
It's so pretty, Mom.

550
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,088
Come on, let's check inside.

551
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,430
Wow, it is beautiful!

552
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,710
Mom.

553
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,910
This is a bridal shop. Wearing this?

554
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,430
Dad!

555
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,400
It's not appropriate.

556
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:51,020
Why not?

557
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:52,666
Other people have wedding photos,

558
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:53,430
but we don't.

559
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,740
When I think about it...

560
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,060
I get jealous. Right?

561
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,870
Yeah, Mom.

562
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,422
I've never seen you in a wedding dress!

563
00:24:58,422 --> 00:24:59,822
You must be very beautiful.

564
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,190
Our daughter is an adult now.

565
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:02,710
What's the wedding photo for?

566
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,710
Mom, Mom!

567
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,780
It's not a problem.

568
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,430
Besides, who says wedding dresses

569
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,710
can only be worn at weddings?

570
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,300
Exactly!

571
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,630
If you're willing,

572
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:10,990
we can take a photo every year

573
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,870
until Huan'er is as old as we are now.

574
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,300
We'll take them until we're 90!

575
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,100
Yeah!

576
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,580
I agree with Dad!

577
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,580
Mom,

578
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,990
when you're 90,

579
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,950
Dad will be the most handsome old man

580
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,910
in Tianhe!

581
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,780
And, you'll be

582
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,066
the most stunning beauty!

583
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:24,990
Come on!

584
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,540
Come on.

585
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,990
Wearing a wedding dress at 90

586
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,300
would be ridiculous.

587
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,390
People will laugh at us.

588
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,190
Stop messing around.

589
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,910
Just pick one.

590
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:31,709
We're already here.

591
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,490
This one looks nice.

592
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,540
No. The breast has reached the stomach.

593
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,844
What about this one? It's puffy.

594
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,100
The back...

595
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:37,870
No, no, no.

596
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,740
Dad, hurry up and pick one.

597
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,355
How about this one?

598
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:43,260
It even has a ribbon here.

599
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,679
- It's not nice.
- Too old-fashioned.

600
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,780
Fine. Let's see another one.

601
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,644
So many styles...

602
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:49,470
Why don't you pick one yourself?

603
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:50,340
You choose, okay?

604
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,430
Choose from these.

605
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,190
I think these look pretty good.

606
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,740
This one looks great, Mom!

607
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,820
You'll look absolutely stunning in it.

608
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,190
See?

609
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,933
My mom has such a great taste.

610
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,088
Isn't it beautiful?

611
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:15,466
It's so beautiful!

612
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,060
Here she comes!

613
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,100
I've never worn anything
like this in my life.

614
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,430
Snow White!

615
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,190
Be careful.

616
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,390
You guys...?

617
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,100
So beautiful!

618
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,390
Why are you all here?

619
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,100
You see, wearing a wedding dress

620
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,990
at this age is quite embarrassing.

621
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:31,740
Mom!

622
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,710
I tell you,
you look stunning in this dress.

623
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,390
Just like twenty years ago.

624
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,710
Hey.

625
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,190
Come on!

626
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,190
Why are you here too?

627
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,990
Your leg...

628
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,820
It doesn't hinder me
from joining in on the fun.

629
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,300
Exactly.

630
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,870
See what you have done.

631
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,020
You look amazing.

632
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,390
So handsome!

633
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,710
Since you're all here,

634
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,710
let's take it together.

635
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,020
No, you two first.

636
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:51,470
You two stand in the center.

637
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:52,244
Okay, here we go.

638
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,630
Here.

639
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,710
Look over here.

640
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,780
Three, two, one.

641
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,470
Okay?

642
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:01,990
Great!

643
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:03,020
Get a little closer.

644
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,910
We'll take another one.

645
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,360
Take one photo with you holding her.

646
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,020
Wait a second.

647
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,340
What's wrong?

648
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,630
You know,

649
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,066
I've always been a straightforward guy.

650
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,190
I don't know romance,

651
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:21,733
and I don't know
how to make people happy.

652
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,430
When you got sick,

653
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,820
I felt really guilty.

654
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:31,755
I felt guilty for not
taking good care of you.

655
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,190
In these past few days,

656
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,540
I've been thinking

657
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,100
about how I can do better,

658
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:46,710
and how I can be a good husband.

659
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,470
In the end,

660
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,870
it was Huan'er who reminded me.

661
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,500
Even our kid could think of it,

662
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,870
but I couldn't.

663
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,710
After all these years,

664
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,870
we've stumbled our way

665
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,990
to today.

666
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,190
And, there's always been
a regret in my heart,

667
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,500
in which I never

668
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,990
properly proposed to you.

669
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,580
So today,

670
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,500
in front of everyone,

671
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,500
I want to ask you

672
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,540
the question I should've asked

673
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,644
twenty years ago.

674
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:29,622
Lina,

675
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,910
will you marry me?

676
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,500
Yes, I do.

677
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,230
Don't cry.

678
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,300
Dad!

679
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,060
Dad!

680
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,644
Put the ring on!

681
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,990
Oh, right! Put the ring on!

682
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,390
This is for you.

683
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,340
Purple roses.

684
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,430
So beautiful.

685
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,540
Purple roses mean

686
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,060
eternal love.

687
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,100
Eternal love.

688
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:06,870
Mom,

689
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:15,911
watching television?

690
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,150
Thank you.

691
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:26,400
Thank me for what?

692
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:30,177
Thank you for giving me
everything you could.

693
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,222
So, don't ever think our family
is any less than others.

694
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,390
In my eyes,

695
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:36,666
you've always been
the best mom in the world.

696
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,430
What's wrong with this kid?

697
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,933
Why are you grinning like that?

698
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,780
Why?

699
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,990
Can't I smile now?

700
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,990
My dad just proposed to my mom.

701
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,190
I'm really happy!

702
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,630
Uncle Chen and Aunt Lina's love

703
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,020
is deeper than I imagined.

704
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,500
Yeah.

705
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,780
My mom doesn't
care about material things.

706
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,340
She cares about two hearts
that truly love each other.

707
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,820
But, this is such an important event.

708
00:32:39,844 --> 00:32:41,511
Why didn't you even tell me in advance?

709
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,390
Only my dad and I knew.

710
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,950
No one else did.

711
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:49,066
What's wrong?

712
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:49,710
Are you upset?

713
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,150
No.

714
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,740
Don't be mad.

715
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,340
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

716
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:57,540
I'm not mad.

717
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,430
What's wrong?

718
00:33:02,755 --> 00:33:03,844
What's that smell?

719
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,820
What smell?

720
00:33:04,977 --> 00:33:06,000
Did you put on perfume?

721
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:06,580
No.

722
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,390
You put on perfume?

(is probably the scent of pheromones.)

740
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,470
I'm sweating.

741
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,422
I've arrived.

742
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:34,333
What a coincidence.

743
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:35,488
My house is here, too.

744
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,700
Yeah.

745
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,140
Just now...

746
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,830
Was that your first kiss?

747
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,500
Of course, it was my first kiss.

748
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:55,190
I've never been
in a relationship before.

749
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,020
But, you seemed

750
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,060
pretty skilled just now.

751
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,700
I thought

752
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,310
it wasn't your first time...

753
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,620
Stop it!

754
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,060
Maybe it's just

755
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:06,577
that I watch too many movies...

756
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,700
And I just...

757
00:36:07,955 --> 00:36:09,244
Couldn't hold myself back...

758
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,950
So I...

759
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:18,910
Chen Huan'er.

760
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,910
So, does

761
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,060
this mean

762
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,580
we're a couple now?

763
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,390
How does that make us a couple?

764
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,620
But, we just...

765
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,020
Yet, you haven't even

766
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,020
properly

767
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,390
confessed to me.

768
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,470
Chen Huan'er,

769
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,700
I like you.

770
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,620
Will you

771
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,430
be my girlfriend?

772
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,620
Xichi,

773
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,140
what are you two
still doing out so late?

774
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,830
Dad.

775
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,540
I go in first.

776
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:18,044
You guys have a lot
of topics to talk, huh?

777
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:19,400
Your mom's been looking for you.

778
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,950
She called me just now.
Get home now.

779
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,466
Really?

780
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:24,533
What's up?

781
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:25,466
Anything else?

782
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,580
No, nothing at all.

783
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:26,790
I...

784
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,440
I walk you home.

785
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,180
No need, Uncle.

786
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,377
My home is upstairs.

787
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,044
Go on, hurry up.

788
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:30,688
Bye, Uncle.

789
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,310
Why hasn't he called me yet?

790
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,220
Jing Xichi.

791
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,420
(Piggy Jing)

792
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,350
Hello?

793
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,830
Hello?

794
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,270
Just now...

795
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,350
Why does my mobile plan...

796
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,100
Hello?

797
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,060
What's going on?

798
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,310
How dare he hang up on me!

799
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,270
How do I cancel this? Help me check it.

800
00:38:41,377 --> 00:38:42,100
How to cancel it?

801
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,111
Why isn't it working?

802
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,100
Mom, it's just easy.

803
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,140
You go to sleep first.
I'll fix it for you tomorrow.

804
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:47,270
It's late now.

805
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,950
Go to sleep.

806
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,155
It keeps deducting money!

807
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:49,866
Go ahead, Mom.

808
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:51,390
Fine. Don't forget to help me tomorrow.

809
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,950
Don't worry.

810
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,910
What's going on?

811
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,620
(I just wanted to tell you that...)

812
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,311
(I just wanted to tell you)

813
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,088
(that I was serious just now.)

814
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,950
(Will you be)

815
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,310
(my girlfriend?)

816
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,700
(Silly.)

817
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:48,911
(What does that mean?)

818
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,990
(Goodnight,)

819
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,470
(my boyfriend.)

820
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,310
(Good night, my girlfriend.)

821
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,180
Boyfriend! I have a boyfriend!

822
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,830
What was that sound?

823
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,060
Mom!

824
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:05,870
The bed collapsed.

825
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,140
You...

826
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:09,950
This...

827
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,310
Be careful.

828
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,580
What's going on?

829
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
I just turned over...

830
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:14,933
Gosh...

831
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,700
The quality of this bed is terrible.

832
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,466
