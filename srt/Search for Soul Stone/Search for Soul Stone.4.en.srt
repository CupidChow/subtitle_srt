1
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,920
Shaoye

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,960
It's not that I won't say it

3
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,320
I really didn't see anything

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,759
I just remember there was someone

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,840
No, that wasn't a person

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It was a monster

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,960
He had no arms

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,679
A blade grew out from his arm

9
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,039
A blade

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,000
Shaoye

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,599
That monster is right behind you

12
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,120
Xiao Duo, run

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Run!

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
Aren't you good at running?

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,519
Xiao Duo

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hide behind me, quick

17
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,719
Sir specifically instructed

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
to catch them alive

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,039
But didn't say how alive

20
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,479
What does that mean exactly?

21
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,719
Nine-tenths alive

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,520
Seven-tenths alive

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,759
Five-tenths alive

24
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,000
Or both alive

25
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,479
One alive counts too

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
What do you mean by that?

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,199
Salute me

28
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,000
No need to be so polite

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,759
At most

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
I'll just cut off both your legs

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,759
So you can't run again

32
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,439
Xiao Duo

33
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,800
Xiao Duo

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,319
Stop

35
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,479
I said stop!

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,879
Xiao Duo

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,039
You think

38
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,199
that thing of yours can hurt me?

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,520
Looks like I underestimated you

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
But if I switch to this

41
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,400
How will you handle that?

42
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
If you move again

43
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,599
I'll kill him

44
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,199
Want to see who's faster?

45
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,199
Miss

46
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,600
Dao Lang has already been locked up

47
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Got it

48
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,439
All these years

49
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,839
How did you get by?

50
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,879
How else could we live?

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,399
Eat when there's food

52
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,839
If there's no food

53
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:00,800
Go earn some more

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,399
Let me tell you

55
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,439
The two of us were actually quite fun

56
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,120
We'd fish coins from the claw machine

57
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,399
Stuffed rocks to trick the junk dealer

58
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,920
Sometimes when it rained

59
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,199
There were hardly any people outside

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,480
Couldn't find any bottles to pick up

61
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,560
We had to steal from the supermarket

62
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,240
Sir

63
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,000
That yellow cigarette behind you

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,879
How much is it?

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,399
That's thirty

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Oh, thirty

67
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,240
Thanks, sir

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,879
Young man

69
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,680
Your sister is still young

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,959
Promise me

71
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,079
Don't let her do this again

72
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,879
Turns out that old man always knew

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
we were there to steal

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,560
I finally understood

75
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,160
I can't let Xiao Duo

76
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,439
live her whole life like a sewer rat

77
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,720
I want to take Xiao Duo

78
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,279
and live with dignity

79
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,240
to make up for our past mistakes

80
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Let Xiao Duo live a normal life

81
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,759
With my ability

82
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,439
I'll do what a Meng Jia member

83
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,319
is supposed to do

84
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,120
I'm not human

85
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,079
I'm lazy and greedy

86
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,759
Darn it

87
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
I shouldn't have stolen

88
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,120
Your power keeps growing

89
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,759
Making money shouldn't be hard

90
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,079
Before my power is strong enough

91
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,560
I can't reveal my ability

92
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,639
and put us in danger

93
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,920
Nor break the rule that the Gifted

94
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
must stay hidden from the world

95
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,759
No wonder all these years

96
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,959
we couldn't find you

97
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Until I can face the real culprit

98
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,839
I have to keep hiding

99
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,600
Yu'er, your hand

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,519
Meng Yan

101
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,800
That day at Meng Jia

102
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
what really happened?

103
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,639
A lot of people tried to catch me that day

104
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,920
I didn't know who they were

105
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,079
According to Ah Q and Dao Lang

106
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,199
I suspect it was related to Shen Tianyi

107
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,319
Shen Tianyi

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,959
I guessed it was him long ago

109
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,920
How did you know?

110
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,319
After your family had trouble

111
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,000
The Shen family took over

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,639
all of Meng Jia's jade veins

113
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,839
Now the jade king of Myanmar

114
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,319
has shifted from Meng Jia to Shen Jia

115
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,279
Most of the jade on the market

116
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,319
is now in Shen Jia's hands

117
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,480
But strangely

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,679
when jade is sold from Shen Jia

119
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,200
most of it has lost its energy

120
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
Training the Gifted does require

121
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,600
a lot of energy from jade

122
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,120
But having too much isn't useful

123
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
What does he want?

124
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,679
Some guess

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,320
he's secretly practicing some dark art

126
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,919
Others think

127
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,399
he's recruited

128
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,200
many Gifted to serve him

129
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,639
I already sent the Azure Dragon Gang to investigate

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,720
But

131
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
there's still no clue yet

132
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,799
Miss

133
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,399
Dao Lang cut off his own arm

134
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,279
broke free from the chains and escaped

135
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,440
You actually came back just like that

136
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,840
I failed in my duty

137
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,919
You've worked hard

138
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,399
Get some rest

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,919
Thank you, sir
