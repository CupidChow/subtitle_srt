1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Madam Tang

2
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,439
If this keeps going

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,600
we'll all be worn out.

4
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:56,840
Now

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,359
there's only one way left.

6
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,679
What way?

7
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,759
We release all our power together

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,079
and break through his power limit.

9
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,879
Overwhelm him.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,239
Okay.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,640
We'll go down with him.

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,400
It's time.

13
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,599
I've finally waited for this.

14
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,319
Even if

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,280
you kill me,

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,760
with just your

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,439
little power,

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,439
Who said I want to kill you?

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,680
You...

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
How did you...

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,280
My dear uncle,

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,479
I've been by your side

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,800
learning from you for years.

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,919
When...

25
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,080
When did you start?

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,759
All this time,

27
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,080
you kept me locked in that

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,159
altar-like room.

29
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,199
I was just like

30
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,879
an animal you sacrificed.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,960
You watched me.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,680
I hid my power

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,439
afraid you'd see me as a threat.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,439
I truly wanted you

35
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,479
to be my real father.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you didn't.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was just a dog by your side.

38
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,560
Just a

39
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,800
disposable tool to you.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,439
But did you ever think

41
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,199
even a dog

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,039
gets tired of begging and wagging its tail.

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,240
Even a tool

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
wants to replace its master sometimes.

45
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,560
Like

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,639
now.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,680
You'd even kill your foster father.

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,879
Do you have any humanity left?

49
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,000
Humanity?

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,159
Those who achieve greatness

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,680
never care about humanity.

52
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,039
Great men ignore the details.

53
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,400
Once I unite Mian Guo,

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,680
this will be

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,800
a tale of ruthless decisiveness.

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
No one wants to follow

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,479
someone who killed their own father.

58
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,840
I don't need their loyalty.

59
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,479
I just need their fear.

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,879
Fear

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,000
is what makes them bow to me.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,599
It's the best way.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,120
Did you forget my power?

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,479
Defy me,

65
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:07,759
die.

66
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,759
My power—

67
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,360
I haven't forgotten.

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
But to me now,

69
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
it's too weak.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I heard fifteen miles away,

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,199
someone smashed his stepfather's head with a rock.

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,079
Do you know where he is?

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,879
Eating Shen Family's food

74
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,759
comes with a price.

75
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,160
Sir.

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,199
I'm ready.

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,759
Anyone there?

78
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,199
Anyone there?

79
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,480
Let me out!

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,040
Let me out!

81
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,639
Anyone there?

82
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,560
Let me out!

83
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,399
Not bad.

84
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,079
Before dying,

85
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,759
I get to see a show.

86
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Meng Yan

87
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,639
If you treat Yuyan badly,

88
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,480
I'll haunt you even as a ghost.

89
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,319
Our generation's karma is settled.

90
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,879
Yuer

91
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,040
Jia Family

92
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,439
is yours now.

93
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:54,959
No!

94
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:55,800
No!

95
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,399
No!

96
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,800
No!

97
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,399
You'll live in your own nightmare

98
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,800
feeling endless fear.

99
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,439
It's worse than death.

100
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,199
No need to thank me.

101
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,800
It's what your uncle should do.

102
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,519
This young couple—

103
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,439
how did they become a trio?

104
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,160
What should we do now?

105
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,639
Just eat your breakfast.

106
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,120
Okay.

107
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,959
Not dead?

108
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,879
You should've said so.

109
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,120
I already bought an urn.

110
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,439
Sorry, Yuer.

111
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,439
Let the past generation's matters

112
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,120
stay with the past.

113
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,240
Jia Yaozu

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,759
Jia Yaozu, what are you doing?

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,879
Come back!

116
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,439
Mom.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,799
Don't worry.

118
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,879
Be careful, Mom.

119
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
Six years ago,

120
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,840
The Jadeite House Meng Jia massacre case took a turn.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,120
Police confirmed

122
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,840
the killer was Meng Jia's rival, Shen Family.

123
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,840
Mastermind Shen Tianyi is dead.

124
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,679
The only one left, Shen Jingshi,

125
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,600
is mentally unstable and detained.

126
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,440
Police are guarding him 24/7.

127
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,279
Once his condition improves,

128
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,000
he'll be prosecuted immediately.

129
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,639
Police won't let any criminal

130
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,639
escape justice.

131
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:33,919
Brother.

132
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,159
I'm hungry.

133
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,480
Hurry up!

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,440
Coming!

135
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,080
Coming!

136
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
Brother made your favorite meat.

137
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,039
Here.

138
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,240
Try it, see if it's tasty.

139
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,159
Come and try.

140
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,879
Here, eat this piece.

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,759
We're here too.

142
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:55,799
Brother.

143
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,240
Which one will you choose as my sister-in-law?

144
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,799
You.

145
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:00,600
Me.
