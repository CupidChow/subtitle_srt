1
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,760
What's wrong with your eyes?

2
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,599
It seems

3
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,760
you can't understand what I'm saying.

4
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,199
Meng Yan

5
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,759
Kill me.

6
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,759
Kill me.

7
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,000
I, Jin Zhenghao,

8
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,719
don't need your pity.

9
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,400
Nor do I need your forgiveness.

10
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,039
And I certainly don't need

11
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,000
the charity of the Meng family.

12
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,159
Meng Yan

13
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,800
Looks like I'm late.

14
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Shen Tianyi

15
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,439
Shen Tianyi

16
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
I came here today

17
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,759
to tell the four great families

18
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,120
that I, Jin Zhenghao,

19
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,360
am not anyone's subordinate.

20
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,360
My Jin family will never

21
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
betray you.

22
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,079
Many years ago,

23
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,680
he led me to you all.

24
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,759
This time, it's also because of him

25
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,079
that I found you.

26
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,720
The Sovereign once said

27
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
our fate

28
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,519
was set when we were created.

29
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,000
It was already decided.

30
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,959
Jin Zhenghao's destiny is

31
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,279
to bring you to my side.

32
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,959
Child, accept your fate.

33
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,959
Come with me.

34
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,279
Shen Tianyi

35
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,399
Anyone who comes in the name of the Sovereign

36
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,560
must be cautious before him.

37
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,720
Obey his words.

38
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,480
Do not provoke him.

39
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,000
Do not defy him.

40
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,920
Because he

41
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,399
will not forgive your past.

42
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,519
Shen Tianyi

43
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,800
My Tang family does not wish to oppose you.

44
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,399
But these young ones today

45
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,079
I must take them with me.

46
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,839
So pretentious.

47
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,560
Why is Madam Tang suddenly

48
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,000
meddling in other families' affairs?

49
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,480
Oh.

50
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,399
Do you want Meng Yan

51
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,519
to be your son-in-law?

52
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,879
The Meng family is gone.

53
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,160
Why must Master Shen wipe them out?

54
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,319
It's been years.

55
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,360
Madam Tang has grown so gentle.

56
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,480
You—

57
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,399
Have you forgotten something?

58
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Do you need me

59
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,120
to help you remember?

60
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,319
Madam Tang, don't get distracted.

61
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,160
Don't let the youngsters see a joke.

62
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,399
Hu Huang Chang Mang

63
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,200
Qingfeng Yanhun

64
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,200
Jia Yaozu

65
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,759
Didn't expect you, always living it up,

66
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,559
to be so skilled in summoning spirits.

67
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,320
Even better than your brother back then.

68
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,679
You flatter me, Mr. Shen.

69
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,000
It's rare for our three families to gather.

70
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,399
No day like today.

71
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,600
How about I host tonight?

72
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,200
I know a good KTV place.

73
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,200
Especially the girls there.

74
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,799
I'm too old to enjoy that.

75
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,799
Gentlemen,

76
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
since we're defying the Sovereign today,

77
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,600
Whew.

78
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,559
All right.

79
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,320
Mr. Shen,

80
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,759
I, Jia Yaozu,

81
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,879
am no gentleman.

82
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,080
But I've seen enough pretenders.

83
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,679
Your Sovereign also said

84
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,320
hypocrisy is the greatest sin.

85
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,120
Deceit is the devil's greatest power.

86
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,360
Whoever uses the Sovereign's name

87
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,200
to make others betray the Sovereign,

88
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,200
or in the name of freedom

89
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,440
makes others give up freedom,

90
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,679
that person

91
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,879
is the devil.

92
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,799
May the Sovereign protect you.

93
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,080
The Sovereign

94
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,799
has fooled me plenty.

95
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,159
Madam Tang,

96
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,399
how about you and I get together instead?

97
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,600
No need.

98
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,120
Old people are sly, old horses are slick.

99
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,200
You only take one.

100
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
I have to take two.
