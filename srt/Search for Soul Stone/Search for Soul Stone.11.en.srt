1
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,439
What if I insist on going in?

2
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,960
All right.

3
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,399
You can't win against them.

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,920
Let Madam Tang come in.

5
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,040
Sorry, Madam Tang.

6
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,920
In this outfit,

7
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,239
it's not convenient to greet you.

8
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,040
Would you like a drink?

9
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,359
Where's Jia Yuer?

10
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,359
No idea.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,359
My niece—

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,400
I can't control her.

13
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,359
She and Meng Yan broke into our Tang family.

14
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,000
They took Yu Yan away.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,159
What does that have to do with me?

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,359
The young ones' business—

17
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,480
I never interfere.

18
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,599
I suggest you do the same.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,599
At their age,

20
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,359
they're especially rebellious.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,920
Shen Tianyi has his eyes on Meng Yan.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
Aren't you worried they're with Meng Yan?

23
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,200
Worried.

24
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,599
Of course I'm worried.

25
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,760
I think what Madam Tang fears most

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,439
is probably Shen Tianyi.

27
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,199
Tell your daughter what happened back then.

28
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,159
Speaking of that—

29
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,639
Jia family head, you must share my pain.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,759
Aren't you afraid of Jia Yuer?

31
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,840
What should I be afraid of?

32
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,680
Six years ago,

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,400
I wasn't even in Myanmar.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,599
All those dirty things my brother did—

35
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,439
what do they have to do with me?

36
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
They don't.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,319
But if your niece finds out,

38
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,000
will she trust her playboy uncle

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
and what he says?

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,759
If Meng Yan finds out

41
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,240
what your brother did back then,

42
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,800
can he forgive Jia Yuer?

43
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,879
What exactly do you want?

44
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm going to find Shen Tianyi.

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,479
Take care of yourself.

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,719
Why are you looking for him?

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
To beg him.

48
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,479
In these Shen family files,

49
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,319
there's no info on the Gifted.

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,719
Why not pull that cloth aside and look?

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh.

52
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,159
These are all from the past few years—

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,759
the Shen family info we've found.

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,360
By the way—

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,599
What exactly is Shen Tianyi's power?

56
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,599
No one knows Shen Tianyi's Gifted power—

57
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,680
what it really is.

58
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,680
We only know he's extremely strong.

59
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,639
My mom once said

60
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,599
even if she gave it her all,

61
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,599
she could only fight Shen Tianyi to a draw.

62
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,159
And it's strange—

63
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,400
Shen Tianyi's appearance—

64
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,400
I've seen him since I was little until now,

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,599
and he hasn't changed at all.

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,879
He should be,

67
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,719
by now, over sixty.

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,360
No matter how young he looks,

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,400
he should have some gray hair.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,159
But now he looks

71
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,560
just over forty.

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I've seen him since I was a kid,

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,759
and his looks truly haven't changed.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
It's really strange.

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Also, look at this—

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,519
the address Shen Jingshi left behind.

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,240
It's a Jadeite Factory owned by the Shen family.

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
And the location—

79
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,879
it's right here.

80
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,279
Every day, jadeite rough stones from the mine

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,680
are shipped here.

82
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,480
And it also has

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,000
a jadeite exhibition hall.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
This place is crucial for the Shen family.

85
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,720
So I suspect

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,120
there must be guards.

87
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,519
Maybe even Gifted people.

88
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,240
If we want to get in,

89
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,480
it won't be easy.

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,800
Transporting these rough stones—

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
they must use big trucks.

92
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,600
Then we can hide in a truck

93
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,680
and sneak inside.

94
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,759
Exactly.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,680
So,

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,079
let's go now.

97
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,000
Even if we can't get in,

98
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
we can at least scout it out.

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,399
Okay.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,639
Wait a second.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,319
Then—

102
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
what about Xiao Duo?

103
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,519
This is so dangerous—

104
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,759
Xiao Duo definitely can't go.

105
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,399
Let's wait until she's asleep.

106
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,160
Wait for her to sleep.

107
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,399
Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,399
When will she ever fall asleep?

109
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,399
Just wait.

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
If she doesn't finish her movie,

111
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,480
she won't sleep.

112
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
No—

113
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,800
The jadeite mine owner delivers jadeite

114
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,480
only from 11 to 1 a.m.

115
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,120
We're running out of time.

116
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:53,800
I don't care.

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,040
Within one hour,

118
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,959
make her sleep.

119
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,839
I—

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,959
Can't you just

121
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,680
use your power to make her sleep?

122
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
No, I can't.

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
At a time like this,

124
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,759
I still have to save someone.

125
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,480
It's not the time to worry about details.

126
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,399
It's just making her sleep—

127
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,720
not hurting her.

128
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,959
It's not that I don't want to.

129
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,279
It's—

130
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,639
I just can't do it.

131
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,920
I told you before,

132
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,720
Xiao Duo's situation is very strange.

133
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,560
With a Gifted person,

134
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,800
when I try to control their mind,

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,279
I feel a strong resistance.

136
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
But with Xiao Duo,

137
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,399
I don't feel any of that.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
I can only read what she wants to tell me.

139
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,319
But I—

140
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,680
can't control her mind.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,319
Can't read her heart, either.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,199
It's like—

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,279
reaching your hand into water,

144
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,439
and grabbing a handful.

145
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,319
Gentle Mom is online now!

146
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,319
Hey, Fourth.

147
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,600
Why are you so late?

148
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,120
Sister Xiaoduo is telling you—

149
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,079
Kids really should go to bed early.

150
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,399
But he can help me make money.

151
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:01,879
So, what do you think?

152
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,480
You're getting senile.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,079
Who do you think you are?

154
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,959
You dare set up a table here?

155
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
Don't think that just because you're—

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,399
Kids really should sleep early.

157
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,600
Otherwise, your health will—

158
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,959
That's a total jerk move.

159
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,360
You know that?

160
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,519
And you said you wanted to be loud.

161
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,480
I swear I want to smack you.

162
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,720
A gentle mom.

163
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,199
What do you mean?

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,079
I'm not gentle enough?

165
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,759
Meng Xiaoduo just can't speak.

166
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,319
She's not stupid.

167
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,120
She can tell if you're real or faking.

168
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,480
You think I'm faking it?

169
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,120
Fine.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,680
I want to see how much better Tang Yuyan is than me.

171
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,800
How long does it take her to get Xiaoduo to sleep?

172
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,519
Shh.

173
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,199
She's asleep.

174
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,879
How did you do that?

175
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,040
Maybe—

176
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm just gentler, I guess.

177
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,680
The raw stones they sent—

178
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,199
Don't seem special at all.

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Meng Yan, can you sense any Soulstone inside?

180
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,480
It's very faint.

181
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,600
Almost none at all.

182
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,000
Logically speaking—

183
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,559
The Shen family already controls—

184
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,799
all the jadeite mines.

185
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,879
The raw stones they bring in—

186
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,000
should be carefully selected.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,720
Sending in such low-grade stones—

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,279
I don't know what they're for.

189
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,399
It's late tonight.

190
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,639
I went to the gas station earlier.

191
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,200
Somehow, I fell asleep.

192
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Hello.

193
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,200
The number you dialed can't be reached.

194
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,159
Huh?

195
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,480
What's that noise behind us?

196
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,919
I didn't hear anything.

197
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,240
No sound at all.

198
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,759
Open it, let me see.

199
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,720
I didn't hear anything either.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,919
Open it and check.

201
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,360
I think you misheard.

202
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,399
There's nothing here.

203
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,000
Let them through.

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,919
This place is so important—

205
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,399
and we got in so easily.

206
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,080
There's a power reaction to the east.

207
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,279
Shen Jingshi might be there.

208
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Let's go.

209
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,519
It's not just one.

210
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
It's three.

211
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,519
Three?

212
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,960
How is that possible?

213
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,120
The Gifted.

214
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,480
Even for the Shen family—

215
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,279
that's rare.

216
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
Just this factory—

217
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,399
has three of them?

218
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,519
Unless—

219
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,799
Shen Jingshi already knew we were coming.

220
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,399
Keep a close eye on them.

221
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,080
Report their positions to me at all times.

222
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:39,919
Yes.

223
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
So what if they know?

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,759
Wipe them all out.

225
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,600
You—

226
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,279
Are these three places far apart?

227
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,120
East, west, north.

228
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,679
Three directions.

229
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,399
Each is a bit far from the others.

230
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,159
If we move together—

231
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,200
we could get surrounded.

232
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,960
We might not get another chance.

233
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,600
I think it's better if we split up.

234
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,600
But splitting us up—

235
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,600
might be exactly what Shen Jingshi wants.

236
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,000
No way.

237
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,399
We absolutely can't—

238
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,639
repeat what happened with Jin Zhenghao.

239
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,000
Lean your head over.

240
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,440
What for?

241
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,440
Close your eyes.
