1
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,359
Shen Tianyi has lost his Soulstone

2
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,200
His body is rapidly aging

3
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,280
Now what he wants most is you

4
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,240
And this is also your best chance

5
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,920
Actually I've never understood

6
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,040
You so devoutly believe in your Lord

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,519
Yet when we struggle like ants

8
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,799
Fighting desperately to survive

9
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,159
What exactly is your Lord doing?

10
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,200
Suffering

11
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,840
Makes one question if they took the wrong path

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,280
But can also guide them back

13
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
The Lord

14
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,599
Will wipe away their tears

15
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,640
There'll be no more death

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,040
Nor sorrow

17
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,480
Crying

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,359
Or pain

19
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,280
For the former things have

20
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,560
Passed away

21
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,959
Those not in the Tome of Destinies

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,400
Shall be cast into the fiery lake

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
It seems Mr. Meng

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,960
Is quite familiar with scripture

25
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,199
In my days of suffering

26
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,479
I swore to heaven

27
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,599
I'd destroy the wicked with my own hands

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,800
Turn their laughter to weeping

29
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,039
Reduce their strongholds to ashes

30
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,280
How many do we have now?

31
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,080
Miss

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,199
Counting all in the Jia household

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,680
Twenty-three remain

34
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,199
Summon them all

35
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,000
Even the kitchen helpers?

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,800
Did I stutter? Everyone means everyone!

37
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,639
Why look at him?

38
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,759
I'm in charge here

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,719
Yuer

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,560
Enough

41
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,000
You're coming too

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
When everyone's gathered

43
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,039
We storm Shen's house together

44
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,000
Agreed

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
We'll follow your lead

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,039
Why so quick to agree?

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,319
Meng Yan's a good boy

48
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,280
And most importantly

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
He's my future nephew-in-law

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,439
If I won't save my own kin

51
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,439
What kind of uncle would I be?

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
What nonsense!

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
You kept this from me so long

54
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,319
I haven't settled with you yet

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,639
After we save Meng Yan

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,560
We'll settle accounts then

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Why so few of you?

58
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,159
Where are the rest?

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
From now on

60
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,759
Keep Yuer securely at home

61
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,560
If she escapes

62
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,039
I'll hold you responsible

63
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,719
Jia Yaozu

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,039
What are you doing?

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,960
Jia Yaozu, you jerk!

66
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,960
Sorry Yuer

67
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,039
The older generation's business

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,240
Should stay with them

69
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,079
What do you mean?

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,399
Jia Yaozu

71
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,160
Jia Yaozu, what are you doing?

72
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,000
Come back!

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,600
Jia Yaozu, stop this!

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,399
Let me go!

75
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,600
Jia Yaozu

76
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,240
So I'm being locked up again?

77
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,680
I can't watch you march to your death

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,000
I know you're worried

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
But Meng Yan...

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,360
I'll keep him safe

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,399
You have my word

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,839
Then be careful, mother

83
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,720
Are you certain, Madam Tang?

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,399
Entering here today

85
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,399
Against Shen Tianyi

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
Means fight to the death

87
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,959
Are you afraid?

88
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,160
I do fear

89
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,759
Never seeing your graceful self again

90
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,879
Then let's turn back

91
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,160
We're already here

92
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,079
You...

93
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,639
All your abilities and progress

94
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,519
Have been under my control

95
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,279
Don't be arrogant, Meng Yan

96
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,240
Our understanding of power

97
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,399
Was never the same

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,199
Let me show you

99
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,199
What true power is

100
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,079
You

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
The means you've employed

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,600
to surpass and defeat me

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,519
are proof of your efforts and strength

104
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,759
And those very means

105
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,800
represent the measure of your hope

106
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,040
What I shall do now

107
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,199
is utterly crush that hope

108
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,160
Dust to be swept away

109
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,319
whether one speck or two

110
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,240
makes no difference

111
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,240
to the eye

112
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,079
The two family heads visiting Shen Manor

113
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,959
Shen failed to properly receive you

114
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,480
I came today

115
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,000
to settle accounts

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,639
with the Shen family

117
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:17,879
Father

118
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,040
Mother

119
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,040
Where are you?

120
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,800
Father

121
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,279
Mother

122
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,959
Yan'er

123
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,960
We must leave now

124
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,799
Where are you going?

125
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,559
Yan'er

126
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,399
Your mother and I

127
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,039
never wanted you in the Gifted's world

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,200
Yet you've walked this path regardless

129
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
We meant to let you grow naturally

130
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
But seeing you suffer each time

131
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,559
our hearts would cry out

132
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,679
and waver

133
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,240
leaning toward

134
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
helping you gain greater power

135
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,960
rather than stopping you becoming Gifted

136
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,200
Yan'er

137
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,679
You've grown strong

138
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,840
So even as we depart

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,879
we rejoice for you

140
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,639
We've always been by your side

141
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,200
watching you grow

142
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
and were truly happy

143
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,559
Yan'er

144
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,039
We are content

145
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,679
Father

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,360
Mother

147
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,919
Father

148
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,240
Mother

149
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,159
Father

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,480
Mother

151
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Never

152
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
has anyone stood above

153
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,200
Shen Tianyi

154
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,600
Not the Tangs

155
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,799
nor the Jias

156
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,279
Not even the Mengs

157
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,200
Madam Tang

158
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,720
Continuing like this

159
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,840
we'll all be exhausted to death

160
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,360
Now

161
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,320
there's only one way

162
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,159
What way?

163
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,720
We release all our spiritual energy

164
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,320
to breach his power's limits

165
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,600
and make him explode

166
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,600
Agreed

167
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,279
We'll perish together

168
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
Now!
