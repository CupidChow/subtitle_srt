1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,799
No.

2
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,359
We absolutely must not

3
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,000
repeat what happened with Jin Zhenghao.

4
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,039
Lean your head over here.

5
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,399
What for?

6
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,399
Close your eyes.

7
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,640
Don't mess around in our heads.

8
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,560
Remember,

9
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,719
I'll leave something in your minds—

10
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,760
a mark.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,799
A mark?

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,799
Yes.

13
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,239
You can think of it as a beacon.

14
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,560
I can sense the location of spiritual power.

15
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,239
And I can contact you anytime.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,000
Got it.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
It's like a global satellite system

18
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,560
with radio communication.

19
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,760
This thing of yours—

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,200
it can't stay in our heads forever.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,599
I don't want you spying on me.

22
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,400
I don't have time for that.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,439
That's enough.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,959
Everyone, be careful.

25
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,040
Especially you.

26
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,200
Sir, Madam Tang is here.

27
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,439
Madam Tang walks lightly,

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,799
still graceful as ever.

29
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,760
Visiting me alone at night—

30
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,599
aren't you afraid of gossip?

31
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,879
The Tang family's treasure—

32
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,280
you've finally brought it out.

33
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,879
If I'm not mistaken,

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,599
Mr. Shen will make a move on Meng Yan tonight.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,319
The Sovereign

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,240
will be very pleased with your devotion.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,759
Mr. Shen,

38
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,080
playing riddles now is pointless.

39
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,800
I don't care what you plan for Meng Yan,

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
nor do I want to know.

41
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,840
But please,

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,280
don't involve my daughter.

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,879
Yuyan

44
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,439
is a good girl.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,000
But the Sovereign is just.

46
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,400
Whatever he allows

47
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,240
has its reasons.

48
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,199
If Yuyan insists on getting involved,

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,360
that's her own choice.

50
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,960
Shen Tianyi,

51
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,800
you know very well

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,960
I've endured all these years

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
for a reason.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
As a reasonable person,

55
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,039
I'm willing to seek a peaceful solution

56
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,639
for Madam Tang's request.

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,120
As for Jin Zhenghao,

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,599
I can let it go.

59
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,159
I can blame it all on Meng Yan.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,439
But this time, Yuyan must return safely.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
Like Mr. Shen,

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm also superstitious.

63
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,039
If anything happens to Yuyan—

64
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,560
like getting hit by a car,

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
or struck by a meteor—

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll hold responsible

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
everyone in the Shen Family Compound.

68
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,560
I won't be polite then.

69
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,439
The path of the stubborn is full of thorns and snares.

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,879
To protect your life, you must stay away.

71
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,399
Raise a child

72
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,279
to walk the right path.

73
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,160
Even when he's old,

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,160
he won't stray from it.

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,360
Let's go.

76
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,600
Hurry up.

77
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:25,800
Yuyan,

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,240
it's that direction.

79
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,519
Keep going further in.

80
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,480
Be careful.

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,240
Yuyan.

82
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
You're very close now.

83
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:48,800
Be cautious.

84
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,759
Watch ahead.

85
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,480
Yuer.

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,560
Your spiritual power hasn't moved.

87
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,399
I think working here is pretty safe.

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,360
I agree.

89
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,079
Where do we go next?

90
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
What's on your right?

91
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,439
On my right—

92
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,120
there are lots of paintings.

93
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,360
Yes.

94
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,399
That's the place.

95
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,399
Keep going further in.

96
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,519
Be very careful.

97
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,040
Ade.

98
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,399
I've found Ade.

99
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,839
Ade.

100
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,639
Ade.

101
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
How is he?

102
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,680
He's covered in wounds.

103
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,639
And he's unconscious.

104
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,079
Wait.

105
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
Yuer.

106
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,759
The spiritual power near you is moving.

107
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,199
Miss!

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,879
Quick!

109
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,399
Run!

110
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,240
Yuer!

111
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,399
Jia Yuer!

112
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,720
What's wrong?

113
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,120
I think I heard something.

114
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
But I didn't see anyone.

115
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,000
Who?

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,279
Come out!

117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,879
Smells so good.

118
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,600
Despicable!

119
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,799
Show yourself and fight me if you dare!

120
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,759
Yuyan.

121
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,360
You're already nearby.

122
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,600
Get ready to fight.

123
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,600
I heard the young master say

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
you can control shadows.

125
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,320
Stop!

126
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,240
Too bad—

127
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,360
what shadows look like,

128
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,200
I can't see at all.

129
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,399
Maybe I can hear them.

130
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,039
Can you let me hear the sound of shadows?

131
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,840
If you don't stop now,

132
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,919
I'll have to act.

133
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,360
You rely too much on your eyes,

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,600
and lose the innate

135
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
extraordinary perception you have.

136
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,799
Now,

137
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
let's see what you do.

138
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,600
How are you all doing?

139
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,600
Can you hear me?

140
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,919
Say something!

141
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,559
Yuyan.

142
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,000
Yuer.

143
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,519
No, that's not right.

144
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,360
All the sensing is gone.

145
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,960
My ability—

146
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,799
is gone.

147
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,200
For J—

148
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,879
Should I?

149
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,600
No.

150
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,759
Your minds

151
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,200
are filled with more and more worries

152
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,600
Your hearts

153
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,639
are crowded with all kinds of desires

154
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,120
You've lost the innocence of childhood

155
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,600
the purity

156
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,240
and sensitivity

157
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
Your perception is growing numb

158
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,000
and will eventually lose

159
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
the sixth sense you once had
