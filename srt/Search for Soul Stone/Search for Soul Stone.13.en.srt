1
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,280
What a pity.

2
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,920
Despicable.

3
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,159
If you have guts, show yourself
and fight me.

4
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,799
What?

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,159
So using my power is despicable,

6
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,239
but using a gun

7
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
is considered fair?

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Jerk.

9
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,200
You jerk.

10
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,879
Let go of me!

11
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,879
Jerk, let go of me!

12
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,200
Miss, let's go.

13
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,360
Ade.

14
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,520
Ade.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,919
They...

16
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,080
When the gang was slaughtered,

17
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,840
I couldn't

18
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,960
help my brothers.

19
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,960
I brought shame to the gang.

20
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm going down now.

21
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,000
They won't blame me, right?

22
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,520
No.

23
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,360
No.

24
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,639
Meng Yan.

25
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
Can you hear me?

26
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,080
What's happening on your side?

27
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,280
I'm fine.

28
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,479
Ade is dead.

29
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,759
By the way, Meng Yan,

30
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
why couldn't I hear you just now?

31
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,479
I don't know.

32
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,000
My power suddenly vanished earlier.

33
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,360
How is that possible?

34
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,680
I think

35
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,400
there's something in this factory

36
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,439
we don't know about.

37
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,720
Meng Yan.

38
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,279
It seems there are others here

39
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,120
besides us.

40
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:22,680
Yuyan.

41
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,160
Yuyan.

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,839
So that's it.

43
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,519
So that's what?

44
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,199
No wonder, with my father's power,

45
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,800
he was defeated by you all.

46
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,480
Explain further.

47
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,480
I guess

48
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,600
your power

49
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,759
is to make powers around you disappear.

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,040
Is that right?

51
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,600
I just want everyone

52
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
to start on equal footing.

53
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,879
Equal footing.

54
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,480
You turn powered people into ordinary ones,

55
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,120
then outnumber them to win.

56
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,079
If a powered person

57
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,399
loses their power,

58
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,639
they're at your mercy.

59
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,399
How is that different from being useless?

60
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,240
Looks like

61
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,160
everything today

62
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,040
was all part of your plan.

63
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,800
I think

64
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,920
the mind

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,040
is the strongest power.

66
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,079
The Azure Dragon Gang had no grudge with you.

67
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,319
Why did you kill them?

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,279
They were just in my way.

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Whenever I'm in a good mood

70
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,319
and want to do something,

71
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,399
they run around in front of me.

72
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,600
Running around.

73
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,680
Or show up in my sight.

74
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,399
I can't help but want to catch them,

75
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,519
kick them one by one.

76
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,920
Kick them one by one.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,199
Just thinking about it makes me feel great.

78
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,959
If your power is really that strong,

79
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
why wait until now to act?

80
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,399
Because my uncle

81
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,040
taught me to forgive others.

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,680
Or maybe

83
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,800
your power

84
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,480
has some fatal flaws.

85
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,439
Oh?

86
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,839
Let's hear it.

87
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,040
Your first flaw

88
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,519
is range.

89
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,800
Your range

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,199
probably only covers the factory.

91
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
No.

92
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,439
That's not right.

93
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,639
It can't even cover this exhibition hall.

94
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,240
Your second flaw

95
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,839
is time.

96
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,399
To use your power,

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,120
you need some time to activate it.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
Otherwise, with your personality,

99
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,680
you wouldn't have waited this long.

100
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,040
Of course,

101
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
as the Shen family's heir,

102
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,800
to fix these two flaws,

103
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,480
you can use your resources and money.

104
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,160
Now, your third flaw.

105
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,319
Because of this,

106
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,560
you split the three of us up on purpose.

107
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,639
Especially Jia Yuer.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,680
What are you most afraid of now?

109
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,600
That's right.

110
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,040
It's guns.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,519
Yuer.

112
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,079
Hey.

113
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,240
Can you hear me?

114
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,240
What happened just now?

115
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,120
No time to explain.

116
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:51,959
Meet at the corridor.

117
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:52,759
Hurry!

118
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,000
What's going on over there?

119
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,040
Seems there are others here.

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,279
Not from the Shen family.

121
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,839
He helped me.

122
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,199
What do we do now?

123
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's get out first.

124
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,040
We can't get out.

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
Meng Yan, oh Meng Yan,

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,839
aren't you good at running?

127
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,800
Let me see now

128
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,720
how you'll run.

129
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,680
Shen Jingshi.

130
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,240
What grudge do you have against me?

131
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,519
Why wipe out my Azure Dragon Gang?

132
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,679
It's not like I did it on purpose.

133
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,000
My condolences.

134
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,919
My men are all rough.

135
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,639
They made a mess of your Azure Dragon Gang.

136
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,600
Didn't even clean up for you.

137
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,840
Sorry about that.

138
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,799
Yuer.

139
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,440
Yuer.

140
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,000
How is that possible?

141
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,159
Controlling the powers of powered people—

142
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,799
that's Shen Jingshi's power.

143
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,759
I didn't expect this.

144
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,919
I actually lost to a kid.

145
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,639
Meng Yan.

146
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,639
The look on your face right now—

147
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,240
is exactly like your father's back then.

148
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,480
You bastard.

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
Let go.

150
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,240
Let go.

151
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,120
The Meng family couldn't beat us before.

152
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,200
Now and in the future, it's the same.

153
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,600
If the heads of the Tang and Jia families

154
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,240
knew you were so rude to us,

155
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,440
Shen Jingshi—

156
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,440
do you know what would happen?

157
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,879
I—

158
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
I wasn't rude to your families.

159
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,240
Besides,

160
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,600
who saw it?

161
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,240
Did you see it?

162
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,000
Or did you see it?

163
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
But then again,

164
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,879
no wall can keep secrets forever.

165
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,799
Dead people—

166
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,639
are better at keeping secrets.

167
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,120
Xiao Duo.

168
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,840
Why can't my power suppress her?

169
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,240
Xiao Duo.

170
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
Xiao Duo.

171
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,440
Brother.
