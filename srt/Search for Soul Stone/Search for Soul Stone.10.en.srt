1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,799
Your Azure Dragon Gang

2
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,079
Have you made any enemies lately?

3
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,280
I get it.

4
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,799
I get it.

5
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,000
Are you messing with me?

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,799
Aren't you?

7
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,000
I already know.

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,120
Stop pretending.

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,799
It's not funny.

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Not funny at all.

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,599
Get up.

12
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,319
Wake up.

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,359
Get up.

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
So boring.

15
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,760
Keep this up and I'll kill you, believe it or not.

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,599
Get up.

17
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,599
Believe I'll—

18
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,000
Yuer.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,239
Yuer, calm down.

20
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,200
Let go.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,560
It's all your fault.

22
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,599
It's because of you.

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
If you hadn't

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,400
left without a word back then,

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,319
I wouldn't have started the Azure Dragon Gang.

26
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,799
If I hadn't formed the Azure Dragon Gang,

27
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,280
the brothers wouldn't have died.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,000
They wouldn't have died.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,280
I understand now.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,120
We're in this together.

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
You all teamed up to trick me.

32
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,680
I get it.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,439
Get up.

34
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,879
Hurry, get up.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,039
Is there surveillance here?

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Yes.

37
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,120
Who is this person?

38
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,680
Shen Jingshi.

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,800
I knew this

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,120
was tied to the Shen family.

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,000
Who is Shen Jingshi?

42
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,080
The sole heir of the Shen family.

43
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,520
But I heard

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,599
he doesn't have any Power.

45
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,280
Where are you going?

46
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,919
I'm going to bring Ade back.

47
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
Find Shen Jingshi and avenge our brothers.

48
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,400
We don't stand a chance.

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,599
We need another ally.

50
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,280
For what?

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
To find your young lady.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Open the door.

53
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,039
Sorry.

54
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,759
No unauthorized entry allowed.

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,479
What's wrong?

56
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,560
You don't even recognize me now?

57
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,960
The master gave orders.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
Especially about Miss Jia.

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,800
No entry allowed.

60
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,199
So if that's the case,

61
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,280
she can't go in,

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,599
does that mean I can?

63
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,400
You're unauthorized.

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,360
You—

65
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,199
Fine.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,080
Then we won't go in.

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,879
Go get Tang Yuyan.

68
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,400
Tell her I'm waiting at the door.

69
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,400
Miss isn't feeling well.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,199
She's resting.

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,280
She can't see guests.

72
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
You're really stubborn.

73
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,680
I don't care, I'm going in.

74
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,960
Sorry.

75
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,159
The master gave orders.

76
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,520
Please don't make things hard for us.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,960
What if I refuse?

78
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,919
Sorry, Miss Jia.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We don't want this either.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,919
Please leave.

81
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,480
I don't buy it.

82
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,959
The master gave orders.

83
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,600
Please don't interfere with my work.

84
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,000
Please leave at once.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,720
The master will be back soon.

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,000
It's strange,

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,199
I could always enter the Tang house before.

88
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,480
Why is Madam Tang

89
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
not letting me see Yuyan today?

90
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,839
Second Uncle said yesterday

91
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,600
Madam Tang sent us back.

92
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,800
Did you see it?

93
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,199
Is Jin Zhenghao dead?

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
Then Shen Tianyi came with people.

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,519
Jin Zhenghao was killed by him.

96
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,560
Then he knocked me out too.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,399
I don't remember anything after that.

98
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,480
Feels like your Power has grown.

99
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
You can control more people at once now.

100
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,639
But why do you always

101
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,720
have to bring Xiaoduo with you?

102
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,600
You can't even handle yourself.

103
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,800
Why not leave her with my second uncle?

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't do that.

105
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
Your uncle's a middle-aged playboy.

106
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,199
If you really leave her with him,

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,759
he's never home.

108
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,079
Who'd look after Xiaoduo?

109
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,879
But it's tiring for her to run with us.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,759
Besides,

111
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,000
she can't really help.

112
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,600
She's mad.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,879
What did she say?

114
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Probably cursed pretty badly.

115
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,519
Who is it?

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,720
Who is it?

117
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:51,879
Let me tell you something.

118
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,800
No matter who you are,

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,000
open the door for me right now.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,879
Did you hear me?

121
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,839
Don't think that staying silent

122
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,800
means I don't know who you are.

123
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,959
Once I get out of here,

124
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,600
I'll check the cameras to see who you are.

125
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,040
Didn't expect our Miss Tang

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,879
to go out wearing a mask.

127
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,600
Sister Yuer.

128
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,120
Miss, we're here to rescue you.

129
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:12,759
We—

130
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,519
Meng Yan is here too.

131
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,800
Yuyan, I'm here.

132
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,199
My mom locked the door from outside.

133
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,120
I can't get out.

134
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,199
Can't you control shadows?

135
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,639
My mom took away all the lights

136
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,600
from inside here.

137
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
No shadows can appear.

138
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,000
Do the servants have a key?

139
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,399
I don't know.

140
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,600
Hey.

141
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,720
What are you doing?

142
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,600
We're here to pick someone up,

143
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,000
not to rob the place.

144
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,959
Then what do you suggest?

145
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,720
Let's split up and search.

146
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,519
Check if other servants

147
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,680
have a spare key.

148
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,000
The Tang house is so big,

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
with so many servants.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,759
If you check one by one,

151
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,800
Madam Tang will be back.

152
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,079
Stop talking nonsense.

153
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,959
Don't fire a gun in someone else's house.

154
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
No choice, it's for survival.

155
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,160
Yuer.

156
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,600
Meng Yan.

157
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,560
Why are you all here?

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,079
Yuyan.

159
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,560
Something happened to the Azure Dragon Gang.

160
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,879
What happened?

161
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,639
Madam.

162
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,840
I only remember that kid

163
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,559
came with the Jia family's young lady.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,159
There was another girl with them.

165
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,600
I just remember they tried to force their way in.

166
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,559
We kept trying to stop them.

167
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,879
But what happened after that,

168
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,200
I can't remember at all.

169
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,320
I failed in my duty.

170
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,600
Please punish me, Madam.

171
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,279
We've been busy in the house all along,

172
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,279
but really didn't see them at all.

173
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,679
It's really strange.

174
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,720
Forget it.

175
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,039
This isn't your fault.

176
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,679
Madam Tang.

177
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,679
Mr. Shen.

178
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,759
What brings you here?

179
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,919
I'd like to ask Madam Tang

180
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,879
if you're planning to hand over Meng Yan—

181
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't know where he is.

182
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,679
Yuyan should know, right?

183
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
He took Yuyan away.

184
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,399
If you see him, Mr. Shen,

185
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,440
please tell him to stay away from Yuyan.

186
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,480
Sorry to bother you, Madam Tang.

187
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,159
Prepare the car. We're going to the Jia house.

188
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,559
Yes, Madam.

189
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
Uncle.

190
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,519
All of this is part of my plan.

191
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,799
To defeat Jin Zhenghao—

192
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,759
he's not as weak as you think.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,279
I'll capture him alive for sure.

194
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,679
Mianhuatang, come here.

195
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,200
This is my own place.

196
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,759
It's a bit small,

197
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,000
but enough for a few of us to stay.

198
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,039
No.

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,840
Both of you have such big houses,

200
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,360
so why do you insist on

201
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,440
making your own little space?

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Nonsense.

203
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,519
What girl

204
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,879
doesn't have her own little secret?

205
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,159
Xiaoduo.

206
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,240
You're still young.

207
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,399
If anything happens, tell your brother.

208
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,080
Don't lie to me.

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,879
Do you hear me?

210
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,480
You know,

211
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,159
you're not that old,

212
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,279
but you sure act like a dad.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,399
You—

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,720
Xiaoduo.

215
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,159
We need to talk about something.

216
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,519
Go to the bedroom first.

217
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,960
Play with Mianhuatang for a while, okay?

218
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,519
Go on, come here.

219
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,200
Madam Tang.

220
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:24,879
Step aside.

221
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,360
Sorry, Madam Tang.

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
Our master is already resting.

223
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,000
What if I insist on going in?

224
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,519
One zero two.

225
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,200
The Tang family head is forcing her way in.

226
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,039
Request immediate backup.
