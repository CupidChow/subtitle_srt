1
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,000
The way you judge others behind their backs

2
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,479
is how you will be judged by them.

3
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,240
Where is it?

4
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,479
Right here.

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,159
Qiye.

6
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,840
There's still business to handle.

7
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,959
Mr. Shen is young and spirited.

8
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,799
As for me,

9
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,439
I humbly admit defeat.

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,959
It's been years since we met.

11
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,560
Mr. Shen, you remain as imposing as ever.

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,719
Xie Laoqi.

13
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,239
You still value punctuality.

14
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,519
Mr. Shen, you know

15
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,439
time means everything to me.

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,159
It is everything.

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,879
I'll be brief.

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,879
Back then, the Meng family—

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,519
the child who escaped

20
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,719
has resurfaced.

21
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,840
Oh.

22
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,480
With your skills, Mr. Shen,

23
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,840
do you even need my help?

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,159
If it were just Meng Yan,

25
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,719
I'd handle it myself.

26
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,879
But now,

27
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,879
the Tang and Jia heirs

28
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,359
are involved too.

29
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,040
From what you say,

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,599
does Mr. Shen

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
still fear those two families?

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,719
I'm getting old.

33
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,960
If I want to step on an ant

34
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,439
without crushing it,

35
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,879
the force required

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,159
is hard for me to control.

37
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,000
I know

38
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,000
you're a perfectionist.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
You came to the Mengs to wipe them out,

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
with me, back then.

41
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,240
But one slipped away.

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,479
That must've bothered you all these years.

43
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,879
Help me,

44
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,159
and you'll help yourself too.

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,520
The old are always wiser.

46
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,280
You've calculated everything perfectly.

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,319
Also,

48
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,879
I know your methods, Qiye.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,120
If Meng Yan falls into your hands,

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,319
he won't die easily.

51
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,240
I hope, Qiye,

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,879
before you finish him,

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,719
let me see him first.

54
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,240
I have questions for him myself.

55
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,439
I'll follow your orders, Mr. Shen.

56
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,560
Just as well,

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,879
I want to have some fun too.

58
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,879
Meng Yan.

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,080
Where is he now?

60
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,479
At the Jia house.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,280
Other Gifted

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,759
gain power from the Soulstone in jade

63
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,759
to obtain spiritual energy.

64
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,040
They use it to boost their Gifted rank.

65
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,800
But we

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,639
grow stronger by raising our mental strength.

67
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,560
That's how we enhance our power.

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,439
True mental breakthroughs

69
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,639
happen in the emotional void.

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
When emotions surge and break the limits,

71
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,560
the Heart Realm opens.

72
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,600
Hey.

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,879
Why are their watches

74
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,240
fifteen minutes slow?

75
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,439
Summoning the spirits.

76
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,839
Didn't expect northern shaman arts

77
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,480
to show up here in Myanmar.

78
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,279
To channel the Martial Saint—

79
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,920
you must've trained hard these years.

80
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,279
You've put in real effort.

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
What a pity.

82
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,279
Such a shame.

83
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,680
If you level up once more,

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,920
and summon a higher spirit,

85
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,279
maybe

86
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,519
I'd even

87
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,040
fear you a little.

88
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,759
But now,

89
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,480
you're just at my mercy.

90
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,480
In all the realms and elements,

91
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,839
no matter how strong you are,

92
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,279
who can defeat time itself?

93
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,439
And I am the one

94
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,879
who controls time.

95
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,199
You insolent fiend, spouting nonsense!

96
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,720
Jia Yaozu.

97
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,000
Bastard!

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,439
How does that feel?

99
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,560
Meng Yan.

100
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,839
Your father killed my cousin Fan Ba Ye.

101
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,680
This debt—

102
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,720
it's time we settled it.

103
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,639
Afraid?

104
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,000
Of course I'm afraid.

105
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,360
I think what Lady Tang fears most

106
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,439
is probably Shen Tianyi.

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Tell your daughter what happened back then.

108
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,720
If Tang Yuyan finds out

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,040
you're not her real mother,

110
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,439
but also her father's killer,

111
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,160
she

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,399
what will she think?

113
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,000
This is Tang Yuyan.

114
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,319
I'm unable to take your call now.

115
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,800
Please leave me a message.

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Sorry.

117
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Sorry to bother you.

118
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
You are—

119
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,759
I'm here to kill you.

120
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,440
Everything you've done

121
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,519
is meaningless.

122
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,399
Xie Laoqi.

123
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,840
Whose girl is this,

124
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,000
so rude?

125
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,519
Let's see who's faster, you or me.

126
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,279
Within seven steps, I'm the fastest.

127
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,639
Beyond seven steps—

128
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,799
I'm still the fastest.

129
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,799
I thought you were someone impressive.

130
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,480
Enough for Mr. Shen to ask me himself.

131
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,320
Turns out you're so easy to beat.

132
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,120
When did Qiye become Mr. Shen's lapdog?

133
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,720
No need to be so harsh.

134
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,759
Mr. Shen and I are just partners, nothing more.

135
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,480
If I hadn't heard Meng Yan was here,

136
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,799
I wouldn't have bothered coming.

137
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,639
Back then, Mr. Shen actually let you escape.

138
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,720
Let's see how you run this time.

139
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,440
What?

140
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,559
You were involved in my family's tragedy?

141
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,720
"Involved"?

142
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,639
That's a pretty mild way to put it.

143
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,559
Me, Xie Laoqi,

144
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,679
I'm not exactly humble.

145
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,960
Your father killed my brother, Fan Ba Ye.

146
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,519
So I paid him back with your whole family.

147
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,519
Tch.

148
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,279
Twisting the truth.

149
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,120
Even if Meng Yan's father killed Fan Ba Ye,

150
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,639
he was ridding the world of evil.

151
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,519
This little girl—

152
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Look at that face.

153
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,240
So pretty.

154
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,320
I wonder, in a moment,

155
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,559
if I slice up your face a bit,

156
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,279
then break your teeth

157
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,679
one by one,

158
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,639
and rip out your tongue,

159
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,639
let's see what you can say then.

160
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,240
And you—

161
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,279
Just look at yourself.

162
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,960
Such a fine figure.

163
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,360
Curves in all the right places.

164
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,720
Too bad your brain's fried.

165
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,799
You actually thought

166
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,000
you could use that useless thing

167
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,000
to take me on.

168
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,559
Think you can handle me?

169
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
Too bad my brother's gone.

170
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,799
These long legs of yours—

171
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,759
if I sliced off the flesh,

172
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,080
and grilled it piece by piece,

173
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,320
I wonder how tasty it'd be.

174
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,840
Mr. Shen said

175
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,919
I can kill anyone I want,

176
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,360
except for you.

177
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,039
He wants me to leave you alive.

178
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,639
But I,

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,879
you're the one I want dead most.

180
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,440
A son's debt for his father's sins.

181
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,240
I should carve you up,

182
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,799
slice the flesh from your body,

183
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,519
cut it all off,

184
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,000
make you wish you were dead.

185
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Screaming while you wait to die.

186
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,639
That would feel so good.

187
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,600
But unfortunately,

188
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,279
I, Xie Laoqi, keep my word.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,879
So I'll let you live.

190
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,320
But—

191
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,519
if you lose both arms,

192
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,919
