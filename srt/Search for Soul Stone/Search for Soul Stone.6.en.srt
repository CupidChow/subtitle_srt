1
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,560
This is exactly how I remember Meng Jia.

2
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:59,640
But hasn't the Meng Jia manor
been abandoned for years?

3
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
How is that possible?

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,519
Even the orchids I planted as a child...

5
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,799
Cheng Yi.

6
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,439
Master, Madam.

7
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,719
Yan is back.

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,519
Yan, you finally came home.

9
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,560
Cheng Yi...

10
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,439
You...

11
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,680
The Cheng Yi who cleaned the house?

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,480
She lost half her body...

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,359
Silly child.

14
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,359
Do you know

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,040
how worried they were
when you stayed away so long?

16
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,200
Master and Madam missed you so much.

17
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,680
Dad.

18
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,400
Mom.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,319
While you were gone,

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,319
Madam cried every day.

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Master was distracted all the time.

22
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,760
Thank goodness you're back.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,200
You came back at the right time.

24
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,439
Come inside, quickly.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,759
Do you remember?

26
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,520
Every year on your birthday,

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,560
we'd set a big table of food.

28
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,039
And your favorite fruit cake.

29
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,199
But you only ever ate the cake.

30
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,639
Happy birthday to you.

31
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,479
Happy birthday to you.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,439
Happy birthday to you.

33
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,479
How are things over there?

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,560
I feel uneasy.

35
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,199
Something's not right.

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,319
Don't act rashly.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Find Meng Yan and Xiao Duo first.

38
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,719
Happy birthday to you.

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,360
Yan.

40
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,360
Want to see your future?

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,960
Puppetmaster Toad.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,439
No matter what tricks you play,

43
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,599
it's time to end this.

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
Let's check the study, then.

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,840
Our Yan is about to be a college student.

46
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,599
It's his first time away for so long.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,960
If you need money, just tell us.

48
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,319
Don't hang out with shady people.

49
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,560
And also,

50
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,199
never show off Meng Jia's Power.

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,599
Understand?

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,080
Got it, Dad.

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,039
We didn't let you date before

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,080
because we worried about your studies.

55
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,599
Now in college, date as many as you want.

56
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,319
Don't be stingy.

57
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,360
Okay?

58
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,360
Dad, what are you saying?

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,519
This farce should end now.

60
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,160
Meng Yan.

61
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,040
They're all fake, all puppets.

62
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:27,959
I know.

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,360
Then you...

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,759
Don't rush.

65
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,759
Yuer, calm down first.

66
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,319
Give Meng Yan some time.

67
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,279
I'm here on this side.

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,079
Is there more?

69
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,319
What?

70
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,120
My life.

71
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Of course.

72
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,680
Who?

73
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,439
You move pretty fast.

74
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,879
Sorry.

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Really sorry about earlier.

76
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,279
Looks like you're clear-headed now.

77
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,519
Sister Yuer.

78
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,639
No one could stay calm in that situation.

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,639
But he knows I care about him,

80
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,720
yet he used Mind Control on me.

81
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,800
So ungrateful.

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,240
Thank you.

83
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
I thank you.

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,600
Why is he just like when he was little?

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
So clueless.

86
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,920
I know.

87
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,759
You must still blame me.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,240
Blame you for what?

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Blame me...

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,279
When you had trouble back then,

91
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,519
I didn't help you.

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,079
Life rarely goes as we wish.

93
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,480
But you could have, later.

94
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,480
No one compares to you.

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,839
When did you get so smooth-talking?

96
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,759
You lie without blushing.

97
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,000
Darn it, I'll check over there.

98
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,920
Then I'll go look too.

99
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,040
You know.

100
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
I know everything.

101
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,360
What do you know?

102
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,720
I can read minds.

103
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,480
Then do you know

104
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
what I'm thinking right now?

105
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,199
You're thinking

106
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
about things you shouldn't.

107
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
Be more specific.

108
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,680
You want to be with me...

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,120
I want to be with you...

110
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,160
Yuer.

111
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,000
Why are you doing this?

112
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,079
I wish what you said was all true.

113
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,120
And that you were real too.

114
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,439
Puppetmaster Toad.

115
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,879
You're right.

116
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,000
Life rarely goes as we wish.

117
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,759
Truly a son of Meng Jia.

118
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,000
So impressive.

119
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,600
Standing with his bride on stage today,

120
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,560
what a perfect couple.

121
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,879
From now on,

122
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,519
we have one more daughter.

123
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,759
Look how happy you are.

124
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,279
Didn't you always want a daughter?

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,840
Will I be that bride?

126
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,279
Our little Meng Yan has grown up.

127
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,000
A grown son can't be kept by his mother.

128
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,480
Once he has a family,

129
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,159
we'll see him less and less.

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,120
Dad.

131
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,919
Mom.

132
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,120
Meng Yan.

133
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Calm down.

134
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,080
None of this is real, it's an illusion.

135
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,720
No.

136
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,360
This is real.

137
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,679
It just never happened.

138
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,559
If not for Shen Tianyi,

139
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,440
I would have had a real life like this.

140
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
Together with my own parents.

141
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,279
Do you want to know what happened
that night?

142
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,600
Do you want to know
what really happened?

143
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,879
Master Shen,

144
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm begging you.

145
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,759
Master Shen,

146
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,440
The Meng Jia will be yours
from now on.

147
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,399
We are at your mercy.

148
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,720
But Yan is still just a child.

149
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,519
He is innocent.

150
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,200
Please, spare him.

151
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,000
Impossible.

152
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,919
That's not true.

153
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,000
Even if my father were to die,

154
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,639
he would never kneel
before Shen Tianyi.

155
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,919
If you come over here

156
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440
and lick my shoes clean,

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
maybe I could

158
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,399
let your son go.

159
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,080
Master Shen,

160
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,759
I'm begging you, please spare him.

161
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,480
Let Yan go.

162
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,240
I'm begging you, Master Shen.

163
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,919
I'm begging you.

164
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,960
Let Yan go.

165
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,919
Knows my family inside out,

166
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,399
and can control puppets.

167
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,440
It must be him.

168
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,159
I know who you are now.

169
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,080
Show yourself.

170
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,000
Long time no see, Meng Yan.
