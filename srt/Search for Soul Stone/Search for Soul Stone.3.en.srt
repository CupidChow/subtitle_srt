1
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,000
The real Meng Yan

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,679
would definitely know

3
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,880
which chamber has the bullet

4
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,799
Why didn't you dodge?

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,680
The Jia Yuer I know

6
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,000
would never pull the trigger

7
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,240
You still don't believe me?

8
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,159
When you were eight, your parents teamed up

9
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,400
You hid at my place for a week because

10
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,879
Enough

11
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,080
Stop talking

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
Go handle your own stuff first

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
Can't you let me save face

14
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,479
in front of my little brother?

15
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,159
And where have you been all these years?

16
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,719
You made me worry so much

17
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,879
You could've at least called me

18
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,599
How would I know your number?

19
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Fine

20
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,680
You even forgot my number

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Every time, it's early morning

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,159
You came to my house to play

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,080
You

24
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:55,560
You

25
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,400
And you still want me to ask around for you

26
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,439
Watch your tone with me

27
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,159
You

28
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,280
The person you're looking for is Ah Q

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
I've already asked about him

30
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,800
He's a regular at the casino

31
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,280
Pretty well-known around here

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,840
Why?

33
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,800
Is it because he's good at cards?

34
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,800
No, his manners are terrible

35
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,879
He loses and instantly gets mad

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,800
He flips the table when angry

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Then gets beaten up for it

38
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,800
After that, he cries and begs for forgiveness

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,280
But he still comes back the next day

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,639
Let's go to Dao's place

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
We should find him there

42
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,000
Who said I'm going with you?

43
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,400
Thanks

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,400
Let's go

45
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,680
Meng Yan, let's go together

46
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
Ladies

47
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,080
I really don't have time

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,199
to play games with you

49
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,400
I'll say it again

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
No one helped my family back then

51
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,879
No need to now either

52
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's go

53
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,639
Hey, boss

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,360
What's up?

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,400
Get me a car downstairs, quick

56
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,919
Okay, I'll be right there

57
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,800
You don't need to come

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,960
Are you stupid?

59
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,680
Then I'll wait in the car

60
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,520
Yeah, wait for me in the car

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,080
If I don't leave now, I'm dead

62
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
What did I say?

63
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,040
Boss

64
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:45,800
Boss

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,600
Boss, let me go

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Boss

67
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,000
Boss

68
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:48,800
Boss

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,319
Boss

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,199
Boss

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,279
Boss

72
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,879
Our Young Master is on his way

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,319
He's here

74
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,720
No one can save you now

75
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,120
Where's that guy?

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
I really don't know him

77
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,600
He barged into my office

78
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,879
With a little girl

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,560
That's all I know

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,480
Boss, please let me go, boss

81
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,000
Young Master Shen, you're here

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Young Master Shen

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
Please let me go, Young Master Shen

84
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,279
Young Master Shen

85
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,480
Young Master Shen

86
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,199
Young Master Shen

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
Young Master Shen

88
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,759
I've told you everything I know

89
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,680
Young Master

90
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
To the Shen family and Master Shen

91
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,199
I'm absolutely loyal

92
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,680
Oh, right

93
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,519
Master Shen said

94
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,759
We are all Children of the Master

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,160
We should care for each other, right?

96
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
Care for each other

97
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,959
Young Master, please let me go

98
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:45,600
Young Master

99
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,600
Young Master Shen

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,160
Young Master Shen

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Indeed

102
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,399
My uncle is a devout believer

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,319
When we first came to this country

104
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,199
He'd chase someone for blocks

105
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,959
just for a good stone

106
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,279
At night, he'd come home

107
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,279
and beat me for not reciting scripture

108
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,759
Saying

109
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,680
it's because I can't recite scripture

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,079
not respectful enough to the Master

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,279
that's why our life is so hard

112
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,240
Young Master Shen

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,079
Young Master Shen

114
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:22,759
Young Master Shen

115
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,199
I'm begging you

116
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,879
Please let me go, Young Master Shen

117
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,519
You might truly be innocent

118
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,680
But for people like you who sin

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,160
and use faith to forgive themselves

120
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,920
to comfort themselves

121
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,160
even to control others' minds

122
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,120
This is how I do things

123
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,480
Farewell

124
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,399
No

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,800
No

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,279
No

127
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,079
They're cheating

128
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,000
Cheating

129
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,160
Get lost

130
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Don't let me see you again

131
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,040
You

132
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,199
Me

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Hey

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,399
A guy about your age

135
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,000
with a seven or eight-year-old girl

136
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,600
came to your place looking for Ah Q

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Keep an eye out for me

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,480
I'll be there soon

139
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,480
Spare me, hero!

140
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:32,879
Please, have mercy!

141
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know anything.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,319
I don't know.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Young Master Meng

144
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,879
You are...

145
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,160
Master

146
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,279
It's me, Master.

147
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,600
I used to help in your kitchen.

148
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,439
When you were little,

149
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,920
you loved my date pastries the most.

150
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,600
Oh.

151
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,519
So it was you.

152
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,199
If you hadn't said anything,

153
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,399
I wouldn't have remembered.

154
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:54,839
It was you.

155
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
You never cleaned out the pits.

156
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,279
I always bit down on them.

157
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,199
Speak.

158
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,439
My family's Mo Fei jade—

159
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,160
Did you sell it to the auction house?

160
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
Master, what are you saying?

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,519
I don't know.

162
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,959
Where did you find him?

163
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,720
At an auction.

164
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,199
I heard Meng family items were up for sale.

165
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,120
So I went there.

166
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,399
Didn't expect him to show up too.

167
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,079
He's been hiding all these years.

168
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,399
He must've suffered a lot.

169
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,399
So I don't blame him for acting that way.

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,799
You know what I can do, right?

171
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,799
You really want to force me?

172
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
Let me warn you—

173
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm not that skilled with this trick yet.

174
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,000
Still not very practiced.

175
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,759
If I use it on you,

176
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,159
you might have side effects.

177
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Like brain damage,

178
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,320
paralysis,

179
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,639
or losing control of your bladder.

180
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:50,919
No!

181
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't say I didn't warn you.

182
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,720
No!

183
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,679
I know the Meng family's ways.

184
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,399
I'll talk.

185
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,720
Speak up!

186
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
It was that night.

187
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,200
I...

188
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,519
I stole it.

189
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,799
That night.

190
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,960
You were there the night my family was killed.

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,679
I should've left earlier that night.

192
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,960
But the date pastries weren't done.

193
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
The chef made me redo a batch.

194
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
I fell asleep under the stove.

195
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,120
When I woke up, there was chaos outside.

196
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,759
I didn't know what was happening.

197
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,399
I went out to look—

198
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,759
There were bodies everywhere.

199
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,000
Blood everywhere.

200
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,480
I figured the master and madam were gone.

201
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,799
The Meng family was finished.

202
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,399
So I thought, no one wanted the stuff.

203
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,600
I took whatever I could.

204
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:42,320
Gambled it all away over the years.

205
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Only that was left.

206
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,519
But I lost too much lately.

207
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,000
So I sold it too.

208
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Who bought it?

209
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,559
The auction house owner.

210
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,799
He looked like bad news.

211
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,279
No one else.

212
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,039
That's it.

213
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,159
Just him.

214
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,360
If you don't believe me, check yourself.

215
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,600
I know you Meng family folks

216
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,679
can read minds.

217
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,200
Nothing gets past you.

218
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,159
I remember when his family had trouble,

219
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,360
my dad suddenly insisted

220
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,200
I go north to visit my uncle.

221
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,480
When I came back,

222
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,360
his house was empty.

223
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,399
So I think

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,960
what happened to his family—

225
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,879
our elders

226
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,000
must've known.

227
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,559
Me too.

228
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,200
Just days before his family fell,

229
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,840
my mom suddenly asked

230
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,080
if I wanted to study abroad.

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
When he needed us most,

232
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
none of us were there.

233
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,480
No wonder he's so disappointed in us.

234
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,759
My family treated you well, right?

235
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
When my family was attacked,

236
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,399
you just watched.

237
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,960
Master.

238
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,720
Those people killed everyone they saw.

239
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,320
No one survived.

240
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,960
If I hadn't hidden under the stove,

241
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,600
I'd be dead too.

242
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,519
Even Aunt Cheng, the cleaner—

243
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,559
half her body was gone.

244
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,559
Wait.

245
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,480
You said those people—

246
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,320
Who else was there?

247
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,720
Do you remember how many?

248
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,759
I don't remember.

249
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
Will you talk or not?

250
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,200
Master.

251
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,559
It's not that I won't talk.

252
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,879
I really didn't see.

253
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,200
I just remember one person—

254
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,519
No, not a person.

255
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,559
It was a Monster.

256
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,399
It had no arms.

257
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,159
A blade grew from its arm.

258
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,320
A blade.

259
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,679
Master.

260
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,000
That Monster is right behind you.
