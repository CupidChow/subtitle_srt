1
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,000
That can't be right.

2
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,840
Are you done playing?

3
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,400
It's our turn now.

4
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,200
Anyone still alive?

5
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,000
Anyone still alive?

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,959
You.

7
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,599
What are you going to do?

8
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,760
Whatever you're imagining,

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,799
it's worse than that.

10
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,519
You.

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
How did you know I was coming?

12
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,599
I didn't use any powers.

13
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,359
I'm not here to fight you today.

14
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,760
Then why are you here?

15
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm here to warn you.

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,199
Someone else is coming for you.

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,199
Why are you telling me?

18
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,360
Just think of it as me being nice for once.

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,680
Fine.

20
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,159
Then I'll try being the villain.

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,759
That person is cunning and ruthless.

22
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,639
Don't get yourself killed.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,159
When is he coming?

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,000
Watch your timing.

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
Before you enter Jia Yaozu's room.

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,080
If I'm not mistaken,

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,599
your power should be

28
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,599
to stop time in a certain area.

29
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,360
If you weren't so proud of

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,479
your unique ability,

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,039
and only paused for a few seconds each time,

32
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,960
I might not have noticed so easily.

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,879
But you talk way too much.

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Fifteen minutes.

35
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,439
Even a fool could see it.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,479
So,

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,840
from the moment I entered Jia Yaozu's room,

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
everything that happened

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,039
was all

40
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,879
Well?

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,840
an illusion I created for you.

42
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,360
Are you satisfied?

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,159
Looks like you are.

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,199
It's only fair to return the favor.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,199
Now it's your turn to entertain us.

46
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,960
Us.

47
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,639
That's right.

48
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,240
Did you forget?

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,599
What you said in the illusion?

50
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,479
How you treated the Meng Jia?

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,879
And what you said to those two girls?

52
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,159
No.

53
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,199
You just said this is all an illusion.

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,560
None of this is real.

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,879
What does this have to do with those two bitches?

56
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,000
Can you watch your mouth?

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
Those girls even call you uncle.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,759
That makes you sound younger.

59
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,240
Why insult them?

60
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,400
So what are you going to do to me?

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
I don't think Master Xie Qi needs to know just yet.

62
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,159
What I've done

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,080
is child's play to you.

64
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,360
In your memories,

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,000
I found a thousand ways you tortured people.

66
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,279
I picked the easiest one.

67
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,240
And used it on you.

68
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,120
I think

69
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,600
you'll remember it for life.

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,560
Just kidding.

71
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,399
I'm only talking.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,879
I didn't actually do it, right?

73
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,720
It's just a joke.

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,240
You.

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,040
You don't actually believe this, do you?

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,079
Enough.

77
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,480
Master Xie Qi.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
Can you not do this?

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,319
You're at least

80
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,800
a respected figure in the underworld.

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,120
Don't embarrass yourself in front of the young ones.

82
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,279
What's this now?

83
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,839
Oh, this?

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,240
Think of it as adrenaline or something.

85
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,639
So you won't suffer too much.

86
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,199
Or maybe

87
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,319
so you don't faint from fright.

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,199
Otherwise I'd miss your performance.

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,959
What a shame.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Get away.

91
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,680
No word from Master Xie Qi yet?

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Not yet.

93
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:22,959
Get away.

94
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,000
You lunatic.

95
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,639
Pervert.

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,040
I have a little question for you.

97
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,079
Master Xie Qi.

98
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,839
How many people have you cut over the years?

99
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:36,879
Oh, right.

100
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Let me check this scale first.

101
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,720
Ten.

102
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,199
Twenty.

103
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,199
Thirty.

104
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,040
That's all?

105
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,040
Still not nearly enough.

106
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,279
Master Xie Qi.

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
On your body,

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,759
there should be about sixty kilos, right?

109
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,759
Take your hand away.

110
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,920
Move your hand, now.

111
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,199
How much do you think I should cut?

112
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
You sick freak.

113
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,439
Let me tell you,

114
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,199
If you've got the guts, just kill me.

115
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:05,839
Otherwise,

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,040
you'll pay for what you did today.

117
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,399
There will be consequences.

118
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,079
Your past sins are deep in your bones.

119
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,199
Technically,

120
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,759
I shouldn't just cut your flesh.

121
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,480
I should saw off your bones too.

122
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,399
And boil them.

123
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,160
But since you're an old man,

124
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
as a young man,

125
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,560
I should show some mercy.

126
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:27,720
How about this—

127
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,360
I'll just make a gesture.

128
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,240
Cut two jin and call it done.

129
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,399
Come on.

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
Get away.

131
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,000
You're really going to cut me?

132
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,360
Cutting from the butt is easiest,

133
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,639
and it won't hurt as much.

134
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,360
Since it's a private area,

135
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,120
and those two girls are watching,

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,319
it's a bit offensive for you.

137
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,399
You're already in this state,

138
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,199
and you still care about being offended?

139
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,920
You really are a freak.

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,839
Oh, right.

141
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,160
It might hurt a bit when I cut.

142
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,040
But bear with it.

143
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,720
Don't worry.

144
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,240
I won't let you die.

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
I'm not exactly a professional,

146
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,279
but the Jia Family has a medical team.

147
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,680
They can save you anytime.

148
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,199
Let's do this.

149
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,199
Enough.

150
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,000
You've seen enough at this point.

151
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm afraid the next part might scare you.

152
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,720
Go away.

153
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,560
You freak.

154
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,319
You lunatic.

155
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,000
Why did you suddenly stop us from watching?

156
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,399
Meng Yan.

157
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,879
Seems even more twisted.

158
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,920
What's wrong, Madam Tang?

159
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,000
Someone keeps coming to my house lately.

160
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,439
You know, a single man and woman alone...

161
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,759
It wouldn't look good if word got out.

162
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,399
Where's Meng Yan?

163
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,360
He's at my place.

164
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,560
Tell Meng Yan and Yu Yan to come out.

165
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,519
They're busy.

166
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,199
No time.

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,480
Madam Tang.

168
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,240
How about we sit down for a drink?

169
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,600
Tell Meng Yan and Yu Yan to come out.

170
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,040
Madam Tang.

171
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,720
Are you here to show off in my Jia Family?

172
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,079
I'll look for them myself.

173
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,439
Madam Tang.

174
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,519
You freak.

175
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,399
Why is it still a bit short?

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
It's more than that.

177
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,399
More than what?

178
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,440
If you don't believe me, see for yourself.

179
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,360
Still two taels short.

180
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,960
It's not just one person.

181
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,320
Sorry about this.

182
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,240
Now I can only take a bit from your other leg.

183
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,960
To make up the rest.

184
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,720
Come.

185
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,799
I mean, your Clan Massacre wasn't the only one.

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,799
It wasn't just me and Shen Zhengyi working together.

187
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,320
Madam Tang, wait a moment.

188
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
The Tang and Jia Families were involved too.

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
Slandering others won't lessen your guilt.

190
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,039
I didn't.

191
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,720
Only your family's gift

192
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,480
can sense

193
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,000
the Soulstones in the jade veins.

194
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,320
Back then,

195
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,559
your father refused to cooperate with the three families.

196
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,440
So,

197
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,600
the three families joined forces to pressure him.

198
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,600
None of them are innocent.

199
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,120
How can you prove this isn't just an excuse

200
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,600
you made up to save yourself?

201
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,720
That Madam Tang

202
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,600
isn't even that girl's real mother.

203
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
She personally killed Tang Henian back then

204
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,840
and took over as head of the family.

205
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,240
If you don't believe me,

206
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,519
go confront Shen Tianyi yourself.

207
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,120
What happened back then

208
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,639
all started with the meeting Shen Tianyi called.

209
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,679
It began with that meeting.

210
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,120
That meeting

211
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
involved all three major families.

212
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,559
It was aimed at your father,

213
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,440
Meng Shixian.

214
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,279
Thank you, sir, for attending this meeting.

215
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,000
Let me introduce you first.

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,200
These two are the heads of the two major families in the Federation.

217
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,480
Jia Family head Jia Guangzong,

218
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,279
Tang Family head Tang Henian,

219
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
and the Kelen Gang,

220
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,120
Nokai Gang,

221
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,279
Dan Gang,

222
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,960
the mine owners from all major mining areas,

223
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,919
and friends from other regions of Myanmar.

224
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,360
Thank you all for the invitation.

225
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,919
But I, Meng, am just a nobody.

226
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,919
Why would you all go to such trouble for me?

227
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,559
I don't know.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,639
Mr. Meng, here's the situation.

229
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,759
The rare Soulstones in the jade mines

230
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,879
gave us powers beyond ordinary people.

231
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,399
But we ordinary folks

232
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,360
can only mine them with the most foolish methods.

233
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,720
From hundreds or thousands of tons of rock

234
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,960
we find just one or two Soulstones.

235
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,200
All the families and factions mobilize for this.

236
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,279
Fighting and killing.

237
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,000
It's turned this place into chaos.

238
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:10,879
So,

239
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,120
we need Mr. Meng's gifted sense

240
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,200
to help us

241
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,519
find the Soulstones in the veins.

242
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,559
Only then can the fighting end.

243
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,480
I...

244
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,480
Why should I do this?
