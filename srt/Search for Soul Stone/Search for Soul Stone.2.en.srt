1
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,000
Nine million, second call.

2
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:51,560
Nine hundred.

3
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:51,840
Wait a moment.

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,200
Miss Tang is making a Blank Check Bid.

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,599
What does that mean?

6
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,760
Blank Check Bid means—

7
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,519
No matter how much the other side bids,

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,879
she’ll always raise it one more round.

9
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,640
Little girl,

10
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,000
this is something our Master Shen

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,560
really wants.

12
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,120
Then tell Uncle Shen

13
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,480
this item

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,959
is something I, Tang Yuyan, really like.

15
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,599
I want to buy it and keep it for a few days.

16
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,719
If he wants it,

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,359
let him come ask me for it himself.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,719
So you’re Miss Tang.

19
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,239
Forgive me for not recognizing you.

20
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,719
I’ll visit you another day.

21
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,239
Let’s go.

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,239
Miss Tang bids nine point two million.

23
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,079
Anyone else want to bid?

24
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,000
Sold.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,359
Congratulations, Miss Tang.

26
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,519
I’m already outside.

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,040
Just wait for me at the door.

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,159
Ruined my plan.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,639
It’s ruined.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
She has powers too.

31
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,520
I can’t control her.

32
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey kid, what’s wrong?

33
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,080
Did you get separated from your parents?

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,719
Come on.

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,560
I’ll help you find your mom and dad.

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,400
Trying to play tricks on me?

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,479
You—

38
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,439
Meng Yan.

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,919
Tang Yuyan.

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,960
Long time no see.

41
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,520
Where have you been all these years?

42
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,560
None of your business.

43
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,520
Who’s this little girl?

44
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,680
Did you get married?

45
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,960
Are you blind?

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
She’s my sister.

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Do you know how many years I’ve looked for you?

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,800
How many years have you looked for me?

49
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,719
When the Meng family had trouble back then,

50
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,520
it was in all the newspapers in Myanmar.

51
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:00,680
At that time—

52
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,159
why didn’t any of your families

53
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,360
step up and speak for justice?

54
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,280
Stay away from me, Miss Tang.

55
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,159
I’m dangerous right now.

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,319
Then why didn’t you come find me back then?

57
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,520
You don’t even trust me?

58
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,000
It’s not about you.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
Why can’t you focus on what matters?

60
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
The point is, I’m dangerous now.

61
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:23,879
Forget it.

62
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,839
Let’s go.

63
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,519
What are you up to now?

64
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,920
My dear Miss.

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
Then give me back the item.

66
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,920
Your Tang family’s Shadowcraft

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,519
doesn’t need this spiritual energy.

68
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,920
Why did you buy it?

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
I just saw

70
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,319
it belonged to your Meng family.

71
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,480
I thought I’d buy it

72
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,079
and maybe return it to you someday.

73
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,120
Uncle, is it still not enough?

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,759
Lately, a lot of jade’s energy

75
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,319
has mysteriously disappeared.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,959
If at the auction

77
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,519
we get the Meng family’s Mofei Jade,

78
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,519
we won’t need to keep

79
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,120
searching for these inferior substitutes.

80
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,160
I have failed you.

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,439
You can’t even get things done

82
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,839
with money now?

83
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,920
I already spoke to the auction house owner.

84
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,360
But then a fat guy showed up

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,639
and kept raising the price against me.

86
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
Then Miss Tang showed up at the end

87
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,759
and made a Blank Check Bid.

88
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,720
Still making excuses?

89
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,720
Uncle.

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,439
This jade vein is getting weaker.

91
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,720
Why don’t we just take the Tang family—

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,319
Don’t worry about the Tang family’s business.

93
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,040
But I think—

94
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,160
Jingshi.

95
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,439
You’ll be in charge of this family one day.

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,920
Yes.

97
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,519
Mr. Shen.

98
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,240
I’m willing to make up for my mistake.

99
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
You useless fool.

100
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,480
What’s the point of keeping you?

101
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,480
Uncle, I was wrong.

102
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,040
Uncle, I was wrong.

103
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,480
You—

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,319
Take some men and find the Meng family’s child.

105
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,120
Yes.

106
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,519
With him,

107
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,519
we can find a new jade vein.

108
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,360
It’ll save us a lot of trouble.

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Those ordinary people

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,759
only find worthless jade mines.

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,439
There’s barely any spirit stones in them.

112
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,839
So many years have passed.

113
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,560
Are you sure that Meng Yan is still alive?

114
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,160
Only the Meng family can read people’s minds.

115
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,879
Without anyone noticing.

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,839
They come and go freely.

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,839
If I’m right,

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,560
the one causing trouble at the auction

119
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,319
was Meng Yan.

120
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,759
This is—

121
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,720
Xiaoduo isn’t well.

122
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,839
She needs spiritual energy to—

123
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,680
This belongs to our Meng family.

124
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,519
I decide how it’s used.

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,759
Tch.

126
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,959
If it weren’t for a lousy gambler

127
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,639
selling it to pay off debts,

128
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,319
you’d never have found it.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,920
Gambler.

130
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,839
So you know where that gambler is?

131
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,680
You want to find him?

132
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,560
Yes.

133
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,319
The jade came from him.

134
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,439
Back when my family had trouble,

135
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,360
he must know something.

136
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,160
I know what you’re after.

137
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,079
I’ll take you to see an old friend.

138
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,639
She can help.

139
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,079
Who?

140
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,120
Sister Yuer

141
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Don't recognize me anymore?

142
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,759
You say he's Meng Yan

143
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,840
How come

144
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,679
it's only been a few years

145
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,039
and you can't recognize him?

146
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,600
Forget it

147
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,480
Let's just go

148
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,559
It's good enough if she doesn't cause trouble

149
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,080
What does Meng Yan look like

150
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,159
Don't you remember at all?

151
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,080
There are plenty who look alike

152
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,440
How can you prove he's Meng Yan?

153
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,759
Well

154
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,559
He knows you

155
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,120
Isn't that proof enough?

156
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,879
I know all the actresses on TV

157
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,120
But do they know me?

158
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,720
Them knowing me means nothing

159
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,360
Unless he can prove it himself

160
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,720
If you really are Meng Yan

161
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,279
then you should be able to dodge this
