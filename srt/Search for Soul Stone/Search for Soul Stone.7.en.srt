1
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,520
I know who you are now.

2
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,159
Come out.

3
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,679
Long time no see, Meng Yan.

4
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,239
Jin Zhenghao.

5
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,760
This kid seems pretty shy.

6
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,879
How old is he?

7
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,079
He's eight.

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,439
Just two years older than our Meng Yan.

9
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,719
Perfect for playing together.

10
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,239
I'm Meng Yan.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,319
You know, the Meng family survivors—

12
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,560
You're not the only one.

13
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,120
Does that make you feel relieved?

14
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,719
You betrayed our Meng family.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
How can you say that about me?

16
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,519
After all, I'm just a poor—

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,920
orphan with no parents.

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,319
It just so happened

19
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,079
I passed by Shen Tianyi's house,

20
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,719
and happened to tell Shen Tianyi

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,719
where I used to live.

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,159
That's all.

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,480
My father treated you well.

24
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,959
Why did you betray him?

25
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,879
Treated me well?

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,719
Is this what you mean?

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,719
Master Meng.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,240
For all the years I served

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,879
the Meng family,

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,319
please don't drive us away.

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,719
I've warned you more than once

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,800
not to let Zhenghao study

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,520
these strange and dangerous arts.

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,120
Such skills easily attract attention.

35
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,680
And they go against

36
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,240
our Meng family's rule of discretion.

37
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,199
Now Zhenghao

38
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,319
uses these skills for ill-gotten gains.

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
I truly can't keep you here anymore.

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,680
I made you disobey.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,280
Made you disobey.

42
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,080
Enough.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,159
Enough, sister.

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,879
Don't make things hard for the child.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,479
We had no other choice.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,680
That jade used to be

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,319
just a pretty stone.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,120
But now it contains a Soulstone.

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,719
Supernatural powers have bewitched people.

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,319
And our Meng family

51
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,159
is coveted for our Psychic Perception

52
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,319
of the Soulstone.

53
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,759
Take this.

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,439
It's a token from me and Old Meng.

55
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,759
Just a small gesture.

56
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,759
Go buy something with it.

57
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,520
We don't need Meng family's pity.

58
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,319
Master.

59
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,000
Zhenghao practiced dark arts and went astray.

60
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,960
He is now shunned by all.

61
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:55,520
Leaving Meng family, he'll fall deeper into darkness.

62
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
Please, Master and Madam,

63
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,159
look after our Zhenghao.

64
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,719
Sister.

65
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Sister.

66
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,399
Mom.

67
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,240
Why do you have to do this?

68
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,759
So the Meng family was hiding here.

69
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,079
Do you like the gift I prepared for you?

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,319
You dare show up before me

71
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,199
aren't you afraid of my Psychic Perception?

72
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,360
You truly are the Meng family heir.

73
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,759
Still so arrogant.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,439
If your power

75
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,560
could pierce my Aether Barrier,

76
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,920
would you have waited until now?

77
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,560
How would I know without trying?

78
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,560
Yuyan, do it.

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,920
Yuyan.

80
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,839
Yuyan.

81
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,120
Let me go.

82
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,439
Yuyan.

83
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,319
No wonder you talked to me for so long.

84
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,319
You were waiting for this moment.

85
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,079
Meng Yan,

86
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,560
looks like you're no longer

87
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
the little brat I remember.

88
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,720
Jin Zhenghao.

89
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,360
If your goal is to kill me,

90
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,360
just keep me here.

91
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,959
Let them go.

92
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,839
You—

93
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,839
You're just an appetizer.

94
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,920
I came here today

95
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,319
to use your Meng family's land

96
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,879
and tell all four great families

97
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,439
that I, Jin Zhenghao,

98
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,120
am no one's puppet.

99
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,839
As for you,

100
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,319
after this is done,

101
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,800
you'd better cooperate with me.

102
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,920
Help me find every Soulstone vein

103
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,439
in Myanmar.

104
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,480
What if I refuse?

105
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,519
If you won't,

106
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,519
Xiao Duo.

107
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,360
Xiao Duo.

108
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,079
No!

109
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,680
Don't!

110
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,079
Let her go!

111
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,800
Yuer.

112
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,279
Yuyan.

113
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,399
If you don't want to die—

114
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,120
Yuyan, are you okay?

115
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
Let Xiao Duo go.

116
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,759
Didn't expect Miss Jia's skills to be so strong.

117
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,879
Cut the crap.

118
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,319
Let's see if Miss Jia's aim

119
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,559
is better than my speed.

120
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,559
Fine.

121
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
Better to live miserably than die well.

122
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,919
You win.

123
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,919
Miss Jia.

124
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,519
Don't be nervous.

125
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,759
Don't shoot.

126
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,320
I've let her go.

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,960
I keep my word.

128
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,759
Xiao Duo, go to your brother.

129
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,919
Okay, sister.

130
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,720
Okay, sister.

131
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,159
Jia Yuer, be careful.

132
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,159
Yuer.

133
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,559
Yuer.

134
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:35,919
Yuer.

135
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,159
Nothing in this world goes as we wish.

136
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,879
Yuer, don't speak.

137
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,480
Don't talk yet.

138
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,720
How do you feel?

139
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,879
Meng Yan.

140
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,320
But don't use up all your sorrow yet.

141
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,039
There's still one more.

142
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,360
Yuer.

143
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,360
Yuer.

144
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,759
It's useless.

145
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,919
You can't break through
my Aether Barrier.

146
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,879
Originally,

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,840
I wanted to see
how strong your gift was.

148
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,360
You're just a mortal
in the end.

149
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,600
This must be
your limit.

150
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,559
Xiao Duo

151
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:44,960
Jia Yuer

152
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,320
Yuyan

153
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,799
Jin

154
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,879
Zheng

155
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,279
hao
