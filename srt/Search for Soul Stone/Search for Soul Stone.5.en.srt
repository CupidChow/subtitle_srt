1
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,640
Thank you, sir.

2
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,959
Uncle.

3
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,480
There's another problem.

4
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,959
Mm.

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,120
The spirit power is too weak.

6
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,760
Still nowhere near

7
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,400
what we had at the Meng family

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,480
when we found those spirit stones.

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,079
Daolang said before

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,760
it was the two young ladies from Jia and Tang

11
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,480
who saved Meng Yan.

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,040
The younger generation of Tang and Jia

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,439
used to be two-faced,

14
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,200
but at least they called me uncle.

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,159
We all kept up appearances.

16
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,319
But this time,

17
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,480
they openly stand against me.

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,640
Something strange is definitely going on.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
There's Jia Yuer,

20
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,079
and Tang Yuyan.

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,599
Only that old lady from the Tang family

22
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,760
do we still fear a little.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,359
As for the Jia family,

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,120
after the old man died,

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,359
only Jia Yaozu is left.

26
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,959
He's just a useless playboy.

27
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,400
His niece

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,759
even dares to mess up our plans.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,000
I heard Jia Yuer

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,759
started some Azure Dragon Gang.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,759
They keep coming after us.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
Uncle, you must be joking.

33
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,879
That Azure Dragon Gang

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,280
to us

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,560
is just child's play.

36
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,120
Why are you here?

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,319
It's been six years.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
I have so much to tell you.

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,159
No.

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,240
Whatever it is, let's talk tomorrow.

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
It's so late now.

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,360
Do you know

43
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,919
some things can only be said at night?

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,360
Don't.

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,879
Put on some clothes.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,719
It's so cold.

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,759
If you think I'm cold,

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,680
then come closer to me.

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,919
Don't you like it?

50
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,120
I...

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,400
Stop messing around.

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,639
This is Jia Yuer's house.

53
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,199
What,

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,240
am I not enough alone?

55
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,919
You want her to join us?

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,479
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,719
Come out, hurry.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,840
He's such a flirt.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,839
Yuer.

60
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,519
You...

61
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,279
Meng Yan, you're so naughty.

62
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,920
How do you know some things

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,279
are more fun with three people

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,839
than with just two?

65
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,279
You...

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,120
There's still a long time till dawn.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,680
Shh.

68
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,319
Yuer, your hand...

69
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,759
Wait, that's not right.

70
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,079
Who are you really?

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,759
What are you?

72
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,480
Why doesn't my power

73
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,439
work on you?

74
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,480
What we are doesn't matter.

75
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,439
What matters is what you saw.

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
What do you want?

77
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,959
You'll know soon.

78
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Meng Yan, get down!

79
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,879
You...

80
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,839
Are you okay?

81
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,519
Wait.

82
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,720
That dead toad

83
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,800
how did it show up here?

84
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,720
Dead toad?

85
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,199
Mm.

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,920
Yuer means the Puppetmaster Toad.

87
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,399
He's now the most powerful

88
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,839
puppetmancer in Dai.

89
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,720
Two years ago, he single-handedly

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,600
wiped out Dai's biggest gang.

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
He became famous overnight.

92
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,759
They say his puppetmancy is ever-changing.

93
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,360
No one can tell what's real or fake.

94
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,920
Rumor has it

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,759
he's always coveted

96
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,040
the Jade Vein of the three great families in Myanmar.

97
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,160
Puppetmaster Toad.

98
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,279
That dead toad is always mysterious.

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,160
But now it's fine.

100
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,199
At least we know he's straight.

101
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,959
How do you know?

102
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,439
Look at those stockings.

103
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,120
That's straight guy taste.

104
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,680
I wouldn't wear them anyway.

105
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,079
But I see these puppets

106
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,639
don't have any weapons.

107
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,879
They don't seem to want to hurt Meng Yan.

108
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,759
Oh no.

109
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,720
Xiao Duo!

110
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,079
Xiao Duo!

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,360
Isn't this your home address?

112
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm going out for a bit.

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,519
Wait here and be good till I return.

114
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
Okay?

115
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,839
Who are you?

116
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,560
Who am I? And who are you?

117
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,560
All things are different.

118
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,720
All things are the same.

119
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,639
It's you.

120
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,120
Boss Jia, you've had too much.

121
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
We're just getting started.

122
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,120
You're annoying.

123
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,639
Bottoms up!

124
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,080
Boss Jia.

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,759
Drink it all!

126
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,080
Patriarch.

127
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,200
Come.

128
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:11,919
Patriarch.

129
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,440
Patriarch.

130
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,919
Come.

131
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,159
Patriarch.

132
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,120
Let's go, sit over there.

133
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,000
Patriarch.

134
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,759
Yuyan hasn't come back yet.

135
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,120
Not yet.

136
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,639
Someone sent this over.

137
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,960
That brat hasn't called all day.

138
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,960
She didn't even call home.

139
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,159
Oh no.
