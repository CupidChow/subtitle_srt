1
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,600
Xiao Duo

2
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,359
Brother

3
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,079
Xiao Duo

4
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,159
Xiao Duo

5
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,239
I never expected

6
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,519
you'd be here

7
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,680
You escaped back then

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,799
Now you've walked right into the trap

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,200
But that's fine

10
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,200
I'll deal with you now

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,599
It's not too late

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,040
Still not working

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,760
Need a large amount of Spiritual Power

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
Xiao Duo

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,959
Xiao Duo

16
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,680
Don't let your emotions control you

17
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,120
Feel the flow and direction of Spiritual Power

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,599
Our Meng Family doesn't need Soulstones

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,520
But all Spiritual Power from Soulstones

20
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,800
can be used by us

21
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,439
This Spiritual Power

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
comes from the Soulstone in the factory

23
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,479
No, it's Meng Yan

24
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,599
How did you...

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,919
Darn it

26
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,319
This little bitch disrupted my power

27
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,199
I knew I shouldn't have kept you alive

28
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,919
Only realizing it now

29
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,120
It's too late

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,199
I advise

31
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,560
I advise you not to

32
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,159
Why am I suffering the same damage?

33
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,080
Meng Yan

34
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,439
You underestimate my power

35
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,159
If you dare

36
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,520
stab me here

37
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,719
Come on!

38
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,120
We'll

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,839
meet in hell

40
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,079
Who are you?

41
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,560
Who are you?

42
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,959
Why save him?

43
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,199
Mr. Shen

44
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,199
He's alive, right?

45
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,800
No point bringing a corpse, right?

46
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,199
Madam Tang

47
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,639
How did this happen?

48
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,000
Ask Shen Jingshi about that later

49
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,560
Now we're even

50
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,920
Even?

51
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,079
Who gave you the illusion

52
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,439
that you're qualified

53
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,959
to bargain with me?

54
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,079
You saved my adopted son

55
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,360
I'll release your daughter

56
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,199
That does sound fair

57
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,199
The Tang Family does have a daughter

58
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,839
But what does that have to do with you?

59
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,800
Madam Tang

60
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,439
Oh no

61
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,519
I should call you

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,399
Shisan Niang

63
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,000
What's going on now?

64
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,959
How strange

65
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,160
Shisan Niang

66
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,639
Go in and mediate quickly

67
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,639
Madam and master are fighting again

68
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,800
What happened this time?

69
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,959
Mr. Tang is fooling around again

70
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,240
Today that woman even came to confront us

71
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,399
Luckily Sister Zhang and I were here

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
Madam just gave birth

73
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,680
She would've been at a disadvantage

74
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,920
Believe me, I'll make you...

75
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,439
Can't go out

76
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,879
Who do you think you are?

77
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,959
I asked Yinghong to fetch something for me

78
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,199
Not only did you insult her

79
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,600
But also kicked her out

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,959
Do I have no dignity?

81
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,439
Do you think I don't know

82
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,240
What's between you two?

83
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
I tolerated your sneaky affairs outside

84
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
I turned a blind eye

85
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,399
But today you dare challenge me at home

86
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,360
You've gone too far

87
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,279
Too far?

88
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,800
Let me show you what "too far" really is

89
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
Can't even bear a son

90
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,959
Have you no shame?

91
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,439
Sir...

92
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,519
And you dare say I went too far?

93
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,199
Sir...

94
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,560
Sir!

95
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,680
Madam just finished her confinement!

96
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:33,800
You!

97
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,160
Madam, please calm down

98
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,519
Isn't a daughter still your child?

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,240
What good is that good-for-nothing?

100
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,959
My business has been failing these years

101
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,720
All because of your jinx!

102
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,639
I'll teach you to jinx me!

103
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,439
And you!

104
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:47,959
Get out!

105
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,759
You damn jinx!

106
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,600
Cursing me!

107
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,519
I'll show you!

108
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,560
How dare you, a mere servant!

109
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,399
Someone like you

110
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,279
Doesn't deserve to live!

111
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,759
Servants never care who the master is

112
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,559
A master is just like clothing

113
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Whoever wears it

114
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,399
Becomes the household's master

115
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
The family head...

116
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,440
As for what's beneath the clothing

117
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,879
Whether it's Madam Tang or Shisan Niang

118
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,960
Makes little difference to them

119
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,399
However...

120
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,039
For Tang Yuyan

121
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,879
It would be completely different

122
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,799
This secret's been kept twenty years

123
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,039
If Tang Yuyan knew

124
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,399
Not only are you not her real mother

125
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,039
But also her father's murderer

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,480
What would she think?
