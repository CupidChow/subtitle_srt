1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,000
Boss, we've found the Meng Jia.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,960
Do it.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,039
Leave no one alive except the child.

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:14,640
Yes.

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,320
Brother Meng.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,480
You were hard to find.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,159
My condolences.

8
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,679
Shen Tianyi.

9
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,479
You talk about virtue and honor.

10
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,119
But for the Soulstone in jadeite,

11
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,399
you'll do anything.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,640
You and your masters can go to hell.

13
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,079
Look.

14
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,280
The masters favor you so much.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Your clan doesn't need Soulstone power

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,040
to be Gifted.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,560
You can grow stronger naturally.

18
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,680
They gave your family the gift to sense Soulstones.

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,439
But people like us

20
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,680
have to scavenge like hyenas

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,159
for Soulstones in jadeite

22
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,760
just to survive.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,560
Just to keep our powers.

24
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,159
Yan'er.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,599
Run!

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,960
I heard

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
your child inherited

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,879
the Meng Jia's powers.

29
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,479
If you won't cooperate,

30
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,759
he's enough.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,439
It makes no difference.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,639
Where is he?

33
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,719
Are you blind?

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
He's right here.

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
There's no one here.

36
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,280
Can't even watch a kid.

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,240
I see the boy.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,479
Over there! Stop!

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,080
Stop!

40
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,800
Don't let him get away!

41
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,280
Stop!

42
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,199
He's up ahead.

43
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,000
Half a century ago,

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,759
in Myanmar's jadeite mines,

45
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,439
Soulstones with mystical energy appeared.

46
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,159
Jadeite with spiritual power

47
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,199
can unlock life's potential.

48
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,719
Some humans

49
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,360
gained all kinds of supernatural powers.

50
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,840
The Gifted are ranked by power

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,479
from D, C, B, A to S class.

52
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,560
They can boost their rank

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,039
using jadeite's energy.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
But our Meng Jia

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,800
could sense Soulstone veins,

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,039
and suffered disaster.

57
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,159
Boss, the kid ran off!

58
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,280
You didn't find him?

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,159
Boss, spare me!

60
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,960
Boss, please!

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,680
Boss, have mercy!

62
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,280
Boss.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,280
Keep searching.

64
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,319
Yan'er, run!

65
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,199
Stay alive.

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Until you reach S class,

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
you must hide yourself well.

68
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,560
Level up.

69
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,959
But months have passed.

70
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
I only know a little mind reading and control.

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,839
Our Meng Jia's psychic sense—

72
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,680
how do I level it up?

73
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,759
This little girl

74
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,959
makes my energy fluctuate.

75
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,319
There's a hint of growth.

76
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,959
Near this mute girl,

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
my power is slowly rising.

78
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,959
My name is Meng Yan.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,040
What's your name?

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,319
She isn't Gifted.

81
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,079
Why can't I read her mind?

82
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,519
I see a little flower on your chest.

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,560
I'll call you Xiao Duo.

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,360
Xiao Duo.

85
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,759
Will you be my little sister?

86
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,199
With her,

87
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm even harder to find.

88
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,079
Boss.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
Why are these bottles so heavy?

90
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,519
Forty-five cents.

91
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,160
My mind control power seems stronger.

92
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,079
The Jadeite King Meng Jia fire incident

93
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,439
was six years ago.

94
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,279
Recently, news broke

95
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,040
Meng Jia's top jadeite relic has resurfaced.

96
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
It will soon be auctioned.

97
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
Good afternoon, everyone.

98
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,480
I'm your auctioneer today.

99
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,439
Behind me

100
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,759
is a mid-century antique.

101
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,360
Starting bid: three hundred thousand dollars.

102
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,959
Each raise: fifty thousand dollars.

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,959
Let the bidding begin.

104
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,120
Three hundred fifty thousand.

105
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,639
Three hundred fifty thousand here.

106
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,519
Four hundred thousand.

107
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,920
Four hundred thousand here.

108
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,480
Any higher offers?

109
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,279
Four hundred fifty thousand.

110
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,079
Four hundred fifty thousand here.

111
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,839
Anyone else want to bid?

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,360
Five hundred thousand.

113
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
Five hundred thousand here.

114
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,399
Thank you.

115
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,240
Any more bids?

116
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,279
Who are you?

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,560
Did you enter the wrong room?

118
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,439
Who are you, really?

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,519
I'm talking to you.

120
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,480
What are you doing?

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
Leave now or I'll call security.

122
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
Pour me some tea.

123
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,360
Why should I serve you?

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,759
You're Gifted.

125
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
What are you here for?

126
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
Lot number 027.

127
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
How did you get it?

128
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,680
Our auction house has rules.

129
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,399
We never reveal client info

130
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,879
or item origins.

131
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,680
Rules.

132
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,720
You auctioned our family's item

133
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,279
without my permission.

134
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,720
That's your rule?

135
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,360
Lot 027 is a Meng Jia relic.

136
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
Meng Jia was wiped out six years ago.

137
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,159
Are you...

138
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,679
Auction.

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,120
Right?

140
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,879
Sold.

141
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,240
Congratulations, sir.

142
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,759
Now, our next item.

143
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,360
Lot 027, Meng Jia relic.

144
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,639
Starting bid: one million dollars.

145
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,919
Each raise: two hundred thousand dollars.

146
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,840
Everyone, start bidding.

147
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
Darn it, The Jadeite King!

148
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,240
Such a precious Meng Jia treasure

149
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
has ended up out in the world.

150
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,879
I bid three million.

151
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,639
Three million.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,279
This gentleman has offered

153
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,559
a price of three million.

154
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Anyone else want to raise the bid?

155
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,600
Six years ago, Meng Jia was

156
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,360
Could this be bad luck?

157
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,679
That's just superstition.

158
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,200
The media already said

159
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,639
it was just a fire.

160
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,720
Four million.

161
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,679
Four million.

162
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,519
I bid five million.

163
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Five million, thank you.

164
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,879
Any more bids?

165
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,000
I bid six million.

166
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,519
Alright, six million over here.

167
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,919
I bid seven million.

168
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,080
This gentleman bids seven million.

169
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,960
Anyone else want to raise the bid?

170
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,879
Isn't that someone from Shen Jia?

171
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,279
They want this jadeite too.

172
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,480
Don't mess with Shen Jia. Stop bidding.

173
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,360
Seven point two million.

174
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,559
This gentleman bids seven point two million.

175
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,279
Any more bids?

176
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,720
Seven point five million.

177
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,960
Seven point seven million.

178
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,480
Lot number 027

179
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,440
is what Mr. Shen specifically requested.

180
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,320
If you offend him,

181
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,480
you'll regret it.

182
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,960
Shen Tianyi, right?

183
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
He still covets Meng Jia's things.

184
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,159
Good, I'm after him too.

185
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,720
Let's play with him today.

186
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,279
Eight point five million.

187
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,879
Eight hundred...

188
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,559
Eight point seven million.

189
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,279
This gentleman bids eight point seven million.

190
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,240
If there are no higher bids,

191
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,720
this gentleman will

192
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,039
win lot 027 for eight point seven million.

193
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Soulstone barrier.

194
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,639
He's one of the Gifted.

195
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,639
Fatso, you'd better watch yourself.

196
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,240
Me?

197
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,360
What did I say?

198
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,559
Not bad.

199
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,679
Daring to bid against Shen Jia.

200
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,159
You've got guts.

201
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,679
Mr. Shen

202
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,519
won't let you off.

203
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,559
Won't let me off?

204
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,360
Soon you'll tell me yourself

205
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,679
where this thing came from.

206
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,480
And you'll hand it to me yourself.

207
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,320
You brought this on yourself.

208
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,679
What does it have to do with me?

209
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,879
You think I'll tell you?

210
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,759
Eight point seven million, first call.

211
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,720
He's a hopeless gambler.

212
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,480
Right?

213
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,159
Any more bids?

214
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,240
How did you know?

215
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Eight point seven million, second call.

216
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,919
Witchcraft.

217
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,120
We, Shen Jia, bid nine million.

218
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,159
Nine million.

219
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,919
Anyone else want to raise the bid?

220
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,279
This is bad.

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,519
Nine million, first call.

222
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,480
Nine million, second call.

223
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,120
Nine hundred...

224
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:54,799
Wait!

225
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm making a Blank Check Bid.
