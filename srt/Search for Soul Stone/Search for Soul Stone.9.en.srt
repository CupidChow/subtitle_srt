1
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,480
Let me do it.

2
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,599
Mom, let me go outside.

3
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,079
Mom.

4
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,000
Why should I let you out?

5
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,199
Running around outside again.

6
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,360
You think you're grown now.

7
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,599
Staying out late and not coming home.

8
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,599
Spending all day with those shady people.

9
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,879
Messing around outside.

10
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,599
Yesterday...

11
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,360
If it weren't for—

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,479
your Uncle Jia bringing you home,

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,599
who knows what trouble you'd get into.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Mom, listen to me.

15
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,759
I met Meng Yan.

16
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,759
He's still alive.

17
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,360
Meng Yan is alive.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,759
He’s really lucky to survive.

19
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,960
He told Sister Yuer

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,719
that on the night his family was killed,

21
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,360
he heard Shen Tianyi’s voice.

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,120
Just like Sister Yuer said.

23
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,879
Shen Tianyi is—

24
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,680
Enough! Quiet.

25
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,319
The older you get, the less respect you show.

26
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,199
Call him Uncle Shen.

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,759
When Uncle Jia brought me home,

28
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,960
did you see Meng Yan?

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
Jin Zhenghao took Meng Xiaoduo away.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
We went to look for him.

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,560
But Jin Zhenghao tried to kill us.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,319
Then I passed out.

33
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,080
Did Uncle Jia save Meng Yan too?

34
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,479
I only care if you’re safe.

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,599
I don’t have time for anyone else.

36
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,520
Mom.

37
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,800
What happened to Meng Yan?

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,159
Mom.

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,000
Please, I’m begging you.

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,719
Let me go out.

41
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,319
I want to see him.

42
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,080
After all these years,

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,319
you still can’t let him go.

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,599
Yes.

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,080
I’ve looked into that person.

46
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,800
He does look a bit like Meng Yan.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,159
But the Meng family was wiped out six years ago.

48
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,560
Meng Yan is already dead.

49
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,360
No, Mom—

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,560
He really is Meng Yan.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,919
He can read minds.

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
That’s the Meng family’s Psychic Perception.

53
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,360
Mind reading? Nonsense.

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
That’s just a cheap street trick.

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,319
Stop trying.

56
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
You can’t open it.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,319
With your little skills,

58
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,199
Others may not know,

59
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,079
but I’m your mother—I know.

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,959
Stay home and reflect on yourself.

61
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Without my permission,

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
no one is allowed to open the door for her.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,279
Yes, Madam.

64
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,560
Yan’er.

65
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Yan’er.

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,680
Where is this place?

67
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,360
This is the Heart Realm.

68
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,759
It’s the true secret of our Meng family’s
Psychic Perception.

69
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,480
The real secret lies here.

70
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,759
When you enter the Heart Realm,

71
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,360
the true power of Psychic Perception

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,160
will be unlocked.

73
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,800
Dad.

74
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,959
Mom.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,560
Why are you both soaked?

76
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,920
Have you been standing in the rain?

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,480
It rains in this world too.

78
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,399
When our Yan’er feels sad,

79
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
clouds gather here.

80
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,759
When you’re deeply sad,

81
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,000
it rains here.

82
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,399
There’s nothing here.

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,319
You must be lonely.

84
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,560
Every parent wants

85
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,319
to always be by their child’s side.

86
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,680
When something goes wrong,

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,560
to help them right away.

88
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,800
That’s a parent’s duty.

89
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,399
Loneliness isn’t scary.

90
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,800
What’s scary is rain that never stops.

91
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,360
Can you stay here?

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
Don’t leave me again.

93
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,319
Yan’er.

94
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,360
We are the source

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,959
of the power within you.

96
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,079
We are your parents,

97
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,759
and yet not your parents.

98
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,480
What do you mean?

99
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,600
I don’t understand.

100
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,519
This place—

101
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,560
is hidden inside your heart,

102
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,160
a place for cultivation.

103
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
Other gifted ones

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,399
can only gain power from jade spirit stones.

105
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,600
That’s how they get their energy.

106
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,800
And use it to raise their abilities.

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,480
But we

108
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,600
grow stronger

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,560
by constantly strengthening our spirit.

110
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,279
That’s how we gain power.

111
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,319
A true breakthrough in spirit

112
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,319
often happens in an emotional void.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
When emotions surge,

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
breaking through all barriers,

115
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,199
the heart can be opened.

116
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,199
So I can get stronger here?

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,959
Remember,

118
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,759
the Heart Realm’s entropy tide

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,959
can wash away your confusion.

120
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,319
It gives you greater mental power.

121
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,560
What are you doing?

122
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,959
What are you doing?

123
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,240
Me?

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I didn’t do anything.

125
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,480
You didn’t do anything?

126
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
How did you know what I said?

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,079
I didn’t do anything, so I don’t know.

128
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,639
What do you mean by “doing something”?

129
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,680
Jia Yaozu.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,639
Don’t pull.

131
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,000
Don’t pull.

132
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,800
Can you stop tugging me?

133
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,040
I’m only on this floor.

134
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,879
Miss.

135
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,319
Where’s Jia Yaozu?

136
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,800
The master is in the living room.

137
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,319
What are you laughing at?

138
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Congratulations, Miss.

139
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,959
Congratulations for what?

140
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,439
Oh.

141
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,959
Nothing.

142
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,279
Son-in-law

143
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,199
What do you mean?

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,200
If you prefer, I can call you son-in-law.

145
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,200
You

146
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,960
Stop wasting words with her.

147
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,879
Be gentle.

148
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,720
Can you stop pulling?

149
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,960
I'm really only this injured.

150
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Aren't you hurt?

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,759
How are you still so energetic?

152
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,200
Even Jia Yaozu can't heal this wound.

153
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll stab him to death.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,879
Jia Yaozu

155
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
Will you ever stop?

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,759
Hey

157
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,120
Slow down.

158
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,159
Jia Yaozu

159
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,399
You're awake.

160
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,200
Why are you two just getting up?

161
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,279
Fighting without even getting dressed.

162
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,799
What nonsense are you saying?

163
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,399
Look at what you've done.

164
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,919
Oh, no need to thank me.

165
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,200
It's what your uncle should do.

166
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,320
I still...

167
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,480
Thank you.

168
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,240
Hey

169
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
You

170
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,519
Didn't you just say

171
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,960
I did a good thing?

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,240
You're a real scoundrel.

173
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,080
Hey

174
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,120
I'm definitely not the scoundrel here.

175
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
Last night

176
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,399
Shut up.

177
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,080
Drinking first thing in the morning.

178
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,399
You've drunk yourself stupid.

179
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,200
Early morning

180
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,080
Look, it's almost afternoon.

181
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,759
You can really sleep.

182
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,279
Must be exhausted.

183
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,919
Shut up.

184
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,480
Afternoon

185
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,600
Where's Xiao Duo?

186
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,360
Where is Xiao Duo?

187
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,799
Your wife won't let me talk.

188
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,679
Who's his wife?

189
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,639
What kind of uncle are you?

190
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,399
Oh

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,759
So you remember I'm your uncle.

192
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,879
Where exactly is Xiao Duo?

193
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,080
Oh

194
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,600
That little girl?

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,440
She slept all day, just like you.

196
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,759
Such a little kid, snoring in her sleep.

197
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,000
Why are we at your house?

198
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,440
Your house, my house—what's the difference?

199
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
Uncle's house is your home too.

200
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,759
And also,

201
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,240
Last night, you two—

202
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
What exactly did you do?

203
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,960
Drank too much.

204
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,600
Got into a fight.

205
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,399
You think everyone's like you?

206
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,799
Drunkard

207
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,600
Uncle never said you couldn't drink.

208
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
Why are you so angry?

209
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,720
Invite me next time you drink.

210
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,080
I'll set it up for you.

211
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,200
Tell me your type in advance.

212
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,480
I'll arrange a few for you.

213
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Men, you know.

214
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,639
We all get it.

215
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,679
I'm injured,

216
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
not deaf.

217
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,600
You think everyone's like you?

218
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,799
See?

219
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,399
Now you're siding with outsiders.

220
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,399
I see Meng Yan as family.

221
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
That's why I said that.

222
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,360
Enough, I don't want to argue.

223
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,399
Let's go.

224
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,159
Wait a second.

225
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,519
Did I tell you he's Meng Yan?

226
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,360
You did.

227
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,399
You didn't.

228
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,279
Did I or didn't I?

229
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,200
Whether I did or not,

230
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,559
I know anyway.

231
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,799
Stop trying.

232
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,799
That trick doesn't work on me.

233
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,200
You're basically confessing.

234
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,600
Only someone from the Meng family

235
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,919
would use this.

236
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,679
Miss, the Azure Dragon Gang—

237
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
Damn, let's go!

238
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,600
What's wrong?

239
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,759
Something happened to the Azure Dragon Gang.

240
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,279
Big brother

241
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,600
Your daughter

242
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,559
is really getting more and more troublesome.
