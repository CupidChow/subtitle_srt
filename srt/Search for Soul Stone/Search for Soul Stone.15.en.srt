1
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,479
If

2
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,200
Tang Yuyan knew

3
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,399
not only are you not her real mother,

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,000
but also the one who killed her father,

5
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,760
what would she think?

6
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,400
What do you really want?

7
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,159
To become the Tang Family head,

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,760
you must be clever.

9
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,480
What I want—

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,239
you surely know.

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,040
How is it?

12
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,640
Let's talk outside.

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
Her pulse is weak,

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,439
but still steady.

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,079
It's less a coma,

16
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,479
more like she's just asleep.

17
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,719
That's good.

18
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:14,960
I didn't expect

19
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,919
you could read pulses.

20
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,319
My mom is amazing.

21
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,080
Doctors often came to ask her advice.

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,759
I picked up a little over time.

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,120
This is all my fault.

24
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,520
If I hadn't tossed the address away,

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,280
Xiao Duo wouldn't have found it.

26
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,439
It's not your fault.

27
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,759
That's just how Xiao Duo is.

28
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,599
Even if she couldn't find it,

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,599
she'd find another way.

30
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,159
Besides,

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
if not for Xiao Duo,

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,240
we'd all be dead now.

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,599
Before passing out, Xiao Duo called "Brother."

34
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Tell me,

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,199
why was she silent before?

36
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,840
Could it be her ability?

37
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,960
Brother Meng

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,599
Xiao Duo

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
When will Xiao Duo wake up?

40
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,280
She may need a full checkup at the hospital.

41
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,080
But I think

42
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,280
they won't have a clear answer.

43
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,520
I'll take her now to get checked.

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,800
Xiao Duo

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,599
Xiao Duo

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,520
The door is locked.

47
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,280
Xiao Duo

48
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,039
Xiao Duo

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,479
No, something's wrong.

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,759
Something must've happened.

51
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,199
Move aside.

52
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,080
Let me kick the door open.

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,960
Calm down.

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,599
Brother Meng

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,159
Xiao Duo

56
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,400
Xiao Duo

57
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,960
Open the door!

58
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,439
Xiao Duo, open up!

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
You must've seen how I looked.

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,399
Don't worry.

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll leave on my own.

62
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,319
Xiao Duo

63
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,879
What are you saying?

64
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,800
I know I looked scary.

65
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,360
I don't know

66
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
why I turned out this way.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,879
My aunt said

68
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,279
I caused my parents' deaths.

69
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,399
Brother Meng

70
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,360
Sister Yuyan

71
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,399
Sister Yu'er

72
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,959
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,519
I never meant to hurt you.

74
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,839
Xiao Duo, don't say such nonsense.

75
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,759
Brother Meng and I,

76
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,399
and Sister Yu'er, would never blame you.

77
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,160
You protected us.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Xiao Duo

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,839
Please open the door.

80
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,199
Open the door.

81
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,720
Brother Meng

82
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,800
Are you afraid of Xiao Duo?

83
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,480
Xiao Duo

84
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm the real bad guy.

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,959
When we first met,

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,959
you gave me your only food.

87
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,120
But I stayed with you

88
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
because being near you boosted my power.

89
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,240
That's why I followed you.

90
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,399
I wanted to use you at first.

91
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,759
Xiao Duo

92
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,519
Will you be my sister?

93
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,399
Back then,

94
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't lead you right,

95
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,240
I used you to hide myself.

96
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,600
I made you steal with me.

97
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,079
I'm the one who was wrong.

98
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,439
All these years,

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,079
we've relied on each other.

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,759
I've long seen you as my real sister.

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,399
Xiao Duo

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,079
You can scold me,

103
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,120
or hit me,

104
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,480
but

105
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,600
please don't leave me.

106
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,639
Xiao Duo

107
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,439
We have no home now.

108
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,160
You're all I have left.

109
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,879
Brother Meng won't cry.

110
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
Young Master Shen

111
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,759
Why?

112
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,959
They all say

113
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,879
the Shen Family can cure her.

114
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,560
We couldn't help her,

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,519
so we sent her to you.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,959
Didn't you promise

117
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,040
to treat her well?

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,959
Young Master Shen, please!

119
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,800
THE MASTER'S WILL IS LIKE THE DAWN;

120
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
IT CANNOT BE OBSCURED.

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,800
This is

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
Xiao Duo's sealed memory.

123
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,079
ALL WHO OPPOSE US

124
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,680
LIKE MOTHS TO A GARMENT,

125
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,800
OR FIRE TO A FIELD,

126
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,680
UNTIL NOTHING REMAINS.

127
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,959
You brought me

128
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,639
a brat made to target me.

129
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,839
And want me to keep her?

130
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,480
You're asking to die.

131
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,000
Ah!

132
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,879
Child, run!

133
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,279
Run!

134
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,600
Run, child!

135
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Don't look back!

136
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Kill her!

137
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:31,839
Run!

138
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,799
So this is Xiao Duo's hidden secret.

139
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,399
Her power

140
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,000
can even nullify Shen Jingshi's ability.

141
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,000
I always said you were a monster.

142
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,360
Had your parents send you away.

143
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,600
Go on, leave.

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
We can't handle you.

145
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,200
Okay.

146
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,080
Brother Meng won't cry.

147
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,759
Xiao Duo, you can't leave now.

148
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,200
Come on, Xiao Duo.

149
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,200
I'll take you for something tasty.

150
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,840
Let's go.

151
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,600
Xiao Duo

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,480
Go inside first, okay?

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Go lie down and rest a bit.

154
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,759
I'll come find you soon.
