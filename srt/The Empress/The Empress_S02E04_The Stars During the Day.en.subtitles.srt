1
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,083
Fienchen, will you come join us?

2
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,625
I'm making tea now.

3
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,416
And milk.

4
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,500
-Daddy has to have tea too.
-Yes.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,583
Do you want tea, Daddy?

6
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,625
Franz? Fienchen asked you something.

7
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,208
Yes. Sorry.

8
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:06,958
Where is my tea?

9
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,125
Thank you.

10
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,500
Who else wants some?

11
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,666
What are you thinking about?

12
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,916
Our visit to Milan.

13
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,166
I hope things in Lombardy calm down.

14
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,916
I think it was right
to give your brother that task.

15
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,875
-Don't you think?
-Yes.

16
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,333
We have to wait and see.

17
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,083
But other parts of the empire worry me.

18
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,833
Where do you want to go?

19
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,041
To Hungary.

20
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,333
I know we were just travelling
for such a long time.

21
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,750
-And you want to be with the children.
-Then let's just take them along.

22
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,500
-Really?
-Yes.

23
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,250
We'll go on a family adventure.

24
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,208
Yes?

25
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:57,916
To Hungary?

26
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,791
Are you serious?

27
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:03,958
The Hungarians are paying a very high
price for a revolution from ten years ago.

28
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,958
It's time for change.
I want to take a first step.

29
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,208
And what is this step
supposed to look like?

30
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,000
They are demanding a constitution.

31
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,416
-Do you want to permit that?
-I will present Elisabeth to them.

32
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,500
She is the one keeping
the people in our empire together.

33
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:25,333
Must I remind you how your last encounter
with one of those barbarians ended?

34
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't hate a whole nation
for the act of one individual.

35
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,916
One more thing.
The girls are coming this time.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,833
No, they're far too young for such a trip.

37
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:41,916
Fienchen is old enough. It could be
an important experience for her.

38
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:47,125
And, who knows, she may play
an important role in this empire someday.

39
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:41,000
THE EMPRESS

40
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,291
-Yes.
-Good morning, Countess.

41
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,458
-We wanted to pick you up.
-I'm not ready.

42
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,416
Your luggage is still here.

43
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,583
Take the Countess's luggage.
We're running late.

44
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,666
Yes, Countess.

45
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,458
Is the Princess here?

46
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,375
Have you seen her?

47
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,750
No, we haven't seen her.

48
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,083
Your Imperial Highness, where are you?

49
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,250
Poor thing.

50
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,250
Countess, are you unwell?

51
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,583
You are very pale.

52
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,041
Is the fever back? We thought
it was done after all those weeks.

53
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,125
It is done.

54
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,750
-Should I call for the Doctor?
-No, please don't.

55
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,666
I merely slept poorly.

56
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,333
I heard the kitchen staff
had the whooping cough.

57
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:27,583
-And two of our chambermaids had the flu…
-Pauline, it was just a cold.

58
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,416
I'll be right there.

59
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,541
You cannot possibly come on this journey.

60
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,250
Not in this state.

61
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,875
So, that's how it is.

62
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,000
So you can finally be rid of me.

63
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,041
I know it's not the flu.

64
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,500
What do you plan on doing?

65
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

66
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,666
Please leave.

67
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:04,916
Now.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,958
How pretty.

69
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,916
It smells good.

70
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,458
Yes.

71
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,416
Come on, then.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,500
I want to show you
something else before you leave.

73
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,208
Where did they come from?

74
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,875
You do that so well.

75
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,166
It's so cute.

76
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,750
It's a pity that you have to go

77
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,083
and won't see the kitties any more.

78
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,541
By the time you return, they'll be big.
Not small and fluffy any more.

79
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,125
Oh, well.

80
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,083
Come on now.

81
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,291
-It's time to leave.
-I'm not going.

82
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,791
I'm staying with you.

83
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,458
You can't, my dear.

84
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,791
Your mum and dad
want to take you on their big trip.

85
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,291
Sophie,

86
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,333
put the kitty down.

87
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,708
-No.
-You have to.

88
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,208
I'm not going. I'm staying here!

89
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,375
Kittens?

90
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,458
You can't be serious.

91
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:16,916
Where is she?

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,916
Hiding there under that bush.
She doesn't want to come out.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,166
I thought you liked it
when kids spend time in nature.

94
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,791
Don't take me for a fool.

95
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,083
This trip isn't right for her.

96
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,000
I decide what's right for her.

97
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,708
I'm her mother.

98
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,708
I know you won't believe me, Elisabeth.

99
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,791
But I will miss her.

100
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,791
You're right.

101
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,083
I don't believe you.

102
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,166
Wait, let me wipe your nose.

103
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,208
I hope you haven't caught a cold.

104
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,625
Leontine?

105
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,041
What's wrong?

106
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,583
I can't accompany you, Your Majesty.

107
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,958
-Will you please go outside? Thanks.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,541
Why not?

109
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,500
Is the fever back?

110
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,416
You should have rested more.

111
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,125
-I hope you're not angry at me.
-No.

112
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,875
Of course you'll stay here
if you're not well.

113
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,208
I would've loved to come along.

114
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,458
Now that you're finally going to Hungary.

115
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,708
Next time.

116
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,125
Will you promise me
that you'll see the doctor?

117
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,333
Yes.

118
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,291
Leontine, you must get better.

119
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,333
Thank you very much, Elisabeth.

120
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,541
Your Majesty, please.

121
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:26,541
Could I complain?

122
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:32,333
Could I be apprehensive?

123
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,166
Could I lose faith

124
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,958
In you

125
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:44,875
And in myself?

126
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,208
That was better already,
Your Imperial Highness.

127
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,958
More precision on your triplets, please.

128
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,708
And don't speed up on the sixteenths.

129
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,750
Yes.

130
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,125
I have one more thing.

131
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,416
When you sing, "Could I complain?
Could I be apprehensive?"

132
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,625
"Could I lose faith in you and in myself?"

133
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,458
it needs to be more powerful, you see?

134
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,083
"I could lose faith," he says.

135
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,791
But he doesn't.

136
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,916
Because he believes God is with him.

137
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,875
Even in the darkest hour,
he doesn't give up the fight.

138
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,750
One has to hear it.

139
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,750
Yes, Your Imperial Highness.

140
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,416
All right then, once more from the top.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,875
Could I complain?

142
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:49,333
Could I be apprehensive?

143
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:54,791
Could I lose faith in you

144
00:10:54,875 --> 00:11:00,916
And in myself?

145
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,958
I don't need anything, thank you.

146
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,416
It's me, Alexander.

147
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,000
I was so worried when I heard
you were no longer travelling to Hungary.

148
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,541
Then I was delighted
we could have some time together.

149
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,583
May I?

150
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,625
Of course.

151
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,416
Can I ask you something?

152
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,833
Yes.

153
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,791
Is there a reason you're angry at me?

154
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,875
You've been avoiding me. I…

155
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,000
I thought you'd lost interest in me.

156
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,625
I'm very interested in you.

157
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,333
It's this stupid cold. I…

158
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,000
Of course.

159
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,666
I'll leave you alone.

160
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,208
No.

161
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,541
Make me a tea.

162
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,958
You can do that, right?

163
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,083
Yes, I can do that.

164
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,458
I prefer you without the tight dress.

165
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,625
-Naked. How original.
-No.

166
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,958
I didn't mean it like that.

167
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,916
I think I really see you then, Leontine.

168
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,666
Can you imagine leaving this place?

169
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,416
Going someplace where we can start anew?

170
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,875
Away from court.

171
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,125
Away from politics.

172
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,375
Just a vegetable garden and…

173
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,375
maybe a child?

174
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,875
I thought you didn't want
to just be a housewife.

175
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,000
I might, but just not here.

176
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,666
You know, His Majesty and I…

177
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,375
We've built so much here.

178
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,875
And you're so important to the Empress,
and we still have such big plans here.

179
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,458
Forget it. It was stupid.

180
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,916
First you don't want to marry,
so you can work.

181
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,666
Now you want to marry, but not here?
Explain it to me.

182
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,250
Why don't we stay and marry here?

183
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,250
Children, come!

184
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,750
Come on, Klara!
I'm going to beat you there!

185
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,125
Food is served. Hurry.

186
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,333
Come! Hurry up!

187
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,583
-Wait for me. Don't go so fast!
-Or else the sisters will scold us again.

188
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,875
-Crybaby.
-I want to sit next to Joseph.

189
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,875
The youngest sleep here.

190
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:32,291
Many of them share a bed.
Actually, we're low on everything.

191
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,541
I'm happy when I don't have to send
the children to bed hungry.

192
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,750
Her Majesty would love to help
where it's most needed.

193
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,291
God bless the Empress.

194
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,416
The windows need to be replaced.

195
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,833
In the winter,
we lost 20 to whooping cough alone.

196
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,833
Tell me, newborns…

197
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,291
Do you also take them in your house?

198
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,625
Yes.

199
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,458
What was born out of sin,
we find on our doorstep.

200
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,500
Does it sometimes happen
that one of the children finds a new home?

201
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,916
The Empress wants to know.

202
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,916
The children here
find their home in the Lord.

203
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,375
Nothing more.

204
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,666
I know this world often leaves
young women no choice.

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,458
But no love is more powerful
than a mother's love.

206
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,666
Giddy-up!

207
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,791
Giddy-up!

208
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,750
Stop!

209
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,541
Welcome to Ofen, Your Majesty.

210
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,416
-I hope you had a pleasant journey.
-Out of the way!

211
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,291
Hello, ladies. May I take these for you?

212
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,875
Motion sickness.

213
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:20,291
You know, the streets in Hungary
are in much worse shape than ours.

214
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,041
Shut up!

215
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,083
-Put Gisella to bed, please.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,875
Do you not feel well?

217
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,916
Tummy ache.

218
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,125
Franz, Fienchen doesn't feel well.
It's surely from the long journey.

219
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,666
I want to walk with her
in the fresh air a bit.

220
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,583
We expect the Viceroy at seven o'clock,
Your Majesty.

221
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,833
I think it would do her good.

222
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,666
I'll come along.

223
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,083
-We have enough time.
-Yes.

224
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,333
Yes, Your Majesty.

225
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,791
Did you see? There's a river.

226
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,708
-Are you feeling a little better?
-Yes.

227
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,625
-Yes? And does your tummy still hurt?
-No.

228
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,958
Charlotte was feeling
very bad earlier too.

229
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,958
Where are the stars during the day?

230
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,875
Where are the stars during the day?

231
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,250
Come, I'll show you something.

232
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,583
-See how it sparkles?
-Yes.

233
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,666
What could that be?

234
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,833
Oh God. Now we have to go in the water.

235
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,625
Look.

236
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,916
Look how it sparkles.

237
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,083
-Maybe it's a star that fell from the sky.
-Yes.

238
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,541
For you.

239
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,458
Come, my darling. Come.

240
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,666
Here.

241
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,000
Show me your star.

242
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,833
Whoop.

243
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,708
She's just like you.

244
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,333
The same wild spirit for adventure.

245
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,500
I know.

246
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,958
But she has your tender heart.

247
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,083
Ew.

248
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,333
I wish it could always be like this.

249
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,208
No, I will carry

250
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:08,291
In my breast

251
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,708
Your heaven

252
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,041
For all times

253
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,333
And this heart

254
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:27,750
Before it breaks

255
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,833
Tea for you, ma'am.

256
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,583
Thank you. I must leave now.

257
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,208
If you'll excuse me,
Your Imperial Highness.

258
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,458
My auntie's celebrating
her golden wedding anniversary.

259
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,791
Yes, of course.

260
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,208
Your Imperial Highness,

261
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,333
Baron.

262
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,916
I very much enjoyed it today.

263
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,708
Me too.

264
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,416
May I ask you something?

265
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,083
Why do you do that?

266
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,666
What do you mean, Your Imperial Highness?

267
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,750
Placing your hand on the piano.

268
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,958
I can stop if it bothers you.

269
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,916
It doesn't bother me at all.

270
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,500
It helps me feel the sound of the notes,

271
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,166
their vibration under my fingers.

272
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,500
You play very beautifully,
Your Imperial Highness.

273
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,500
Forgive me.

274
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,250
I don't know why I said that.

275
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,208
It's best I go.

276
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,291
I feel the exact same way.

277
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,833
Was someone there?

278
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,916
You should go.

279
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,041
Goodbye.

280
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:33,500
We have to nip this illness in the bud
before it spreads.

281
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,916
He's practically still a child.

282
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,541
He's practically a man.

283
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,625
You can save your children
from many things,

284
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,625
on Earth.

285
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,000
But in the afterlife,

286
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,083
they will be on their own.

287
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,541
Don't worry.

288
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,708
I'll take care of it.

289
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,333
-Your Majesty.
-What's wrong with her?

290
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,416
-The Princess vomited.
-Does she have a fever?

291
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,583
She is a bit warm.

292
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,833
And yesterday before falling asleep,
she had a bit of diarrhoea.

293
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,208
Why didn't you tell me that?

294
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,583
I didn't want to wake you again,
Your Majesty.

295
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,916
It was so late.

296
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,583
Please call for a doctor.

297
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,708
Dr Seeburger arrived
with the imperial entourage.

298
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:27,875
Better than nothing.

299
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,541
Okay.

300
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:37,916
Open your mouth.

301
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,875
She had a low-grade fever
all night and this morning.

302
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:42,916
Oh, yes.

303
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,833
She's teething.

304
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,041
That is often accompanied
by an elevated temperature and diarrhoea.

305
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,416
-No reason for concern.
-She also vomited.

306
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,000
Your Majesty,

307
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,458
I am aware of the sometimes
oversensitive emotions of a mother,

308
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,208
but this child is healthy.

309
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,625
"Oversensitive emotions"?

310
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,666
All right.

311
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,458
Thank you, Doctor.

312
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,458
Your Majesty.

313
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,583
I can't stand him.

314
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,125
I know.

315
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,708
Go to the reception alone tonight, please.
I want to stay with Fienchen.

316
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,333
Elisabeth, I'm meeting
the Hungarian magnates,

317
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,458
including the new Justice Minister,
Count Nádasdy.

318
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:28,083
He wants me to pardon
the revolutionary leaders from back then.

319
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,791
I'm not sure yet
if it's the right thing to do.

320
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,666
-You being there would be very important.
-I know.

321
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,416
But I don't want to leave her alone today.

322
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,666
Come on, we're going to bed,
my darling, okay?

323
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,375
So you get better soon.

324
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,250
"And all the stars shone".

325
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:02,125
"And all the children gathered together
to see the little lamb".

326
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,708
Are you cold?

327
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,750
No.

328
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,083
Look, you'll see the stars soon.

329
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,416
How is my girl?

330
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,750
She's never had
such a high fever from teething.

331
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,958
Maybe we should return to Vienna?

332
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,541
There's nothing in Vienna
we don't have here.

333
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,625
Elisabeth, you heard the doctor.

334
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,666
You need to get some sleep.

335
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,708
Please.

336
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,625
How was the dinner?

337
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:07,291
Whenever I come alone, everyone
immediately expects a confrontation.

338
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,416
I'm sorry.

339
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:17,083
-I'll call Frieda so you can go lie down.
-No.

340
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,708
I'm going to stay with her tonight.

341
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,166
Thank you.

342
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:22,791
Good night.

343
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,375
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

344
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,541
We didn't want to wake you.
Look who's feeling better.

345
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,166
-Fienchen.
-Mummy.

346
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,125
Hello.

347
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,916
She ate some porridge too.

348
00:25:58,416 --> 00:25:59,625
I told you so.

349
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,208
No reason to worry.

350
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,625
Well, my darling?
I'm so happy you're feeling better.

351
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,791
You can perform
your duties without worry, Your Majesty.

352
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,750
You being with me
these next few days is very important.

353
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,083
Where do we need to go?

354
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:18,166
We'd be in the East Hungarian Plain
for three days.

355
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,666
I have to win over the large farmers.

356
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,375
Then we'll do that.

357
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,208
It is important.

358
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,041
Sit down.

359
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,666
You will not see the baron any more.

360
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,083
Your music lessons are over.

361
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,000
Please don't.

362
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,125
You are no longer a child, Ludwig.

363
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,958
In the spring, we will look for
a suitable candidate for you to marry,

364
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,583
so there are no rumours.

365
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,958
I'll mend my ways, Mother.

366
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,291
Please, please.

367
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,416
Don't take my music away.

368
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:28,000
I only want to protect you, Ludwig.

369
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,583
Please believe me.

370
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:35,666
Margarete.

371
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,500
Your Imperial Highness,
if you would follow me, please.

372
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,708
Where to?

373
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:53,208
Your special daily lessons
with Cardinal Rauscher begin today.

374
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,458
-No. Please, not the Cardinal.
-It is for your own good.

375
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,666
Minister, you have a guest
waiting for you in the small salon.

376
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,708
-A guest? What sort of a guest?
-A certain Count von Apafi.

377
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,041
Count von Apafi.

378
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:38,750
It is an honour.

379
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,958
Interior Minister von Bach.

380
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,416
Thank you for finding the time.

381
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,166
Please.

382
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:51,375
I hope you will forgive me
for showing up here unannounced.

383
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,708
-I happened to be passing through.
-But of course.

384
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,750
Leontine will surely be
very happy about your visit.

385
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,458
Minister, I'll be honest.

386
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,875
My wife and I are worried.

387
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,750
We have written to our daughter often
in the past two years

388
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,708
and have received next to no replies.

389
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:20,041
Then your marriage proposal came,
immediately followed by a withdrawal.

390
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,958
With all due respect,
what is going on here?

391
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,833
I understand you very well, Your Highness.

392
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:30,833
Let me begin like so…

393
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,666
Your daughter Leontine…

394
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,916
is Her Majesty The Empress's
closest confidant.

395
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,958
The Empress and my daughter?

396
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,375
You don't say.

397
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:50,916
Yes, this position
demands all of her energy.

398
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,750
She hardly has time for anything else.

399
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,291
And that's why the marriage proposal
is indeed off the table?

400
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,916
No, it is not.

401
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,750
I am more determined than ever,
Pount von Capafi.

402
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,041
Sorry, I mean Count von Apafi.

403
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,625
That's what I was hoping.

404
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:18,166
My wife insisted
that you have the wedding at our castle.

405
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:24,833
I have a photograph of the castle
that you will soon be the count of.

406
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,791
And this is Countess Agnes, my wife,

407
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:32,333
and Leontine
just before she departed to come here.

408
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,375
Leontine?

409
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,000
Where?

410
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,333
Here.

411
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,041
What do you think, Mr von Bach?

412
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,791
When can I see my daughter?
Is she here in the palace?

413
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,666
Countess von Lamberg, are you here?

414
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,916
One moment.

415
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,250
Baron von Bach, well, well.

416
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:33,833
What is this about?

417
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:37,875
The Countess von Apafi.

418
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,208
Did she get into trouble?

419
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,791
Do you still remember
her arrival at court?

420
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,625
Were there any inconsistencies?

421
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,791
Inconsistencies?

422
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,333
-No.
-Please.

423
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,250
Think about it. Anything would help.

424
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,750
Think, Margarete, think.

425
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,750
There was something with her shoes.

426
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,833
Countess Salm-Reifferscheidt,
God rest her soul,

427
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:11,208
kept going on about Countess Apafi
not acting like a countess.

428
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,250
That was Countess Salm-Reifferscheidt?

429
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,875
Amalia couldn't stand Leontine.

430
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,958
Schönbrunn is a snake pit.

431
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:27,250
Amalia also got hold of some photographs.

432
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,666
Of Leontine.

433
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you know what happened to them?

434
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,166
To the photographs?

435
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,750
No.

436
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,333
Amalia had that terrible accident.

437
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,291
I don't know.

438
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,125
Thank you.

439
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,583
They are very well-behaved.

440
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:07,875
Thank you.

441
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:27,458
A traditional dish.

442
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,125
Carp soup.

443
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,333
Carp from the Danube.

444
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,833
I do not recommend it, Your Majesty.

445
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,791
Phenomenal.

446
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:49,875
Thank you very much.

447
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,625
For you, Your Majesty.

448
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,666
Thank you.

449
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,958
Well done!

450
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,375
Truly wonderful.

451
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,000
Hey, you.

452
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,666
I thought you'd enjoy this.

453
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,083
Dr Seeburger sent me.

454
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:14,666
It's the Princess.

455
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,541
Her condition has worsened.

456
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,125
Prepare the carriage!

457
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,500
Hey! Go!

458
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:30,416
Yes!

459
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,625
Let's wait and see. Maybe it's not so bad.

460
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:40,333
Do you think they'd have notified us then?

461
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,125
I shouldn't have believed Seeburger.

462
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,500
No point blaming yourself
since we don't know what it is.

463
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,583
I should never have left.

464
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,416
When we left, she was doing well.

465
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,416
If she gets a fever, she gets a fever.

466
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,541
Us being there wouldn't have helped.

467
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,250
Being loved by your parents,
a sense of security,

468
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,750
that would've helped, Franz.

469
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,333
Even if you weren't taught that.

470
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:11,541
Hey!

471
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:24,750
Your Majesties.

472
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:25,791
Your Majesties.

473
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,291
Where is she?

474
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,291
Your Majesty, this is Dr Götz,

475
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,541
a paediatrician
and specialist from Vienna.

476
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,625
Specialist? For what?

477
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:38,333
Her Imperial Highness,
Princess Sophie, has typhoid fever.

478
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:42,500
What?

479
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,583
That can't be.

480
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,041
But she was feeling better.

481
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,708
I'm going to her.

482
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,958
Let's listen to the doctor.

483
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:55,125
I am sure the illness has been festering
for two or three weeks already.

484
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:59,958
The nanny informed me that the Princess
had diarrhoea a few days ago.

485
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,958
Yes, but there was never any mention
that it could be typhoid.

486
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:05,750
How could you miss that?

487
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,166
Your Majesty, typhoid symptoms,

488
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,958
in the early stages,
are unclear and easily mistaken.

489
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,666
And how can you be so sure

490
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,291
when he didn't recognise it
these last few days?

491
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:20,208
In the last three years,
I've seen over 500 children with typhoid.

492
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,958
I recognise it.

493
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:30,916
I'm here,

494
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,000
my darling.

495
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,833
Has she drunk anything?

496
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,416
She spits it all out.

497
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,958
I've been trying
with water and a spoon for hours.

498
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,333
Your Majesty.

499
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,791
She is terribly pale, Franz.

500
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,833
I'm here, my Fienchen.

501
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:58,416
My little girl.

502
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,708
Everything will be okay.

503
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,916
She'll get better, you hear?

504
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:08,875
Of course she will.

505
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,208
Is there anything you want to tell me?

506
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,708
-What do you mean?
-You know exactly what I mean, Leontine.

507
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,875
Oh, right. That's not even your name.

508
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,041
I don't even know your name.

509
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,708
Who would make up such a thing?

510
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:43,458
You've been lying to me all this time.

511
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,791
There have always been rumours about me,
you know that.

512
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,291
-Don't believe any of it.
-Your father is here.

513
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,708
Count von Apafi.

514
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,583
I spoke to him today.

515
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:00,541
Shall we go get him?

516
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:10,541
I never cared if you were rich or poor,
or how noble you were,

517
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,791
or where you come from.

518
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,666
But I can't live with an imposter.

519
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:19,125
My feelings were always real.

520
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,625
Who are you?

521
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:36,375
Did you have something to do
with Amalia's accident?

522
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:41,916
Say something!

523
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:51,208
Don't ask questions
you don't want answers to.

524
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,250
Is he still here?

525
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,375
Count von Apafi?

526
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,166
Does he know his daughter isn't here?

527
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,083
Not yet.

528
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:10,000
I… I'll say the Empress needed
her court lady Leontine in Hungary.

529
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,125
I won't betray you.

530
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I love you.

531
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:30,791
Pack your things.

532
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,458
Leave the palace before daybreak
and never come back.

533
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,375
You ridicule divine creation.

534
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,083
You insult it.

535
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,708
Do you understand that?

536
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,041
Stand up.

537
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:11,458
Embrace me.

538
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,041
God is with you.

539
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:27,500
Kneel back down.

540
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:34,875
Pray with me.

541
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,208
Oh Lord.

542
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,666
-Oh Lord.
-Deliver me from the sin of lust.

543
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,416
-Deliver me from the sin of lust.
-Deliver me from the sin of fornication.

544
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,125
Deliver me from the sin of fornication.

545
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:47,208
Deliver me
from all sins too powerful for me.

546
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,708
Deliver me
from all sins too powerful for me.

547
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:53,541
-Let me be cleansed by your blood.
-Let me be cleansed by your blood.

548
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,708
So that I triumph through my prayers.

549
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,666
So that I triumph through my prayers.

550
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:03,458
In the name of the Father,
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

551
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:04,750
-Amen.
-Amen.

552
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:06,333
Stand up.

553
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:08,500
Embrace me.

554
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,416
We're nearly done.

555
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,625
When you're better,
we'll have another tea party.

556
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,666
-Okay?
-Yes.

557
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:47,708
Please, my Fienchen,
you must swallow the water.

558
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,791
Just try it once.

559
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,333
Your Majesty, excuse me.

560
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,875
It's… It's just the poor thing…

561
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:01,500
Stop crying!
If you're going to cry, then get out!

562
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,333
My star.

563
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,291
The stone.

564
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:21,541
Why are you still standing there?
Look for the stone.

565
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,250
Of course, Your Majesty.

566
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:28,833
We'll have it soon.

567
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:41,291
Here it is.

568
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:00,625
You'll feel better soon.

569
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:09,791
O how beautiful

570
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:14,916
Is your world?

571
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:17,750
Father

572
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:24,500
When she shines with golden beams

573
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:37,500
When your gaze

574
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:42,958
Descends

575
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,875
And paints the dust

576
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:51,958
With a shimmering glow

577
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:04,416
Could I complain?

578
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,958
Could I be apprehensive?

579
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:15,333
Could I lose faith in you

580
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:21,416
And in myself?

581
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:26,000
No, I will carry

582
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:31,708
In my breast

583
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,958
Your heaven

584
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:41,083
For all time

585
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:47,625
And this heart

586
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:53,375
Before it breaks down

587
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,708
Shall drink in the glow

588
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:05,458
And the light

589
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:10,708
Drink in the glow

590
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:17,333
And the light

591
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:24,333
Fienchen, I fell asleep for a moment.

592
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm back.

593
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:27,916
My darling.

594
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,458
Fienchen?

595
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:34,166
Fienchen?

596
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:37,875
Wake up.

597
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:40,583
Wake up.

598
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,083
Franz?

599
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,416
Get the doctor.

600
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,291
Get the doctor!

601
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,416
Your Majesty, I…

602
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,625
-I am so very sorry.
-No, no.

603
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,416
No…

604
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,833
