1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,666
Do you like it?

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,291
It is very tight.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,666
One day, you will be
Emperor of this great empire, Franz.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,000
20 YEARS EARLIER

5
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,458
This empire is a precious treasure

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,125
that our enemies wish
to take away from us.

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,875
You have to protect
this empire in war and in peace.

8
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,166
Why me?

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,375
It is God's will.

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,625
He appointed you.

11
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,166
If God decides everything,

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,791
why does he make it
so there are wars and enemies?

13
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,833
It suits you wonderfully, Franz.

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,125
If I have a uniform,

15
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,083
will I also fight
in wars like the soldiers?

16
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,125
No.

17
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,208
The soldiers fight for the Emperor.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,791
You wear a uniform like them
so they can look up to you.

19
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,583
From now on, you will always wear it.

20
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,791
You are not like other people, Franz.

21
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,416
Don't forget that.

22
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:21,250
THE EMPRESS

23
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,041
Thank you, Theo.

24
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,666
This truly is a great day, Your Majesty.

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,041
Yes, that it is.

26
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,916
Your Majesty, the Archduchess.

27
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,166
Your Imperial Highness.

28
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,125
Franz, do you hear the bells?

29
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,125
We've waited so long for this day.

30
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:48,958
The uniform.

31
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,125
He's just been born.

32
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,875
He's not only getting
his name before God, Franz.

33
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,125
He gets his title too.

34
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,333
Where is he anyway?

35
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,625
Our little angel?

36
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,583
Elisabeth already took him with her.

37
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,708
Of course.

38
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,583
May I introduce you?

39
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,875
Your little brother.

40
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,833
You see? He's very quiet.

41
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,333
He cries less than you did back then.

42
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,208
But he's scared of strangers.

43
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,125
You'd have had to look out for him.

44
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,708
Here you are.

45
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,583
You are always with me, Fienchen.
No matter what I do.

46
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,958
Your father and I think of you always.

47
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:50,500
And so we baptise you,
Rudolf Franz Karl Joseph,

48
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,958
the future Emperor of Austria

49
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:58,125
and as of today Colonel
of the 19th Imperial Infantry Regiment.

50
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,958
-Amen.
-Amen.

51
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,125
Give him to me.

52
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,625
Everything's fine.

53
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,875
You did it.

54
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,041
You did it.

55
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,666
What's wrong with him?

56
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,500
He has to preside over an army
before he can walk. I'd cry too.

57
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,250
He'll have to lead an entire empire.

58
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,416
But not today.

59
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,208
Congratulations have arrived
from all over Europe. You see?

60
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,375
Over a thousand messages have arrived.

61
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,000
These are all letters
from your family back home.

62
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,833
These are well-wishes from the people.

63
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,583
This can't…

64
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,500
What is it?

65
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,750
Who is the letter from?

66
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,083
Countess Apafi.

67
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,208
From Leontine?

68
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,083
-What did she write?
-Just congratulations.

69
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,000
No address.

70
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,291
The stamp is no longer legible.

71
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,458
She's alive.

72
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,750
-To the heir to the throne!
-To the heir to the throne!

73
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,750
The future of Habsburg is secured.

74
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,416
Thank you.

75
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
Once you have a moment, we need to discuss

76
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,750
a somewhat unpleasant
foreign affairs development.

77
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,666
What kind of foreign affairs development,
Mr Minister?

78
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,208
It can wait.
I don't want to spoil this joyous event.

79
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,708
You already did.

80
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,166
We've received reports saying
thousands of volunteer fighters

81
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,208
from other Italian territories have joined
the independence movement in Lombardy.

82
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,416
It's descending upon us like an avalanche.

83
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Do I not get one single day to be happy
about the heir to the throne?

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
Where exactly are
these independence fighters from?

85
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,750
All of the Italian regions
support Garibaldi.

86
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,666
Modena, Parma, Sicily.

87
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,541
Have you spoken
to the Empress about Sicily?

88
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,625
I'm afraid the Empress will oppose it.

89
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,333
The Empress should submit
to the political situation in this case.

90
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,875
So we must urgently ensure the other
Italian states help us stop the rebels.

91
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,208
Our most important ally
is the Kingdom of Sicily.

92
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,416
We must bind them to us.

93
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,208
What is your plan?

94
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,583
The King of Sicily is terminally ill.

95
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:38,000
His son Francesco will take over,
but he doesn't have a Queen yet.

96
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,291
And you have one to spare?

97
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,458
To prevent Sicily
from becoming utterly irrelevant,

98
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,375
they urgently want a blood relative
of a high-ranking European ruling family.

99
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,833
We could give them that.

100
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,750
Mimi just turned 16.

101
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,750
-She is supposed to marry this spring.
-Franz, please.

102
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,250
She should find a man who she can stand.

103
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,416
Not everyone can be as lucky as us.

104
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:12,208
Marriages create political alliances.
And we need this alliance, urgently.

105
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,500
When's this supposed to happen?

106
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,583
I'm afraid our time
is already running out.

107
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,375
Down with the Habsburgs!

108
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,708
Freedom for Italy!

109
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,958
MILAN, AUSTRIAN PROVINCE

110
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,375
Freedom for Italy!

111
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,166
Down with the Habsburgs!

112
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,875
Freedom for Italy!

113
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,291
Down with the Habsburgs!

114
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,250
Freedom for Italy!

115
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,833
Down with the Habsburgs!

116
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,083
Your Highness.

117
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:54,041
We must leave immediately.
General Gyulai has imposed a curfew.

118
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,916
I am still Viceroy.

119
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,625
Your Highness, we must leave. Right now.

120
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,000
Freedom for Italy!

121
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,708
Down with the Habsburgs!

122
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,250
Freedom for Italy!

123
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,625
Down with the Habsburgs!

124
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,750
The situation is escalating.

125
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,333
Garibaldi's rebels
are coming from everywhere.

126
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,958
We're hearing about riots.

127
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,083
Almost every night.

128
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,791
According to reports, Piedmont
is gathering troops along our border.

129
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,250
Your Majesty,

130
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,541
we must declare war on Piedmont.

131
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,416
That is exactly what Cavour wants.

132
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,875
No, Your Majesty,
I think that is a big mistake.

133
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,166
For years, Cavour has been inciting
our people against us.

134
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,125
The other major powers are sympathising
with the Italian unification movement.

135
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:47,333
Queen Victoria is imploring us
to grant Lombardy independence.

136
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,791
For the sake of peace.

137
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,666
Then we ask Queen Victoria

138
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,000
to grant India independence
for the sake of the poor Indians.

139
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,875
The other major powers
want to see our empire shrink. That's all.

140
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,250
Lombardy belongs to Austria.

141
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,291
Declaring war on Piedmont is unavoidable.

142
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,583
Cavour wants to sit at the adults's table.
Then let him see what comes of it.

143
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:13,458
And that's exactly why I wonder
why the Piedmontese want a war

144
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,458
when Austria is so much stronger?

145
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,250
The rebels are fighting
for something they believe in.

146
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,291
And if they join forces
with troops from Piedmont,

147
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,416
we'll end up shooting at our own people.

148
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,958
Send an ultimatum to Turin in Piedmont.

149
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:37,833
Cavour has three days to lay down arms
and quit supporting the Lombardian rebels.

150
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,875
If he does so,

151
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,625
we'll sit down at the negotiation table.

152
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,416
And if not…

153
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,750
we will declare war.

154
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:55,916
Thank you.

155
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,250
Elisabeth's sister is coming today
for the bridal preparations.

156
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,625
I will make sure she travels on
to Naples as quickly as possible.

157
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,166
The Sicilians have to stop
the flow of rebels.

158
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,500
Prince Francesco of Sicily?

159
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,666
I've heard he is
intellectually somewhat challenged,

160
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,541
and that his appearance
is rather repulsive.

161
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,250
Then you had best not marry him.

162
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,625
Very well.

163
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,416
Have you ever been to Vienna?

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,875
No.

165
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,916
Do you know my sister, the Empress?

166
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,125
No.

167
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,791
I only know my home.

168
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,041
Only Bavaria.

169
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,625
Is Sicily pretty?

170
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,375
Yes.

171
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,500
Elisabeth.

172
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,875
Your Majesty.

173
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,000
It's so nice to see you.

174
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,416
I'm getting married. Can you believe it?

175
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,041
Your Majesty.

176
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,500
This is Donna Nina.

177
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,833
The King of Sicily
sent her to accompany me.

178
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,958
-She is my court lady now.
-Very pleased to meet you.

179
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,750
What are we doing today? What happens now?

180
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,166
I think we have
to try on your bridal garments.

181
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,625
Isn't that right?

182
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,166
Yes.

183
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,041
Is she always in such a good mood?

184
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,083
Yes.

185
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,250
There are lemon trees
and lizards all over in Naples,

186
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,000
and people only eat macaroni.

187
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,250
Did you know that?

188
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,541
I've missed you.

189
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,333
I'm meant to wear this when I arrive?

190
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,500
Do you think Francesco will like it?

191
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,375
Of course.

192
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,875
I don't know him at all.

193
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,500
I don't know what he looks like,
what he likes to do.

194
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,541
Nothing.

195
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,125
Please leave us alone for a moment.

196
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,791
Very well, Your Majesty.

197
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,708
-Let's sit down.
-Come along, ladies.

198
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,916
I know this is hard for you, Mimi.

199
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,041
Are you scared?

200
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,541
That's not it.

201
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:10,875
I haven't…

202
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,458
What? You can tell me, Mimi.

203
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,750
…bled yet.

204
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,166
Mother says you can't marry
if you haven't bled yet.

205
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,083
So in the fall,
I said it had already happened.

206
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,916
But it hasn't happened yet.

207
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,708
What should I do now?

208
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll think of something.

209
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,666
Her Majesty The Empress.

210
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,750
Your Majesty.

211
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,208
Your Majesty, what can I do for you?

212
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,250
My sister isn't ready to marry yet.

213
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,541
I feared you'd say that.

214
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,000
She hasn't menstruated yet.

215
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,791
That is unfortunate, but not a hindrance.

216
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,500
Since when isn't it a hindrance?

217
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:10,250
The Sicilians get a Habsburg bride
and help us in exchange.

218
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,500
Anything else is a problem for the future.

219
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,041
My sister knows nothing about her groom.

220
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,875
Not even what Francesco looks like.

221
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,541
I knew how my Karl looked.

222
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,208
That didn't make it any better.

223
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,250
I can withdraw my consent at any time.

224
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,625
Tell me the truth.

225
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,125
Francesco was a sickly child.

226
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,250
He didn't speak
until he was six years old.

227
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,958
They say he is withdrawn and hypocritical.

228
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,541
Francesco's father is a brutal ruler.

229
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,625
The people despise the whole family.

230
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,666
Will that do?

231
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,000
Men wage war.

232
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,625
We women get married
to secure our empires.

233
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,166
That is our place in history.

234
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,000
It has always been done this way.

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,166
Even if it comes to war, Elisabeth,
which I'm trying to prevent,

236
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,875
the Kingdom of Sicily's
over 1,000 kilometres away from Piedmont.

237
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,458
The people of Sicily
hate the royal family.

238
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,625
What do you think will happen
to that family and my sister

239
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,791
if a revolution breaks out there?

240
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,583
Sometimes a person has to make
a sacrifice to save many others.

241
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,416
Would you do that?

242
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,750
Make such a sacrifice?

243
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,583
Is there anything new?

244
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,666
My brother has given
the rebels and Piedmont three days

245
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,250
to lay down their arms,
or else there will be war.

246
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,000
He has no choice.
Piedmont will not stop provoking Austria.

247
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,666
Of course he has a choice. He could
negotiate with Cavour and Lombardy.

248
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,750
He won't do that.

249
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,375
Then it's the biggest mistake
of his reign.

250
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,708
-I can't allow that.
-Why not?

251
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,791
He's my brother.

252
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,208
He doesn't care what you think.

253
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,375
He's left you
in the lurch here for months.

254
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,083
Was it ever about Lombardy for you?

255
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,250
About the people?

256
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,791
Or is it always just about him?

257
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,625
Why did he even give me this position?

258
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,000
Maybe he wanted to see you fail.

259
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,208
-I have to speak to him.
-It's not enough, Maximilian.

260
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,583
This life here…

261
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,916
It's not enough for me.

262
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,916
I cabled.

263
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,916
We must speak to the Emperor at once.

264
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,708
Very well.

265
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,000
I hope you got some sleep last night,
Your Majesty.

266
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,083
Not until we hear from Piedmont.

267
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,375
Lieutenant Colonel Rosmini, Your Majesty.

268
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,708
He says it's urgent.

269
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,458
-I'll take care of it.
-No, have him come in.

270
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,125
Your Majesty, thank you for your time.

271
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,666
We confiscated this crate
after the last big riots

272
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,708
on our border to Piedmont.

273
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,375
Muskets.

274
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,333
The Piedmontese have been supplying
rebels in our country,

275
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,000
thousands of them for months.

276
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,166
We already knew that.

277
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,500
The French eagle.

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,833
Cavour and Napoleon
must have come to a secret agreement.

279
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,625
That means if we declare war on Piedmont…

280
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,375
We'll be at war with France.

281
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,958
Why didn't we know this?

282
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,416
I am just as surprised as you,
Your Majesty.

283
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,541
But it is not your job to be surprised!

284
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,500
Your job is to be prepared!

285
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,666
Your Majesty, I never would have thought

286
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,250
Napoleon would be allied with Cavour. I…

287
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know what he gets out of it.

288
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,958
He's using
the Lombards's discontent to destroy us.

289
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,166
Even Napoleon's army is not invincible…

290
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,458
That's not the point.

291
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,333
I want to decide who I go to war with!

292
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,916
And not be surprised on the battlefield!

293
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,708
You've all made that impossible.

294
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,875
Please go.

295
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,375
Is my sister here yet?

296
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,583
Yes, Your Majesty.

297
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,000
-Thank you.
-Elisabeth.

298
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,541
Your Majesty.

299
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,041
-Good morning.
-Look what Auntie Sophie gave me.

300
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,625
It belonged to Maria Theresia.

301
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,083
And it makes you look
like a real Queen, Mimi.

302
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,875
Maria Theresia was a steadfast woman.

303
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,250
She never gave up.

304
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,041
Even when things were difficult.

305
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,916
I'd like to speak to my sister alone.

306
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,083
Your sister and I spoke
candidly about the fact

307
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,333
that it might not be pleasant in Sicily.

308
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,750
But Mimi is a brave young woman,
aren't you?

309
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,208
And she wants to make our family proud.

310
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,416
I know that.

311
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,875
Why don't you want me to go?

312
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,166
I think Elisabeth is afraid
her own beautiful, young sister

313
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,083
might take her place in Europe.

314
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,833
You know that's nonsense, Mimi.

315
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,375
I have to get back to work.

316
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,166
Finish your meat, Mimi.

317
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,083
That will help with the bleeding.

318
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,208
Why did you tell her?

319
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,458
Because I don't want…

320
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,541
That was our secret.

321
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,291
Because I don't want you to go.

322
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,041
Why not?

323
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,333
It's too dangerous.

324
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,083
There may be a revolution.

325
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,291
And Francesco?

326
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,708
Are you jealous like Auntie Sophie said?

327
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,833
No, Mimi.

328
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,125
I just want you to know the truth.

329
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,291
You have no right to decide
what I can and can't do.

330
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,583
Stop.

331
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,708
Your Imperial Highness.

332
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,250
I want to see him right away.
Will you be okay alone?

333
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,625
I didn't know it was so huge.

334
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,583
Don't get jealous.

335
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,166
Jealousy is for those
who can't achieve what they really want.

336
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,458
I shall go for a walk.

337
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,125
His Imperial Highness,
Archduke Maximilian, Your Majesty.

338
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,083
Your Majesty.

339
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,500
I cabled that I was coming.

340
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,833
Withdraw the ultimatum.

341
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,791
We must negotiate with the Piedmontese.

342
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,125
The Piedmontese
aren't the only ones against me.

343
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,750
-What do you mean?
-Napoleon.

344
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:28,291
He's supporting the rebels.
He has an agreement with Cavour.

345
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,333
I think that's
what he wanted the whole time.

346
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,500
To force us into a war
without him having to start it.

347
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,041
Then we must give up Lombardy.
Only then will there be no reason for war.

348
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,083
And then?

349
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,541
Do you think that would end it?

350
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,541
Don't you understand what's happening?

351
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,083
Napoleon will keep encroaching
until he's here in Vienna with us.

352
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:56,000
I will not be the little boy
who draws in his horns to Napoleon.

353
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,666
This isn't you, Franz.

354
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,916
We ourselves are partly to blame.

355
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,083
If we'd listened to the Lombards in time.

356
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,916
Is that what you've been doing
the last year and a half?

357
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,791
And what has cost us so much money?

358
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:08,791
Listening?

359
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,708
I am very proud of what Marie
and I achieved in Lombardy.

360
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,875
But it wasn't enough.

361
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,875
You can't blame me for this disaster.

362
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:23,125
Just when I had the Lombards trust,
Gyulai came and ruined it.

363
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,625
On your damn command!

364
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,708
You gave me an impossible task.

365
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,791
You wanted to see me fail.

366
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,166
Why would I do that?

367
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,125
Because you can't forgive me.

368
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,666
That's no reason
to jeopardise my own empire.

369
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,958
Your Majesty.

370
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,041
We have a reply from Turin.

371
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,958
Read it.

372
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,208
Cavour rejected the ultimatum.

373
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,833
Is there news from Vienna yet?

374
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,416
From him?

375
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,041
Not yet.

376
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:39,625
We're declaring war on Piedmont,
and in doing so, on France as well.

377
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,291
Order mobilisation.

378
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,125
Absolutely the right decision,
Your Majesty.

379
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,416
Minister Grünne, Minister Buol,
this was your last deed for Habsburg.

380
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,250
I expect your resignations
by this evening.

381
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,541
Your Majesty,
we all misjudged the situation.

382
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,708
-But you can't make me…
-Napoleon deceived us, yes.

383
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,791
But since this conflict
in Lombardy-Venetia started,

384
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,875
you haven't had one sensible idea
for defusing the situation.

385
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,458
Send in the military, bolster it.
That was it.

386
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,708
That's not enough for me.

387
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,208
And as I was informed, Count Buol,

388
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:20,291
you've made lucrative investments
in our armament factories.

389
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,750
So you wanted to keep building up arms.

390
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,708
You served your own interests,
not Habsburg's.

391
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,166
You can leave.

392
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,958
I expect your resignation letter
by tomorrow morning too.

393
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,125
From me too?

394
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,958
You are the Viceroy of Lombardy.

395
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:57,791
The people must see
that our family is taking responsibility.

396
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,125
You need a scapegoat.

397
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,625
No, I need my brother.

398
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,333
Emperor Franz Joseph has declared war.

399
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,250
It happened exactly as you predicted.

400
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:33,541
That's good.

401
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:36,833
Isn't it, Your Majesty?

402
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,625
I just felt sorry for him for a moment.

403
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,041
Franz Joseph?

404
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:48,375
Why?

405
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,000
It's the beginning of the end for Austria.

406
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,666
He doesn't know it yet.

407
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,583
Franz?

408
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:03,791
Franz.

409
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,500
I had no other choice.

410
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,708
I know.

411
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:26,500
All throughout Europe, it will look
like the Emperor's little brother

412
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,291
failed as Viceroy.

413
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:30,875
It's war.

414
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:36,166
-I have to stand by my family's side.
-And this war is his fault alone.

415
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:37,666
Not yours.

416
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:39,666
He needs me.

417
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,083
That's what he said.

418
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,125
I need you.

419
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,666
Your family isn't good for you,
don't you see?

420
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,333
It is the only family I have.

421
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,375
I didn't mean it that way.

422
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,416
Habsburg.

423
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:05,708
Your family will be
on the wrong side of history.

424
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,625
Don't be stupid enough
to stand alongside them.

425
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,458
Mimi, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
made you question yourself.

426
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:33,625
No.

427
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,000
You were right.

428
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,958
I don't want to go there.

429
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:42,833
Give us a moment, please.

430
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,458
You have to go.

431
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,208
But…

432
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,333
you said you didn't want me to.

433
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,666
I know, but it's not about what I want.

434
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,708
What if the family
is just as awful as you said?

435
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,958
Then I don't want to go there.
Then I don't want to be their Queen.

436
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:09,583
Mimi, being a Queen doesn't mean
wearing pretty dresses and going to balls.

437
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,916
Being a Queen means giving people hope
when it gets dark around them.

438
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,125
And that's why you have to go.

439
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,166
So there's someone
the people can believe in now.

440
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:31,250
If it doesn't work out,
I'll come pick you up. I promise you.

441
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,958
Write as soon as you arrive.

442
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,291
You'll be proud of me.

443
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,791
I've always been proud.

444
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,291
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

445
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,791
I never would have imagined this.

446
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,500
That I would send my sister there?

447
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:30,083
That you would be a true Habsburg one day.

448
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,166
Giddy-up!

449
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:53,375
3 WEEKS LATER

450
00:30:56,625 --> 00:31:02,625
GARRISON HOSPITAL I, VIENNA

451
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,250
There were
several thousand dead in Magenta,

452
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,083
8,000 wounded, and 4,500 missing.

453
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:38,416
For now, General Gyulai
has ordered them to retreat.

454
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,750
Napoleon was ahead of us at every turn.

455
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:22,583
Your Majesty, what do you plan to do?

456
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,041
How could this happen?

457
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:37,208
Tens of thousands lost.
What is General Gyulai doing there?

458
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,791
What's wrong with you?

459
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,333
My brother is in the army.

460
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,875
He was there, in Magenta.

461
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,250
We cannot be weak now, Margarete.

462
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:13,125
What kind of an example
would we be for our soldiers?

463
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,708
Of course, Your Imperial Highness.

464
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,458
LEONTINE
COUNTESS APAFI

465
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,500
Your Majesty, do you desire something?

466
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,666
I often wonder what Leontine would do.

467
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,708
What she would advise me
to do in a situation like this.

468
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,041
I know you had
a special bond with Leontine.

469
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,625
I will never be able to replace her.

470
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,958
But if there's anything I can do…

471
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,333
Is there anything
about Leontine that I don't know?

472
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,791
There are things
you don't know, Your Majesty.

473
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,458
When Leontine left…

474
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,958
she was expecting a child.

475
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,833
All the other stories about Leontine
were just nasty rumours.

476
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,708
Your Majesty.

477
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,125
Her Majesty The Empress.

478
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:18,250
What can I do for you, Your Majesty?
Is this about your visit to the hospital?

479
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,583
Leontine lied to both of us, Mr von Bach.

480
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,625
I know as little
about her real identity as you do.

481
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,000
Or where she came from.

482
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,708
Countess Apafi, or whatever
that woman's name was, was an imposter.

483
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,916
And she is not worth you wasting any more
of your precious time on this matter.

484
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,791
She was expecting a child.

485
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,541
I tried everything I could to find her.

486
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,625
But I don't think I'm the one
who has to look for her.

487
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:18,208
The Lord is on our side.

488
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,958
He will lead us to victory in this war.

489
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:29,166
Do you remember the day I got my uniform?

490
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:34,833
I asked you why the good Lord
allows war and all this suffering

491
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:35,916
if He is omnipotent.

492
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,541
I remember it well.

493
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,541
To this day, I don't have an answer.

494
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,416
But I don't expect one either.

495
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,208
I baptised you.

496
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:55,958
I crowned you.

497
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,333
I married you.

498
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,916
I know you, Franz Joseph.

499
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,625
You may be an Emperor by God's grace,

500
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:06,458
but you feel, suffer,
and doubt like every other person.

501
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,458
That is your weakness.

502
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,625
But it is also your strength.

503
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:20,791
You're right.

504
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,541
Excuse me, Your Eminence.

505
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,958
Your Majesty, do you have a moment?

506
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,000
What is this?

507
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,000
Excuse me?

508
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,500
We lose thousands of soldiers each day,
and you want to leave now?

509
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:02,291
-This war is not your fault, von Bach.
-It's mine as much as it was all of ours.

510
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:08,708
I… Over this past year,
I haven't always had the clearest head.

511
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:10,875
You are the only one I can trust.

512
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,791
Whatever you blame yourself for,

513
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:15,916
it is forgiven.

514
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:18,916
That is very generous, Your Majesty.

515
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,833
But I still ask to be removed
from my position.

516
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,500
What if I refuse?

517
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,416
I will leave the court, Your Majesty.

518
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,958
I have to make up for a big mistake.

519
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,541
Even if it means giving up this position.

520
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:42,958
Your Majesty, working with you
was the greatest honour of my life.

521
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,583
Alexander?

522
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,666
I don't think it's ever too late
to do the right thing.

523
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,041
Franz.

524
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:22,875
Leave us alone, please.

525
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,708
I've made a decision.

526
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,125
I'm going to the front.

527
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,708
What?

528
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,875
Why?

529
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,666
Because it's what's right.

530
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,041
Do you think it will make it better?

531
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,375
Do you think you can do it better
than your generals?

532
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:58,875
No, I don't.

533
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,083
You were right, Elisabeth.

534
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:06,375
I've never made a sacrifice.

535
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,583
I've been wearing
this uniform for 20 years.

536
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:14,958
For what?

537
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,416
Please, Franz. Don't do it.

538
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,125
You've seen with your own eyes
what this war is doing.

539
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,291
I must take responsibility.

540
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,791
I need your support.

541
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:55,833
I have something to tell you.

542
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,875
I relieved General Gyulai of his command.

543
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,125
At the end of the week,
I will go to the front in Lombardy

544
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,875
and assume command of the troops.

545
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,291
My mind is made up.

546
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:15,750
Why?

547
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,583
Over 6,000 dead.

548
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:22,208
Just as many wounded.
The morale of the army is at rock bottom.

549
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,666
That's life in a war.

550
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,333
A war I didn't want.

551
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:29,708
The least I can do
is be with the soldiers.

552
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:33,833
No, Franz.
You don't belong on the battlefield.

553
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:36,375
That's for soldiers,
and you are the Emperor.

554
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,166
Napoleon is there too.

555
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,041
Napoleon is a General.

556
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,708
Someone who takes what he wants.

557
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,458
You are not made for war. You are…

558
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,500
Too weak?

559
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,958
I knew all of Europe sees it that way,
but not my own mother.

560
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,125
Is this your idea?

561
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,708
No.

562
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:06,041
It sounds like it's your idea.

563
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:08,166
I support him.

564
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,083
Excuse me.

565
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:27,708
You're right, Mother.

566
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,208
There is a difference
between Napoleon and me.

567
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,166
He made himself Emperor.

568
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,041
I never had a choice.

569
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:56,583
Franz.

570
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:00,708
You said you needed me.

571
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,791
If something should happen to you,

572
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:09,166
I'll be here.

573
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,125
I have a son, Maximilian.

574
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,333
He isn't even a year old.

575
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,625
I can take over in the meantime…

576
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,666
Between our mother and my wife,
the Empire is in good hands.

577
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,708
What do you need me for, Franz?

578
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:29,208
-Ever?
-It's not about you.

579
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:33,916
-We're fighting for our empire.
-I don't think it's my empire.

580
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,416
It is neither your empire, nor my empire.

581
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,333
I need to preserve it.

582
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,833
For this brief moment in eternity.
That is all.

583
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,375
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

584
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,250
Blessed art thou among women,

585
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,875
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

586
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,458
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

587
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:26,666
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of our death.

588
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,458
Thank you, Theo.

589
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,083
Attention!

590
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,666
See you soon, Mother.

591
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:42,666
Which hand?

592
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,166
This one.

593
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:56,083
Fienchen asked where the stars are
when you can't see them.

594
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:18,541
We'll see each other again.

595
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,250
Attention!

596
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,125
Get up.

597
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:00,583
Go away.

598
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:03,875
Go away!

599
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,541
Why are you all that I have left?

600
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,333
What if he doesn't come back?

601
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,250
I've sacrificed so much.

602
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:41,791
I know.

603
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,125
What if this empire was never worth it?

604
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:50,500
What if I can't stop the darkness?

605
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,333
All we can do is have hope.

606
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:01,500
And carry on.

607
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:05,791
Today.

608
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:30,708
