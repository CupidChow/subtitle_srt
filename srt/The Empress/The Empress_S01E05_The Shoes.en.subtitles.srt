1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,541
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:23,958
Help!

3
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,375
Whoa!

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,875
Help!

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,250
-Whoa!
-Stop!

6
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,166
Why have we stopped?
We're expected at court.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,458
I need help.

8
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,791
What's wrong, girl?

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,875
Good heavens, girl.

10
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,083
Is someone after you?

11
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:49,958
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,750
What--

13
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,250
It's all here.

14
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,666
Countess Leontine von Apafi.

15
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,333
One fewer.

16
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,541
We have to go.

17
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,375
For the people.

18
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,125
For the people.

19
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,625
Your Majesty?

20
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,666
-What are you doing here?
-Says the Empress in a tree.

21
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,625
Oops.

22
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,500
Cigarette?

23
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,208
-Thank you, Majesty.
-You're wearing my patience thin.

24
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,458
I've told you ten times
to call me Elisabeth.

25
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,541
-What is that?
-A Bulgarian woodtit.

26
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,833
Hey!

27
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,041
Is someone there?

28
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,750
I saw a fox.

29
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,416
At the entrance.

30
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,166
A fox?

31
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,041
You should go look. It could have rabies.

32
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,083
I walk here every morning
with the Empress.

33
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:18,958
Go on, then!

34
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,250
Your Majesty?

35
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,625
It's time.

36
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,208
Franz?

37
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,833
Is he still here?

38
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,625
His Majesty has already departed.

39
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,583
And Countess Esterhazy awaits you.

40
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,708
In the name of the Imperial family
and all residents of the Habsburg Empire,

41
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:49,666
I wish you courage,
strength and confidence.

42
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,541
It's an honour
to fight for the fatherland.

43
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,708
You have taken an oath to me,

44
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,666
but you do not serve me alone…

45
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,416
you serve the Almighty God.

46
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:17,916
Forgive me.

47
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,916
Honestly, I have no idea
what to say to you.

48
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,875
You're the ones leaving your families,
not me.

49
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,375
You're going to a part of the Empire
hardly anyone knows.

50
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
You're the ones who protect our empire.

51
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,625
Not the Almighty, not me, but all of you.

52
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,083
And I am eternally grateful for that.

53
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,750
My hope…

54
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,625
No, my conviction is,

55
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,000
that we can preserve peace on our borders.

56
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,625
But sometimes peace comes at a high price.

57
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,833
Show the Russian army
that we do not wish to go to battle,

58
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,000
but that we're prepared to at any time!

59
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,583
May God protect you.

60
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,125
Attention!

61
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,041
First Battalion and right!

62
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,416
Second Battalion and left… about face!

63
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,833
Forward,

64
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:37,875
march!

65
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,750
Warmonger!

66
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,250
Today's visit is of great importance.

67
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,375
The Empress is concerned for her people.
The people must see it.

68
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,166
But never forget,

69
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,000
to the people, you are a divine being.

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,916
Always follow these three rules.
Do not touch anyone.

71
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,541
Ever.

72
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,833
No direct eye contact.

73
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,500
And do not speak familiarly with anyone.

74
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,625
The Empress must always remain
untouchable, unapproachable.

75
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:41,958
Always.

76
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,375
We will visit several workshops.

77
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,083
You will receive a gift
from the workers each time.

78
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,375
Will I also bring a gift? For the people?

79
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,291
You are the gift.

80
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,166
The people of Vienna are agitated.

81
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,875
Because of the mobilization, I know.

82
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,625
Because of the Russia conflict,

83
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,500
which has escalated
in no small part due to you.

84
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,625
It would've escalated without me as well.

85
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,625
Really? And the Emperor would've been
humiliated without your help?

86
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,125
Go out. Show your face.

87
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,791
Do something for him.

88
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,791
Can we skip that today?

89
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,750
I can barely breathe.

90
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,708
Soldiers are pushing through sickness
and hunger towards the fronts.

91
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,583
Swallow it.

92
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,666
Not on the dress!

93
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,375
Now it's on the dress. Wipe it off.

94
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,500
It is about time
you serve your purpose, Elisabeth.

95
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,583
Come on, Hedi. We'll be late for work.

96
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,583
Are you ready?

97
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,833
I spy with my little eye…

98
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,916
I'm not five anymore.

99
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,375
I spy with my little eye something…

100
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,416
red.

101
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,666
My nose?

102
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,375
There's nothing red here.

103
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,083
Close your eyes.

104
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,250
Open them.

105
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,750
Where did you get those?

106
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,250
That's my secret.

107
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,375
Let's go.

108
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,708
Your Majesty.

109
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,208
Sorry, but I have to speak to you.

110
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,541
Von Sina cancelled on you.

111
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,958
I'm not surprised.

112
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,500
He said he'd suspend all future payments.

113
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,625
He said you broke your word
by sending 200,000 soldiers instead of--

114
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,750
I know!

115
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,583
Leave me alone.

116
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,250
Clear this away.

117
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,041
Clear it away!

118
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,625
For… Forgive me, Theo.

119
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,458
The Empress wishes to see you.

120
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,916
If I may, Your Majesty.

121
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,000
When it seems
as if everything is falling apart,

122
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,291
things sometimes fall into place.

123
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,583
-I wanted to see…
-You were gone when I woke up.

124
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,250
-Sorry, go on.
-You first.

125
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,541
I was looking for you.

126
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,250
If you wander around at night,
we'll always miss each other.

127
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,583
How were the troops?

128
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,708
I have a bad feeling.

129
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I can feel the tension in the city.

130
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm going out today.

131
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,833
Showing my face, as your mother says.

132
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,083
Well, you have a good face.

133
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,458
Do not worry.

134
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,500
An iron foundry, you know?
Maybe one day, they'll build our rails.

135
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,833
A smile, thank heavens.

136
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,416
I'm sure it will be a good day.

137
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,125
Good morning, Your Imperial Highness.

138
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,000
Is it your lucky charm?

139
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,208
That looks like a lady's ring.

140
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,291
An engagement ring.

141
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,500
It was.

142
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,833
And where's the lady it was for?

143
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,541
Did she break your heart?

144
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,375
She's dead.

145
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,000
Good heavens. My deepest apologies.

146
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,375
Perhaps you will find love a second time.

147
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,333
Leave now.

148
00:16:59,041 --> 00:16:59,916
Please.

149
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,291
My beloved people,

150
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,291
a great change
can also be a new beginning.

151
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:38,125
I will receive the Imperial crown
with dignity and humility.

152
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,000
With dignity and humility, with…

153
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,958
…receive it with dignity and wisdom.

154
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,791
What is the situation on the front?

155
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,000
The Russian army is holding its position.
The Tsar won't budge.

156
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,791
Once reinforcements arrive at the border,
we can attack at any time.

157
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,208
-As soon as Your Majesty commands.
-No.

158
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,291
No attack.

159
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,750
Our army will stand along the border.

160
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,375
Like a wall.

161
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,000
The troops will show resolve
and intimidate the Tsar

162
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,791
without destroying
diplomatic relations for good.

163
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,375
A wise decision.

164
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:27,291
I… I'd like to point out
the situation in Vienna is also tense

165
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,416
because troops were redeployed.

166
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,750
Baron von Kempen will deal with that.

167
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,458
If you'll excuse me.

168
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,333
If I may.

169
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,500
I doubt pressure
from the police is the solution.

170
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,166
Hundreds of arrests since the wedding
haven't ended the unrest.

171
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,083
Your Majesty.

172
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,208
Tell Kempen to tread lightly.

173
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,000
You've suffered a setback. That hurts.

174
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,875
The time for your ideas will come.
I promise.

175
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,666
But it's all a question
of the right moment.

176
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,541
Now, you will defend our empire.

177
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,000
Do you really think now

178
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,500
is a good time
to send Elisabeth into the city?

179
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,291
She will calm the people down.

180
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,666
Stability, security
and order are important now.

181
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,083
When chaos reigns, we need control.

182
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,166
Not change.

183
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,416
I want to know if we are in accord, Franz.

184
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,041
The world is changing, Mother.

185
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,791
The question is
whether this family will too.

186
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,791
The Archduke is familiar with such visits.

187
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,166
He's beloved among the people.
Isn't that so, Your Highness?

188
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,833
I'm happy you came along today.

189
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,708
Are you afraid?

190
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,791
Of the people? No.

191
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,083
But of her?

192
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,333
Yes.

193
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,958
When I get nervous, I always say,

194
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,208
"How nice. Thank you very much."

195
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,708
And I bow my head a bit.

196
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,625
Like this…

197
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,750
Give it a try.

198
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,333
How nice. Thank you very much.

199
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,250
When there is something to eat or drink,

200
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,708
I don't swallow it.

201
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,250
I put it in my cheeks
and spit it out later.

202
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,750
-Make way!
-Elisabeth!

203
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,916
Make way!

204
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,583
-Elisabeth!
-Get away!

205
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,250
Elisabeth! Elisabeth!

206
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,333
-May I not see my empire?
-Not all at once.

207
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,916
Elisabeth!

208
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,625
-Elisabeth.
-Everyone, step back!

209
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,750
Step back!

210
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,166
-I can't see a thing!
-Didn't you hear? Step back!

211
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,583
Elisabeth!

212
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,750
-Elisabeth!
-Elisabeth!

213
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,375
Your Majesty.

214
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,791
Your Majesty.
It is an indescribable honour.

215
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,041
How nice. Thank you very much.

216
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,708
May I introduce our workers?

217
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,333
Your Majesty.

218
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,208
Hello.

219
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,291
We've been forging iron for over 50 years.

220
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,791
We produce everything from ovens

221
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,875
to balustrades and fountains.

222
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:23,750
Of course, we have shifted
to making cannons and other armaments.

223
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,625
We have 135 employees.

224
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,666
Our factory is
up to the most modern standards.

225
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,416
Allow me,
in the name of everyone in the shop

226
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,166
to present this gift to you, Your Majesty.

227
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,833
As a sign of our devotion
to the divine House of Habsburg.

228
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,458
Thank you very much.

229
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:50,666
The workers also went
without a day's pay to support the army.

230
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,916
-I beg your pardon?
-May God protect the Emperor.

231
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,291
May God protect the Emperor.

232
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,041
Your Majesty,
the coach is waiting to depart.

233
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,500
Our schedule allows for no delays.

234
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,125
If I may, I'd like to go inside
and see how the people work.

235
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,958
I'm afraid
we have no time for that, Majesty.

236
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:20,875
I think we do.

237
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,125
Look over here, Elisabeth!

238
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,458
Over here!

239
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,333
Look over here, Elisabeth!

240
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,583
BRONZE & IRON FOUNDRY
H. WINKELMANN

241
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,291
Take it off, come on!

242
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,333
Take it off!

243
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,541
Hello.

244
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,541
That goes over here!

245
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,125
We need two more men!

246
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,500
Go take a look, boys.

247
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,291
The fumes are harmful, Your Majesty.

248
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,833
-I kindly request…
-I'm just looking around.

249
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,333
Your Imperial Majesty, are you unwell?

250
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,333
We really ought to go now!

251
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,416
Go away, girl!

252
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,291
No. Wait.

253
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:33,708
I thank you.

254
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,541
-You're completely useless.
-We're leaving!

255
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,083
Get rid of that!

256
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,333
What's your name?

257
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,250
Mine?

258
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:51,166
Do you work here too?

259
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,166
Yes, Majesty.

260
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,041
Your Majesty, with all due respect.

261
00:24:56,125 --> 00:25:00,333
-Elisabeth! Elisabeth! Elisabeth!
-Give me a moment. Please.

262
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,291
Elisabeth! Elisabeth!

263
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,416
-Elisabeth! Elisabeth!
-Why don't we get to see her?

264
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,291
Didn't you hear that?
You're to step back! Back! Now do it!

265
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,166
-You have not told me your name.
-Hedwig, Majesty.

266
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,708
But everyone calls me Hedi.

267
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,500
Elisabeth!

268
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,958
Elisabeth!

269
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,458
Back! Back!

270
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,875
My brother wants to buy me new ones.

271
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,125
Don't you have parents?

272
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:38,958
Elisabeth!

273
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,666
Good gracious!

274
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,166
What are you doing?

275
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,083
You will grow into them.

276
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,833
Elisabeth! Elisabeth!

277
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,791
Carry the Empress out. Immediately.

278
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:04,333
What are you waiting for, Kempen?

279
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,625
Her Majesty must be carried.

280
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,083
No. I can walk.

281
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,708
An empress is not allowed
to touch this floor.

282
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:13,958
I will walk.

283
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,291
Kempen, let me down right now!

284
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,833
Let me down!

285
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,583
There she is!

286
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,500
Let me down, please.

287
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:32,041
Elisabeth! Elisabeth!
Elisabeth! Elisabeth!

288
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,458
-The delicate lady!
-Please let me down.

289
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:36,291
Yes, don't get dirty!

290
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,833
Let me down!

291
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,583
She can't walk on her own or what?

292
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,583
Damn Imperial scum!

293
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,000
Drive!

294
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,208
Leave the child alone!

295
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,666
Elisabeth!

296
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,875
What's happening to those people?
He must stop!

297
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,833
We will return to the palace at once.
No further visits.

298
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,250
Are you all right?

299
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,333
This happens
when you get too close to the riff-raff!

300
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,625
I warned you!

301
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:06,458
ESTEEMED MOTHER - DEAR FATHER
LEONTINE VON APAFI

302
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:40,750
Blood.

303
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:44,708
Countess Apafi?

304
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,125
Von Bach, you may remember me.

305
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,333
Do you have a moment?

306
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,333
I wanted to…

307
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,583
Would you come walk with me?

308
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:08,458
From the first day,
I sensed you were different.

309
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,000
Don't get me wrong.
That's just what I like.

310
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,875
I'm from a small village myself,
not far from here.

311
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,791
Unlike yours, my father is not a count.

312
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,625
At times, I'm not sure
how I ended up here.

313
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,458
It sometimes seems like a dream.

314
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,875
What am I doing? I'm talking on and on.

315
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,125
Did you know that…

316
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,833
we have wonderful works
in our art gallery from a painter

317
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,791
who worked near your hometown?

318
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,416
Near Hermannstadt, right?

319
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:49,750
Yes.

320
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:53,916
It would bring me great joy
to look at them with you.

321
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,125
Maybe another time. I must--

322
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,291
The Empress won't be back until evening.

323
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,541
Please.

324
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:08,875
I've been looking
for the courage to speak to you.

325
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,291
Now, I cannot wait another day.

326
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:20,666
Very well.

327
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:25,333
The southern armed forces, the navy
and the Hereditary Lands support us.

328
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:29,833
We already have contacts with newspapers,
the postal service and secret services.

329
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,291
I sense a "but."

330
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,916
You still lack three things, Highness.

331
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
-One, the support of the military.
-I know. Next one?

332
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:40,708
The support of the Catholic Church.
To convince the army, we need…

333
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:43,791
A blessing from above.
Rauscher listens to my mother. Next?

334
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,000
Your mother.

335
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,625
Damn it.

336
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,333
I'll take care of her last.

337
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,916
You know, gentlemen,
such an opportune moment won't come again.

338
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,500
The Emperor is extremely weakened.
The people are no longer on his side.

339
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,083
Give me a few days, then we'll be ready.

340
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,375
Your Majesty, the visitor you requested.
Countess Gundemann.

341
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,125
Show her in.

342
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:31,666
Your Majesty.

343
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,250
Nice to see you.

344
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,958
You look radiant, Louise.

345
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:44,958
Somehow different.

346
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,916
Perhaps that's due
to my recent engagement.

347
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,541
My most heartfelt congratulations.

348
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,625
Baron von Sina will make
an honest woman out of me.

349
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,708
You don't need a man for that.

350
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,541
You can marry, but I cannot?

351
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,833
No, I am just surprised.

352
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:11,708
You are a countess.
Von Sina is merely a baron.

353
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,500
Isn't that a step down for you?

354
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,916
I was never looking for a higher title.

355
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:19,166
What are you looking for then?

356
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,000
Simon gives me security.

357
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,333
And he's giving me an island.

358
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,000
What harm could it do?

359
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,750
Let's toast to that.

360
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,125
To love.

361
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,833
I have only loved once.

362
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,708
I didn't want to hurt you.

363
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,291
Who says I meant you?

364
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,791
Strange being back here.

365
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,291
Everything seems so much

366
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,041
smaller than before.

367
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,875
I need your fiancé's support, Louise.

368
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,958
You broke your word.

369
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,375
Simon wanted to support
your infrastructure plans.

370
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,125
Not a military venture.

371
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,875
The circumstances forced my hand.

372
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,500
I still want to change the Empire.
I mean that.

373
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,666
Can't you speak to him again?

374
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,041
I thought you invited me,
so we could be friends.

375
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,291
But nothing has changed.

376
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,791
You are using me, Majesty.

377
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:44,750
No, that is not true.

378
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,125
I need you.

379
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,333
I want you to beg.

380
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,250
I beg your pardon?

381
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,750
Doesn't feel good, does it?

382
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,333
I beg you, Louise.

383
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:16,291
Help me.

384
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,333
For the good of our people.

385
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,916
Very well, I'll see what I can do.

386
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,375
And you give some thought…

387
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:36,500
to what you can do for me in the future.

388
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,041
Your Majesty.

389
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,750
There was an incident
during the Empress's visit today.

390
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:07,041
-A servant will carry you.
-No one will!

391
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,875
Majesty, at least put shoes on.

392
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:14,541
If you let me walk like a normal person,
we could've avoided this!

393
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:18,333
If Your Majesty had listened to me,
we could've avoided this!

394
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,458
Put the shoes on!

395
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,083
Please.

396
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,208
Leave me alone.

397
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:43,250
His Majesty, the Emperor.

398
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:50,708
Are you well?

399
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:56,083
You put yourself and others in danger
with your stubbornness.

400
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:00,625
No, I didn't.

401
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,625
You caused a riot.

402
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:06,583
-Elisabeth surely did not intend that.
-But it did happen.

403
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,791
You have no sense
of what is proper and what is not.

404
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,708
You went too far,
and it's not the first time.

405
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:17,916
-I saw how the police treat the people!
-The police protected you.

406
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,791
Kempen and his men are the dangerous ones.

407
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,041
That is ridiculous!

408
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,416
Please leave us alone.

409
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,083
I don't understand you.
What was that about?

410
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,000
Why didn't you leave
when Kempen ordered it?

411
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,958
Because it felt right to stay.

412
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,208
Elisabeth.

413
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:03,083
You can't get so close to the people.
It's dangerous.

414
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,125
Why?

415
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,583
Because you're the Empress!

416
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,541
You are above them.

417
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:11,083
That's precisely why they hate us all.
We don't act human.

418
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:14,166
No talking to them,
looking at them, touching them.

419
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,750
You want to hand out bread?

420
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,541
Sorry, Elisabeth.
It's a bit more complicated.

421
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,791
People are suffering. Simple.

422
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,375
You have no idea
what I'm doing to bring change!

423
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,291
And your bleeding heart
doesn't help me at all.

424
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:23,041
I will think of a way
to get a better handle on the girl.

425
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,458
It's a bit too late for that,
don't you think?

426
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:31,416
If she has another misstep
and fails to get pregnant again,

427
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,958
there will be consequences.

428
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,708
-I completely agree with you.
-For you too.

429
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,750
What do you mean, Your Imperial Highness?

430
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:44,958
That is all.

431
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,875
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

432
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,833
How long has it been
since your last confession?

433
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:18,791
That is your first question?

434
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:19,875
For God's sake.

435
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,625
Since the death of your fiancée,
I believe.

436
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:23,958
God rest her soul.

437
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,958
I am happy
you have found your way back to God.

438
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,375
Speak, my son.

439
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,458
I have cursed…

440
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:34,583
What do you call it?

441
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,875
Taken the Lord's name in vain.

442
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:41,166
I have… done everything on the list.
I beg for forgiveness.

443
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,416
Pray,

444
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,666
and the Lord will unburden your soul.

445
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,791
There is more, Your Excellency.

446
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:04,791
I know you wish the Church
and state to be more closely tied

447
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:08,666
and for Habsburg's neighbouring
Catholic regions to be part of the Empire.

448
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,791
If there were a new ruler,

449
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:15,500
if it were time to make a change,
what position would you take?

450
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:31,083
You don't even know the Lord's Prayer,
and you want my support to seize power?

451
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:32,250
I am a pragmatist.

452
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:36,125
What is your vision for our empire?
What do you stand for?

453
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,958
I always get what I want.
That is my strength.

454
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,291
Who are you to question God's plan?

455
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,916
We changed emperors once. Why not again?

456
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,375
The people are on my side.

457
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,958
That does not worry me.

458
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:53,958
What does?

459
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,541
If you stand for nothing, Maximilian,

460
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,833
what will you fall for?

461
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:07,666
Elsa.

462
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,708
I have to talk to Egon.

463
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:14,291
Amalia is onto me.
I have to get out of here.

464
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,958
We have to abort the plan.
Do you understand?

465
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:19,583
It's too late.

466
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:22,791
What does that mean?

467
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,125
It will happen.

468
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,000
When?

469
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:28,416
For the people!

470
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,208
Elisabeth.

471
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:02,541
I heard this place was haunted.
I just didn't know you were the ghost.

472
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,333
What are you doing here so late?

473
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,041
I was in the city. At a party.

474
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:17,875
And you?

475
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:21,166
I couldn't sleep. As always.

476
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,250
I know of a tunnel that leads out of here.

477
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,708
I'll pack a small bag,
and we'll be in Prague tomorrow.

478
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,125
You always promise so much.

479
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,500
What if I suddenly said yes?

480
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:52,916
Then you say yes.

481
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:49,208
Shit.

482
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:00,125
Yes?

483
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,333
Elisabeth.

484
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:07,041
Sorry, I hope I'm not disturbing you.

485
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,708
I couldn't sleep.

486
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,500
May I?

487
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,083
Of course.

488
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,958
I heard what happened today
at the foundry.

489
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:00,375
And that you gave a girl your shoes.

490
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:10,750
Did it cause a conflict?

491
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,875
If only he weren't an emperor.

492
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,625
Tell me something about you.

493
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:29,375
-I have nothing interesting to tell.
-I don't believe that.

494
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:35,041
I have no story about a happy childhood
if that's what you mean.

495
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:40,875
I have never met a strong person
with a simple past.

496
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,291
What are we doing here?

497
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,125
The police caught him.

498
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:18,916
What happened to him?

499
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:32,666
Why?

500
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:39,916
Don't look away.

501
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:43,458
Our lives are worth nothing to them.

502
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,666
But that will change.

503
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,416
We will avenge your brother.

504
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,583
-For the people.
-For the people.
