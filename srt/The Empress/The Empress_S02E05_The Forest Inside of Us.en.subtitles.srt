1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:09,916
Lord,

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:14,583
let your word bring light
in this dark hour.

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,208
You receive Princess Sophie

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,958
as you shall, one day,
unite us all in your kingdom.

5
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,583
We have faith in this, Father,

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,583
at this difficult time.

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,833
No.

8
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:37,916
No!

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,458
Your Majesty, please.

10
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,375
Elisabeth.

11
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,291
-No.
-You have to let go, please.

12
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,333
No.

13
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,125
Don't touch me!

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,333
You didn't believe me when I said
we shouldn't leave her alone,

15
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,375
that she wasn't better yet!

16
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,916
You wanted me for yourself
when she needed me.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,333
That is enough.

18
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:16,041
Is this how you want to pay
your last respects to the Princess?

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,250
You are behaving like a monster.

20
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,250
-You are the monsters!
-Pull yourself together, Elisabeth!

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,125
I've pulled myself together
for you for years!

22
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,583
To be enough for you!

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,041
I left my daughter alone for you.

24
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,500
I can't forgive you for that.

25
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,250
She was the only good thing
we ever had together.

26
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,416
THE EMPRESS

27
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,458
KINGDOM OF BAVARIA, 2 MONTHS LATER

28
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,166
Your Majesty, wait!

29
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:57,916
Your Majesty.

30
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,500
Your Majesty, please wait!

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't lose her.

32
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,625
Your Majesty!

33
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,291
The Countess of…

34
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,666
Elisabeth!

35
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,583
It doesn't feel right to just leave.

36
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,125
Don't you worry.

37
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,375
I'll manage fine.

38
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,125
Your Royal Highness, the way
the Empress is behaving scares me.

39
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,833
You make sure
that your foot heals quickly.

40
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,458
What should I tell the Archduchess
when she asks me how the Empress is?

41
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:44,000
That she's recovering exceptionally well
and will be back home in the near future.

42
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,125
-But she is…
-Goodbye. Depart.

43
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,750
Get up, Elisabeth.

44
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,791
I beg of you.

45
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,208
Damn it, get out of bed now. Please.

46
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,750
You must eat something, Elisabeth.

47
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,791
Your siblings would love to see you.

48
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,583
They're worried.

49
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,541
General Gyulai's telegram is alarming.

50
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,291
There has been much rioting
this last week.

51
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,791
And attacks on Austrian soldiers.

52
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:11,333
The situation in Lombardy-Venetia
has not improved. Quite the contrary.

53
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,500
Do you doubt
the abilities of my son's Viceroy?

54
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,875
With all due respect,
three quarters of his budget

55
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,666
are being used to equip schools
and to restore churches and libraries.

56
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,916
Archduke Maximilian took measures
that are welcomed by the Lombardy people.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,416
It's just window dressing!

58
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,583
Otherwise, the riots would end,
and Garibaldi wouldn't have new followers.

59
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,916
I think the Archduke's measures
need some more time.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,458
I think the Archduke's measures
have already wasted far too much time.

61
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:45,041
It must be clear
who is in charge in Lombardy,

62
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,375
Archduke Maximilian or General Gyulai.

63
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,083
Your Majesty?

64
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,500
Your Majesty?

65
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,083
Gentlemen,
if you would excuse the Emperor and me.

66
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,625
His Majesty will comment
on the matter tomorrow.

67
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,375
Franz, I know how much you're suffering.

68
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,541
Not only did you lose your daughter,
you also lost your wife.

69
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,958
But every painful end
is also a new beginning.

70
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,541
Did you cry?

71
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,750
I mean, in the last weeks.

72
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,541
Did you cry over her once?

73
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,333
The Empire needs a leader.

74
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,250
So pull yourself together.

75
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,583
He isn't doing well, my mother writes.

76
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,500
Franz is brave,
but grief covers him like snow.

77
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,000
And where is Elisabeth?

78
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,666
No mention of her.

79
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,250
I can't imagine losing a child.

80
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,500
I saw my little sister die.

81
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
She was four. I was seven.

82
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,125
She had a rare illness.

83
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,750
No one knew what it was, and then…

84
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,166
Then she was dead.

85
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,125
My mother was so sad,
I thought she'd never come back.

86
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,375
And you?

87
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,291
I sat with her every day
and tried to cheer her up.

88
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,250
All I wanted was to make her laugh again.

89
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,166
And you still want that today.

90
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,750
We're looking ahead, you hear?

91
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,375
We will have children.

92
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,833
A whole lot of children.

93
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,958
We'll have a big family.

94
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,458
Our own family.

95
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,833
Your Imperial Highness.

96
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,166
What's playing
at the court theatre this week?

97
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,166
Here.

98
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,541
This week, Shakespeare is playing.

99
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,041
A performance every evening.

100
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,750
No.

101
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,208
Nothing with mad kings, please.

102
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,750
A Midsummer Night's Dream?

103
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,000
"A woodland farce with love and magic."

104
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,791
Announce the Emperor's attendance
for tomorrow evening.

105
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,458
The people must see him,
and he must see the people.

106
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,333
Very well, Your Imperial Highness.

107
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,916
The Emperor cannot be allowed
to neglect his duties

108
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,625
just because his wife believes
it is appropriate to surrender to despair.

109
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,666
Is there any news from the Empress?

110
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,708
Nothing, unfortunately.

111
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,166
Then we'll begin the process.

112
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,625
Have you made the enquiries?

113
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,000
Of course, Your Imperial Highness.

114
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,666
Therese of Saxony-Altenburg
and Alexandra of Denmark.

115
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,625
Therese is considered uncomplicated.

116
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,041
That is the bare minimum.

117
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,250
Marrying an Emperor
is more than the Altenburgs deserve.

118
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,791
They say Alexandra is talkative,
but very healthy.

119
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,541
As long as she produces
an heir to the throne,

120
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,083
she can babble all she wants.

121
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,166
Your Imperial Highness,
is everything okay?

122
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,083
I sometimes feel like the earth
is moving under my feet.

123
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,208
Where were we?

124
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,041
Don't you think the Empress will return?

125
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,333
She is not the Empress we need.

126
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,291
She never was.

127
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,625
My dear wife…

128
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,541
Scratch that.

129
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,833
My dear spouse,

130
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,458
I must tell you that…

131
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,958
Don't look at me like that, Theo.

132
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,458
What can one say?

133
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,875
Let's forget about it.

134
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,041
That will be all.

135
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,541
Your Majesty.

136
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,583
Bring me a cognac.

137
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,666
Mimi, two hours of French after we eat.

138
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,541
Do I have to today, Mother?

139
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,958
Of course you have to.

140
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,250
You know exactly why.

141
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,666
Je m'appelle Max.

142
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,333
Formidable, Max.

143
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,458
You see, Mimi?

144
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,750
Elisabeth.

145
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,833
Your Majesty.

146
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,250
-How nice.
-There you are, finally.

147
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,875
-The dumplings are very fresh.
-Thank you.

148
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,458
The calves were slaughtered yesterday.

149
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,666
Just coffee for me, please.

150
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,125
Coffee for me too, please.

151
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,791
Where is Father?

152
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,375
Is he not back yet?

153
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,416
Your siblings were looking
forward to finally seeing you.

154
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,541
They say Father lives
with the wayfaring people.

155
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,000
-On the other side of the lake.
-What nonsense, Mimi.

156
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,083
Your father
is still travelling for business.

157
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,291
Sit up straight, Max.

158
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,458
Elbows off the table.

159
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,958
Eat your liver dumplings
so you'll be ready for bridal season.

160
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,791
Liver gives you
strong bones and shiny hair.

161
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,333
Next summer, it'll be time for Mimi.

162
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:09,583
The bigger royal families
have already made enquiries about her.

163
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,000
But I will only marry
the man I really love.

164
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,958
Like Elisabeth.

165
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,541
Love doesn't happen for everyone, Mimi.

166
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,000
Now eat your dumplings.

167
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,125
Go on.

168
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,375
Where is Fienchen now?

169
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,125
Mapperl, shh.

170
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,833
Mother said that she's in heaven.

171
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,708
That's right.

172
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,875
Little Sophie…

173
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,000
is an angel now.

174
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,875
-The good Lord is watching over her.
-No, he isn't.

175
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,708
He isn't.

176
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,375
Elisabeth, please.

177
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,541
Where is she then?

178
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,125
She's lying in a wooden coffin in a crypt.

179
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,041
There is no heaven.

180
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,916
Elisabeth, stop it.

181
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,583
There is no God, and there are no angels.

182
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,708
No one is watching over us.

183
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,208
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

184
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,708
Stop her.

185
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,833
Your Majesty, it's supposed to snow later.

186
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,625
Please. The Duchess is worried.

187
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,416
You will not return to the forest.

188
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,625
People are already talking.
"The Empress has rabies," they say.

189
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:32,541
When you couldn't stand me back then,
you always sent me out into the forest.

190
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,666
-You're behaving like a madwoman.
-Well, then I am mad.

191
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,000
And you always knew that.

192
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,125
We've all lost children.

193
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,833
That's life.

194
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,708
I cannot go on without her.

195
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,750
I understand that.

196
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,625
But you have to control your emotions.

197
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,375
I can't.

198
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,208
But you have to.

199
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,750
What about your husband?

200
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,708
You're his wife. He needs you.

201
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,500
And what about your little girl? Gisella?

202
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,000
She's better off without me.

203
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,250
Stay here.

204
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,750
You have to eat something.

205
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,625
My Oberon!

206
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,208
What visions have I seen!

207
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:57,208
Methought I was enamoured of an ass.

208
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,333
There lies your love.

209
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,958
How came these things to pass?

210
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,083
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!

211
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,958
Silence awhile.

212
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,500
Robin, take off this head.

213
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,083
Titania, music call,

214
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:25,333
and strike more dead than common sleep
of all these five, the sense.

215
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,041
Your Imperial Highness.

216
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,250
I heard you wished to speak to me.

217
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,625
Baroness von Sina,
I'm delighted to see you.

218
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,000
You look radiant. Marriage suits you.

219
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,708
Allow me to express my condolences
on the death of Princess Sophie.

220
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,583
Please convey this to the Emperor too.

221
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,500
I could use your help, Baroness.

222
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,708
As you probably know,
the Empress is in Bavaria.

223
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,166
And it is unclear when she will return.

224
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,541
And you want me to bring her back?

225
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,000
The Emperor needs the comfort
and the warmth of a woman.

226
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,375
I am sure you'll find
someone suitable, Your Majesty.

227
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:34,083
Baroness, we both know
Elisabeth is not the only woman

228
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,916
who meant something to the Emperor.

229
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,250
My husband would not approve
of this conversation.

230
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,833
Your Imperial Highness.

231
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,916
This would not be for me,
Baroness, but for the Empire.

232
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,625
What's the difference?

233
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,041
Your Highness,
for the reception with the Milan society,

234
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,000
I thought either the blue dress,
with its exotic quality,

235
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,750
or the light, simple one.

236
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,625
As I understand it, you and the Archduke
want to look more inconspicuous

237
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,583
and closer to the people, don't you?

238
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,125
It's not about the dress.
It's about the woman wearing it.

239
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,666
The blue one.

240
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,708
Go get a pad.

241
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,291
We should have you take
more salt baths this month.

242
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,750
It helped my mother.
And three raw herrings every evening.

243
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,541
You can eat the herrings yourself.

244
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,708
I want to see a doctor.

245
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,166
Of course.

246
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,833
Excuse me.

247
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,250
Good evening.

248
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,708
You shouldn't be out, signora. The curfew.

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
Do you have a cigarette?

250
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,250
Please.

251
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,250
Yes. All right.

252
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,708
Long live a united Italy!

253
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:38,125
You know, Your Highness, we haven't seen
the inside of the villa in 30 years.

254
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,625
Well, now I'm here.

255
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,375
You're very generous, thank you.

256
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,291
We don't have enough
to take care of the poor.

257
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:51,291
For the past few months, we've been
taking care of the hospitals, Sister.

258
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,041
We are very grateful for that.

259
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,916
But poverty leads to discontent
among the youth.

260
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,708
We should leave
the planning of new infrastructure

261
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,625
to the Lombards themselves.

262
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,375
Put the power back
in the hands of the Lombards.

263
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,750
I think that's a good idea.

264
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,333
To His Imperial Highness,
the Archduke's health.

265
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,333
-Raise your glasses!
-Raise your glasses!

266
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,458
Raise your glasses! Let's drink to that!

267
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,500
It's all just a bribe!

268
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,625
Shh.

269
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:26,958
Pardon?

270
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,041
The wine.

271
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,833
This food.

272
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:36,625
You're just adorning the facade,
but behind it, everything's the same.

273
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,083
Seize him!

274
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,000
Wait.

275
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,208
Just because you learned Italian
doesn't mean you can fool us.

276
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,083
They will go to war with the rebels!

277
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,208
-Everyone knows that.
-No.

278
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:59,291
We'll make Lombardy so stable
that the revolts will end.

279
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,583
There won't be
a war against the rebels, good sir.

280
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,500
Last week,

281
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:13,166
700 soldiers were forced
to enlist in the Austrian army.

282
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,458
Young men.

283
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,791
Children.

284
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,166
Is that your idea of prosperity and peace?

285
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,666
There must be some misunderstanding.

286
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,000
I ordered no sort of forced enlistment.

287
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,500
But he did.

288
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,208
You must inform me
before taking such action.

289
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,083
His Majesty The Emperor
put me in charge of the army.

290
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,208
I'm worried about the state of security.

291
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,375
All our work is for naught
if we don't coordinate our actions.

292
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,625
With all due respect,

293
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,166
since you are spending our money
on church renovations and almshouses,

294
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,208
I cannot rely solely
on regular Austrian soldiers.

295
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,083
-We need more soldiers.
-No!

296
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,166
We must win the trust of the people here.

297
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,000
Pull the foundation away from Garibaldi.
More soldiers will do the opposite.

298
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:21,125
Last week, I lost five of my men,
Your Imperial Highness.

299
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,208
Murdered in cold blood by rebels.

300
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,833
A revolution is coming our way.

301
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:27,916
And what do you do?

302
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,666
I myself will take over
supreme command of the troops.

303
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,250
Elisabeth!

304
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:55,958
Where are you going?

305
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:00,666
I'm going to Father.

306
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,916
Mother says Father completely
lost his mind last summer.

307
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,708
That's why I want to see him.

308
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,833
I can't stand being with Mother.

309
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,791
I can't believe
she already wants you to marry next year.

310
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,333
You're only 15.

311
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,583
Mother says it's the best age.

312
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:21,250
Europe is full
of unmarried heirs to the throne now.

313
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,916
Or she just doesn't want me
to end up like Helene.

314
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,083
Didn't Mother tell you?

315
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,208
Helene fell madly in love
a few months ago.

316
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,500
And he loves her too.

317
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,583
But they're not allowed to be together.

318
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:40,833
Why? Who is he?

319
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,125
His name is Anton of Thurn and Taxis.

320
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,125
They're a small family,

321
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,041
no land, no money.

322
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,291
But Helene didn't care.

323
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,458
She wanted to marry Anton no matter what.

324
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,791
She begged Mother on her knees.

325
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,708
Until Mother asked
our cousin for permission.

326
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,708
-And then?
-The King said no, of course.

327
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,041
Anton's social standing is
far too low for us.

328
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,125
Helene cried for weeks.

329
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,291
First the thing with Franz and now this.

330
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:15,375
I think Helene should be allowed
to marry the man she really loves.

331
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,791
Like you and Franz.

332
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,875
In good times and bad.
That's what you vowed to one another.

333
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,333
Those are just words, Mimi.

334
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,708
They don't mean anything.

335
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:35,250
-But a love like the love we imagined…
-There is no such love.

336
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,416
Go back to the house.

337
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,833
Don't wait for me tonight.

338
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,166
The Foreign Minister, Your Majesty.

339
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,375
-Your Majesty, I shall excuse you.
-Have him come in.

340
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,041
Your Majesty.

341
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,916
Thank you for receiving me unannounced.

342
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:32,000
I must speak to you
about the situation in Milan.

343
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:37,750
You want me to cut off my brother's funds.
Isn't that right?

344
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,458
Three more Austrian soldiers
were murdered last night.

345
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:47,166
General Gyulai needs all the financial
resources to ensure our safety.

346
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,875
My brother says he needs
all the financial resources.

347
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,583
And I put my trust in him.

348
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,333
May I?

349
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,541
Your Majesty, I'm sorry
I have to say this, but…

350
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,666
Speak.

351
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,291
Your brother

352
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,333
is wasting the money on big parties.

353
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,791
He's playing statesman.

354
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:41,416
But what does it accomplish? Nothing.

355
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,416
I think he wants
to create a legacy of his own.

356
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,666
But it's endangering
the security of Habsburg,

357
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,958
and I cannot allow that.

358
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,375
Your Majesty.

359
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,541
It wouldn't be the first time

360
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:04,541
your brother only had
his own interests in mind,

361
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,000
and not the empire's.

362
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,833
I simply can't stand

363
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:13,750
when others take advantage of
the hard times you're going through.

364
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:20,333
Tell the assembly I put you in charge.

365
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,166
You decide on this matter.

366
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,583
I thank you, Your Majesty.

367
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:28,833
Go now, please.

368
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:30,791
Go.

369
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,458
Your Majesty, can I help you?

370
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,708
Get out.

371
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,333
Out!

372
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,125
And stay there.

373
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,833
And, therefore, financial support

374
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:42,916
for cultural and social initiatives
will be cut for all of Lombardy-Venetia.

375
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,916
Did His Majesty actually agree to this?

376
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,500
For the benefit of the generous
and comprehensive build-up

377
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,708
of the local army.

378
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,125
No.

379
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,708
I will speak to the Emperor myself.

380
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:57,333
He has to make this decision, not you!

381
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,208
He put me in charge of this matter.

382
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,458
Gentlemen, this meeting is concluded.

383
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:09,333
-Since when do you conclude meetings?
-Since the Emperor put me in charge.

384
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:14,583
And since when have you been so interested
in a comprehensive military build-up?

385
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:17,750
-That's not your responsibility at all.
-Neither is it yours.

386
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,833
Excuse me.

387
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:22,250
Your Imperial Highness!

388
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:27,250
You cannot allow
the Foreign Minister to put on such airs.

389
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,416
It is negligent!

390
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,583
Don't tell me what I must and mustn't do.

391
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,125
Prepare two telegrams.

392
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,125
For General Gyulai
and Archduke Maximilian.

393
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,166
-Get them out before tonight.
-Yes, sir.

394
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,375
And bring me something to drink.

395
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:51,791
Cognac.

396
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:59,375
Everything seems to be fine,
Your Imperial Highness.

397
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:02,375
The regular bleeding indicates

398
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:03,666
that you're fertile.

399
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,791
I told you. Everything will be fine.

400
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:15,000
Your Imperial Highness, may I have a word?

401
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:27,875
I just wanted to tell you

402
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:32,208
that the man's semen
can be inadequate for a pregnancy.

403
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,666
Between the two of us, Doctor.

404
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,750
I've already been
responsible for a pregnancy or two.

405
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,791
Oh, really?

406
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,458
All the better then.

407
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:47,500
Well, then.

408
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,541
And since then, no infectious diseases?

409
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,208
Influenza, gonorrhoea,

410
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,416
syphilis?

411
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:01,791
No.

412
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:04,791
A telegram has arrived.

413
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:06,625
From Vienna.

414
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,291
Thank you, Doctor.

415
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,541
Your Imperial Highness.

416
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,416
From your brother.

417
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,208
What's wrong?

418
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,625
He has cut off all our funds.

419
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:48,041
All the money from Vienna
will go to Gyulai and the army.

420
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,291
He can't do that.

421
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,666
What about all our plans?

422
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,708
All our ideas?

423
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,875
I was childish enough to think
he'd believe in me for once.

424
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,250
What bullshit.

425
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,625
It isn't over yet.

426
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,458
Go to Vienna. You must talk to him.

427
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,750
Of course, it's over!

428
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,875
Don't be so naive.

429
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:17,625
You're leaving?

430
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:23,250
If you want to plan how to move forward,
I'll be there for you.

431
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,208
Thank you for your loving compassion.

432
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,833
The father of my children
doesn't wallow in self-pity.

433
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,250
It's repulsive.

434
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,333
His Majesty will recover,
Your Imperial Highness.

435
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,375
Give him time.

436
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,750
I must say, it even breaks my heart
when I think of little Sophie.

437
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,583
She was so clever.

438
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:05,583
Like you.

439
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:08,125
She even bore your name.

440
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,250
Is that not fateful?

441
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,375
Are you drunk?

442
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:13,916
Just one glass.

443
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:15,875
Really.

444
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,583
The whole mood weighs on your soul.

445
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,750
The Countess is done.

446
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:23,375
-No, I wanted to try some pâté…
-Please go.

447
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,458
Your Imperial Highness.

448
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:49,625
Clear the other dishes away too.
Clear it all away. I will dine alone.

449
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:50,666
Very well.

450
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:57,166
And send for the Interior Minister.

451
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:05,291
No pâté for Margarete.

452
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,125
Good evening.

453
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,708
It looks as if at least one
of us had a good day.

454
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,583
Countess von Lamberg.
This is a surprise at this late hour.

455
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,250
-May I offer you something?
-Please.

456
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,375
Finally, someone you can have fun with.

457
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,708
The whole palace is like a cemetery.

458
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,666
I really am very glad

459
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:50,125
we finally have
this so unexpected opportunity.

460
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,375
What is there to celebrate?

461
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,500
We're building up arms to secure Lombardy.

462
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,333
The Emperor

463
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,958
put me in charge.

464
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,000
Well, well.

465
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:17,958
So you're on your way up.

466
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:21,958
Just like you.

467
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,625
But isn't it more of a sad occasion?

468
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,000
That there could be war?

469
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,916
War doesn't have to be
a terrible thing for all of us.

470
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:00,833
Your Imperial Highness.

471
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,916
Forgive me.
I didn't mean to disturb your dinner.

472
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,000
How could you dare
to speak to me like that?

473
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,500
Your Imperial Highness?

474
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,666
Just now. In front of the entire assembly.

475
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,750
Count Buol shamelessly seized
control of the matter.

476
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:32,458
Then meet him in a bar
and beat each other up like peasants do!

477
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,750
Not at my cabinet table.

478
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,750
Excuse me for a moment.

479
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,083
-Your Imperial Highness.
-Baroness of Sina.

480
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,958
So you've changed your mind?

481
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,166
He is an old friend who's suffering.

482
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,375
Maybe he needs someone to talk to.

483
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,458
To talk to?

484
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,125
Certainly.

485
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,250
Whatever he needs.

486
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,333
Your Imperial Highness.

487
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,458
Were you eavesdropping, Minister?

488
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,000
The door was open.

489
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:27,958
Was that Baroness of Sina?

490
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:30,500
-If you have an opinion, then out with it.
-Me?

491
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:33,833
I have never had
an opinion in all my life.

492
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,000
I beg your pardon
for my behaviour at the assembly.

493
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,291
And I wish you a peaceful evening.

494
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,291
Minister.

495
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,583
Your Imperial Highness?

496
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,833
Would you like to dine with me?

497
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:07,875
With you?

498
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,083
Forgive me.

499
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,083
I mean,

500
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,125
the two of us together?

501
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:26,625
I would be honoured.

502
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:43,750
I had honestly hoped for more stimulating
conversation from you, von Bach.

503
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,583
I tend to disappoint at social events.

504
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,541
There was a time
when you were afraid of me.

505
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,958
That was always so nice.

506
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,916
What happened to that?

507
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,208
First you want stimulating conversation,
and now I am to be frozen with fear again.

508
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,208
What do you want from me?

509
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,375
I don't know exactly.

510
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,083
To the good old days.

511
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:14,875
And don't you worry.

512
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,250
I am still very afraid of you.

513
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,583
Another glass of wine,
Your Imperial Highness?

514
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,000
Your Majesty?

515
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,125
Your Majesty?

516
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,500
It's me.

517
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,541
I'm sorry.

518
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,541
I'm here.

519
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:13,791
Everything's okay.

520
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,875
I miss you so much.

521
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:21,916
I am here.

522
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,166
I missed you so much.

523
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,083
I love you.

524
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,416
Elisabeth.

525
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,791
Elisabeth.

526
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,458
Is it very painful?

527
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,416
You have to completely surrender
to the pain, then it passes.

528
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,458
Elisabeth?

529
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,208
What are you doing here?

530
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:53,500
I wanted to see where you are, Father.

531
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:55,666
I'm here.

532
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,125
You always said you wanted a circus.

533
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,708
And everyone said I was crazy.

534
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,291
These people, Father…
Do you pay for all of this?

535
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,875
I make sure they have food to eat
and a roof over their heads.

536
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,708
Actually, they're the ones

537
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:21,916
keeping me alive.

538
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:30,958
You didn't write to me.

539
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:35,333
Not a letter, not a card.

540
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,375
Would that have helped?

541
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,291
People are saying that you no longer eat.

542
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,166
It helps no one if you starve, you know?

543
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,500
Or do you want to die?

544
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:00,666
Is that it? Did you leave Vienna
to die a miserable death here?

545
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,666
I can't return to Vienna, Father. I…

546
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:12,125
They want me to just carry on.

547
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,166
And him? Does he want that too?

548
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,666
Stop it once and for all, Elisabeth.

549
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,416
Stop trying to change the world.

550
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,875
The world out there is lost.

551
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:37,000
-I don't know where I should go.
-Then stay here.

552
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,250
Take a look around.

553
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,666
All those who belong nowhere
are at home here.

554
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,750
And everyone can be who they want to be.

555
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,208
Free.

556
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,083
Crazy.

557
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:53,333
And people like us.

558
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:06,833
Did you hear that?

559
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,708
My daughter will stay with us for a while.

560
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,916
I thought your daughter was the Empress.

561
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,250
Where are you going?

562
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:20,375
Where are you going, Elisabeth?

563
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,000
Something happened to you
a few months ago.

564
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,250
What was it?

565
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,750
Nothing I'm aware of,
Your Imperial Highness.

566
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:54,375
Does it have to do
with Countess Apafi's disappearance?

567
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,708
Does anything get past you?

568
00:46:58,791 --> 00:46:59,833
-Ever?
-No.

569
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:06,500
So, did she break your heart?

570
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,625
I'm not as soft as you think,
Your Imperial Highness.

571
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:12,041
I can bear a lot.

572
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,166
But I hate being deceived.

573
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,875
I don't think you're soft.

574
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:21,000
Please.

575
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,541
You've made it
more than clear over the years.

576
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,833
I actually believe

577
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,625
that if this palace
should crumble to pieces,

578
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,208
you are one of the few
who would survive out there.

579
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,208
You don't need much

580
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,208
because you came with nothing.

581
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,041
Don't worry.

582
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:51,000
You will find a nice woman.

583
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:03,416
I know the question I'm about to ask
will earn me two weeks in prison.

584
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,375
Four.

585
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,791
Four weeks in prison
for all personal questions.

586
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:12,708
What was the question?

587
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,500
Who takes care of you,
Your Imperial Highness?

588
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,750
I don't need a shoulder to cry on.

589
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:27,625
I know.

590
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:48,291
To despair is a luxury I cannot afford.

591
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,666
Even if I wanted to.

592
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:08,375
Good night.

593
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:14,541
-Forgive me, I didn't mean to…
-Thank you for this lovely evening.

594
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:45,875
Mummy.

595
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,458
Mummy.

596
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:05,458
I've missed you so.

597
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,291
I miss you so.

598
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:15,000
Don't cry, Mummy.

599
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:23,208
Where is my stone?

600
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,166
Daddy has your stone.

601
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:40,625
-Daddy has your stone.
-Elisabeth!

602
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,125
Elisabeth.

603
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:47,500
Elisabeth.

604
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:00,750
Come. Come on.

605
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,375
Come.

606
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,500
Have you been awake long?

607
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,250
What is it?

608
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:43,625
The doctor asked me yesterday
if I've had diseases.

609
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:51,041
There are infectious diseases
that can make a man infertile.

610
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,333
Two years ago, before I met you…

611
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,208
I had syphilis.

612
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,666
I thought I'd got through it fine, but…

613
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:18,625
If it's true…

614
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:25,000
If I can't give you any children…

615
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,916
will you still stay with me?

616
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:42,458
Sleeping in the forest.
Who does such a thing?

617
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,083
It wasn't the first time.

618
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:50,291
You always ran around in the woods.

619
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,416
You always ran away.

620
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,583
Don't put that on me.

621
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,833
Because you didn't want me here.

622
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,208
You pushed me away.

623
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:11,166
Nothing about me was ever right.

624
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,416
I've never told you this, but…

625
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:35,875
when you were born, you had teeth.

626
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:39,458
Here in the front.

627
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,583
Two teeny-tiny pointy teeth.

628
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:53,708
That's very rare, the doctor said.

629
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:57,333
For someone to be born with teeth.

630
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,041
You are stronger than you think.

631
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:09,000
Stronger than the others.

632
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,208
I should've protected her.

633
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,416
You don't need to forgive Franz.

634
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:28,875
You need to forgive yourself.

635
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:41,458
Is there any soup left?

636
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:43,916
Yes.

637
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:46,333
Mimi, get the bone broth.

638
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,041
I have to go back home.

639
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:01,666
Good morning, Your Majesty.

640
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:09,000
Was someone here?

641
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,291
Your Majesty?

642
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,125
It was as if Elisabeth was here.

643
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:23,458
No one was here.

644
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,125
Prepare the carriage.

645
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,208
I'm going to Bavaria.

646
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

647
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:51,500
Mother.

648
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:52,833
A letter from the King.

649
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:56,250
-He's allowing Helene to marry.
-What? Why?

650
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:58,250
Elisabeth wrote to him.

651
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,916
"And it is, therefore, with great joy

652
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,791
that I comply with the Empress's
explicit and heartfelt wish

653
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:11,208
and allow Helene to enter into the union
that her heart desires".

654
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,583
That's wonderful.

655
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:18,625
Wonderful!

656
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:29,166
Stop!

657
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:32,750
Whoa.

658
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:38,083
Why are we stopping?

659
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:40,875
There's another carriage, Your Majesty.

660
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:41,916
We cannot pass.

661
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:18,541
It's so quiet in the palace
without our daughter.

662
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,166
Being without her is unbearable.

663
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:27,791
And being without you…

664
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,125
just makes it all even worse.

665
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:44,666
Can you forgive me?

666
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:49,333
There's nothing to forgive.

667
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:20,125
What is that?

668
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:21,625
-Are you hurt?
-No.

669
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:48,125
The Emperor is still reluctant
to use the military.

670
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:52,125
The chance to strike the Habsburgs
has never been better, Your Majesty.

671
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:54,833
He lost his daughter, Prime Minister.

672
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:56,291
He's in mourning.

673
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,541
Have you no heart?

674
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,666
I will help you unite Italy.

675
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,625
But I certainly won't wage
a war of aggression.

676
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,916
Franz Josef must declare war on you.

677
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:15,125
In other words, on Piedmont,
not vice versa.

678
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,291
France can intervene as your saviour.

679
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,375
And what happens

680
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:28,625
if Emperor Franz Josef
does not declare war?

681
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,291
He's known for being a dove.

682
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:33,625
Believe me.

683
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:35,583
There will be a war.

684
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,333
And he will start it.

685
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:41,125
