00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:30,500
1856 - AT THE GATES OF VIENNA

2
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,500
Good morning.

3
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,083
Oh, no. How could this have happened?

4
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,875
Did you check the carriage?

5
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,250
Of course.
I checked it this morning before leaving.

6
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,625
My love.

7
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,791
Where is Adolfo?

8
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,166
-How could this happen?
-There he is!

9
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,041
-I don't get it either.
-Please get back in the carriage.

10
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,625
Where have you been all this time, Adolfo?

11
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,916
He looks pale. Do you feel unwell perhaps?

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,958
I think he's sick with excitement
about seeing the pretty Empress.

13
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,708
Let's go!

14
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,041
-We can carry on, Your Highness.
-Finally. Let's go.

15
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,833
-Should I put it with the other gifts?
-No.

16
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:41,208
-Our Empress awaits us!
-Let's go!

17
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,500
Close the door!

18
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,958
THE EMPRESS

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,750
Here.

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,666
A warm welcome to you.

21
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,916
A warm welcome to you.

22
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,208
Good day.

23
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,000
How nice to see you again.

24
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,375
How nice to see you again.

25
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,125
Where's Hungarian?

26
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,458
Good day.

27
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,958
Good day.

28
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,208
All I need now is Italian.

29
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,250
Good day.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,208
I see you, Fienchen.

31
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,833
A lot of guests
are coming today, you know?

32
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,666
Is the baby doing well?

33
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,916
Yes, it'll be here soon.
Then you'll be a big sister.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,916
Sister or brother?

35
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,916
I don't know.

36
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,791
What do you wish for?

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,625
The Lord will send us a ruler
who will save us from the darkness.

38
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,916
He alone is the one who decides.
Not you, not me.

39
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,291
He alone.

40
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,000
I've always hated
having to wait for a man.

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,583
For centuries, it has been
a man on the throne, Sophie.

42
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,166
Chosen by God.

43
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,625
The woman gives life,
and the man rules over it.

44
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,333
Without an heir to the throne,
we are lost.

45
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,166
Napoleon had a son.

46
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,375
We have to show the world
the Habsburgs have a future.

47
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,333
Our people mustn't lose faith.

48
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,625
You mustn't lose faith,
Your Imperial Highness.

49
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,166
It is a big day, ladies.

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,666
The delegates are all coming
to see the Empress.

51
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,541
Contact with the people across the empire
is our Empress's highest priority.

52
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,208
We only have a few hours
to prepare Elisabeth.

53
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,333
Elisabeth?
You call the Empress by her first name?

54
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,625
May I do that too?

55
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,375
A few basic rules, Countess.

56
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,416
Firstly, we are always immaculate,
but not wanton.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,583
Décolleté here, not here.

58
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,541
Secondly, I oversee the Empress's court.

59
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,041
I'm the only one allowed
to see the Empress alone.

60
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:17,125
Never let anyone see the Empress
without my permission. Never.

61
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,416
Of course, Countess.

62
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,125
-And third, you have to decide.
-Decide?

63
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,458
Lots of ladies
are only here to go to balls,

64
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,041
to find a rich husband.

65
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,750
Yes, I mean you, Josephina.

66
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,333
That's how I was at first too,
but I know better now.

67
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,083
Serving the Empress
is my most important task.

68
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,125
Countess.

69
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,666
Only those willing to do
anything for her will make it.

70
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,625
Ladies.

71
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,166
It doesn't mean you can't have some fun
on the side, if you know what I mean.

72
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,250
No, I…

73
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,625
-Pardon me, Countess?
-Pauline.

74
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,791
I don't think we'll have any issues.
My court, my rules.

75
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,500
You little rascal.

76
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,833
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,375
I do beg your pardon.
The Princess got away from me.

78
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,750
She can always come in
to see me if she wishes.

79
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,416
Princess Sophie,
it is time for your breakfast.

80
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,666
-She can have breakfast with me.
-Yes.

81
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,750
Your Majesty, that will ruin
the entire schedule.

82
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,750
Your Majesty?

83
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,208
The midwife is here.

84
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,958
-Please get my husband. I need him.
-Certainly.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,666
The delegations
from distant Bukovina and Dalmatia

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,625
have confirmed their visit too.

87
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,416
The Hungarians confirmed too?

88
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,583
Yes, Your Majesty.
They all accepted your invitation.

89
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,375
We both know for whom all those people
endured this long journey.

90
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,500
Not because of me.

91
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,666
Not because of me either.

92
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,916
Your Majesty,
the Empress wishes to see you.

93
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,625
I'll be right there.

94
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,541
I hear a strong heartbeat.
In three to four weeks, it will be time.

95
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,791
And now
for the most important question of all.

96
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,875
Isn't that right?

97
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,541
His Majesty The Emperor.

98
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,000
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

99
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,750
I wanted you to be here.

100
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,583
Please carry on.

101
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,666
And you can say that for certain?

102
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,791
Mrs Pfudel has delivered
more than 2,000 children.

103
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:02,500
More than 30 kings,
dukes, princes, and a pope.

104
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,958
She's never been wrong.

105
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,500
We used to say if the mother
is glowing during the pregnancy,

106
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,666
her cheeks rosy, her hair shiny,
she will have a boy.

107
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,000
If, however, she is pale, her hair
colourless and dry, it will be a girl.

108
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,583
Because girls take away
their mother's beauty.

109
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,333
Those are old wives' tales!

110
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,750
It is the heart rate
and the shape of the belly, you see?

111
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,625
-What will it be?
-Look forward to an heir to the throne.

112
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,833
There is little doubt.

113
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,000
She is never wrong?

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,166
Never.

115
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,791
Ready for all of your guests?

116
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,125
How lovely to see you again.

117
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,750
The pleasure is all mine.

118
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,375
Thank you for making the long journey.

119
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,583
No, I don't do such indecent things.

120
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,000
Everything okay?

121
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,166
He's kicking me.

122
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:31,958
My son.

123
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,458
Behave in there, you hear?

124
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,541
Once you're out in a few weeks,
we'll talk man to man.

125
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,208
Now let your mother be.

126
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,083
Whoa.

127
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,083
Let's go.

128
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,250
Ado, let's go.

129
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,791
Give this to my secretary for review,
so it's ready for the cabinet tomorrow.

130
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,333
-Certainly, Minister.
-Thank you.

131
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,208
He's gone.

132
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,375
You really should have it cleaned.
It has moths.

133
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,083
I'm so tired of having to hide you.

134
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,333
I find it exciting.

135
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,750
By now, you must know me
well enough to know

136
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,750
I am not the right man
for this sort of thrill.

137
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,333
For someone who fought in the revolution,
you sure are faint-hearted.

138
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,375
The revolution was nothing
compared to this affair with you.

139
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,000
As you know,
I didn't engage in any street fighting.

140
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,875
I was more interested
in the discourse regarding jurisprudence

141
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,916
in my political reading club and…

142
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,083
But you are still trying
to improve the empire.

143
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,750
From your desk.

144
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,458
-Yes.
-Yes.

145
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,958
You're right.

146
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,291
No, not now!

147
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,541
Nothing can come between us.

148
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,791
Excuse me, Minister.
The Empress is looking for Countess Apafi.

149
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,666
-Except her.
-How do they know I'm here?

150
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,458
-I'll pass that on.
-No, shh!

151
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,750
Thank you, Minister.

152
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,958
Everyone knows you're here.

153
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,416
Even the chambermaids wonder
why you haven't made it official.

154
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,416
No, Leontine, that was a joke.

155
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,750
Only my valet knows. No, do stay.

156
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,500
-Your Majesty.
-Your Imperial Highness.

157
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,416
I have heard the good news.

158
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,166
I'd like to show you something.

159
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,291
My gift for the baptism.

160
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,875
I remember the first time
I saw you in this uniform.

161
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,916
A uniform won't make him a good ruler.

162
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,541
No. The grace of God will.

163
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,916
I hope I was able
to live up to the expectation.

164
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,541
You are still young.

165
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,875
Let's wait until the child is born
and can walk.

166
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,500
Where were we, Theo?

167
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,125
Look who's coming.

168
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,583
Excuse me, where are you going?

169
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,250
To Her Majesty The Empress.

170
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,875
No one can see the Empress.

171
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,041
She sent for me.

172
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,041
Or do you want to forbid her
from seeing me?

173
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,041
No.

174
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,583
Who are you, then?

175
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,583
Well, that is a good question.
Who are you really?

176
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,291
No one actually knows, do they?

177
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,666
Well, my name is Pauline von Bellegarde.
It is my first day.

178
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,250
Very pleased to meet you, Pauline.
I'm Leontine von Apafi.

179
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,458
You only see the Empress on Tuesdays,
and only if I allow it.

180
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,458
-She wishes to see me.
-So what?

181
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,458
Charlotte, please make an exception.

182
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,166
Today is such
an important day for Elisabeth.

183
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,083
Just this once.

184
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,083
I govern the Empress's affairs.

185
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,458
Trouble with Hungarian again?

186
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,666
Leontine.

187
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,125
There you are at last.

188
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,791
I heard the good news.
The midwife says it's a boy.

189
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,541
I just hope she's right.

190
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,833
What if it's another girl?

191
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,166
Then we'll raise
a gang of smart, little women.

192
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,666
If it is a boy, then we'll travel.

193
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,083
There's so much
I want to do in this empire.

194
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:12,875
I know.

195
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,791
I told you not to run off!

196
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,541
I am so sorry, Your Imperial Highness.

197
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,916
Look what you've done, Princess Sophie.

198
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,166
It was a gift
from the Pope to Maria Theresia.

199
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,791
You must learn to behave!

200
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,375
I am so very sorry.

201
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,916
-Fienchen, what happened?
-Mummy.

202
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,541
Did you hurt yourself?

203
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,333
Everything's okay, my darling.

204
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,583
-It's just an old vase.
-I just wanted to play.

205
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,041
She ran away again, Your Majesty.

206
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,666
This is our home,

207
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,625
not a prison.

208
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,208
She's allowed to run around freely.

209
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,333
I agree with you entirely, Elisabeth.

210
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,791
I think we'll find a new job for you.

211
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,791
You heard Her Majesty.

212
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,791
Off you go now.

213
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,666
How do you feel, Elisabeth?

214
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,500
I feel splendid.

215
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,333
I know the reception
this evening was your idea,

216
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,500
but are you sure
it isn't a bit too much for you?

217
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm worried about the boy.

218
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,666
I want to speak
to the people in our empire.

219
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,375
I want to listen to them.

220
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,750
I'm their Empress.

221
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,375
Once she's given birth to the boy,
I'll take over.

222
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,416
Of course, Your Imperial Highness.

223
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
I will mould the next emperor.

224
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,625
Then she can travel and "listen
to the people" as much as she wants.

225
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,375
The further away, the better.

226
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,625
And what will we do
if it is a girl after all?

227
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,041
The Lord won't disappoint me this time.

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,250
I sometimes wonder if it's all God's will,
if He's steering it all.

229
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,666
-Do you not?
-Do you have a better idea?

230
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,625
No, Your Imperial Highness.

231
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:16,666
Well, then.

232
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,166
All these languages give me a headache.

233
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,791
Look, the delegation from Dalmatia.

234
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,583
They say Dalmatian men
are the most handsome.

235
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,291
I would need a man who satisfies my mind.

236
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,583
No such man exists.

237
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,000
Your Imperial Highness.

238
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,958
But look at that.
One of them even has a moustache.

239
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,250
Your Imperial Highness.

240
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:09,041
If I may introduce my three daughters.
Josephine, Alexandrine, and Wilhelmine.

241
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,583
Yes.

242
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,833
Oh my God.

243
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:16,833
Dear Countess. You look splendid.
The highest position at court suits you.

244
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,875
Yes, move on.

245
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,875
-The poor wretch.
-Yes.

246
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,000
Three daughters truly are a burden,
especially those three.

247
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,625
It's a burden how much he lusts after you.

248
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,166
Impressive celebration, Bach.

249
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,333
Trying to show off
how united the empire is?

250
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,375
The Emperor's popularity
has increased immensely.

251
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,666
Due to your administrative reforms?

252
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,875
I think it has more
to do with the pretty Empress.

253
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,666
You're confusing me now.

254
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,916
Aren't you the Empress, von Bach?

255
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,375
His Majesty The Emperor.

256
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,458
Her Majesty The Empress.

257
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,000
Your Majesties, honoured guests.

258
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,333
Representatives,
from all parts of our holy empire,

259
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:38,666
from all hereditary lands and crown lands,
have travelled here to pay their respects

260
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,750
to His Majesty The Emperor
and Her Majesty The Empress.

261
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,333
The hereditary land
of Bohemia shall present itself first.

262
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,000
Good day.

263
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,708
Welcome to Vienna.

264
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,708
Thank you.

265
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,750
Thank you very much.

266
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,166
May God protect the divine Empress.

267
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,958
The Crown Land of Bukovina.

268
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,708
The delegation
from the Crown Land of Dalmatia.

269
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,958
Thank you.

270
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,500
The delegation
from the hereditary land of Hungary.

271
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,375
-You invited the Hungarians too?
-Your Majesty.

272
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,583
I did not invite anyone at all.

273
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,208
-It is such an honour.
-Thank you.

274
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,916
Welcome to Vienna.

275
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,375
-You speak Hungarian?
-It's a very unique language.

276
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,833
Disgusting.

277
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,875
The delegation from the hereditary land
of Lombardy-Venetia.

278
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,833
Count Giuseppe Marino.

279
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,750
We are greatly honoured, Your Majesties.

280
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:32,958
We are from Milan,

281
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,708
and I bring you the best
from our vineyards.

282
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,958
-Come.
-Thank you so much.

283
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,041
You're welcome.

284
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,458
The Italian people must be free!
We will no longer be silent.

285
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,250
-Help us, Empress!
-Don't touch her!

286
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,166
Freedom for Italy!
Down with Austrian terror!

287
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,083
Freedom for Italy!

288
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,625
Hear us out, Empress!
The Lombards are oppressed!

289
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,416
-You must help us! Your Majesty!
-Out with him!

290
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,083
Empress, help us!

291
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,750
After him!

292
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,083
Stop him!

293
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,791
Elisabeth, no!

294
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,708
Stay back!

295
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,000
Elisabeth, stop!

296
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,208
Stop the Empress!

297
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,875
Elisabeth!

298
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,833
Get away from there.
How could this happen? Take him away.

299
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,458
One of the guards said
he was a Lombardian rebel.

300
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,416
-Why are they rebelling in Lombardy?
-What?

301
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,416
-Did he want to harm the Empress?
-Stop whining. All of you!

302
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,708
The Empress needs us now.
She will be here any moment.

303
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,541
Get some fresh clothes.

304
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,583
Your Majesty.
We are so happy nothing happened to you.

305
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,541
-I want to see my daughter.
-That's blood!

306
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:32,083
Don't stand around like a swan, Pauline!
Get the Empress some tea.

307
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,708
-Where is Fienchen?
-She's been taken to safety, Your Majesty.

308
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,666
Elisabeth?

309
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,500
Please leave at once.

310
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,166
Leontine?

311
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,958
Can you find out
if the young man is still alive?

312
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:55,708
Who is he?

313
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:00,041
Adolfo Tadini
had been your secretary for a year.

314
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,750
And you knew nothing
of his political views?

315
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,083
I swear on my life, Your Majesty.

316
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,500
I knew nothing. I didn't know this.

317
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,958
-I beg you, please believe me!
-Stand up, please.

318
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,916
Please escort the Count out.

319
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,333
-Question him tomorrow morning.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:20,583
But I didn't know. I didn't know anything.

321
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,791
A cut-out tongue.
What's this supposed to mean?

322
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,875
The people there want to say something
but aren't allowed to.

323
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,625
What is the situation
in Lombardy-Venetia, von Bach?

324
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:35,708
The calls for political autonomy
and liberation from Habsburg rule

325
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:39,583
and occupation have never ceased
entirely since the revolution.

326
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,166
But in recent years,

327
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,000
there's been no hint
of an organised independence movement.

328
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,458
That person acted alone, Your Majesty.

329
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,666
I'm certain of it.

330
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,500
Nevertheless,

331
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:53,750
I'll order an increased military presence
in Lombardy immediately.

332
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:55,583
That will do.

333
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:00,250
I'm afraid it's not quite that simple.
Your Majesty, may I?

334
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,500
Our immediate neighbour,
the Kingdom of Piedmont,

335
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,708
has long wanted
to unite all Italian-speaking regions,

336
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:13,041
the Kingdom of Sicily,
Modena, Parma, Tuscany and so on,

337
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,750
creating one big empire
under the leadership of Piedmont.

338
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,500
And this is supposed to include
our Lombardy-Venetia.

339
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,166
Have you ever heard such nonsense?
What is this country to be called?

340
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,833
Italy.

341
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:32,333
The Lombards have been part
of Austria for over 150 years.

342
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,000
They are loyal to the Emperor.

343
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,375
Are they?

344
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,666
Piedmont's prime minister,
the Count of Cavour,

345
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,708
railed against the Habsburg Empire
at the peace conference in Paris.

346
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:47,458
He said oppressed Lombards
had to be freed from Habsburg rule.

347
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,666
And why am I just now learning about this?

348
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:57,500
We were focused on the peace negotiations
with St Petersburg. This was secondary.

349
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,416
Today's incident has shown
you judged this wrong.

350
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,750
Lombardy is part of our empire.
That is still your responsibility, Bach.

351
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,291
But not Piedmont.

352
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,083
Gentlemen.

353
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:13,250
How did the other major powers
react to Piedmont's demands?

354
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:17,458
Our position in Europe has been bad
since the Crimean War.

355
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:20,208
France and England
are hostile towards our empire.

356
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:24,250
That's outrageous! We sent
300,000 soldiers to stop the Russians.

357
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,208
But we avoided a battle.

358
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:29,833
Victory over Russia is therefore credited
to Emperor Napoleon alone.

359
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:34,208
The opinion in Paris was,
a man who doesn't fear war.

360
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,750
I don't fear war either.

361
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,666
But I prefer peace.

362
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,541
We must speak with Emperor Napoleon.

363
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,875
It would be good to have him on our side.

364
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:56,583
Emperor Napoleon
does not speak to Austrian diplomats.

365
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,166
"Emperor Napoleon," the sound of it alone!

366
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:03,375
One is born an emperor.
One doesn't declare oneself as such.

367
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,375
The old rules of politics
don't matter to Napoleon.

368
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:11,083
We must show him
how important he is to us.

369
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,125
By sending a family member
to him directly.

370
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:17,125
Your Majesty,
you can't possibly go to Paris yourself.

371
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,625
No. Of course not.

372
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,791
TRIESTE
AUSTRIAN PROVINCE

373
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,333
Your Majesty, dear Brother,

374
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,250
this is letter 85.

375
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,458
But who counts such things?

376
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:40,750
I just read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

377
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:45,291
It is about a scientist
who creates a person in his image.

378
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,041
But then Frankenstein rejects his creature
because it scares him.

379
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:55,083
The monster then proceeds
to only do horrible things.

380
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:58,125
Allow me to quote the monster,

381
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,750
"I am evil

382
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,333
because I am unhappy."

383
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,166
Imperial Highness.

384
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,875
I always have to vomit on my birthday.

385
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,125
Shall I ask your guests to excuse you?

386
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,625
Out with the old, in with the new.

387
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:33,250
Cheers.

388
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:38,833
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny

389
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:42,875
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

390
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:48,541
Which nobody can deny

391
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,541
I thank you all.

392
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:55,291
-Thank you, Ivan.
-Make a wish, Your Highness!

393
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,166
I wish for good health.

394
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:03,791
-Stimulating acquaintances.
-Oh, yes!

395
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:10,041
A fountain of wine that never runs dry.
And a palace bigger than this one.

396
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,750
And then I wish for…

397
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,791
a huge wave to come from the sea…

398
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,833
and swallow all this up.

399
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,208
Starting with me.

400
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:01,333
Did you congratulate him on his birthday?
Your brother?

401
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,500
We have bigger problems now,
don't you think?

402
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,250
He's suffered enough.

403
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,500
It was high treason.

404
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,250
The punishment is death.

405
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,958
He never would have succeeded.
Because I wouldn't have allowed it.

406
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:23,833
It's not about whether
he'd have succeeded or not.

407
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,416
He attempted it.

408
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,708
I'm going to bed.

409
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,291
Forgiveness isn't a feeling, Franz.

410
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,250
It's a choice.

411
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:39,916
-Your Imperial Highness!
-Leave me!

412
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Leave me.

413
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,541
I'm even too cowardly for that.

414
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,166
Alexander?

415
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,791
Did you see the Empress?

416
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:20,375
She'd like to know
how the young man is doing.

417
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,625
He succumbed to his injuries.

418
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,708
Can you tell me
what else you know about him?

419
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,083
I sometimes feel like you're using me.

420
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,458
The Empress asked me to find out.

421
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:52,875
I don't want this any more.
These secret meetings. It's not right.

422
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,833
Is that the Catholic in you talking?

423
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,958
Do you think
you'll go to hell because of me?

424
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,750
Marry me.

425
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:10,125
I want to show the whole world
that we belong together.

426
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,000
Leontine,

427
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,333
I want to meet your family.

428
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,291
I'll think about it.

429
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,958
What's stopping you from saying yes?

430
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,500
You have my dress.

431
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,250
None of it belongs to you!

432
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,708
What did you do
with the real Countess Apafi?

433
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,875
You are scum.

434
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,083
Sleep, my darling.

435
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:21,791
Close your eyes.

436
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:32,083
The good Lord is in the light
As He is in the darkness

437
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,083
He is in everything that there is

438
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,250
He is in our kisses

439
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:52,958
Sleep tight.

440
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,666
I'm so sorry about what happened today.

441
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,583
-We shot him. Just like that.
-Not just like that.

442
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,083
He tried to flee.

443
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,666
He was unarmed, was he not?

444
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,458
He threatened us.

445
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,833
I was afraid for you.

446
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:31,083
He didn't mean any harm. I know that.
He was desperate. Didn't you see that?

447
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:34,833
Yes, and desperation gives rise to hate.
I experienced that.

448
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,250
What if he had harmed you?

449
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:44,625
Our family.

450
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,291
But he didn't.

451
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,083
What you just said to Fienchen…

452
00:35:58,416 --> 00:35:59,333
What was that?

453
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,458
It's a poem.

454
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,208
Heinrich Heine?

455
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,583
I know he's still forbidden here.

456
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,125
Don't tell on me.

457
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,125
My father sent it to me.

458
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,041
Who else?

459
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,250
Is he kicking again?

460
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,000
Elisabeth?

461
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,041
The midwives!

462
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,250
The Empress needs the midwives!

463
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,125
The midwives!

464
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,916
The Empress needs the midwives.

465
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,458
Come. Quickly.

466
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,375
Faster!

467
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,125
-My glasses!
-I've got them.

468
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,416
Did something happen?

469
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,166
Your Imperial Highness.

470
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,166
-Is something wrong with the child?
-The contractions have begun.

471
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,000
-The heir to the throne is on his way.
-But it's still far too soon!

472
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:11,416
Nature takes its course,
Your Imperial Highness.

473
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,041
Let it be known that we should pray.
In the court chapel.

474
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:17,708
-Certainly, Your Imperial Highness.
-Everyone in the palace shall pray!

475
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,333
Not now.

476
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:28,000
It is the Empress. She's in labour.

477
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:33,166
Get out of there! The Empress needs me.
The Empress needs me now!

478
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,208
Oh, God.

479
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,583
-Don't you think we're disturbing?
-We're here for emotional support.

480
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:45,583
It's tradition.

481
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:48,916
If Your Majesty would lie down,
it would help things.

482
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,416
I have to move around.

483
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,458
Thank you.

484
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:59,833
-Can the child be born this early?
-It's only a few weeks. I'm not worried.

485
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:03,583
The sun may only rise once
over a woman in labour. You know that.

486
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,541
It's only been a few hours.

487
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,791
Massaging the lower back
helps open the cervix.

488
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:11,666
The cervix was open
wide enough two hours ago.

489
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,916
But why don't we see the head?

490
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:15,750
What can I do?

491
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,250
Tell me what I can do.

492
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:23,916
Something isn't right.
The pain is different from last time.

493
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:30,750
Can't you give her something for the pain?

494
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,375
In England, they give women chloroform
during childbirth.

495
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:37,708
-Not in the Habsburg Empire.
-Bearing the pain is our divine duty.

496
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,625
Get the doctor.

497
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,583
Your Majesty,
with all due respect, there's no need.

498
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,708
Get the doctor.

499
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,666
He is worth it, Elisabeth.

500
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:12,333
-Maybe it's the umbilical cord.
-God help us.

501
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,750
May I ask you to lie down, Your Majesty?

502
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,666
Maybe we should sing something soothing.

503
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,958
Yes. But please, do it outside.

504
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:30,916
My umbilical cord was around my neck.
The midwife cut it with a letter opener.

505
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,708
Please leave the room.

506
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,041
Only Dr Fritsch and the midwives stay.

507
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,333
Please.

508
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:50,791
Lie down.

509
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:57,958
Hold this, please.

510
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,125
-Is something wrong with the child?
-I can see the head.

511
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:04,875
You're doing very well, Your Majesty.

512
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:25,666
-I fear the uterus is damaged.
-We can still save the child.

513
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,625
-What did you say?
-The child has to come out immediately.

514
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,208
Get the forceps, Mrs Pfudel.

515
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:34,375
Hurry up. We have no time to lose.

516
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:48,666
You're doing very well, Your Majesty.

517
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,500
-Hold this, please.
-Yes, right away, Doctor.

518
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,500
I need more light.

519
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,083
Keep going, Your Majesty, keep going!

520
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:13,833
You're getting close.

521
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,125
You're doing great.

522
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:18,708
One more push.

523
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,250
Keep going!

524
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,666
Yes. Very good, Your Majesty.

525
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,875
Here he comes.

526
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,208
Clean the child off.

527
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,333
We must try to stop the bleeding.

528
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:45,875
Elisabeth, you did it.

529
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:48,541
You did it.

530
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,125
Your Majesty,
please go over to your child.

531
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,791
What about my wife?

532
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,250
I implore you. Go.

533
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,625
We need towels. Bring more towels!

534
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,583
More towels!

535
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,291
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

536
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,250
It's a girl.

537
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,458
Try to keep her awake.

538
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:34,958
Your Majesty?

539
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,750
Can you hear me?

540
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,250
Your Majesty, can you hear me?

541
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,833
Your Majesty.

542
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,458
Your Imperial Highness! A telegram!

543
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,375
Your Imperial Highness!

544
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,708
A telegram from Vienna.

545
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:35,958
It's from your brother.

546
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:53,708
