1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,333
Lord.

3
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,666
Guide us through the darkness

4
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,791
and lead us into the light.

5
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,833
Show us who is good

6
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,500
and who wishes evil.

7
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:07,875
Your Highness?

8
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:09,875
It's time.

9
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,166
The Emperor

10
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,583
fights for us

11
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,500
and our beloved Austrian Empire.

12
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,500
He shows us the way.

13
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,083
With strength

14
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,125
and wisdom,

15
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,958
the Emperor protects us

16
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,125
and our Empire from dark powers

17
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,416
that wish to subvert it.

18
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,583
And now,

19
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:52,125
Almighty God has sent him a bride.

20
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,708
Elisabeth.

21
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,958
She is to be like an island

22
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,125
in the midst of a raging storm.

23
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:08,583
Her bosom shall provide
our divine Emperor refuge.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,625
For demonic forces are at work out there

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,125
that wish to devour

26
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,041
our beloved Empire.

27
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,375
But this alliance,

28
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,000
Franz and Elisabeth,

29
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,791
will protect us.

30
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,250
It will shine

31
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,833
for eternity.

32
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,291
By the grace of God,

33
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,875
I declare you

34
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,250
husband and wife.

35
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,166
Elisabeth!

36
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,708
Imperial couple!

37
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,375
-Hold still!
-Back!

38
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,000
Hold still, I said!

39
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,708
Back!

40
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,833
Stay back!

41
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,166
Stay back!

42
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,916
We need reinforcements!

43
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,291
Stay back!

44
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,791
Can't you hear? Back! Get back!

45
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,166
Back!

46
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,416
Your visitor, Imperial Highness.

47
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,916
You are late.

48
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
Thank you for the invitation.

49
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,791
Your Imperial Highness.

50
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,916
You always add a little colour
to a dreary evening like this one.

51
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,250
But from here on, you're on your own.

52
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,416
I'll manage fine.

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,708
Care to tell me your plans?

54
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,250
To meet new friends.
To see old ones again.

55
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,791
Why so nervous?
You've never been to a ball?

56
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,708
I have, but I am not as jaded
as some people are.

57
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,333
What's the problem with you, Leontine?

58
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,375
A lady from such a noble house
in her prime.

59
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,291
Why are you not married?

60
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,291
I have to meet a man at court.

61
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,666
I have seven sisters.
Father says five must marry.

62
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,333
-Or else he'll hang himself.
-I'm not looking for a husband.

63
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,125
What are you looking for?

64
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,125
As I hear, you had a visitor last night.

65
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,375
Your Imperial Highness,
the Foreign Minister.

66
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,291
At this hour? Today?

67
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,458
Your Highness, I beg your pardon.
It's an emergency.

68
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,166
Speak.

69
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,708
The Russians have greatly increased
their troops on our border.

70
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,458
We've heard they're crossing it.
It's a threat.

71
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,458
The Russian army is on Habsburg soil?

72
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,166
I know you and the Tsar
are old friends, but…

73
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,875
Even the oldest friendship ends.
A border violation is unforgivable.

74
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,708
We must inform the Emperor.

75
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,916
What's happening now?

76
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,500
The court will dance in our honour.
We dance at the end of the evening.

77
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,916
Didn't they tell you? It was cancelled.

78
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,625
So you don't embarrass yourself.

79
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,083
She actually looks like an empress.
However did you do that, Mother?

80
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,833
Did you see?
The people immediately adored her.

81
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,291
You wanted them to calm down,
not to get riled up like dogs in heat.

82
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,041
-You're exaggerating.
-That's just what I see.

83
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,000
No, Maximilian.

84
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,875
You see what is in your own heart.

85
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,291
Do you know that woman there?

86
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,916
Which one?

87
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,666
Who is that?

88
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,625
I don't know her.

89
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,250
We have problems at the border.
We must speak at once.

90
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,041
Pardon me.

91
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,333
Where did the Emperor
run off to so quickly?

92
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,916
Bring her some fruit. She looks so pale.

93
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,958
I always knew
Elisabeth was something very special.

94
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,708
We just need
to find one for you now, Helene.

95
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,166
Countess?

96
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,375
-I'd like to make a request.
-Certainly, Your Majesty.

97
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,000
I'd like my sister to stay
with me at court.

98
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,166
You want to stay?

99
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,791
But you have
such wonderful company already.

100
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,291
She is my sister.
I don't trust anyone more than her.

101
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,250
Really?

102
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,666
And I'd like to stay.

103
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,791
She'll be in charge of my royal household.
Or is that a problem?

104
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,375
This is a clear provocation.

105
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,083
Stringing Tsar Nicholas along
was a mistake.

106
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,541
Caving into him now
would be an even bigger one.

107
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,125
I won't let him push me into this war.

108
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,125
I would like to urgently beseech you

109
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,583
to let the French and Russian ambassadors
know whose side we're taking.

110
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,750
And remember our responsibility
to the people in the border regions.

111
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:18,166
So your heart bleeds
for a few Romanian peasants? Please.

112
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,458
Majesty, you know I have
excellent connections to the French.

113
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,625
I can speak to them and form an alliance.

114
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:29,083
No, the most important thing is
to reinforce our troops at the border now.

115
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,416
At least 250,000 men.

116
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,000
Tell the ambassadors
I will make a decision.

117
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,125
This evening.

118
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,875
Shall we continue our discussion
in private, Your Majesty?

119
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,458
Please leave me alone.

120
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,041
Maximilian, you stay.

121
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,041
You invited Countess Gundemann?

122
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,416
Louise? She's here?

123
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,458
Stop this.

124
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,125
This is tasteless, even for you.

125
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,083
I knew nothing about it. Really.

126
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,416
Theo, see to it the Countess is shown out.

127
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,458
No.

128
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,708
Just keep an eye on her.

129
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,916
I don't want a scandal.

130
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,125
What do you still care
about this old story?

131
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,875
Louise is old news.

132
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,833
Or is she not?

133
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,166
You want to be my confidant and make
passes at my bride behind my back.

134
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,375
That's not how it was.

135
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,958
She simply accepted my invitation.
I invited you as well.

136
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,750
Starting now,
you'll stay out of my affairs.

137
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,250
Stay away from her and everything.

138
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,791
Bringing you back to Vienna was a mistake.

139
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,041
Destroying things is all you can do.

140
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,416
Please.

141
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,416
Your Majesty?

142
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,958
The gentlemen have just arrived.

143
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,666
I've been looking for you.

144
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,041
I was wondering how long
it'd take for the nanny to arrive.

145
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,333
I wanted to see
if I can do anything for you.

146
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,875
Well, since you ask, Theo,

147
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,708
tell me,

148
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,041
who is the most powerful man
at this party tonight?

149
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,500
His Majesty, of course.

150
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,333
Even the Emperor needs
something from someone.

151
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,541
I'm afraid I can't help you there.

152
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,583
Now don't act so innocent.
You know everything.

153
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,000
No one knows him better than you.

154
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:29,458
What happened at the church?
It didn't look like it was under control.

155
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,500
We made several arrests.

156
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,750
However,
some neighbourhoods are getting restless.

157
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,833
We're hearing of pubs
where liberal propaganda is circulating

158
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,833
and insurgents are gathering.

159
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,458
If you order,
I will undertake decisive action tonight.

160
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,083
On a joyous day such as this?

161
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,208
How would that look?

162
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,250
Countess, is there a problem?

163
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,916
She wants her sister to stay here.

164
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,583
As the head of her royal household.

165
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,125
I think it would be a great mistake.

166
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,041
Your Imperial Highness?

167
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,000
I'll think of something.

168
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,833
And you.

169
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,500
Arrest as many as you wish,

170
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,041
but tomorrow morning, you'll pardon 50
who we imprisoned long ago.

171
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,375
As a wedding gift for the Emperor.

172
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,125
Very well, Imperial Highness.

173
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,458
Did you hear?
They say there were arrests at the church.

174
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:54,291
-Arrests? For what reason?
-Someone offended the Majesties' honour.

175
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,041
We don't speak of such things
on such a happy day.

176
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,291
They say living conditions
in Vienna are bad.

177
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,958
Many are starving.

178
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,125
Those are rumours.

179
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,916
Speaking of starving, all I ate
for three months was carrots with salt

180
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,708
to fit into this dress,
but it was worth it.

181
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,458
That must be why the champagne
is going to your head so fast.

182
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,458
You have no idea.

183
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,375
You showed us all
what you think of marriage. Now stop.

184
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,375
-I'm not doing this out of protest.
-You're not?

185
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,041
Then why are you chasing every woman?

186
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,291
Because you don't want me.

187
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,166
Don't make a fool of yourself.

188
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:36,875
Who is that?

189
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,250
She won't stop staring at me.

190
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,708
Do you know that woman?

191
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,041
No, I'm sorry.

192
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,166
But of course!

193
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,000
Isn't she Countess Gundemann,
with whom His Majesty…

194
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,083
A misunderstanding, Majesty.

195
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,916
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like to speak to the Emperor.

196
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,333
-Majesty, we'll accompany you.
-She wants to be alone.

197
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,333
The Empress is never alone.
It's not allowed.

198
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,750
-Franz Liszt is back.
-Franz Liszt.

199
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,625
Where is he? I don't see him.

200
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,958
Franz?

201
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,625
Are you here?

202
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,250
Your Majesty.

203
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,583
My congratulations.

204
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,166
Why were you staring at me at the ball?

205
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,875
-Are you always this direct?
-Whenever I can.

206
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,541
How does it feel?

207
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,208
Being newly married?

208
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,250
Like yesterday,

209
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,708
only in white.

210
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,958
I knew we would get along.

211
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,333
Are you married?

212
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,875
-I've managed to avoid it so far.
-Do you know the Emperor?

213
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,458
You know,

214
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,708
at this court,
everyone has their own little task.

215
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,833
Serves their purpose.

216
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,208
What purpose do you serve?

217
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,208
I take care of entertainment.

218
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,250
I'm here now.

219
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,125
Whatever once was is now over.

220
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,916
This castle also has a plan for you.

221
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,583
It changes people.

222
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,166
It creeps inside them.

223
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,500
Until even you
have to play your little part.

224
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,000
Your Majesty.

225
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,041
So you want a loan for a new railway?

226
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,458
Don't we already have one?

227
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,625
His Majesty is convinced
better access to the Empire

228
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,916
would improve the level of satisfaction
in the remote areas.

229
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,250
-He wants to unite our people.
-Forgive me, Majesty. Who is he again?

230
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,708
Alexander von Bach,
my interior minister and closest adviser.

231
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:14,250
The conditions in many parts
of the Empire are intolerable.

232
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,833
Hence all the rebellion.
This railway means more trade and wealth.

233
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:22,250
Majesty, where is your mother?
I'd like to introduce her to my son.

234
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,708
Simon will take over
my businesses one day.

235
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:29,083
Just as your son will do one day.

236
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,208
Gentlemen, the situation is very grave.

237
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,125
The other European states
are leaving us behind.

238
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,000
-Thank you.
-It's not just a railway investment, it's…

239
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,166
Yes, sir.

240
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,541
You are investing in a better future
for the people of the Habsburg Empire.

241
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:48,125
Do you plan to build up the military?
As an ally of England and France?

242
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,083
-Investing in troops could interest us.
-How would these troops get to the border?

243
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,250
What about their rations?

244
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,125
The eastern border is
over 1,000 kilometres away.

245
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,041
We need this railway for everything.

246
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,041
Including war.

247
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,041
Your Majesty, the Empress.

248
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,083
Pardon the interruption.

249
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,583
Majesty, what a wonderful surprise.

250
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,291
And what a great honour.

251
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,125
May I speak with you--
Your Majesty for a moment?

252
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,708
It must wait.

253
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,500
It's very important.

254
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
I said later.

255
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,291
Of course.

256
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,041
If I may, the Empress is ravishing.

257
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,083
Do you still remember
your wedding night, Sina?

258
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,375
Probably better than you do, von Eskeles.

259
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:07,291
Yes, Majesty, we thank you so much
for these excellent cigars,

260
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,375
but I fear our bank can't help you.

261
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:13,333
With your permission.

262
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,208
Come along, Simon.

263
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,708
I always get sick riding on trains.

264
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:24,541
Shit.

265
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,208
Huhu!

266
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,458
Did you lose your empress? Yet again?

267
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,875
Her Majesty is taking a walk.

268
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:58,250
Your Highness,
I am Charlotte von Stubenberg.

269
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,666
My cousin served with you in the navy.

270
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,625
Maybe you remember him.
He has only one ear.

271
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,791
And you are?

272
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:09,250
Not interested in being the next
to lose her job because of you.

273
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,666
It might be worth it.

274
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,083
In my experience, it never is.

275
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,041
Who's that man there?

276
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,958
He looks very interesting.

277
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,666
That is the French ambassador.

278
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,375
Good evening.

279
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,916
Your Imperial Highness.

280
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,666
It's a pleasure to see you again.

281
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,166
The pleasure is all mine.
What an enchanting party.

282
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,541
It's nothing compared
to your costume ball last year.

283
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:43,333
I know you have
an urgent discussion with my brother.

284
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:48,125
With respect, Emperor Napoleon
has shown the Habsburgs much patience.

285
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,041
But now it is time for His Majesty,

286
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:54,375
your emperor,
to decide what side he is on.

287
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:57,000
He pays a high price for his peace.

288
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,000
Oh, please.

289
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,750
It's not about peace to him.

290
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:04,416
How so?

291
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,500
If France and Russia
tear each other apart,

292
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,500
who will ultimately
reign supreme in Europe?

293
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,333
My brother calls it peace,

294
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:21,583
but he profits from your war
by staying out of it.

295
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,666
Did you miss me?

296
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:32,833
Say it.

297
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,291
I wanted you to see him.

298
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,375
The man he has become.

299
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,791
The young woman
for whom this huge palace was too small,

300
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,375
who wanted to change everything,
is she still there?

301
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,833
I don't know.

302
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,041
And now?

303
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,291
You have a new Empress.
What will become of you?

304
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,708
Maybe I'll do something
I've always wanted to do.

305
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:38,916
Then come.

306
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,125
Let us go away from here.
Tomorrow morning.

307
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,291
How silly of me.

308
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,291
You'll never leave this place.

309
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,208
Habsburg.

310
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,708
That is your great love.

311
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,791
But there can be only one Empress.

312
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,375
Attention!

313
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:20,833
The Empress!

314
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,916
Can't you act normally for once?

315
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:28,875
What does that mean, "normal"?

316
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,500
Are the people in there normal?

317
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,791
You know what I mean.

318
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,375
Come on in.

319
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,833
It's almost like at home.

320
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:44,083
But that's not where we are.

321
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:47,833
I beg your forgiveness,
Your Serene Highness, but…

322
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,791
you know what I'm like.

323
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:54,250
You act like an asshole
and call it freedom.

324
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,291
So that's how it is.

325
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,791
They've already changed you.

326
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,625
Someone bring me my gun!

327
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,708
We have to shoot you now.

328
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,708
Can't you just be happy for me?

329
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:17,791
Happy?

330
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:19,291
About what?

331
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,583
Shall we ask your sister
what she thinks of all this?

332
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,583
And now she's supposed to look after you,

333
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,250
even though she loves him too.

334
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,333
I want you to leave.

335
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,041
Take Mother too.
I don't want to see you here again.

336
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,583
You'll never be yourself again
as long as you're in there.

337
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,250
But you got your emperor, didn't you?

338
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,833
You can't have it all, Elisabeth!

339
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:26,791
Your Majesty.

340
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,500
I congratulate you on your marriage.

341
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,333
Pardon me, have we met?

342
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:35,250
We haven't.

343
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:39,291
I'm an old friend of your mother's.
Gustav of Vasa, Your Majesty.

344
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,416
Of Vasa?

345
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,291
You're a Swede?

346
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:45,541
Yes, but I left
my homeland many years ago.

347
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:49,166
-The war with Napoleon?
-Worse. Problems with family.

348
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
You don't say.

349
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,041
My sister…

350
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:57,750
Let's just say it's better
if there are some mountains between us.

351
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,541
Similar with my brother and me.

352
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,791
These days, no palace is
big enough for both of us.

353
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,375
I can't imagine that.

354
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:11,416
As kids, when your brother couldn't sleep,
you sat with him in bed.

355
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,625
So the monsters wouldn't get him.

356
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,333
If you would please excuse me.

357
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:20,416
Wait.

358
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,250
How do you know that
about my brother and me?

359
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,583
Your mother told me.

360
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,166
Your Majesty?

361
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:46,958
Baron von Sina has requested
a last-minute audience with you.

362
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,666
You were expecting my father, right?

363
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,750
To be honest, yes.

364
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,833
He doesn't want to accept it,

365
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:04,125
but I already decide
what investments and loans we make.

366
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:07,916
I think your plans are correct.

367
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,583
The Industrial Revolution coming
to the Habsburgs is overdue.

368
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,208
I am happy to hear that.

369
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:14,833
However,

370
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:16,541
and with all due respect,

371
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,708
your family has a reputation
for spending more money than it has.

372
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,041
Magnificent party, by the way.

373
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:31,416
As you may know, I'm not known
for wasting my money on wars or castles.

374
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,458
Everyone builds themselves
a monument eventually.

375
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:35,583
You have my word.

376
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,333
And that is not enough.

377
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:39,708
Or so I thought.

378
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:43,791
But there is someone
who could convince me to trust you.

379
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,708
And as I've heard,

380
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,958
you already know each other.

381
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,333
My congratulations, Majesty.

382
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,208
How lovely to see you.

383
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,416
I thank you, Countess.

384
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,791
On Monday, I'll send you
a proposal for the loan.

385
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,083
Shall we?

386
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,583
Yes.

387
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,541
This is incredible.

388
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,666
This is fantastic.

389
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,166
We have the money!

390
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,958
-Well, you have the money, Your Majesty.
-What money?

391
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:42,166
Tell the ambassadors
I will ally with no one.

392
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,208
But instead?

393
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,958
I will renew our empire.

394
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,500
And I will build a railway first.

395
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:55,541
-You can't be serious.
-Majesty, I think this is a great mistake.

396
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,916
You can't possibly pawn
our empire off to those dogs!

397
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,750
For a toy!

398
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,375
Where did you suddenly get this idea?

399
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:11,666
If you'll excuse me,
it's time for the dance with my bride.

400
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,333
If the Empire crumbles,

401
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,916
I will hang you first.

402
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,666
Imperial Highness, au revoir.

403
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,291
I will travel to Paris tonight.

404
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,916
Napoleon must know your brother's stance.

405
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,375
Please send Napoleon my regards.

406
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:51,291
I very much hope
our two nations will soon be close allies.

407
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,958
That would require a new emperor.

408
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:57,458
If you have someone in mind.

409
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:20,291
We looked everywhere for you.
The entire court was worried.

410
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,541
We thought someone abducted you.

411
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:27,166
The Emperor had to wait so long.
The guests too.

412
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,750
Your Majesty.

413
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,458
Helene.

414
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:53,375
Your Majesty.

415
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,291
My congratulations.

416
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:10,833
Thank you.

417
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,375
You look enchanting, Helene.

418
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,000
If I may say so.

419
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:23,875
Thank you.

420
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:33,416
I expect they whisper
that I should scratch your eyes out.

421
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,125
Let them whisper.

422
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,041
I'm glad you wish to stay
with Elisabeth for a while.

423
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,708
There you are.

424
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,458
Is something wrong?

425
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:07,125
You already know everything.

426
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,791
Say the word and we'll make sure
that countess never comes here again.

427
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,333
Thank you. That's unnecessary.

428
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,291
Everyone wants a piece of you.
Don't let it unsettle you.

429
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,875
Learn who you can trust.

430
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:30,416
Is it right for Helene to stay at court?

431
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,083
Or is it selfish of me?

432
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:38,083
There's no simple answer to that question.

433
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,166
Please.

434
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,041
If you're asking
if she's loyal to you, yes.

435
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,708
But if she's still hurt…

436
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,791
How would you feel, my dear?

437
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:59,625
We have a dear cousin in Bohemia.
We'll arrange a trip for her.

438
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,541
She deserves a break from your parents,
don't you think?

439
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:06,958
Yes.

440
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,791
How was your evening?

441
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,583
Is everything all right?

442
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,541
You wretched little traitor, you!

443
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,416
Did you make these flyers?

444
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:33,083
Your Majesties, now for
the most important part of the evening.

445
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:34,250
The wedding night.

446
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:43,625
Without successful consummation tonight,
the marriage is not valid.

447
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,958
The act must be performed.

448
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,458
You will wear this gown
for the entire duration.

449
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,541
Do not take it off.

450
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,083
Pain is normal.

451
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:04,375
It is best if you lie still
and let everything take its course.

452
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,875
This union is not
in the service of pleasure.

453
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,833
This union is for God.

454
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:13,208
For the Holy Habsburg Empire.

455
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:45,583
I lied to you.

456
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,250
I know that woman.

457
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:50,500
She told me that.

458
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,166
It ended. Long ago.

459
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,041
She won't accept it.

460
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,750
I felt like a fool the whole night.

461
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:07,708
I'm sorry.

462
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:11,625
They all treat me
like I can't even count to three.

463
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,458
Everyone wants to get into my head.

464
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:17,750
Like my brother?

465
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Be careful with him, that's all.

466
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:30,166
Anything else?

467
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:32,291
No.

468
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,208
This nightgown…

469
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,791
I can't take it off or I'll go to hell.

470
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:04,833
What are you doing?

471
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:09,250
It's calming.

472
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,083
We can do this.

473
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:52,458
Together.

474
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,208
Then don't desert me again.

475
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,333
I promise.

476
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,875
I'm going to rest for a moment.

477
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,041
I'm sorry they sent us away
from the court so soon.

478
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,375
They don't know what she's like at all.

479
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:13,041
None of them know what she's really like.

480
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,083
You always said she's not all there.

481
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:20,916
Like me.

482
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,750
But she is stronger than I am.

483
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,541
And she gets that from you.

484
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,041
Don't be sad, Helene.

485
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,291
I'm not, Mother.

486
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:52,666
From now on, this is her journey.

487
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:05,333
I heard the Prince of Vasa has departed.

488
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:15,583
It's better that way, and you know that.

489
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,666
-He caused us so much trouble. Remember?
-What if it's true?

490
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,833
That my time is over?

491
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,125
What are you doing?

492
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,291
Good night, Your Imperial Highness.
