1
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:09,041
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,166
SIX YEARS EARLIER

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,708
Faster, faster!

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,708
Go, go!

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,708
We'll leave Vienna
until the fighting is over.

6
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,500
The revolution will devour us
if we don't act.

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,541
It's over for your uncle, the Emperor.

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,125
Your time has come, Franz.

9
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,333
-But Father is next in line.
-No.

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,375
Your father is as weak as his brother.

11
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,333
Have no fear.

12
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,333
We'll do it together.

13
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,333
You and I.

14
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,291
Keep going!

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,291
Good morning, Your Majesty.
You were dreaming.

16
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,125
Thank you.

17
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,833
The cabinet is awaiting His Majesty
and you for a special meeting

18
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,625
regarding the Russian crisis.

19
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,666
Furthermore, I am happy to inform you

20
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,916
that the Empress has not bled in 30 days.

21
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,833
There is every reason
to hope she is pregnant.

22
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:22,791
Then see to it that hope becomes certainty
and she was worth all the trouble.

23
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,625
The honeymoon phase is over.

24
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,458
You must stop staring at me
the whole night like an owl.

25
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,208
Not even two months,
and you've had enough of me?

26
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,333
Yes, actually.

27
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,500
But?

28
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,250
The food here is exquisite.

29
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,125
And the view.

30
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,083
The gentlemen await you.

31
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,125
The ministers.

32
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,458
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,541
Is it about Russia?

34
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,041
My regiment will be here soon too.

35
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,416
Three, two, one.

36
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,041
Countess Esterhazy.

37
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,625
Good morning, Your Majesty.

38
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,541
I hope you rested well.

39
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,500
-Good morning, Your Majesty.
-Good morning, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,416
Today's supposed to be sunny.

41
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,541
We could cut flowers again.
Or continue our embroidery.

42
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:18,041
Countess, you know I love your raw egg,
but could I maybe have coffee today?

43
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,000
You last bled a month ago,

44
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,208
and we're full of hope, Majesty,
that it worked this time.

45
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,583
It'll just happen, don't you think?
Have some faith, Countess.

46
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,291
If, God forbid,
anything happened to His Majesty

47
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,416
and there were no heirs to the throne,
the Empire would face a war of succession.

48
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,208
So, if you ask me, no.

49
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:47,500
The future of Habsburg
will not "just happen."

50
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,000
Today, I brought you something else.

51
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,666
What is that?

52
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,041
The placenta of a woman
who just bore her eighth son.

53
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,625
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

54
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,208
Pardon me, Countess.

55
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,458
We have to ensure
we get an heir to the throne, do we not?

56
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,583
What if I have a girl?

57
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,541
A girl

58
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,250
cannot rule.

59
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,833
The French stopped responding.

60
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:40,083
Since your wedding, Your Majesty,
they've severed diplomatic relations.

61
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,375
I cannot explain
what has upset Napoleon so much.

62
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,708
Did the Tsar read my letter?

63
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,916
The time for friendly diplomacy
has expired for good.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,500
You can no longer abide
this escalation, Your Majesty.

65
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,500
We must reinforce our troops.

66
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,250
On both borders. Right now.

67
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,208
I fear we can't afford that.

68
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,333
We need a railway.

69
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,291
There's still enough
to defend our empire, Mother.

70
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,500
We wouldn't have to defend it
if we exhibit strength now.

71
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,541
I will not engage
in a senseless militarization.

72
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,041
There is another way.

73
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,666
Can't you make contact
with St. Petersburg or Paris?

74
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,500
You're my highest-ranking diplomat,
not a damn stable boy!

75
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,375
Any other suggestions?

76
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,250
No?

77
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,500
We'll invite the Tsar's son to Vienna.

78
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,500
Alexander? He is not on the throne yet.

79
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,083
That's not a good idea.

80
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,208
Nicholas would see that
as another provocation.

81
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,416
I am sure Alexander will
do things differently than his father.

82
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,625
I can speak to him about the future.

83
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,333
That will be all.

84
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,375
What's my brother doing here?
You know I don't want him here.

85
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,541
He's bored.

86
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,666
You know how dangerous he can be
when he's bored.

87
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,041
Give him something to do.

88
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,083
I'll take over.

89
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,000
Your Majesty.

90
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,750
Scared?

91
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,333
Not allowed to bed your bride tonight?
Or to what do I owe the honour?

92
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,000
Show me if your short legs
are as fast as your tongue.

93
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,333
Is that it?

94
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,208
Do you want to kill me?

95
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,958
You've changed since the wedding, Maxi.

96
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,250
You told me to stay out of things,
so I am.

97
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,791
-Since when do you do what you're told?
-Do you think I'm here to entertain you?

98
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,041
To play the clown, like before?
Go to hell.

99
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,333
Don't act as if I'm to blame
for your misery!

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,875
You aren't happy at court and never were!

101
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,791
You think you know me so well?

102
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,250
Then tell me I'm wrong.

103
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,541
It was selfish to call you back.

104
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,708
You need something of your own.

105
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,958
Chief Commander
of the Imperial Austrian Navy.

106
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,125
What do you say?

107
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you trying to fool me?

108
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,583
Our navy? I know our navy.

109
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,291
Two ports, eight worm-infested rowboats.
It's a joke.

110
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,166
Then tell me what you want.

111
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,916
Make me Governor of Bohemia.

112
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,416
Or at least Tyrol.

113
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,958
A real responsibility.

114
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,083
You're no statesman, Maxi.

115
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,791
So that's how it is.

116
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,708
An empire from here to the Carpathians,
and you can't share it.

117
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,250
You're afraid
I'll take something from you.

118
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,833
It's always been that way.

119
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,916
Do you know
when you take something from someone?

120
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,458
When you're given nothing.

121
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,125
Good luck with Russia.

122
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,333
Did you hear Prince Ferdinand of Kinsky

123
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,666
asked Princess Marie
of Lichtenstein for her hand?

124
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,708
The Prince of Kinsky?

125
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,916
He was almost taken
by the Princess of Auersperg.

126
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,291
Exactly!

127
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,375
You don't say.

128
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,625
Hold the needle
with two fingers, Leontine.

129
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,458
That makes it easier.

130
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,041
Charlotte, will you hand me the scissors?

131
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,000
Charlotte?

132
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,000
That's a Schwarzenberg, Charlotte.

133
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,583
One of the best families in the Empire.

134
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,708
Forget about it.

135
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,791
Shit.

136
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,250
I beg your pardon.

137
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,791
You curse better than you embroider.

138
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,208
I wonder what's more important in life.

139
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,458
-Tea, ladies.
-Thank you.

140
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,583
Is this how you imagined life at court?

141
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,166
What do you mean by that?

142
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,583
I always dreamed of life in a big city.

143
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,208
Don't you wonder how things are out there?
Beyond the gates?

144
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,708
Yes, Leontine,
you never tell us about yourself.

145
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,791
Your home. Your family.

146
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,250
The Emperor!

147
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,000
Your Majesty.

148
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,083
I have a little time.
Shall we go for a walk?

149
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,500
I have a better idea.

150
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,083
Don't look at me. Over there.

151
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,625
Take off your shirt.

152
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,333
Your trousers too.

153
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,625
Don't smile so much.

154
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,625
I look like that?

155
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,583
Yes, I know.

156
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,500
I have to look at it every day.

157
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,625
How does it feel?

158
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,666
Do you know why he tried to kill you?

159
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,458
Because he had nothing to lose.

160
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,875
Kempen said they caught
everyone involved in the attack.

161
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,416
But that's not what matters.

162
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,375
People are still unhappy.

163
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,666
So many live in poverty.

164
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,708
Franz.

165
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,833
You can change all that.

166
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,291
I know it.

167
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,583
I hear you two went for a swim.

168
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,583
He looks very happy, Elisabeth.
And that makes me very happy.

169
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,458
Thank you.

170
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,250
I know sharing him
with everyone isn't easy.

171
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,041
That's not how it feels.
He tells me everything.

172
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,875
And I hear there is reason for hope?

173
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,583
You'll have a task of your own soon.

174
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,875
Did you have a nice morning?

175
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,250
I saw you in the park
with the ladies again.

176
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,958
Did you hide in the bushes to watch us?

177
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,708
How many handkerchiefs do you have now?

178
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,208
One for each lady
who cries her eyes out over you.

179
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,875
So you're doing well?

180
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,375
Contrary to your prediction, yes.
Splendidly.

181
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,208
The Tsar's son is passing through Bavaria
on his way from Hessen.

182
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,458
Prepare a letter.

183
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,500
Franz?

184
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,583
If we send a messenger,
he could be here this weekend.

185
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,291
Not enough time
to prepare a fitting reception.

186
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,250
-We'll have to postpone.
-This is a unique opportunity.

187
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,041
Not enough time.
It would be an undignified reception.

188
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,375
Dumplings!

189
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,791
-Then we will have to hurry.
-This is ridiculous.

190
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,041
If it's not perfect, it'd be a disgrace.

191
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,541
Maybe a grand reception isn't necessary.

192
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,208
What do you mean, Elisabeth?

193
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,708
Maybe something more intimate will do.

194
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,083
"More intimate"?

195
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,416
My father always discussed
important matters while hunting.

196
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,375
A hunt is a wonderful idea.

197
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,458
We could visit Father at Auhof.

198
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,791
Out of the question.

199
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,750
If you want to talk in peace,
without the circus,

200
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,666
it might be the right choice.

201
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,416
"Circus"?

202
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:03,250
He should know we're not trying
to impress him, should he not?

203
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,583
We'll do that.

204
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,583
No banquet, no currying favour.

205
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,458
A friendly chat.

206
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,625
But the Empress shouldn't go on the hunt.

207
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,208
Why not?

208
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,791
In your delicate condition,

209
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,000
it's too much excitement,
so I'll go instead.

210
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,666
I'd like to go too.

211
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,375
We'll go alone.

212
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,000
Elisabeth and I,
the future Tsar and his wife.

213
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,000
Do you have another wish, Your Highness?

214
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,041
No.

215
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
A hunt. Have you ever heard
of anything so childish?

216
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,666
You must go with them.

217
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,666
Of course, I will.
Our empire is on the brink of war.

218
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,583
Now we're going to him
at that chicken farm.

219
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,875
Karl lives at Auhof
to stay away from state affairs.

220
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,833
What'll be next?
Sending Luziwuzi to Napoleon?

221
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,583
Your husband will be aware
of how serious this is.

222
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:25,458
-I'll have a new uniform sent to him.
-How dare that girl go over my head?

223
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,750
Your Imperial Highness,

224
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,125
sometimes it's good
to let things run their course.

225
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,500
Let her fall on her face
and let everyone see it.

226
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,583
What real harm could she do?

227
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,750
I can't wait to see the Tsar's son.
They say he's a feast for the eyes.

228
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,416
Good morning, ladies.

229
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,041
You do know
that he only has an honorary title?

230
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,125
So what?

231
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,500
-Ladies, some tea?
-He is an accountant.

232
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,916
A man who's good with numbers is good at…

233
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,666
counting.

234
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,500
I don't know what the Empress sees in her.

235
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,958
She is vulgar.

236
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,750
I think she's fun.

237
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,166
If something looks like sauerkraut
and smells like sauerkraut,

238
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,791
it's usually not mousse au chocolat.

239
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,750
Your Majesty?

240
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,541
It is here. The contract from Sina.

241
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,333
We have the money.

242
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,250
You need only to sign it.

243
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,750
-No more obstacles for the railway.
-Congratulations.

244
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,375
Let's just hope we don't need any cannons.

245
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,500
Ho, ho!

246
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,791
My son.

247
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,125
Father.

248
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,541
-You're finally visiting me again.
-I'm pleased too.

249
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,708
It was Elisabeth's idea.
So, please, don't get sentimental.

250
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,750
I'll be in the garden.

251
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,541
I hope you understand
I couldn't stay at home.

252
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,041
It's too important for us.

253
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,500
Of course, I understand.

254
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,000
If I'm with child,

255
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,708
this weekend in the woods
won't change that.

256
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:27,083
Besides, I drank
all the eggs Esterhazy gave me.

257
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,666
So what could go wrong?

258
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,000
Your confidence impresses me.

259
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,250
I bathed in salt
until my skin fell off like scales.

260
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:39,791
I ate so many raw eggs
that I'd vomit every morning.

261
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,875
It didn't help. It took six years.

262
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,541
Having a child is hard work.

263
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,958
I know. My mother bore eight.

264
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,958
But this is about having an heir!
Your only task.

265
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,958
Do it before seeking a new one.

266
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,416
Good evening, gentlemen. Milady.

267
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,500
Thank you all for coming.

268
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,583
His Imperial Highness is just as unhappy
with the course of events as we are.

269
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,708
Indeed.

270
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,291
And I believe I have an interesting offer.

271
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,750
-Imperial Highness.
-Your Majesty.

272
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,750
Welcome to Austria.

273
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,625
So this is the woman
all of Europe is talking about.

274
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:29,458
"Beautiful as the sunrise,"
my envoy wrote to me from the wedding.

275
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:33,333
-He wasn't exaggerating.
-But he may have overdone the champagne.

276
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:40,625
Last time, he was just a boy.
Now he's Emperor.

277
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:41,666
And I'm not.

278
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:45,916
You'll have to tell me
how to get rid of one's father.

279
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,625
-Where is your wife?
-Yes.

280
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:49,833
Where is she?

281
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,083
Maria!

282
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,916
Are we here already?

283
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,541
-Your Majesty.
-Maria.

284
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:08,125
-How lovely to see you again.
-It is a great pleasure.

285
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:12,083
-Yes, Puppy has to relieve herself.
-And she should.

286
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,958
Tomorrow morning. At sunrise?

287
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,541
-Not a moment later.
-I can hardly wait.

288
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,708
We agree
that the Emperor has lost his mind.

289
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,708
We need to ally with the French.

290
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,750
Napoleon's offer is off the table.

291
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,250
Napoleon is so upset,

292
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,625
we could be in a war
on two fronts if we don't act.

293
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,458
With Russia and with France.

294
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:49,166
We should declare war on Russia.
That could change Napoleon's mind.

295
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,833
-Right, but the Emperor disagrees.
-What are you getting at?

296
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:58,125
I have the assurance of the French court
that they won't attack Habsburg.

297
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:01,208
And, what's more,

298
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:04,541
that they would support Habsburg
in a war with Russia.

299
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:05,750
That cannot be.

300
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,750
Napoleon favours the Emperor again?
How do you know that?

301
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,791
I don't think I expressed myself clearly.

302
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,041
The French will not help my brother.

303
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,291
But they will help a new emperor.

304
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:33,791
And, of course, with the condition
that we do not ally ourselves with Russia.

305
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:39,583
What if the Emperor makes
a peace agreement with the Tsar's son?

306
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,083
Leave that to me.

307
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,916
Good morning, Your Majesty.

308
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,958
Good morning.

309
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,333
I don't like any of them.

310
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,333
Grand Duchess.

311
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,125
My darling, good morning.

312
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,250
This is a Zaisenberger hunting rifle
with an octagonal muzzle,

313
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,291
freshly sighted and accurate.

314
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,416
It is our best model.

315
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:15,000
It sits well in the hand.
Why didn't you give this to me right away?

316
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,250
I never show everything I have right away.

317
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,125
So you have more in your cabinet?

318
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:21,833
Who knows?

319
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,083
I'll take the rifle.

320
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,958
-Good choice.
-Empress.

321
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:29,958
Good morning.

322
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,041
The only thing
I don't really understand about hunting is

323
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,375
why you must always start so early.

324
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,250
This is a surprise.

325
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:45,916
Grand Duke,

326
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,416
it's an honour.

327
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,500
I didn't want to miss supporting
my brother on this important weekend.

328
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:57,708
-I'm pleased to see you, Majesty.
-Good morning, Maschenka.

329
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:00,041
-Hello.
-There you finally are.

330
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,041
Gorgeous! Ah, the weather!

331
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,083
Can we start?

332
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,541
I'll take this one.

333
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:14,166
Maria was hoping
to take a walk with you, my dearest.

334
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,041
Leave the hunting to the men,
Your Majesty.

335
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:21,791
We ladies will go on our own outing.
It's a wonderful idea.

336
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:26,500
I'd like to get to know
the Grand Princess on my own,

337
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,458
if you have no objections.

338
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:38,250
You would've preferred
hunting with the men?

339
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,208
No. This is wonderful.

340
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,791
I wondered what your peculiarity would be.

341
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,208
My peculiarity?

342
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,666
The thing
that distinguishes you as Empress.

343
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,375
Does one need such a thing?

344
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:55,250
Marie Antoinette had those lovely dresses,
seven kilograms of fabric!

345
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:59,291
Katharina the Great
supposedly had over 20 lovers.

346
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,833
And do you know Maria,
the former Queen of France?

347
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,791
She did her own cooking at court
and invented her own pastries.

348
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,166
What's your peculiarity?

349
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,666
Is it not obvious?

350
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,125
I love animals.

351
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,416
I have four dozen horses,
dogs and two monkeys.

352
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,625
Even a donkey back home in Hessen.

353
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:22,208
Oh, and I also have
hospitals built and the like.

354
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,875
It gives people something to talk about.

355
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,791
And significance to us women.

356
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,125
Something people remember.

357
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:34,291
I hope I'll be remembered
for being a good empress,

358
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,500
and not for my hairstyle.

359
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,416
Certainly.

360
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:42,125
By the way,
you do indeed have gorgeous hair.

361
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,958
In Russia, we shoot bears.

362
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,416
Didn't you say
we'd at least see wild boars?

363
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Wrong season.

364
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:57,375
Sometimes, one must break the rules
to get what one wants, right?

365
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:02,833
I read about your plans
to abolish serfdom with great interest.

366
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:06,291
-Are you trying to flatter me?
-No. I think we have much in common.

367
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:09,125
I think you owe a great deal to Russia.

368
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,083
That too.

369
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,958
My father saved you during the revolution.

370
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,125
We're forever deeply indebted to him.

371
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,000
Not deeply enough, it seems.

372
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,750
You broke his heart.

373
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:22,208
But you're the one
determining the future, are you not?

374
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,416
My father is still on the throne.

375
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,958
As long as God wills it.

376
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:31,291
But pardon me for speaking so frankly.
People yearn for a new kind of ruler.

377
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,166
One who values peace over war.

378
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,208
Now you really are flattering me.

379
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:40,583
Withdraw your troops,
and I promise we won't attack you.

380
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:44,166
I like you.

381
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:49,791
Let us enjoy the hunt, my friend.
We'll talk about war and peace tonight.

382
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,708
Be careful, it's hot.

383
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,208
Good, yes, very good.

384
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:25,291
The future Tsarina is extraordinary,
is she not?

385
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:30,375
Alexander falls in love
with a new court lady every Wednesday

386
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,250
and ends things every weekend.

387
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,875
I think she takes it in stride.

388
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,500
Thank God.
I thought you couldn't stand me anymore.

389
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,583
Why would you think that?

390
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,708
You've avoided me since the wedding.

391
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,291
You know why.

392
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,416
Why are you here today, Highness?

393
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,583
Why are you here?

394
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,916
Shouldn't you be resting?

395
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,583
Don't you start with that too.

396
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,875
My family needs you
for one important thing,

397
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:03,208
but not foreign policy.

398
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:05,416
One thing is better than nothing at all.

399
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,083
Ouch.

400
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:12,916
Forgive me.
You simply bring out the worst in me.

401
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,375
As long as I bring out something in you.

402
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:30,416
You know I'm here for you
if you need anything.

403
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,708
What would I need?

404
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:52,291
It's going well with Alexander.
Hunting was a fabulous idea.

405
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,791
That was very nice, Countess.

406
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,125
Thank you.

407
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,000
We haven't met yet.

408
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,541
Leontine of Apafi, Your Imperial Highness.

409
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:04,500
Of Apafi. The Apafis, from Transylvania!

410
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,875
I know your parents.

411
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:09,458
Your father is Count Michael. Your mother…

412
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,708
-Agnes.
-Agnes.

413
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,791
Right.

414
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,875
You were your mother's pride and joy.

415
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,500
How is she? She must miss you terribly.

416
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,541
I write her regularly.

417
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,083
I recall you could
already speak French as a child.

418
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,750
Oh, of course, you speak French,
don't you, Leontine?

419
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,791
Hence my name.

420
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:36,541
You like literature, as I understand.
What do you think of Monsieur de Balzac?

421
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,041
I love this story.

422
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:42,833
His writing is so passionate.

423
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,916
Excuse me, please.

424
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,541
No!

425
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,875
Give us a little taste!

426
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,666
Why are you so shy?

427
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:54,666
Excuse me, Your Highness.

428
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,416
You are a riddle, Countess.

429
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,708
But don't you worry.

430
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,000
I will solve it.

431
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,125
Stay away from me, you whore.

432
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,000
Pardon me, Your Imperial Highness.

433
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,291
I have no secrets.

434
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,041
The young Empress truly is special.

435
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,083
-But I'm sure you already noticed that.
-Indeed.

436
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,416
Passionate. So impulsive.

437
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:56,958
Can the well-behaved Emperor handle that,
or does she need some variety?

438
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:05,083
Did he promise
peace and eternal friendship?

439
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,708
What's wrong with peace and friendship?

440
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,083
Be careful. That's all.

441
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,041
Are you stabbing him in the back?

442
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:21,458
Out with it.

443
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:26,750
If you, France, and the others
keep this war up for a long time,

444
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,833
tear each other to pieces
and bleed each other dry, who wins?

445
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:35,083
Who will grab a piece of the Ottoman pie

446
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,875
without dirtying his hands?

447
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,583
My father's lived outside for 15 years.

448
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:56,333
Prey sighted to the east!

449
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:59,208
Let's go out again.
I'm going to get myself a stag now.

450
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:03,375
Will you accompany me this time, Majesty?
I insist.

451
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,000
It is unusual
for a woman to enjoy hunting.

452
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,708
I always went
into the forest alone as a child.

453
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,250
Were you not afraid?

454
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,250
The darkness, the silence.

455
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,416
It always had a magical allure.

456
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,208
Are you sure you're not Russian?

457
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,916
Are you afraid to be alone with me?

458
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,083
As I said,
nothing in the forest scares me.

459
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,875
She could ride on it for hours on end…

460
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,291
while watching me smoke my pipe.

461
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,916
"Don't smoke so much, Father,"
she always said.

462
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,291
Do not speak of her.

463
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,208
It'd do you good to speak of her.

464
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,916
Elisabeth and our girl
would've liked each other.

465
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:39,458
No. Our girl was very different.
Not one bit like Elisabeth.

466
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,291
-Elisabeth is…
-Elisabeth is like you.

467
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,541
Are we lost?

468
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,250
Oh no.

469
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,166
It'll soon be dusk.

470
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,458
Do not fear. I'll protect you.

471
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,416
That won't be necessary.

472
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,958
Pardon, I didn't mean to offend you.

473
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:11,583
Do you know what your husband wants?
My blind trust.

474
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:12,916
But…

475
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,666
can I trust him blindly?

476
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,500
Help me, Empress.

477
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:22,541
He wants to protect our empire,
not expand it. I know that.

478
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:25,500
Then he'd be the first man
to not want that,

479
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,666
but I don't want to bore you.

480
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,208
Then why did you ask me?

481
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,833
Because you know your husband.

482
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,000
He is different.

483
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:33,416
No.

484
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,375
You with your smart little head,

485
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,416
you are different.

486
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:50,125
Perhaps the future
of this huge, cumbersome empire

487
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,958
does not lie with him or the Archduchess.

488
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,625
Perhaps Habsburg's future lies

489
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,250
in your bosom alone.

490
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:08,541
Or…

491
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,291
you really are what everyone says.

492
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,833
A simple girl from the country.

493
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,541
Just because I didn't grow up in a palace…

494
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,625
I knew it.

495
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:25,666
If you want a big prize,
you must take unbeaten paths.

496
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,708
My father taught me that.

497
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,291
Now you've made him angry.

498
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,125
What a shot!

499
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:11,666
To the day's sharpshooter,
Your Majesty, Empress Elisabeth.

500
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,375
To Elisabeth!

501
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,833
Is a wild boar really that dangerous?

502
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,166
Such a large boar can even kill a man.

503
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,291
So that means
the Empress saved the Tsar's son's life.

504
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,375
We're leaving. Pack everything.

505
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,583
We're leaving.

506
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:34,750
Already?

507
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:49,666
By the time he reloaded,
the boar would've torn you to pieces.

508
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,458
What were you to do? Not shoot?

509
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,958
I assume men made these rules, not us.

510
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,708
Is this how you do politics?

511
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,958
Give me a gun that misses?

512
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,916
Elisabeth only followed her instinct.

513
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,375
My instinct tells me
everything here stinks.

514
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:14,875
What are you hiding
behind that boyish face?

515
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:17,125
I was very candid with you, Alexander.

516
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,541
You know what my grandmother always said?

517
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:25,041
If it seems too good to be true,
it's probably bullshit.

518
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:28,250
All I want is for us
to pledge peace to one another.

519
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,416
Do you think
I'd go against my father's will?

520
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,333
I thought you saw this war differently.

521
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,708
Maybe I don't.

522
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:41,958
The occupied territories on our border,
what is happening there is unjust.

523
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,458
Oh, please.
What is happening in your empire?

524
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:50,583
You oppress Hungary, Venetia, Lombardy.

525
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,166
Fine.

526
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,875
-I demand you withdraw your troops.
-Or what?

527
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:59,958
Will you get your wife with a big gun?

528
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:01,958
At least, she would not miss.

529
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,875
You're a coward, Your Majesty.

530
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,541
I will defend my empire, Alexander,
with all that I have.

531
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:17,416
-Then we'll meet again on the battlefield.
-It looks that way.

532
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,208
We shall assemble the cabinet.

533
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,291
Tonight.

534
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,333
Do not worry.

535
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:34,958
What did Alexander say?

536
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:38,208
I'm going back now. You can come
in the morning with the court ladies.

537
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:41,083
-So he won't withdraw the troops?
-Don't worry about it.

538
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,666
Are you saying it was my fault?

539
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,875
You probably
should've exercised restraint. Yes.

540
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,833
Do you know
how he treated me in the woods?

541
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,916
But I imagine such things are allowed.

542
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,166
I'm going with my mother.

543
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,750
See you tomorrow.

544
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:17,916
Your Majesty.

545
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,625
I hope you now know what I meant.

546
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:28,125
You haven't the faintest idea
what you're doing.

547
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,625
It really was a good shot.

548
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:56,250
Are you sure you don't want to stay?

549
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,250
No, I want to go back.

550
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,041
Wait.

551
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,750
Will you accompany me?

552
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,166
You are not to blame, Elisabeth.

553
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,583
Franz sees things differently.
I disgraced him.

554
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,083
You did not.

555
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,625
I did, believe me. I know how it looks.

556
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,083
You did not buckle.

557
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,708
You did what you deemed right.

558
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,541
Why does it still feel so wrong then?

559
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:40,458
That's very simple.
Because our role is to applaud the others.

560
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:43,750
To look pretty.

561
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:50,041
We sink with the ship,
but no one wants to know what we think.

562
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,083
And what now?

563
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,000
-And this is meant to be the solution?
-No!

564
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,333
Oh, please.

565
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,375
There is no solution.

566
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,125
There's only here and now.

567
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:04,750
What is so urgent? We just arrived.

568
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:21,250
Why didn't you tell us
about the outing in the forest?

569
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,375
Far from the palace,

570
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,750
limited visibility, hardly any guards.

571
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,208
It was the chance
we've been waiting weeks for.

572
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:35,666
No. We needed more time to prepare.

573
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,500
Don't play me for a fool.

574
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,416
Why do you wish to draw this out?

575
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:47,416
Maybe there's another way.

576
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,000
The Emperor is a murderer.
He deserves to die.

577
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:52,666
Maybe we're wrong about him.

578
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,083
What is wrong with you?

579
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,166
This is a mistake, Egon.

580
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,166
You're not a countess, Ava.

581
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,583
Did you forget?

582
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,833
Where you're from?

583
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,916
You were born in the gutter,
and you'll end up back in it.

584
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,291
You act so clean and proper.

585
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,541
In your pretty clothes.

586
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:44,250
But we both know what you've done.

587
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:52,583
These people are going to die.

588
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:56,875
Decide which side you want to be on.

589
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:15,083
Stop!

590
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,333
Oops. Oops.

591
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:28,875
Oops.

592
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:43,041
Gentlemen.

593
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:44,791
It is late.

594
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:46,875
I shall retire.

595
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,166
I told you to come tomorrow.

596
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,333
I'm sorry
if I made a mistake with Alexander.

597
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:06,958
I mean it.

598
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,416
What is it? Tell me.

599
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:17,666
Why must you always run to him?

600
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:21,416
I don't trust him, and you know that.
I don't want that.

601
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,083
-Don't talk to me like a child.
-Then don't act like one!

602
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,500
Go to bed, all right?

603
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,125
You should get some rest.
