00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:10,333
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,500
Dear Father,

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,666
when I got married you said

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,333
I'd never be able to be myself
if I go to the Viennese court.

5
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,541
You were wrong.

6
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,333
I am completely and utterly myself.

7
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,833
I've met wonderful people.

8
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,000
Life here is intoxicating,
and I let myself float along.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,708
They don't need me for anything else.

10
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,708
My daughter,

11
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,041
yesterday I found a poem of yours.

12
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,541
"Swallow, lend me your wings

13
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,333
Take me with you to the faraway land

14
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,333
And when I soareth
Freely up there with you

15
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,791
In the ever-blue firmament

16
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,500
How I shall praise

17
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,125
The god from whom freedom was sent"

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,333
You wanted to give your life meaning.

19
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,750
Have you found it?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,958
Elisabeth?

21
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,375
Elisabeth?

22
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,250
-Is she breathing?
-Elisabeth?

23
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,625
-Pardon me.
-Good morning, Your Majesty.

24
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,583
Good morning.

25
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,000
Have you slept?

26
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,458
A bit.

27
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:09,791
No.

28
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,833
From your father.

29
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,250
Don't you want to read it?

30
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,166
Later.

31
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,333
Did you have fun last night?

32
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,250
The ladies and I were drinking.

33
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,416
-I would have liked to have known.
-Would you have come?

34
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,375
I know you've been unhappy
since the foundry incident.

35
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,208
I have a surprise for you.

36
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,625
The situation has changed.

37
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,791
The Habsburg troop deployment
is having an effect.

38
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,291
The Tsar is intimidated.

39
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,041
If the Russians retreat,
our chance will be gone.

40
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,541
The Tsar hasn't moved one bit yet.

41
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,875
Nothing but rumours.

42
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,333
-What is Rauscher's status?
-As good as convinced.

43
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,291
Just your mother now.

44
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,333
Don't give me that look.
She's my mother, not yours.

45
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,333
We're all risking our lives. You too.

46
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,791
I have nothing to lose.

47
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,291
Give us the sign, and our men will be
at the palace in half an hour.

48
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,333
You mean so my brother can be…

49
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,291
arrested?

50
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,208
Yes.

51
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,791
That's how it's usually done.

52
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,083
Is there a problem?

53
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:42,958
No.

54
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,875
I will inform you.

55
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,875
He is wild and restless.

56
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,958
He reminded me of you.

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,958
A horse walks into an inn.

58
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,916
The innkeeper says, "Why the long face?"

59
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,333
Do you think a bad horse joke
makes up for everything?

60
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,041
I hoped it would.

61
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,208
I want to see you tonight.

62
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,583
Just the two of us.

63
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,541
Is that all right?

64
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,250
How considerate of His Majesty.

65
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,250
You had wanted a new pursuit,
and just look,

66
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,375
he found something for you.

67
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,875
Yes, how nice.

68
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,333
Something else to keep you preoccupied.

69
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,541
If you will excuse me.

70
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,666
I must speak with you
about Countess Apafi, Majesty.

71
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,833
I have reason to suspect
we shouldn't trust her.

72
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,541
Her behaviour and her abilities

73
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,500
are not worthy
of Your Majesty and this court.

74
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,750
In my eyes, she is more than worthy.

75
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,833
No, Majesty.
I have gathered a range of evidence…

76
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,291
Spare me your slander, Countess.

77
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,750
I won't tolerate that.

78
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,791
Thank you.

79
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:38,625
Come after dusk.
The door to the east wing is not guarded.

80
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,958
A knife is buried there.

81
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,333
You could take care of it yourself.

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,208
I'm not a murderer.

83
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,208
Really?

84
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,250
What are you then?

85
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,708
I had my doubts, but that's over now.

86
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,875
They are like all the rest.
They don't want change.

87
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,625
They have to go.

88
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,583
So the Empress can die too?

89
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:13,916
Yes, of course.

90
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,291
Good.

91
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,625
Then I will take care of her too.

92
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,958
-For the people.
-For the people.

93
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,416
Have you seen this?
There are more and more.

94
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,375
What do you want, Bach?

95
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,166
What are you thinking?

96
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,250
It is a matter for the palace guard.

97
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,750
Yes, of course.

98
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,625
I wanted to ask if your connection
to the future Baroness von Sina

99
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,333
provides hope for another loan?

100
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,208
Yes, but she wants something in return.

101
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,375
-May I ask what it is?
-Would you please leave me alone?

102
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,541
I urge you to consider
the importance of a railway--

103
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,500
I know.

104
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,208
Thank you.

105
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,208
Do you know what's going on out there?

106
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,375
This cannot happen.

107
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:49,083
-Nothing has happened yet.
-It's been happening the whole time.

108
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,166
-Do you know why?
-I'm sure you'll tell me.

109
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,625
You are unfocused, Franz.
She distracts you.

110
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,875
The arguments, the madness at the foundry.

111
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,500
This is not her fault.

112
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,166
The whole court is talking
because she parties all night.

113
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,833
You married a defiant child,
and that weakens you as Emperor.

114
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,416
The people need a role model.

115
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,125
Something must change, Franz,
and you know it.

116
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,791
If you don't take care of it, I will.

117
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:38,666
Your Majesty, I cannot let you pass.
On the Archduchess's order.

118
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,541
Stop!

119
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,541
-Out of the way.
-You may not pass.

120
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,208
I am the Empress!

121
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,458
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

122
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:22,000
Your Majesty, please.
The Archduchess wishes to speak to you.

123
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,833
She awaits you in the church.

124
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,333
Hungary, Transylvania…

125
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,750
Apafi.

126
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,291
Bethlen family, resident in…

127
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,291
Vienna.

128
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,125
The Apafi's have relatives in the city.
This is the cousin.

129
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,250
Ask for all correspondence
with Countess Leontine von Apafi.

130
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,583
And for a photograph
as quickly as possible.

131
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,083
Very well.

132
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,375
Countess.

133
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,458
You wished to speak to me?

134
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,375
Sit down.

135
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,708
What do you think is
the most important quality for a ruler?

136
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,291
Compassion.

137
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,083
I know you see it differently.

138
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,166
Let me tell you a story, Elisabeth.

139
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,791
It started
when my daughter, Anna, was three.

140
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,958
She shivered and shook.

141
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,416
And then it was
like her little body turned to stone.

142
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,208
No one knew what it was.

143
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,375
The archbishop said
a demon had possessed her, but…

144
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,083
At first, it happened every few weeks,
then ever more frequently.

145
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,916
The doctors said
it was a rare nerve disease.

146
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,333
They bled her.
Do you know what that means?

147
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,625
They drew blood from her little arm.

148
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:50,291
They shaved off her hair
and put leeches on her head,

149
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,041
so they could suck the illness out of her.

150
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,375
And Anna screamed.

151
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,916
And screamed.

152
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,958
"We have to do it," they said.
"Just a few more hours."

153
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,666
But I couldn't stand it any longer.

154
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,333
I sent them away.

155
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,500
And I held her.

156
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,250
I don't know
how many times the sun came up.

157
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,458
I don't know
where her body stopped and mine started.

158
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,583
Four days later, she was dead.

159
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,500
I am so sorry.

160
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,958
It often doesn't help
to hold someone's hand.

161
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,125
Do you understand?

162
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,958
To be indulgent, to feel compassion.

163
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,000
Sometimes you have to cut out the tumour,
even if it hurts.

164
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,875
I must do everything
to ensure this family survives.

165
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,500
What do you need to cut out?

166
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,250
I wanted Franz to have a woman
who supported him.

167
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,291
You wanted a puppet.

168
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,875
I want an empress
who wears our crown with pride.

169
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,500
Who puts the well-being
of this family above all else.

170
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,708
Kingdoms are collapsing around us.

171
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,208
We need an empress
who will save us from ruin.

172
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,041
An empress who outshines the times.

173
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,333
That's not you, Elisabeth.

174
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,375
You have two options.

175
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,208
Go back to Bavaria.
We'll say you've fallen gravely ill.

176
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,791
We'll annul the marriage,
and Franz remarries.

177
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,750
No.

178
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,291
-And you are free.
-No.

179
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,416
No?

180
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,666
Or you can stay here.

181
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,458
But new rules will apply.

182
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,875
No riding,

183
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,416
no evening jaunts,

184
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,708
no court ladies.

185
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:20,625
You get a room in the north wing.
Your only company is Countess Esterhazy.

186
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,791
And the Emperor may come visit you
on appointed days.

187
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,125
Franz won't permit that.

188
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,583
He already knows about it.

189
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,625
Think about it, dear.

190
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,083
-Your Imperial Highness.
-Your Imperial Highness.

191
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,458
She has until this evening to decide.

192
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,666
May I say how much I admire
your clarity in dealing with the Empress?

193
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,708
She will no longer cause turmoil here,
this way or that.

194
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,500
You failed, Countess.

195
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,750
-I…
-The people outside at the gate…

196
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,375
Did you see them?

197
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,750
And we're staring down
the Russians at the border.

198
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,291
How much time do I have

199
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,291
to take care of a girl
who howls at the moon at night?

200
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,625
Who behaves like a lunatic?

201
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,500
But, Imperial Highness…

202
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,916
You have lost your bite.

203
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,625
You need a new task.

204
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,250
Something more manageable.

205
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:53,458
Should the Empress decide to stay here,
you will keep her company.

206
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,541
That will be your only task.
Just the two of you.

207
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,166
And at my side…

208
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,416
Margarete will take your place.

209
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,541
Should the Empress
decide to return to Bavaria,

210
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,166
you shall accompany her.

211
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,125
Some time off.

212
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,250
Don't send me away.

213
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,416
Not to Bavaria.

214
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,416
I will put everything right.

215
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,375
Please.

216
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,166
Please.

217
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:36,708
Please!

218
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,583
Don't make a fool of yourself.

219
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,833
Leave now.

220
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,583
Both of you.

221
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,291
I have to hand it to you, Maman.

222
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,458
You know how to encourage the underlings.

223
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,416
I wonder
what those people hope to achieve.

224
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,208
Nothing will come of this.

225
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,291
They want to be seen.

226
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,416
I have a headache.
Bring me a glass of water.

227
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,583
What game are you playing?

228
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,750
A what? A game?

229
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,500
Don't waste my time.

230
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,583
We all have our games. So…

231
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,666
What is yours?

232
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,916
Franz hasn't become
the emperor you wished for.

233
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,500
I feel sorry for my brother.

234
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,500
Sorry?

235
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,500
How can I explain it?

236
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,875
When you see someone who is unwell,

237
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,958
and then you yourself feel unwell.

238
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,125
Forget it.

239
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,916
Will you get to the point today?

240
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,500
The next years are
about preserving our empire.

241
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,083
Or else it will crumble.
You know that as well as I do.

242
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,083
Napoleon and Queen Victoria
are laughing at us.

243
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,291
and the Prussians are chomping at the bit.

244
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,125
-You know the people like me.
-Popularity is overrated.

245
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,208
Not when you're the only one who is liked.

246
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,000
I have excellent connections
throughout Europe.

247
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,875
-And the support of the--
-The support to do what, Maximilian?

248
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,708
That is high treason. Punishable by death.

249
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,750
-I have to try.
-God alone chooses the emperor.

250
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,291
You chose the last one.

251
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,458
You've shown me
what it means to protect this family.

252
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,583
At all costs.

253
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,291
Majesty.

254
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,750
His Majesty is not here.

255
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,041
Where is he, Theo? I must speak to him.

256
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,250
I'm sorry, Majesty.

257
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,958
But it's really important. I need him.

258
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,416
Majesty, I'm sorry.
It just isn't possible now.

259
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,041
Are you unwell?

260
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,333
-It's not a good time.
-What happened?

261
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,875
Trust me.

262
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,333
Please.

263
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,333
She wants me gone.

264
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,083
Who?

265
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,166
Your mother.

266
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:18,958
No.

267
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,916
I won't allow it.

268
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,416
I couldn't find Franz.
Do you know where he is?

269
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,750
What did you want to tell me?

270
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,625
A lot will change here soon.

271
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:44,458
Very soon.

272
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,166
No matter what happens,

273
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,083
I want you…

274
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,083
I want you by my side.

275
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,833
What is going to happen?

276
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,333
I can't talk about that yet.

277
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,291
I know how much he loves you.

278
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,916
But when you really need him,

279
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,125
then he's not there.

280
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,583
He needs you to feel alive.

281
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:23,333
But for that, a part of you must die.
Is that just?

282
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,666
Elisabeth…

283
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,000
You and I…

284
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,291
It was meant to be.

285
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:05,666
Get out.

286
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:07,500
Go!

287
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,333
Your Majesty, did you call?

288
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,250
Where is Leontine?

289
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,750
Countess Apafi.

290
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,125
Your Majesty,
your brother wishes to speak to you.

291
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,208
Your Majesty.

292
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,625
I was wondering where you were off to.

293
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:02,250
You won't like what I have to tell you.

294
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,375
Some groups have lost faith
in you as an emperor.

295
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,666
The people want a change.

296
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,750
What are you getting at?

297
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,208
Have you looked out the window?

298
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,958
You've lost control.

299
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,125
You want to rule?

300
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,000
You?

301
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,083
Are you serious?

302
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,666
We can have a peaceful transfer of power.

303
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,166
There needn't be a scandal.

304
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,708
Your choice.

305
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:53,458
You don't know
what being in charge is like.

306
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,375
When every decision is yours.

307
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:58,916
The task is yours alone.
Forever. You can't just leave.

308
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,833
I know that.

309
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,250
You know nothing!

310
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,833
You live in a fantasy world, Maximilian.

311
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:09,916
You always have.

312
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,000
You told me about the palace elves
who watch over us.

313
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:17,666
They don't exist.

314
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,083
Nor does your imaginary empire.

315
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,250
Why don't you just enjoy your life?

316
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,458
Why don't you?

317
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,916
Because this is my duty!

318
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,958
You have no more support, Franz.

319
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:41,083
I have the Church on my side.
And the army.

320
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,041
They don't matter.

321
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,125
And your wife?

322
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,291
Does she matter?

323
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,208
She has indicated that she supports me.

324
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,625
She never said that.

325
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:13,750
You're right.

326
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,083
We've barely spoken to each other.

327
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,416
You saw in Ischl that we belong together.

328
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,625
That's why you took her from me.

329
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,791
Get out.

330
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,833
Or I'll have you hanged on the spot.

331
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,375
That will change nothing.

332
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,250
Your time is over.

333
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:13,416
Elisabeth?

334
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,041
Better?

335
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,750
Have you had breakfast?

336
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,000
I haven't kept it down for days.

337
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,291
Your last period didn't come.

338
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,708
Is there another sign? I mean…

339
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,666
how can one be certain?

340
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,083
Take your blouse off.

341
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:14,750
Please.

342
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:27,250
I'm going to touch you.

343
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:29,458
May I?

344
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,875
It is taut.

345
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,875
You're expecting a child. I'm sure.

346
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,125
Are you pleased?

347
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,791
-Is this everything?
-I have this too.

348
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,166
A family party,
but the Countess Apafi was not there.

349
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,083
What am I paying you for then?

350
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,916
A nursemaid.

351
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:52,166
Countess Salm-Reifferscheidt.
What can I do for you?

352
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:57,083
Where is Countess Esterhazy?
I urgently need to speak with her.

353
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:58,791
Have you not heard?

354
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,250
The Countess was given a new task.

355
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,708
But I am all ears.

356
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:10,083
No. I will speak
to the Archduchess personally.

357
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:11,958
Thank you.

358
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,916
What do you have there? Who's that?

359
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:20,166
Is this about Countess Apafi?
Did you find something?

360
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,083
Not a word to anyone.

361
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:38,916
Franz?

362
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,166
Make sure my brother
does not leave the castle.

363
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,083
And find out where Kempen is.
I must speak to him.

364
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:03,458
-I want to tell you something.
-Don't I give you everything you dream of?

365
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,833
-I don't know what you mean.
-Answer me.

366
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,833
You're scaring me.

367
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:20,583
You know none of that
means anything to me.

368
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:23,458
-Gifts.
-Says someone who is very spoiled.

369
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,708
You all think you can scheme
behind my back and I won't notice?

370
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:33,291
-What are you talking about?
-You'll never see my brother again.

371
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,416
So you admit it.

372
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,166
No.

373
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,125
There is nothing between him and me.

374
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,458
What does that mean?

375
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,208
I only love you.

376
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,625
Don't give me that look.
I'm defenseless against it.

377
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,958
Why can't that be enough?

378
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,375
Your mother wants me to go.

379
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,583
What did she say?

380
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,375
That I confuse you.

381
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,083
That something must change.

382
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:40,958
She's right about that.

383
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:43,875
What do you mean?

384
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:47,375
-Did you know?
-No, but it can't go on like this.

385
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:50,833
What can't?

386
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:56,916
Me sitting around all day drinking tea,
trying on clothes,

387
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,708
keeping my mouth shut, having a child,

388
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,375
and turning my brain off?

389
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,666
You wandering around at night,

390
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,750
putting yourself in danger,
behaving as if you've lost your mind,

391
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,333
not following the rules.

392
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,416
That is precisely why you wanted me.

393
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:18,375
I want more, Franz. I can't be locked up.

394
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,083
I need someone
who can be content sometimes.

395
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:29,208
-Then you should've chosen Helene.
-Yes, maybe.

396
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,833
You're a coward.

397
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,500
Tell your mother I'm leaving.
I'm returning to Bavaria.

398
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,083
If you do, you can never come back.

399
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,250
I'd rather be the madwoman in Possenhofen
than spend another day here as Empress.

400
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,041
Attention!

401
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,458
We just counted about 300 people
at the main gate alone.

402
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,375
Others are surrounding the castle.

403
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,875
What do you plan to do about it?

404
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:32,333
We've locked all the gates
and increased the number of guards.

405
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,375
-No one will get in.
-That is all?

406
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:39,416
I want you to post
100 armed men at the gate.

407
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,750
And have the palace guard ready.

408
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:46,333
They're mostly from poorer quarters.
Surely, they're unarmed.

409
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:50,500
And if someone twitches, arrest them.
If they do more than twitch, shoot.

410
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:54,250
-But they're peaceful!
-Is he contradicting me?

411
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,083
Your Majesty.

412
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,666
Von Bach, this doesn't concern you. Go.

413
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,625
What are you waiting for?

414
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,625
Elisabeth is going away for a while.

415
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,208
That is very sensible.

416
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,791
I know it pleases you, Mother.

417
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,333
No, Franz. It doesn't please me.

418
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:31,791
It was a beautiful dream,
but every dreamer wakes up eventually.

419
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:42,625
Can you see to it
that little Luzi gets this dress?

420
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,583
You shouldn't go.

421
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:46,916
Talk to him.

422
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,541
I can tell him to meet you.

423
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,333
And you take this.

424
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,125
-No.
-Yes.

425
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,791
Does he know you're pregnant?

426
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,250
You must tell him.

427
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,541
No, it's over.

428
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,333
Do you remember our first day?

429
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,291
You said it was
a symbol of human fragility.

430
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:34,791
And you were right.

431
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,375
This court has broken me.

432
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:41,000
This court is a game. Don't you see that?

433
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,708
I never liked following rules.

434
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,750
Sometimes you have to follow
the rules to win.

435
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:51,666
I didn't come here to win anything.

436
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,458
There's nothing left for me here.

437
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:58,125
I'll write you.

438
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,750
What are you doing?

439
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,750
It's not about you, Elisabeth.

440
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,750
People burn these as a cry for help.

441
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,083
If you want to help them, you must stay.

442
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,791
Countess Apafi.

443
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,208
Countess, what can I do for you?

444
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,583
It's about the Emperor.

445
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,708
Your Imperial Highness.

446
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,958
I just received a message
from St. Petersburg.

447
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,666
The Tsar ordered his troops to withdraw.

448
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:21,375
It will be seen as a great success.
Your brother's plan worked.

449
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,208
But no one knows that yet.

450
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,250
Does he know?

451
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:32,291
Keep this to yourself.

452
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,791
Not possible. The opportunity has passed.

453
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:38,083
No! I will speak to my mother.
Give me an hour.

454
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,083
-No. It's over.
-It's over when I say it is!

455
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,916
You've not looked this relaxed in so long,
Your Imperial Highness.

456
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,916
If I may say so.

457
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,791
I thank you for your trust in me.

458
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,041
I will not disappoint you.

459
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,208
I know.

460
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,250
The Archduke Maximilian.

461
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,958
Pardon me.
I must urgently speak with you again.

462
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:21,500
Do you know what he wants?

463
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,708
He thinks he can be Emperor.

464
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,041
But he is as ill-suited for it
as the rest of you.

465
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,916
Why do you say such a thing?

466
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:38,958
My entire life, I've stood by weak men.
And you, Maximilian, are one of them.

467
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:44,208
None of my sons are fit for the throne.
Not one. Not you either.

468
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,208
Do you think I'll let one of you
destroy what I've created?

469
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:54,000
Not you, not your father,
not your brother,

470
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,916
and certainly not that girl.

471
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,750
That reminds me,
I wanted to bid her farewell.

472
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:46,833
Elisabeth.

473
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,250
The ability to recognize one's own limits
is very important in life.

474
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,166
Believe me.

475
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,916
I wish you a pleasant journey.

476
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:17,625
Majesty.

477
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,833
I will not permit myself
to question my Emperor's decisions.

478
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,083
The Empress is going to the carriage.

479
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,291
Your Majesty?

480
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,291
Stop!

481
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,708
Drop the knife!

482
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,833
For the people!

483
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:12,416
Go back!

484
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,750
He must stop.

485
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,916
Your Majesty,
I must ask you to turn around.

486
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,041
No one is leaving tonight.

487
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:26,500
Turn the carriage around.
Take Her Majesty back to the palace.

488
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:32,208
Your Majesty, they're blocking the gate.
It is too dangerous.

489
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,500
I must ask you to get back in.

490
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,541
Open the gate.

491
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:36,500
Certainly not.

492
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,000
Open the gate! Right now!

493
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,375
I must get out of here!

494
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,000
We are hungry!

495
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,333
Look at us!

496
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,208
Your Majesty, what are you doing?
I must warn you.

497
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,625
You betrayed him.

498
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,125
No one knows about you.

499
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,125
You can go. I won't betray you.

500
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,083
You can never go back to Vienna.
We'll see to it.

501
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:32,833
One step outside and we'll kill you.

502
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:36,666
And I hear
your days are also numbered here.

503
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,041
There you are.

504
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:48,291
-Did you know the Empress is gone?
-I know.

505
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:51,208
Because of the unrest?
Or a fight with the Emperor?

506
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:54,625
-What will happen to us?
-Can you shut up for once?

507
00:48:55,625 --> 00:49:00,166
Are other people's lives that interesting,
or do you have no thoughts of your own?

508
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:10,208
Then I won't tell you

509
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:13,625
about the photographs of you
Amalia was carrying around the palace.

510
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,500
The Empress is at the gate.

511
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,500
-Here!
-We need reinforcements. Go!

512
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,541
-Go!
-Faster! Faster!

513
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:47,291
You have my dress.
None of it belongs to you.

514
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:50,125
What did you do with the real Apafi?

515
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:52,916
Please, Amalia.

516
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,500
Think this through.

517
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:58,000
Why should I? You've wanted
to get the better of me the whole time.

518
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,208
Are you jealous?

519
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:04,166
I am here to protect
the Empress and this court.

520
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,666
This is sacred to me!

521
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:09,583
I've worked hard
my entire life to fulfil this duty.

522
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,750
And you want to destroy it all!

523
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:15,375
You are scum.

524
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,166
What are you up to?

525
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,458
Open it.

526
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,416
I see you.

527
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,083
Imperial Highness.

528
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,083
If you would follow me.

529
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:20,416
What is she doing? What's going on?

530
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,833
Your Imperial Highness.

531
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:25,125
She told the people
she is expecting a child.

532
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,083
Did she now?

533
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,541
That is wonderful news.

534
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:43,708
Open the gate.
