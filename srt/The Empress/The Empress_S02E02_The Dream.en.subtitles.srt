1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,208
Elisabeth.

2
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,708
Elisabeth, do you hear me?

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,833
It will all be okay.

4
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,083
It's just the fever.

5
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,125
Empress.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,125
Empress. Follow me.

7
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,958
Elisabeth. Come back to me.

8
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,083
Empress.

9
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,208
Follow me.

10
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,541
Come back to me. Please.

11
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:21,875
Please.

12
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,916
THE EMPRESS

13
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,291
Your Majesty,

14
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,291
Imperial Highness, Your Eminence.

15
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,041
How is she doing?

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,791
The bleeding has subsided. That's good.

17
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,500
But the infection is still raging,
hence the high fever.

18
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,666
When will she awaken from this state?

19
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,333
All we can do is wait
for the fever to drop.

20
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,875
That won't suffice. Help her!

21
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,500
Excuse me, Doctor.

22
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,750
Your Majesty,
you should also get some sleep.

23
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,083
Dr Fritsch, I have a question.

24
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,875
Will the Empress be able
to birth another child?

25
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,208
The Empress will want to know
as soon as she awakens.

26
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,916
Another pregnancy

27
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,125
could be life-threatening.

28
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,708
Don't worry. Her Majesty's fate lies
in God's hands, Your Imperial Highness.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,666
Sorry, I'm a scientist,
and I stick to facts.

30
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,250
Where science reaches its limits,
the Lord takes over.

31
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,083
Then let me put it more clearly.

32
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,333
I advise against further pregnancies.

33
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,208
We should seek a second opinion,
Imperial Highness.

34
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,416
That's enough!

35
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,666
I want her to live.

36
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,916
That's all I care about.

37
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,791
You can leave.

38
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:17,458
Your Majesty, they're asking
if you want to see the newborn Princess.

39
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,541
It's been nearly a week since the birth.

40
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,416
No.

41
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:31,083
Since the incident
at the imperial reception,

42
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,541
we conducted investigations
in Lombardy-Venetia.

43
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,708
Clearly many months too late.

44
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,750
And, indeed,

45
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,166
a new revolutionary movement
has formed in the region.

46
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,708
We already boosted our military presence.

47
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,125
All rebellious machinations
will be nipped in the bud.

48
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:52,750
If the revolution comes again,
we shouldn't repeat the same mistakes.

49
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,041
Any other ideas?

50
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,333
Besides military force.

51
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,458
Your Majesty,
the Lombards are very devout.

52
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,791
A clear word from Pope Pius in Rome

53
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,083
will bring the people
of the region back to us.

54
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,333
And what is Habsburg
meant to do for Rome in return?

55
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,000
Pope Pius wants Austria to have

56
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,208
a stronger bond
between the Church and the state.

57
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,458
A papal state?

58
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,000
Your Majesty, no.
I don't think it's a good idea…

59
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,291
Interestingly enough,
no one is asking you.

60
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,333
-Anything domestic concerns me directly.
-Is that so?

61
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,000
Here I was thinking
our Emperor has absolute power.

62
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,416
Lombardy is only the beginning.

63
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,833
Other ethnic groups
will follow their example.

64
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,291
We have to try everything
to reach the people.

65
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,791
Write a draft, Cardinal.

66
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,666
I'll look at it.

67
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,166
Your Majesty.

68
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,458
Your Majesty,

69
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,875
there is a lot of evidence
that the Kingdom of Piedmont

70
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:05,541
is supporting, even encouraging,
the Lombards' efforts for independence.

71
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,000
An alliance with France
remains our priority.

72
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,500
Piedmont is inferior to us in every way.

73
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,250
We really don't need
Napoleon's help to keep them in check…

74
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,416
We don't need him as a war ally.

75
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,541
I want to ensure long-term peace
in Europe with Napoleon.

76
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,125
In the meantime,
do we know who will travel to Paris?

77
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,208
He won't have me hanged, will he?

78
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,125
Not after all this time.

79
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,541
That would be silly.

80
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,000
What do you think?

81
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,083
Your Imperial Highness.

82
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,625
Maximilian.

83
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,166
Luzi.

84
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,000
Let me look at you.

85
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,333
How handsome you are.

86
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,125
-Bursting with life.
-Unlike you.

87
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,875
What is this?

88
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,375
Are there no barbers in Trieste?

89
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,458
Mother.

90
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,250
Careful. Or I might get
the impression that you missed me.

91
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,416
Don't be silly.

92
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,291
Are you serious?

93
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,000
The last few days
were hard enough on your brother.

94
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,791
But every healthy child
is reason to rejoice.

95
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,291
Mother thinks Franz is so sad
because of Elisabeth.

96
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,500
Why? What happened to her?

97
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,125
A difficult birth.
She's not out of the woods yet.

98
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,333
Go on now. He's waiting for you.

99
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,833
Your Majesty, the Archduke.

100
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,291
Your Majesty.

101
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:32,916
Maximilian.

102
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Congratulations on your second daughter.

103
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,583
Thank you.

104
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,250
Your Majesty.
I've waited so long for this moment…

105
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,125
I called you here
to do a service to the family.

106
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,208
After all I've done, you still want more?

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,958
Forgive me.

108
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,541
Is this the right time to joke?

109
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,333
I joke when I'm scared.

110
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,166
There's a new independence movement
in our empire.

111
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,916
In Lombardy-Venetia.

112
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,458
With outside support
from the Kingdom of Piedmont.

113
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,750
I'm sure your advisors know what to do.

114
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,625
Military pressure is
their means of choice, I believe.

115
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,625
What would you do?

116
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,916
You want my opinion?

117
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,041
We…

118
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,208
You need allies in Europe, Your Majesty.
To stabilise the entire region.

119
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,708
We are isolated in Europe.

120
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,125
We have no allies.

121
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,250
Even the Prussians have grown unruly,
I know.

122
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,291
Well?

123
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:56,750
Napoleon.

124
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,875
I'd say you need Napoleon.

125
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,541
However, I wouldn't get my hopes up
very much. The French have never liked us.

126
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,625
They always liked you.

127
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:17,250
-You want me to speak to Napoleon?
-And put in a good word for us.

128
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,583
For a change.

129
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,041
Napoleon and Eugénie just had a son.

130
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,750
Tell them congratulations for me
and offer them a customs union.

131
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,916
A customs union?

132
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,625
As a starting point.

133
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,541
I won't beg for an alliance.

134
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,000
-I'm sorry to hear Elisabeth…
-Do not speak of her.

135
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,083
-I just wanted…
-Never again.

136
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,041
How is this supposed to work,
us starting over?

137
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,541
I'm asking for a favour
in the name of the Crown. That's it.

138
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,583
-Then you must trust me again.
-I don't have to do anything.

139
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,125
You depart in two hours. Send me
a telegram once you've spoken to Napoleon.

140
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,375
Why are you sending me?

141
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,541
If I can't be trusted?

142
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,333
Prove me otherwise.

143
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,375
Your Majesty.

144
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,333
Please, leave us alone.

145
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,083
I'll just rest for a moment.

146
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:13,791
Empress.

147
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,375
Empress.

148
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,541
Empress.

149
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,750
Empress!

150
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,000
Elisabeth.

151
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,208
It's me.

152
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,416
Everything's fine.

153
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,750
Everything's fine. It's me.

154
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,083
Where's my child?

155
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,750
Is it all right?

156
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,750
Yes.

157
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,916
It's a healthy girl.

158
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,125
Can I see her?

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,166
Yes.

160
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,333
I thought I'd lose you.

161
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,416
I'm so happy.

162
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,583
Imperial Highness.

163
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,416
Look at that, Ivan.

164
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:53,666
Yesterday on the rubbish heap in exile,
today on our way to see Napoleon.

165
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,416
Isn't life full of miracles?

166
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,458
If we stop in every hamlet,
Napoleon's son will have hair on his balls

167
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,916
by the time we reach Paris.

168
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,541
Another train has broken down,
Your Highness.

169
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,125
That very train was carrying
a high-born person

170
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,791
who has enquired
whether she can travel to Paris with you.

171
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,208
She?

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,125
So who is this person?

173
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:35,083
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Marie Charlotte of Belgium.

174
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,625
His Imperial Highness,
Archduke Maximilian of Austria.

175
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,875
Your Royal Highness, it is my pleasure.

176
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,791
May I introduce my court ladies?

177
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,250
Duchess von Bransner
and Countess von Metternich-Zichy.

178
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,333
-Your Imperial Highness.
-Your Imperial Highness.

179
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,250
I hear your journey has not gone
as planned. I'm sorry about that.

180
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,291
Don't be. It was wonderful.
A three-hour delay in Innsbruck,

181
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,000
then another interruption
due to lambs on the tracks.

182
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,458
-Oh, no.
-Then a defective switch near Kufstein.

183
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,333
Didn't your brother just upgrade
the railway network?

184
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,541
I was for investing in hot air balloons,
but no one listens to me.

185
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,791
Is there anything I can do
to lift your spirits?

186
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,125
I am in fantastic spirits, Your Highness.

187
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,166
Please, sit down.

188
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,666
Ivan.

189
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,916
Ladies, please take a seat.

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,750
What can I bring you?

191
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,875
What brings you to Paris? If I may ask.

192
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,583
-You may ask anything.
-Your Highness?

193
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,500
-A hot cup of tea, please. Thank you.
-With pleasure.

194
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,291
A private matter.

195
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,791
Private matters are my favourite.

196
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,625
Everyone knows that.

197
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,958
She has so much hair. Have you seen?

198
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,041
I can't believe
that we made it through that.

199
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,458
She's a miracle.

200
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,708
Do you want to hold her?

201
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,166
The Princess must drink.

202
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,166
Can't I do that myself?

203
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,875
Your Majesty, you were unconscious
for a very long time. You have no milk.

204
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,416
Your Majesty?

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,666
You'll be back on your feet soon.

206
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,500
Promise me that you'll rest, okay?

207
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,125
Yes.

208
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,541
What's her name?

209
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,791
Did you give her a name?

210
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,666
Not yet.

211
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,958
I'm so happy you're doing better.

212
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,833
BIRTH OF SECOND DAUGHTER ANNOUNCED

213
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,583
Before you ask, yes.

214
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,000
She is as beautiful as everyone says.

215
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,416
-I didn't want to know that.
-Everyone wants to know.

216
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,250
I'd be more interested to know if she has
any influence on the Emperor's actions.

217
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,416
Or is she just pretty?

218
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,000
It's not that simple.

219
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,500
What's not simple about it?
Does she have any say at court in Vienna?

220
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:22,125
She is full of life, and full of ideas.
My brother admires her very much, but…

221
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,208
But he's just a man
who won't let anyone tell him what to do.

222
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,333
Sometimes, the time
isn't ripe for new ideas.

223
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,875
For women who have a mind of their own,
you mean?

224
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,958
You should meet my mother someday.

225
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,916
We met an hour ago, and you already want
to introduce me to your mother?

226
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,625
At that rate, it's no wonder you
get through women so quickly.

227
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,833
I didn't introduce them to my mother.

228
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,083
You are highly amusing.

229
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,125
But you never laugh.

230
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,750
It's congenital.

231
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,958
The doctors say
a different climate may help.

232
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,958
Champagne, Imperial Highness.

233
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,166
To the Emperor, the Empress,
and their newborn daughter.

234
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,875
To women with minds of their own.

235
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,291
Open your mouth.

236
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,375
That's the spirit.

237
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,791
Bone broth is a miracle cure.

238
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,833
It cured my mother
and my auntie of the Spanish flu.

239
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,833
And they were as good as gone.

240
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,000
I'd like to see Leontine.

241
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,291
Can you get her?

242
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,875
I asked her to find something out for me.

243
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,375
I already tried,

244
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,083
but she's nowhere to be found.

245
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,416
Open up.

246
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,166
-Thanks. I'll do it myself.
-No way.

247
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,833
I will not leave your side
until you're better.

248
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,375
We finally have some real time together.

249
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,166
The Archduchess, Your Majesty.

250
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,750
Your Imperial Highness.

251
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,416
Elisabeth.

252
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,916
What a relief.

253
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,833
You look much better.

254
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,916
Don't be sad.

255
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,500
It will work out next time.

256
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,625
Next time?

257
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,458
You'll have an heir.

258
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,958
Don't listen to what the doctor said.

259
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,666
The doctor hasn't been here.

260
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:18,666
Dr Fritsch is concerned
another pregnancy may endanger your life.

261
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,583
What a good memory you have. Wonderful.

262
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,416
Leave us alone, please.

263
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,458
Don't listen to that chatter.

264
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,958
You're young.

265
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,458
You will recover swiftly.

266
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,291
I don't think I can do it again.

267
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,458
I was pregnant ten times.

268
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,833
I lost four children.

269
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,166
I bore six, one of them dead.

270
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,458
We women can endure
much more than men think.

271
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,208
But I don't think I want to do it again.

272
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,291
We need an heir to the throne, Elisabeth.

273
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,000
And then a second boy
in case the first doesn't make it.

274
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,291
That's how it has been for centuries.

275
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,458
And you are not going to change that.

276
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,333
I forgive your silliness
because you've been through a lot.

277
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,416
Get some rest.

278
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,583
How is the Empress?

279
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:41,625
Only just risen from the dead
and more insufferable than ever before.

280
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,458
She needs absolute peace.
She must stay in bed.

281
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,833
Make an announcement.

282
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,750
No walks, no visits.

283
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:52,375
And the children
will be looked after by the nannies alone.

284
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,291
-Doctor's orders.
-Understood, Your Imperial Highness.

285
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,708
But the children…
Is that meant as punishment?

286
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,708
On the contrary.

287
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,041
I simply want her to recover.

288
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,750
And besides,
the more she longs for her children,

289
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,750
the more she'll want another one soon.

290
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,291
Of course.

291
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,458
And get me a new doctor.

292
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,708
Yes, Your Imperial Highness.

293
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,458
Elisabeth.

294
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,250
What are you doing here?

295
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,583
You should stay in bed.

296
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,458
Here, sit down.

297
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,500
Did something happen?

298
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,083
Your mother paid me a visit.

299
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,333
Do you also want me to have
another child as soon as possible?

300
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,375
Franz?

301
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,000
I only want you to get better.

302
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,666
That's not an answer.

303
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,416
Tell me what you think.

304
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,250
We need a boy.

305
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,250
You know that.

306
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,041
Today? Or is next week okay?

307
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,333
I know girls have
less worth in this family.

308
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,625
-I just didn't know you think that way.
-I don't.

309
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:12,041
You barely even looked at her properly,
Franz. You didn't even give her a name…

310
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,083
I was worried about you, Elisabeth.

311
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,291
I also have to govern an empire.
It's about our position in Europe.

312
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,041
Napoleon has secured an heir.

313
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,250
Oh. If we're doing it for Napoleon,
then that's a different story.

314
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,666
I didn't mean it that way.

315
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,375
-I'm sorry.
-I understand you, Franz.

316
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,208
It's just…

317
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,166
There are other things I want to do.

318
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,125
For our empire.

319
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,333
Not just bear children.

320
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,041
-That time will come.
-No, now.

321
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,958
I dreamt about the young man,

322
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,500
the one we shot.

323
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,041
Over and over again.

324
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,041
I can't explain it.

325
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,750
That man died before your eyes.

326
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,208
No, he wanted to tell me something.

327
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,291
He wanted to tell you something?
From the afterlife?

328
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,791
He wants our help.

329
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,416
He's dead.

330
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,666
-I know how it sounds.
-It sounds insane.

331
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,416
Maybe it's best you go back to bed.

332
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,041
Maybe it's best
if you sleep here tonight.

333
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,083
Your Majesty, why aren't you in bed?

334
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,958
I want to see my children.

335
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,833
The nannies will take care of them
while you're still so weak.

336
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,916
I want Fienchen to sleep here again.

337
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,833
Please, Your Majesty,
you have to lie down.

338
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:05,125
Don't you wish to have breakfast
with the Empress?

339
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,208
No, I don't.

340
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,791
Any news from Paris?

341
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:18,041
The train should arrive soon.
The meeting with Napoleon is at midday.

342
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:24,291
I hate sitting around waiting for others
to handle things for me.

343
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,416
-What is that?
-Pea juice.

344
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,875
It's supposed to increase
the chances of having male offspring.

345
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,500
With warm regards from your mother,
Your Majesty.

346
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,416
That's enough. I have to get out of here.

347
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,708
His name was Adolfo Tadini.
Twenty-two years old.

348
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:54,958
His family runs
a small weaving mill near Milan.

349
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,750
His father served
in the last emperor's army.

350
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:00,750
I have something else.

351
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,125
This belonged to him.

352
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:09,958
Maybe Franz is right.

353
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,416
Maybe it's all just a crazy dream.

354
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,458
You're up again already.

355
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,500
And you?

356
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,416
-Good morning, Charlotte.
-No visitors.

357
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,875
Those were my instructions.

358
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,500
What is it always with you two?

359
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:32,708
I want Leontine and you, Charlotte,
to always be with me, as I desire.

360
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,041
-She…
-She what?

361
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,791
She what, Charlotte?

362
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,375
If there's anything you want to tell me,
then do it now.

363
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:45,875
Please.

364
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,333
Then stop it.

365
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,708
Both of you. Once and for all.

366
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,083
Yes, Your Majesty.

367
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,666
Yes, Your Majesty.

368
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:34,250
Your Imperial Highness,
Princess Marie Charlotte of Belgium.

369
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,375
Your Highness.

370
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:38,916
Good morning.

371
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,041
I hope it wasn't too uncomfortable here.

372
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:43,958
No trouble at all.

373
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,500
I wanted to say goodbye.

374
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:50,916
-Are you jumping out of the train?
-We'll be in Paris in a few minutes.

375
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,083
The ladies and I must hurry.
Remember, I'm a day late.

376
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,291
At least have a sip of tea.

377
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,583
A pear?

378
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,250
What's the rush?

379
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,791
What so urgently awaits you in Paris?

380
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,750
I'm meeting my future husband.

381
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,458
All I need to do is consent.

382
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,333
If I find no fault in him,
our engagement will be final.

383
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,833
And who is the lucky man?

384
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,666
Pedro V,

385
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,375
King of Portugal.

386
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,916
Never heard of it. Portugal?

387
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,500
Where would that be?

388
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,708
And what are you doing in Paris?

389
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,125
I'm on a diplomatic mission,

390
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,541
arranging an important alliance.

391
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,375
-Then we're actually doing the same thing.
-True.

392
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,458
Perhaps you can lend me a dress
that would accentuate my cleavage.

393
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,458
Sorry. It went down the wrong way.

394
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,791
Your Highnesses, we are arriving in Paris.

395
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,166
We are arriving in Paris.

396
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,333
Goodbye.

397
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,583
It's been a pleasure.

398
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,750
All right, we're not here for fun.

399
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,208
To battle!

400
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,666
Follow me, please.

401
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,708
What did you bring?

402
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,166
Your Majesty.

403
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,375
It's a great honour.
Thank you for receiving me.

404
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:54,166
Congratulations on the birth of your son.
With warmest regards from my brother.

405
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,750
How thoughtful.

406
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,291
Allow me to introduce you
to Baron Haussmann.

407
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,000
It's a pleasure.

408
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,458
I've heard a lot about you.

409
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,250
Your Majesty?

410
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,166
This will be a masterpiece.

411
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,291
And my legacy to the world.

412
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,583
Paris?

413
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:30,000
We all want to leave something behind,
don't we?

414
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,916
Large boulevards

415
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,291
from one end of the city to the other.

416
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:41,041
No little alleys like in the Middle Ages
when people had to walk through shit.

417
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:42,541
That's over.

418
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,500
So that traffic can flow and…

419
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,666
so can the shit.

420
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,125
Perfect.

421
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,583
The heart, a square

422
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,791
where all streets converge.

423
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,916
The Place de l'Étoile.

424
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,666
Beautiful.

425
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:02,625
A place where people can celebrate,
and I can speak to them.

426
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,458
You have to speak to the people.

427
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,625
Your brother must know that, must he not?

428
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Sure.

429
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,208
But now, for the best of all.

430
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,541
All you have to do is turn the cannon,

431
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,291
and you can shoot in any direction.

432
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,041
I learned it during the revolution.

433
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,916
You still haven't told me why you're here.

434
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,458
-My brother…
-No.

435
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,583
This is so exciting.

436
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,708
Come to my little soirée tonight.

437
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,250
And you'll tell me everything there.

438
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:55,208
Thank you.

439
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,458
Fienchen.

440
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,458
Fienchen. I'm here.

441
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,125
Yes. Come here.

442
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,583
Yes.

443
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,208
Yes.

444
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,458
Yes. Come with me.

445
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:43,458
Hello.

446
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Mummy.

447
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:52,708
Mummy.

448
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,458
Fienchen, wait. Wait for me.

449
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Fienchen.

450
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Empress.

451
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Fienchen?

452
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:20,875
Fienchen?

453
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:37,791
Empress.

454
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,000
The Princess. Save her!

455
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:54,041
Grab hold of the Princess.

456
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,416
-Imperial Highness, get away from there.
-No. No!

457
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,708
-Why was the Princess unattended?
-She must've run away.

458
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,208
I'm here.

459
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:04,458
Your Majesty, can we help you?

460
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:10,041
-Pay better attention next time.
-There was a man by the hedge. He… He…

461
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,125
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

462
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,958
-Careful.
-There. Over there.

463
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,916
-Mummy.
-Your mother is fine.

464
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,333
He was over there.

465
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,958
I think this was
an acute hysterical nervous breakdown,

466
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,250
triggered by the disappointment
of the birth.

467
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,208
-I see it frequently in women.
-My dear colleague, please.

468
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:37,416
-We have not yet examined Her Majesty.
-I have a very effective new remedy.

469
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,208
That's a strong sedative.

470
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,375
It…

471
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,000
It sedates patients,

472
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,250
and that's it.

473
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,666
Dr Seeburger, I fully trust you.

474
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:54,958
Do what you think is best.

475
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,583
But Your Imperial Highness,
this remedy won't help the Empress…

476
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,833
Thank you, Dr Fritsch. You can go.

477
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,375
A glass of champagne?

478
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,708
You like her? The Belgian Princess?

479
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,708
She could make a wonderful queen.

480
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:48,541
For Portugal.

481
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,583
She could make a wonderful queen
for any country, Your Majesty.

482
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,666
Come along.

483
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,833
Tell me what's on your mind.

484
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:05,875
Your Majesty, my brother wishes
to work more closely with France again.

485
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:29,166
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

486
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,250
Thank you.

487
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,750
I wish you a pleasant evening.

488
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:41,958
To your son.

489
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,291
The newest Napoleon.

490
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,291
To your health, my uncle.

491
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,875
My brother, the Emperor, would like
to propose a customs union, Your Majesty.

492
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:55,875
Why?

493
00:38:56,708 --> 00:39:01,291
Well, Europe's two most powerful empires
should be friends,

494
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:02,958
not enemies.

495
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,125
That's what my brother believes.

496
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:10,916
Your brother's empire is special, I think.

497
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,750
Habsburg has so many different cultures,
different languages.

498
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:19,041
11 official languages
and 25 ethnicities to be exact.

499
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:24,708
I imagine it as a family
with a whole lot of different children.

500
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:29,541
And lots of children mean lots of worries.
Am I right?

501
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:30,625
Yes.

502
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,208
You're right.

503
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,083
I'll give you some advice.

504
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:42,583
You should never hold back children
who want to leave the nest.

505
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,208
Like the Lombards, for example?

506
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:49,666
For example.

507
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,875
I think children who misbehave
actually just want to be loved.

508
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,125
You are a rear admiral, correct?

509
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:04,291
Why doesn't your brother have
a better position for you?

510
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:11,500
Have you ever been to South America?

511
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,125
Argentina,

512
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:16,708
Ecuador,

513
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,291
Peru,

514
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,083
Mexico.

515
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:24,500
-That's where the future is.
-So you're losing interest in Europe?

516
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,750
No. But it is getting crowded.

517
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,833
And when things get crowded,

518
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,750
there's usually one too many.

519
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:38,375
If your brother
doesn't have a real task for you,

520
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:39,791
I'll find one.

521
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,000
I have something for you.

522
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,791
They're called "worry dolls."

523
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,250
They are from Mexico.

524
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:57,041
Every night,
children tell the dolls their worries,

525
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,666
one for each doll.

526
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,250
Lombardy.

527
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:05,708
Hungary.

528
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,750
No heir to the throne.

529
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:15,041
Then you put them under your pillow

530
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:18,000
and have one worry less the next day.

531
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,583
Take them to your brother.

532
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,750
Perhaps he can use them.

533
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,000
I have more.

534
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:25,916
Thank you.

535
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,541
And my brother's proposal?

536
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,750
Your Majesty? The alliance?

537
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,041
I'll consider it.

538
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:36,291
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I'll gladly pass that on.

539
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,333
Your Majesty, my name is Dr Seeburger.

540
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:52,541
It is an honour.

541
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,833
I'm here to help you.

542
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,000
Where is Dr Fritsch?

543
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:59,041
Upon consultation with the Archduchess,

544
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:02,333
Dr Seeburger will take over
Your Majesty's treatment as of today.

545
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,208
You will be feeling better soon,
Your Majesty.

546
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,333
All right.

547
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,416
No, I'm not taking that.

548
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:13,583
Let me through.

549
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,166
Your Majesty.

550
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,333
Her Majesty, the Empress.

551
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,166
Your Majesty.

552
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,500
Did you send that doctor to me?

553
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:37,125
I am worried, Elisabeth.

554
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,791
Instead of regaining your strength,
you appear to be losing your wits…

555
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,583
I'm not losing my wits.

556
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:53,208
I heard you saw someone in the park.

557
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:57,875
A bleeding man who wasn't really there.
Is that true?

558
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,916
And that's why
you lost sight of your child.

559
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,333
You put Princess Sophie
in great danger, Elisabeth.

560
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,875
She is utterly frightened.

561
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,000
I didn't mean to.

562
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,166
What if something had happened to her?

563
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,916
-I just…
-Shh…

564
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,666
I know that.

565
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,000
It has been a hard week.

566
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,708
-Yes.
-Franz will understand.

567
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,041
Does he know what happened in the park?

568
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:39,666
I don't think so.

569
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:43,291
But we have to tell him, don't you think?

570
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,125
No.

571
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,208
No.

572
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,916
Or we can keep it to ourselves.

573
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,875
So he doesn't worry unnecessarily.

574
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,833
Maybe that's a good idea.

575
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,291
Yes.

576
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,416
Yes.

577
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,208
I won't tell Franz anything.

578
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:10,416
I won't tell him.

579
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:22,375
But you'll do something for me, all right?

580
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,041
Doctor?

581
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,250
I also have a concern.

582
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:01,166
I have heart palpitations
and severe headaches at night.

583
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:05,791
I recommend
some herbal tea or a warm bath.

584
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,458
That helps most ladies.

585
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,833
Most women don't work for the Archduchess.

586
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,833
I need something stronger.

587
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,375
I see.

588
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,333
Take three drops. Never more.

589
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:29,375
Thank you.

590
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,625
Your mother isn't feeling well.

591
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,125
That's why we're eating together.

592
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,041
That's nice, isn't it?

593
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,125
I want to do it!

594
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:01,625
Forgive me, Your Imperial Highness.

595
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,250
Leave it. You can go.

596
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,416
You like doing everything by yourself?

597
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,500
I can understand that.

598
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,041
Do you know what?

599
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,458
From now on, we'll call you Sophie.

600
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,750
That was your baptismal name,
and it suits you much better.

601
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,041
Don't you think?

602
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,625
To us, Sophie.

603
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,375
Imperial Highness.

604
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,041
Your Royal Highness.

605
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:01,916
Ladies.

606
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,416
I hope you had
a pleasant evening with King Pedro.

607
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:08,083
Of course, we did.

608
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,333
He is an impressive man.

609
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:12,916
King Pedro has a palace right by the sea.

610
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,958
And he has an island in the Indian Ocean.

611
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,291
I am certain he'll propose this week.

612
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:21,500
And you find no fault in him?

613
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,666
He doesn't make me laugh.

614
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,333
Has anyone ever done that?

615
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,541
Duchess.

616
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:48,166
-One moment, please.
-The carriages are waiting.

617
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:52,625
The Archduke will take a walk
along the Seine tomorrow morning.

618
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:55,375
Then the Archduke
should wear his long johns.

619
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:57,375
It's chilly by the river
this time of year.

620
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,791
Would you let the Princess know?

621
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,125
Please?

622
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:07,583
The Archduke is still next
in line for the Austrian crown, isn't he?

623
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:09,250
Yes.

624
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:12,458
Good night.

625
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,166
Your Majesty.

626
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,500
Elisabeth.

627
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,333
Is she all right?

628
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:44,541
The doctor gave her something
to get some good sleep.

629
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,750
Thank you.

630
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:19,333
If I could, I'd live somewhere
on a mountain with you.

631
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:24,041
I'd be happy with only girls.

632
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,333
I'd teach them to hunt.

633
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,041
You'd teach them to ride.

634
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,833
I wish I could just be a father.

635
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:45,208
England.

636
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,583
Prussia.

637
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,791
Russia.

638
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:52,708
Austria.

639
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,500
It's too cramped, isn't it?

640
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,583
Yes, Europe is too cramped.

641
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:11,750
A newly engaged woman.

642
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:14,916
Yet again.

643
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,333
This is madness.

644
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,375
Your Highness?

645
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,583
I didn't think you'd come.

646
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:35,791
And now?

647
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,458
If we don't move, I'll leave.
I'm freezing.

648
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,000
What should we name you?

649
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,125
These ladies all have the same names.

650
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,041
Do you want to be a Maria?

651
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:24,916
Or a Theresia?

652
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:31,375
You like her?

653
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:38,375
Gisella.

654
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:50,541
-Yes, that horse.
-Turn it once more?

655
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:52,875
-Yes, do you want it to turn?
-Yes.

656
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:54,250
Do you like…

657
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:04,958
Please help us, Empress.

658
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:12,583
Your Majesty, good morning.

659
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:15,583
You already look very refreshed.

660
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:24,458
Okay, please open your mouth.

661
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,500
That's good. Very good.

662
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:37,208
Be nice and calm, Your Majesty.

663
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:43,500
I will not be calm.

664
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:46,583
