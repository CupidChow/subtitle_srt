1
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,916
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,041
Make it stop,

3
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,208
Hazy.

4
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:36,416
But would the foe alarm me

5
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:42,333
Oh, let him never harm me

6
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:48,458
But still Thine angels round me sing

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,666
Today is a big day.

8
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,583
On your feet now.

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,958
Your Majesty, it's the Countess again.

10
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,166
Shall I take care of it?

11
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,458
No, let her in.

12
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,250
My Emperor.

13
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,333
Countess.

14
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,125
It's not a good time.

15
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,250
I had no choice.
You don't answer my letters.

16
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,041
We've resolved everything.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,416
And you think you can just discard me?

18
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,125
I made you a generous offer.

19
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,125
You said you need me.

20
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,625
Your Majesty?
The Imperial bride will arrive shortly.

21
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:44,916
It's over.

22
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,833
Today's the big day, ladies.
Duchess Elisabeth will arrive any moment.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,041
The whole world
will be watching tomorrow's wedding.

24
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,458
And you are here

25
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,333
to fulfil our future Empress's every wish.

26
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,125
What is this décolletage?

27
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,791
We are in Vienna, not Versailles.

28
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,375
I always select more than I need.

29
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,333
In the next weeks, we'll see who makes it.

30
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,041
She will get what she needs,

31
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,416
so we get what we need.

32
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,750
A radiant empress.

33
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,041
I want to know everything.
What she eats, drinks, thinks.

34
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,375
When she has her period. Everything.

35
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,000
The Empress-to-be is almost here.

36
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,750
Ladies,

37
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,958
welcome to the Viennese Court.

38
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:16,208
Franz wrote her 44 letters.
Can you imagine that?

39
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,541
We'll see if it all goes so smoothly.

40
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,333
Why? They're in love.

41
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,750
Or are they not?

42
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,000
Love alone often isn't enough, Luzi.

43
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,833
Does Franz know you think that?

44
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,083
We all have our little secrets.

45
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,958
Right, Luziwuzi?

46
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,416
In line, quickly!
The coaches are arriving.

47
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,583
She's coming!

48
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:48,000
Only beautiful people in the front row.
Everything must be perfect.

49
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,500
There will be no surprises.

50
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,958
There's no such thing as surprises,
just poor planning.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,666
Elisabeth, will you do me a favour?

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,125
When we're here at court,

53
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,500
don't tell everyone what's on your mind.

54
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,208
I can take care of myself.

55
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,500
And Franz loves me as I am.

56
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,708
And this is you?

57
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,541
Welcome.

58
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,583
You're finally here.

59
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,708
How wonderful.

60
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,416
It's a pleasure, Your Imperial Highness.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Come along now.

62
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,083
We have a great deal to do.

63
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,583
Helene.

64
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,916
Welcome.

65
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,750
Ludovica, nice to see you.

66
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,666
The people can hardly wait to see you.

67
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,291
You'll ride to the wedding
in the glass coach.

68
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,500
It's tradition.

69
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,500
In two hours,
you have a dance class with the Emperor.

70
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:07,375
Johann Strauss composed a waltz for you.
But your wardrobe must be tailored first.

71
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,333
Here we are.

72
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,500
Show Their Highnesses

73
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,125
the newly landscaped rose garden
in the meantime.

74
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,083
Of course. This way, please.

75
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,458
Helene.

76
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,250
Helene, please wait.

77
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,333
She won't talk to me anymore.

78
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,375
Not a single word.

79
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,625
We only need forgiveness
from God Himself, Elisabeth.

80
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,625
Everything else is vanity.

81
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,375
And a waste of time.

82
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,916
Your Imperial Highness.

83
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,291
These are your chambers.

84
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,125
Chief Court Mistress,

85
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,625
Countess Esterhazy.

86
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,583
She knows the protocol
and the court better than I do.

87
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,083
She'll run your court
and see to everything.

88
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,583
It is my honour, Your Royal Highness.

89
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,541
May I introduce you to your court ladies?

90
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,458
Chosen from the Empire's best families
to engage your mind and spirit.

91
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,666
They will fulfil your every wish.

92
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,041
Countess Amalia von Salm-Reifferscheidt.

93
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,958
She speaks six languages
and is skilled at embroidery and drawing.

94
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,416
She's served for years.

95
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,333
It's the greatest of honours,
Your Royal Highness.

96
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,208
I have longed for this day.

97
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,750
Countess Charlotte von Stubenberg.

98
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,625
An exquisite harpist.

99
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,625
Your Highness!
You're much prettier than in the pictures.

100
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,125
-Pardon me, I'm a little excited.
-Countess Leontine von Apafi.

101
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,041
From far-away Transylvania.

102
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,583
Her French is excellent.
Outstanding at reading aloud.

103
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,916
I brought my favourite books along.

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,416
Do you know Werther?

105
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,708
Your Highness.

106
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,083
I'm Elisabeth.

107
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,750
No touching!

108
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,250
And no first names please,
Your Royal Highness.

109
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,750
This way, please.

110
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:21,333
These are the latest styles.
Paris, Milan, Saint Petersburg.

111
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,791
I picked them all out for you myself.

112
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,000
So many shoes.

113
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,208
Not your size, Leontine.

114
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,208
Empresses can't wear the same shoes twice.
They're disposed of each day.

115
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,416
That's wasteful.

116
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,750
That's Schönbrunn.

117
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,916
Strange that the trunk
with her shoes still isn't here.

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,375
Today, we must try on
the clothes for the dance,

119
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,458
this evening's dinner and the wedding.

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,708
There is much to do,
but if we're disciplined, we'll manage.

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,083
Do you like it?

122
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,125
It has been
in our family's possession for centuries.

123
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,333
Mama, come!

124
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,958
Wait, I'll get you soon.

125
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,625
Your Imperial Highness.

126
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,708
The cabinet awaits you
in the meeting room.

127
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,708
Well, then…

128
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,666
I'll leave you to the ladies.

129
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,833
I hope this is important.

130
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,250
Your Imperial Highness.

131
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,166
France and England
have entered the war against Russia.

132
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,750
The Russian army near Odessa
has been under fire since yesterday.

133
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,666
Your Majesty must choose a side,
or a side will choose us.

134
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,625
It is imperative
we send in reinforcements.

135
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:40,125
This year's military expenditures
have already put a burden on our budget.

136
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:45,416
Entering this war would mean
leaving no money for anything else.

137
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,208
-I expected you to say that, Bach.
-Von Bach.

138
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,666
What do you need the money for this time?
A home for poor widows?

139
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,208
Gentlemen!

140
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:59,500
Majesty. What could be more important
than defending our empire?

141
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,500
You want to attack, not defend.

142
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,166
I recommend waiting.

143
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,500
-The situation is much too unclear.
-Unclear?

144
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,583
Please.

145
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,875
May I?

146
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,875
Here are the French with at least ten,
three- or four-decker ships of the line.

147
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,375
In front of Crimea, the Brits.

148
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,625
Nine steamers,

149
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,208
six gunboats and one frigate.

150
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,000
And here…

151
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,125
Grapes, please.

152
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,208
The Russian infantry and fleet.

153
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,541
The French will take care of the Tsar.
With or without us.

154
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,625
And if you ask me, Majesty,
we should look to the West.

155
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,708
We could learn
from the French and English.

156
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,041
We shouldn't upset Tsar Nicholas.

157
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,416
Our alliance with Russia
ensures our position in Europe.

158
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,708
We must take a stand against the West.

159
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,625
We shall not enter this war.
That is the Habsburg stance.

160
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,583
Getting involved on either side
is a waste of money and lives.

161
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,041
I have other plans for our empire.

162
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,458
The delegations from Paris and
St. Petersburg are here for the wedding.

163
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,291
They want to know
which side Habsburg will take.

164
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,916
I'd like to urgently implore
Your Majesty to reconsider.

165
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,125
You have my answer.

166
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,375
If you'll excuse me.

167
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,750
Your mother hates me.

168
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,791
Don't flatter yourself.
You are just one of many.

169
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,541
When should we tell
the cabinet and the Archduchess our plans?

170
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:21,125
We won't say anything until it's in place.
Have you arranged the meeting?

171
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,125
I'm afraid tonight is his only option.

172
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,833
I told him it was the night
before your wedding.

173
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,833
We'll meet him.

174
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:40,958
The Empress takes a two-hour bath
every morning and every evening.

175
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,583
Her hair must be combed
and braided every day.

176
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,666
It'll be washed solely

177
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,583
with a mixture of donkey's milk
and chaste tree,

178
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,625
which also bolsters fertility.

179
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,750
Please wash her fingernails thoroughly.

180
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,083
Your skin is so beautiful. Like moonlight.

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,625
I bet the Emperor fell in love
with her eyes first.

182
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,958
Or her lips.

183
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,708
I wish I had hair as long as yours.

184
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,458
Leontine, what are you doing?

185
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,458
That is maid's work.

186
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,750
Of course.

187
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,208
Maybe she should lose the mane,

188
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,750
and we'll try a wig.

189
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,083
What is she doing?

190
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:45,958
Too tight.

191
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,375
Please stop. I can't breathe.

192
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,916
Then it fits perfectly.

193
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,291
I need a break.

194
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,250
I'd like to see Franz, His Majesty.

195
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,000
It's not time for that yet.

196
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,250
Continue.

197
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,583
Then I'll go for a walk. I…

198
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I need air.

199
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,333
But only in a suitable dress.

200
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,875
What is she doing?

201
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,666
Wherever she goes, we follow.

202
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,333
Will some of us really be let go?

203
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,291
Oh, that's just talk.

204
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,666
Traditionally,
the Empress has six ladies-in-waiting.

205
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,375
But there are ten of us.

206
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,500
Some will be weeded out.

207
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,625
And who gets to stay?

208
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,333
The indispensable ones.

209
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,583
Yuck!

210
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,250
Have you ever seen such an animal?

211
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,791
He is looking at you.

212
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,833
I am new here.

213
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,500
Not the bird. The Archduke.

214
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,333
That's Maximilian, the Emperor's brother!

215
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,958
Oh my! He's so handsome.

216
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,833
It's nice to see you again.

217
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,458
I feel the same.

218
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,791
You've changed since the engagement.

219
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,416
You've sprung open like a little almond.

220
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,000
-How do you do that?
-Do what?

221
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,666
You give a compliment,
but it's really an insult.

222
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,041
-Happy to teach you.
-No, thank you. I prefer direct insults.

223
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,250
It's gorgeous here.

224
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,875
At first glance, yes.

225
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,416
-Are you trying to scare me?
-Just telling you the truth.

226
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,750
How's the delightful Italian baroness?

227
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,458
Wonderful, so I hear.

228
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,541
She's gotten engaged to a count.

229
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,583
And you?

230
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,416
I didn't get engaged.

231
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,208
Elisabeth.

232
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,375
If I may give you some advice…

233
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,208
Stick with me in here
and nothing will happen to you.

234
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,500
I have a feeling
the exact opposite might be true.

235
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,041
-Time for your dance lesson.
-If you'll excuse me.

236
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:26,916
"The river with its wild course.
The tempest is my vital force."

237
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,875
She's going to be a lot of work.

238
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,375
Her scribblings aren't the problem.

239
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,333
What else do you have?

240
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,375
These books are banned in our country.

241
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,166
I hate to say it,

242
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,750
but she lacks
all understanding and discipline.

243
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,916
I heard how she greeted the Emperor.

244
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,166
And she just cancelled a fitting.

245
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,833
What do you propose?

246
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,291
This young lady needs a strong hand.
Then she will work.

247
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,875
Don't frighten her off, Countess.

248
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,083
Your Imperial Highness. Your husband.

249
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,458
He's here?

250
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,791
Your Imperial Highness.

251
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,291
Karl! How nice.

252
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,083
You're already here.

253
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,583
Our son will only marry once.

254
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,083
How are things at Auhof Castle?

255
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,875
Very well.
In March, I shot a twelve-point stag.

256
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,916
And we built new stables.
Even has a toilet.

257
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,750
How nice.

258
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,541
How are things here in Vienna?

259
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:43,000
Some trouble with the Russian war,
but don't let that worry you.

260
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,916
You'll know what is to be done.

261
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,041
Can I do anything else for you?

262
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,291
We could spend
some time together this evening.

263
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,333
You'll meet the Imperial bride.

264
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,041
I mean afterwards.

265
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,791
Let me know.

266
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,083
I'm going to rest.

267
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,208
Please excuse my tardiness, gentlemen.

268
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,000
Your Royal Highness,
if I may introduce myself.

269
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,791
Johann Strauss, composer.

270
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:40,625
I composed a waltz in your honour.
For the dance after the wedding.

271
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,458
Mr Strauss looks like
he has a stomach ache.

272
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,125
Something is weighing on you.

273
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,875
Everyone wants me
to take a side in the war.

274
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,958
As quickly as possible.

275
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,750
But you don't want to.

276
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,625
I have other plans.

277
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,750
I'll tell you later.

278
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,875
Where does that door lead?

279
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,666
Your Majesty, I--

280
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,000
I beg your forgiveness.

281
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,750
The Imperial bride
must resume her preparations.

282
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:07,583
Of course.

283
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,625
If you would accompany me.

284
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,083
Boo!

285
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,500
My dear Countess.

286
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,583
-Hello.
-Did you bring the shoes?

287
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,375
Things like that are hard to get.
And expensive.

288
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:17,416
I need them tonight at the latest.
This Amalia is sticking to me like a fly.

289
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,583
I'll get some.

290
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,250
I promise.

291
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,708
What's it like?

292
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:32,458
They all want to get close to the bride
to secure a spot, like crazy little birds.

293
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,291
You're shivering.

294
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,583
But it's so warm.

295
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,666
I feel a chill.

296
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:42,666
They don't wear underwear
under their dresses.

297
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,625
I don't know how they survive.

298
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,791
Well, they won't.

299
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,041
You never told me what she's like.

300
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,041
The Empress.

301
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,833
How should she be?

302
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,375
She's scum,

303
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:10,541
like all of them.

304
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,250
As long as she trusts you
more than anyone else.

305
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,500
I know.

306
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,500
What still has to be done?

307
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,250
Follow me.

308
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,333
Your Royal Highness.

309
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,916
Wait. You've…

310
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,750
Royal Highness.

311
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,458
I implore you.

312
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,291
You can keep the dress on.

313
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,708
This won't take long.

314
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,125
What won't take long?

315
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,333
Dr Fritsch will confirm
the Imperial bride's purity

316
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,000
and her ability to bear
an heir to the throne.

317
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:11,791
-It is an honour, Your Royal Highness.
-Ultimately, God makes the final decision.

318
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,166
As you know,
He alone decides who sits on the throne.

319
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:18,458
As of tomorrow,
you are a vessel of His will.

320
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,791
His Excellency, the Archbishop Rauscher.

321
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,125
If you'd lie down, please.

322
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,958
Position her legs please.

323
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,708
The doctor is nearly finished.

324
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,250
Everything looks healthy.

325
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,791
Proof of chastity matters the most.

326
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:17,916
Stop that!

327
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,208
I am chaste.

328
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,125
The doctor must confirm that.

329
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:27,791
I couldn't see anything.

330
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,166
That cannot be.

331
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
You must ride a lot.

332
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Don't you know what that means?

333
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:43,208
-That is indeed possible.
-No proof of chastity, no marriage.

334
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,083
I believe in her purity.

335
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,541
Even if her hymen is already broken.

336
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,333
May kings issue from your loins

337
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,666
and make all the Earth subject to you.

338
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:48,541
Your Majesty,

339
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,625
your brother.

340
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,750
You wanted to see me?

341
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,625
Let me work the diplomats tomorrow.

342
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,750
-They won't understand your plans.
-Do you take this seriously?

343
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,625
What does that mean?

344
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,875
I've been at your side
advising you for weeks,

345
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,333
but you're always
with that ferret von Bach.

346
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:10,583
During the revolution,

347
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:13,458
First Lieutenant Krall
gave his arm for the Empire.

348
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:18,791
How nice.

349
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,291
He has two daughters,

350
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,541
Agnes and Emilie.

351
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,583
Agnes was expecting a child

352
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,416
with a young man
who had no plans to marry her.

353
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,416
She died in childbirth.

354
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,875
Emilie fell victim to the same young man.

355
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:41,125
Consumed with grief, she jumped off a barn
and has lived in sanatorium since.

356
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,000
Without knowing who the young man was,
all we can do is ensure

357
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,416
he and his family are taken care of.

358
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,083
Nobility status and a yearly pension.

359
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,083
Do you agree to this?

360
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,416
Yes.

361
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:02,416
That way, he can forget this whole thing

362
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,583
and no longer feel he must talk about it.

363
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,125
I thank you, Majesty.

364
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:24,250
-I didn't know they were sisters.
-You must adhere to the rules.

365
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,250
If not, you'll undermine us all.

366
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,333
You look enchanting.

367
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,875
We haven't yet had the pleasure.
Karl, your future father-in-law.

368
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,916
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.

369
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,666
She only lets me out
for important occasions.

370
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm to spend
most of my time in the country.

371
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,458
That sounds familiar.

372
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,250
You look wonderful.

373
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,083
How was your day?

374
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,541
Is Helene not here?

375
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,583
She sends her apologies.

376
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,541
I almost didn't recognize you.

377
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,041
Is that good or bad?

378
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You tell me.

379
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,625
Elisabeth, come over here and join us.

380
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:35,583
War can give meaning to things.
It would get the riffraff off the streets.

381
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:37,833
War is the last resort, not a game.

382
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,958
And we'll give
the people meaning anyway, right?

383
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,875
Have you met the Imperial bride,
Your Excellency?

384
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,208
We've already had the pleasure.

385
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:50,041
I had the honour

386
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,916
of verifying the young lady's chastity.

387
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,916
Wonderful.

388
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,375
It gives me pleasure, Your Majesty, to say

389
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:59,375
nothing stands in the way
of an heir to the throne.

390
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,291
Happy you at least had some pleasure.

391
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,291
Elisabeth,
His Excellency was doing his duty.

392
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:11,125
I'm sorry
the sacred ritual made you uneasy.

393
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,875
A sacred ritual, right. Silly me.

394
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,916
It seemed two men
were looking up my dress.

395
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,083
Pardon me, Maman. Pardon me.

396
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,416
You seem agitated,

397
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,000
my child.

398
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,291
I'm not agitated.

399
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,250
Is everything okay, Elisabeth?

400
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,875
Maybe the bride needs some rest.

401
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:36,625
I don't think that'll be necessary.

402
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,708
-I…
-Franz.

403
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,375
It's been a long day for her.

404
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,916
We want tomorrow to go well, do we not?

405
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,958
A bit of rest
would do you good, Elisabeth.

406
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:55,875
No. Please, I--

407
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,666
Maybe it's better you rest.

408
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,375
-But…
-I insist on it.

409
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,750
If I may permit myself an observation.

410
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,958
Countess Esterhazy
put me in charge of your court

411
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,750
because I'm very well versed.

412
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:45,833
I know how people tick,
what can be said to whom.

413
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,916
I am always ready to help you.

414
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,666
Thank you.

415
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,541
Highness, many of the other ladies

416
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,208
are only here to find a good husband.

417
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,333
They come and go.

418
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,958
I live for this court.

419
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,458
I am here solely to serve you.

420
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,000
Whatever you need, just say it.

421
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,666
Can you tell me what this is?

422
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,041
I found it on the castle floor.

423
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:22,541
I'm sure this can be thrown away.
Shall I dispose of it for you?

424
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,458
I'll go see what's going on.

425
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:32,000
You urgently need rest, Royal Highness.

426
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:37,750
What's going on?

427
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:43,291
Where I am from, people burn
those straw dolls as symbols of mortality.

428
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,416
So God may protect them.

429
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,541
Your Royal Highness,

430
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,083
your teeth.

431
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,500
I'll do it myself. Thank you.

432
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,708
You shouldn't do that.

433
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,375
They'll only gossip then.

434
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,083
You do it, please.

435
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,583
No, definitely not.

436
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:36,041
The night before the wedding.
It's irresponsible.

437
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:39,375
Maybe we could go anyway.
She's already sleeping.

438
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,541
What is that?

439
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:48,125
Archduke Maximilian is hosting a soiree.

440
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,833
You are invited.

441
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:52,000
And us too. We've been invited too.

442
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:55,041
Countess Esterhazy said
the bride doesn't leave her chambers

443
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,000
the night before the wedding.

444
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:18,958
We should go.

445
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,500
That's Franz!

446
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,500
Liszt!

447
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:27,041
I heard when he plays,
it's like dying and being reborn at once.

448
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:28,791
Absinthe, milady?

449
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,833
What is that?

450
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:36,125
Maybe tea would be better, Your Majesty.

451
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,041
Enjoying yourself?

452
00:38:57,083 --> 00:39:00,333
Relax.
I didn't invite that creep Rauscher.

453
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,333
Isn't Franz here?

454
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,875
Not that I know of.

455
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,583
-Is that a reason to leave?
-No.

456
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:15,500
Good.

457
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:19,083
May I introduce you to my good friend?

458
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,791
Just in from Weimar.

459
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,416
Maestro, the Empress-to-be.

460
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,458
I'm honoured.

461
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,166
For you, Your Highness.

462
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,375
Are we too late?

463
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,458
He wanted to be here at midnight.

464
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,708
It is an honour.

465
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:34,416
Now go back quickly before they notice.

466
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,166
For the people.

467
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:47,833
I want you to build me a big railway line.
Like you built in England.

468
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,250
And Egypt and now in Norway.

469
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,916
I want to connect the people of my empire.

470
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:55,916
Bring them prosperity.

471
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,750
-This isn't enough.
-Austria needs this railway.

472
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:08,708
The whole world needs a railway.
That's why it's expensive.

473
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:15,958
Give me three days.
You will get the entire sum.

474
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:20,041
I hear you intend to get involved
in the war for the Ottoman Empire.

475
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,666
This will surely be very costly.

476
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,750
We're not going to war.

477
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,833
I'll get more money before you depart.

478
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:52,916
Let's sit down.

479
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,083
Do you like it?

480
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,250
Your mother gave it to me.

481
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,500
It was my great-aunt Maria Antonia's.

482
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,666
Marie Antoinette?

483
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,166
She was still wearing it
in the guillotine.

484
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:19,333
My family has a talent
for using pretty things for ugly purposes.

485
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,541
Why are you here
if you hate this court so much?

486
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,875
I've often tried to leave.

487
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,583
Elisabeth…

488
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:40,708
When we first met, I thought
a life like this would suit you better.

489
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,666
That I would suit you better.

490
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,333
The marriage is tomorrow.

491
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:50,833
It's not too late yet.

492
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:53,458
No.

493
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,250
You should see yourself.
Did you really believe what I said?

494
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,250
You've never known true love. Right?

495
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:11,000
I love your brother.

496
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:13,750
And yet you're here.

497
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,375
Will you never speak to me again?

498
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:46,250
How many times must I apologize?
I'm sorry.

499
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,416
-You know I'm sorry.
-You're drunk.

500
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,833
I know.

501
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,625
That's not how an empress-to-be behaves.

502
00:43:58,916 --> 00:43:59,875
Helene…

503
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:03,875
It hasn't been an easy day.

504
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,958
I'm sorry you imagined it would be easier.

505
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:20,500
You always run away
when things get difficult.

506
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:23,875
Grow up, Sisi.

507
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,250
Do you know who you've become?

508
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,208
Our mother.

509
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:50,125
I give their newfound love three months.
What do you say?

510
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,041
I'm not your consolation prize.

511
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,000
I told my husband I want to be alone.

512
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:06,125
It is not your husband.

513
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,583
A Prince of Vasa?

514
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,125
Your Imperial Highness,
what should I tell him?

515
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,250
Do you know him?

516
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:28,041
Tell him to come in.

517
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,625
Your Imperial Highness.

518
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:42,750
Prince of Vasa.

519
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,625
How long has it been? Ten years?

520
00:46:58,708 --> 00:46:59,583
Thirteen.

521
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,083
And you still wear the fox.

522
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:07,083
I don't usually discard old things
as hastily as you do.

523
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:11,000
The last man who spoke
to me that way was hanged.

524
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,000
Something to drink?

525
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:18,708
Does he love her?

526
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:20,416
Franz?

527
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,583
Like a sparrow loves the new day.

528
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,166
A marriage out of love.

529
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:27,791
Is that allowed?

530
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,041
We're trying something new.

531
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,666
Why did you invite me to this wedding?

532
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:44,958
All of Europe is invited.

533
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:48,625
Is it maybe because it's my son
who will marry tomorrow?

534
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,833
So many questions, Prince of Vasa.

535
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,916
Stop and take a breath.

536
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:14,500
Your Imperial Highness.

537
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,916
I bid you a good night.

538
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,500
Will I see you tomorrow?

539
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:28,750
Will I get an answer?

540
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,208
What's that supposed to mean,
she's not in her bed?

541
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:52,291
You've lost the Empress?

542
00:48:58,416 --> 00:48:59,416
What is that?

543
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,208
Get her out of here.

544
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:18,333
-They're all waiting.
-I don't care.

545
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,666
Good gracious.

546
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,333
Please give us a moment alone.

547
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:51,666
You must love seeing me this way.

548
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,250
I thought I would.

549
00:49:57,916 --> 00:49:58,916
But I don't.

550
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,416
You smell like old champagne!

551
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:08,541
You too.

552
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:14,291
I like your short hair.

553
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,625
You look gorgeous.

554
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:21,791
Sorry about what I said.

555
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:24,000
Me too.

556
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:26,916
Please say I'm not like mother.

557
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,041
You're not.

558
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,583
I hope he's worth all this.

559
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,833
You'll get used to the circus.

560
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,333
I mean losing you.

561
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,750
You haven't lost me.

562
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,666
Do you really want to go back to Bavaria?

563
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:15,041
Don't you want to stay here for a while?

564
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:19,208
I don't know who to trust here.

565
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:31,666
What is it, Theo?

566
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,541
It appears the Imperial bride
had an argument with your brother.

567
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,083
My brother?

568
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,958
She seemed very distraught.

569
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,791
Ladies, wonderful.

570
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:13,416
Countess,

571
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:15,208
my congratulations.

572
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,000
Take care of my girl, okay?

573
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:19,000
Elisabeth!

574
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,375
-Elisabeth!
-Elisabeth!

575
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,500
Elisabeth!

576
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:28,375
Elisabeth!

577
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:31,250
Elisabeth!

578
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:34,291
Majesty!

579
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:40,875
Elisabeth! Please!

580
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,958
Elisabeth!
