1
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,916
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,625
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,458
It's time.

4
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:12,666
Sisi!

5
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,791
IN THE PREVIOUS SUMMER

6
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,916
POSSENHOFEN - KINGDOM OF BAVARIA

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,916
Sisi!

8
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,583
Where are you?

9
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,625
Sisi!

10
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,041
That girl is driving me mad!

11
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,541
Come, hide with me.

12
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,625
Did you look in the cellar?

13
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:41,708
In the attic?

14
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,583
She isn't dressed yet?

15
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:53,208
This can't be.
The Duke will be here any minute.

16
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,833
Mother says the Duke
is going to propose to you.

17
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,583
But I don't want him.

18
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,125
Why not?

19
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,916
Have you seen how he dresses?

20
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,208
Are you unwell?

21
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,875
"I'm bleeding to death on the inside."

22
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,083
"All because of this child!
Bring me a schnapps."

23
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,833
-Is she with you?
-No, Mother.

24
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,750
I mean it this time.

25
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,375
We have to bathe her, dress her,
lace her up and fix her awful hair.

26
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,458
I won't allow this to go wrong now.

27
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,333
Sisi!

28
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,625
I'm warning you!

29
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,791
I want a man who satisfies my soul.

30
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,625
Do you understand?

31
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,833
Sisi!

32
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,250
Where is she?

33
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,250
She said she wants a man
who satisfies her soul.

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,416
Sisi!

35
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,416
Stay calm, Puck.

36
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,750
Your Majesty?

37
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,250
It's time.

38
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,458
VIENNA - AUSTRIAN EMPIRE

39
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,416
Your Imperial Highness,
I wish you a good morning.

40
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,958
Your Imperial Highness.

41
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,458
-Your Imperial Highness.
-Your Imperial Highness.

42
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,583
After breakfast,
you'll have a brief meeting

43
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,125
with the Bohemian delegation,

44
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,791
followed by the fitting
for the winter wardrobe.

45
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,583
But first, the execution.

46
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,500
Not another fitting.

47
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,291
-Postpone it.
-Very well.

48
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,666
Your Majesty.

49
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,708
Mother.

50
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,375
Always up so early, I hear.
Did you even sleep at all?

51
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,916
This is not a pleasant morning.

52
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,833
You'll get used to it.

53
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,791
I think there are things
one never gets used to.

54
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,875
Come.

55
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:03,791
Puck.

56
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,750
Everything will be fine.

57
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,500
Father.

58
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,708
Wake up.

59
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
I need your help.

60
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,958
Sisi will be here soon.

61
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,458
Morning prayers are very important to her.

62
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,750
She matured over the summer.

63
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,875
She is ready for marriage.

64
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,041
Some more tea, yes? Marie?

65
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,458
He took off and fell.

66
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,416
But I don't think it's so bad.

67
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,791
You get into trouble every single day.

68
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:17,583
What are you even doing out there?
You should be in there getting engaged.

69
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,375
The life she wants me to live,
I don't want it.

70
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,666
There must be something else out there.

71
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,083
What are you doing?

72
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,708
No!

73
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,666
His leg is broken.

74
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,458
It will never heal.

75
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,416
You do it.

76
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,416
He'll get through it.

77
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:51,458
He'll never be able to walk right again.
What kind of a life is that?

78
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,791
You ignore all the rules.
You do as you please.

79
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,000
Now it's time to pay the price.

80
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,500
"Death does not separate, death unites."

81
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,375
"Life is what separates us."

82
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,791
From Heinrich Heine.

83
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,166
They must see your face.

84
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,583
These are the moments
when a ruler shows strength.

85
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,375
Give us bread!

86
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,208
We are hungry!

87
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,166
Murderer!

88
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,125
Nooses!

89
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,416
Sentenced to death for conspiracy,

90
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,166
revolutionary behaviour,

91
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,916
lèse-majesté and high treason.

92
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,250
Solely His Majesty the Emperor

93
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,708
has the power to pardon the condemned.

94
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,708
Do those condemned to death
have anything to say?

95
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,583
You sit in your palace. We sit in filth.

96
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,541
Your Majesty.

97
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,458
You can kill us,

98
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,125
but it'll do you no good.

99
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,083
-The people will rise against you.
-Yes, we will!

100
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,500
Yes, we will!

101
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,041
-I'm dying for the people.
-Yes!

102
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,791
For the peo--

103
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:37,916
Shut the door.

104
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,500
Two counts and two dukes
you've driven away.

105
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,583
They were good men.

106
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,333
My ulcer.

107
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,250
The doctor says it could burst,

108
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,458
and I'll die because of you, Sisi.

109
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,916
My name is Elisabeth.

110
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,166
You!

111
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,916
Mother?

112
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,583
Why can't you be more like your sister?

113
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,916
What does she do
when something makes her unhappy?

114
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,833
I don't know.

115
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,291
Neither do I. That's how it should be.

116
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,208
I want to make my own life decisions.
What is so bad about that?

117
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,500
What do you want to do with your life?
Write poetry?

118
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,291
Why not?

119
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,583
You don't know what it's like out there.

120
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,250
No one's waiting for a girl like you.

121
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,541
You can't force me.

122
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,458
You know there are institutions
for young women who've lost their minds.

123
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,041
An insane asylum? That's excessive.

124
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,375
That's enough!

125
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,500
Helene's future looks bright.

126
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,333
A very special wedding.

127
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,708
And you will not ruin that for us,
understand?

128
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,875
Mother, please, I am not crazy.

129
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,916
Then prove it to me.

130
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,666
What is this?

131
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,791
A ruler who harms himself.
You know how that looks?

132
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,416
I don't enjoy hanging people.

133
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,333
You think I do?
Those people wanted to kill you.

134
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,333
-Not those people.
-But they're future assassins.

135
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,583
There must be another way.

136
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,458
Another way?

137
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,166
Cold winter, bad harvest.
People are hungry and ill.

138
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,958
That leads to riots and hatred.

139
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,208
We cannot hang everyone who is discontent.

140
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,333
There are things even we can't change.

141
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,083
The people's rage.

142
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,833
It is like an illness,

143
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:29,916
an ulcer.

144
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,833
And ulcers must be cauterized.

145
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,125
What is that?

146
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,125
A gift from Tsar Nicholas
for Your Majesty.

147
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,041
Read it aloud.

148
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,041
"My beloved friend,
may this gift give you strength."

149
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:06,250
"Even a powerful empire like yours
is easy prey when it is weak and ill."

150
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,208
"Your people need a vision,
a new objective."

151
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,916
"I await your consent

152
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,375
and promise you an empire
where the sun never sets."

153
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,041
How kind.

154
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,875
He wants us to join him
in the war against the Sultan.

155
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,875
The Ottoman Empire is about to collapse.
The time is right.

156
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,875
War is the last thing
our people need right now.

157
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,166
I know what our people need.

158
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Your Imperial Highness.

159
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,166
Please.

160
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,916
Helene from Bavaria.

161
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,708
That's your solution?

162
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,875
I am to marry her?

163
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,083
The people will trust you again
if you give them a bride.

164
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,541
Believe me. And an heir to the throne.

165
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,083
Just take a look at her.

166
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,333
-Helene is pious and beautiful.
-That's not enough for me.

167
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,708
This isn't about you.

168
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,666
The Prussians want our throne.

169
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,666
Napoleon is an imposter.
We won't marry into that.

170
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,333
And aesthetics disqualify
the Belgians' daughters.

171
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:28,375
A marriage with Bavaria will validate
our claim to the German states.

172
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,083
And it will seem honest.

173
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:40,375
I didn't fend off the revolution, Franz,
for you to be picky with your brides.

174
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,875
You will meet each other in four weeks
at your birthday celebration in Ischl.

175
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,750
Then we'll announce your engagement.

176
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,708
These are difficult times.

177
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,833
Let's give the people
something to dream about.

178
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,208
All this poetry is why Mother
wants to send you to a madhouse.

179
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,625
If he starts talking to you,
I'll take you with me.

180
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,666
I'm happy you're coming.

181
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,416
She wants to keep an eye on me.
That's all.

182
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,541
I wanted to have you here.

183
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,000
Really?

184
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,208
I'm afraid that you…

185
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,166
that you'll get lost.

186
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,875
No need to worry about me.
You know me. I have thick skin.

187
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,958
No, you don't.

188
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,708
Let me see.

189
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,500
It's not done yet.

190
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:33,708
"Swallow, lend me your wings
Take me with you to the faraway land

191
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,416
And should I with you soar up there

192
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,833
-In the ever blue firmament
-…firmament…

193
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,166
How I then shall fervently
Praise the god

194
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,000
From whom freedom was sent."

195
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,208
Don't let her see that.

196
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,291
I will be invisible.

197
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,041
I promise. I will behave.

198
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,541
Starting now.

199
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,083
Welcome, Your Royal Highness.

200
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:23,958
Is the Emperor here?

201
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,583
His Majesty and the Imperial family
aren't expected until tomorrow.

202
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,500
Please prepare some food before I starve.

203
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,333
The Emperor is not here to chat,
so no personal questions.

204
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,791
He's not interested in emotions.
No womanly opinions or remarks.

205
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,625
Sisi!

206
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,458
No emotions. Understood.

207
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,833
You know
the Emperor's brothers will also be here.

208
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,333
I'm not hopeful, but sometimes
crumbs fall on the floor for the dog.

209
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,166
Let's go. Hurry up.

210
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,291
You should bathe before bedtime.

211
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,625
Ow! Be careful.

212
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,416
Sorry, soon you'll have
a maid to do this for you.

213
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,625
What if I cannot bear him?

214
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,208
I heard he has hair all over his body,

215
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,916
like a wild boar.

216
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,708
And he loves it
when the ladies scratch his fur.

217
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,166
I'm sure he's a good man.

218
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,791
What if he doesn't like me?

219
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,875
If he…

220
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,208
If he thinks I'm boring?

221
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,375
You'll be a wonderful empress.

222
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,416
You are always elegant
without even trying.

223
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,541
You know what to say and what not to.

224
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,250
Unlike you.

225
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,541
I sometimes wish
I could be a bit more like you.

226
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,750
Come here.

227
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,708
I'm going to miss you.

228
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,166
Good evening, My Emperor.

229
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,666
Is this your secret fantasy?

230
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,125
Your Majesty, the bear

231
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,291
and me, the helpless squirrel?

232
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,250
And if it were?

233
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,000
Whatever floats your boat, I'd say.

234
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,583
I'm no stranger to the abyss.

235
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,166
We don't have much time.

236
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,833
I've heard rumours

237
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,458
you are getting engaged.

238
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,416
Is this her?

239
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,458
She looks very obedient.

240
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,041
Do you like her?

241
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,666
Something isn't right about her.
I wonder what it is.

242
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,583
Come here.

243
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,791
Does she have a moustache?

244
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,958
I haven't seen you laugh in months.

245
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,458
What has to happen for you
to laugh once, My Emperor?

246
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,375
My marriage is about political interests.

247
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,666
And an heir to the throne.

248
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,458
And what are we about?

249
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,083
It's not about love, is it?

250
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:24,750
Good morning, Your Imperial Highness.
I hope you had a pleasant journey.

251
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:30,333
-Your Majesty, welcome to Ischl.
-I want to go for a ride before breakfast.

252
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,208
No!

253
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:40,708
No!

254
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,166
This can't be.

255
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,375
We had one more trunk with us.

256
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,166
Your Highness,
that's all that was on the carriage.

257
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,375
Maybe the other one will arrive later?

258
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,291
This cannot be.

259
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,958
Your funeral clothes?

260
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,541
-Why?
-Uncle Georg died.

261
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,958
Who is Uncle Georg?

262
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:08,125
-That doesn't matter right now.
-So it's this or dirty clothes?

263
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,666
What you wear won't matter.

264
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,708
Of course, it does! He's the Emperor
and tomorrow is his birthday!

265
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:18,333
Would you be so kind
and bring me a glass of sherry?

266
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:24,000
I read that in London and Paris,
all the artists only wear black.

267
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,875
You understand nothing of this!
Please leave us alone for a moment, okay?

268
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:04,791
-Good morning, Your Royal Highness.
-Good morning.

269
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,833
Good morning, Your Royal Highness.

270
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,833
Come on, pay attention.

271
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,041
Thank you.

272
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,208
Oh my goodness.

273
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:56,666
Come now.

274
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,583
Why are you hiding?

275
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,083
I'm not hiding.

276
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,833
Do you always do that?
Secretly watch others?

277
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,208
No, Your Majesty.

278
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,458
Where are your shoes?

279
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,125
I like going barefoot.

280
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:51,000
-Why the bird in your hands?
-Why all the questions this early?

281
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:03,375
-It was in the villa and couldn't get out.
-I know the feeling.

282
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,041
You are Helene's sister?

283
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,583
Yes, Your Majesty.

284
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,500
Beautiful morning for a ride.

285
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,333
Yes. It helps me think clearly.

286
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,333
I know the feeling.

287
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,083
If you'll excuse me.

288
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:41,583
Of course.

289
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,500
Your Imperial Highness.

290
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,750
Your family will be delighted.

291
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,458
We'll see about that.

292
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,833
They'll die in Venice

293
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:45,000
when I tell them I celebrated
the Emperor's birthday here.

294
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:49,416
Maximilian, what a surprise!
You made it after all.

295
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,750
My beautiful boy.

296
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,125
And who is this?

297
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:58,083
The enchanting Francesca,
Baroness of somewhere.

298
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,416
I thought the Italians couldn't stand us.

299
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,541
This one can.

300
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,250
It's an honour to meet you.

301
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,333
I heard you sowed
your wild oats on your journey.

302
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:09,416
I hear you've found a new empress.

303
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,041
This is my little brother.

304
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:15,208
My little brother Ludwig-Viktor.

305
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,416
Hello, little one.

306
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:20,666
No time to announce she was coming.
It was on the spur of the moment.

307
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,916
Maximilian,
what you do doesn't matter at all.

308
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,916
The guests are waiting in the parlour.

309
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,500
Her Imperial Highness, the Archduchess

310
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:50,541
and their Imperial Highnesses,
the Archdukes of Austria.

311
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,083
My dear sister.

312
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:00,708
Sophie.

313
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:05,000
You must forgive us.
We had a mishap with our clothes.

314
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,125
His Majesty, the Emperor.

315
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,125
Ladies.

316
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:19,541
Your Majesty.

317
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,333
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

318
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,541
And this is her.

319
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,958
Let him look at you, Helene.

320
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,291
The pleasure is all mine.

321
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:33,458
And this is?

322
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,916
-Sisi.
-Elisabeth.

323
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,333
How is the bird?

324
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,458
Your Majesty, the table is ready.

325
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,583
Wonderful! Shall we?

326
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,333
The Tsar wants our help

327
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,791
to destroy the Sultan
and divide up the Ottoman Empire.

328
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,958
-But that is a bad idea.
-Why?

329
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:17,583
The English and French won't allow it.
There'd be an unnecessary war.

330
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:19,708
Isn't the Habsburg Empire invincible?

331
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,125
No one is invincible, Luzi.

332
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:44,375
Your hair, Helene,
it is so beautifully braided.

333
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,125
Don't you agree, Franz?

334
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,250
Very pretty.

335
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,791
I do it myself.

336
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,291
Helene has never done much work at all.

337
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,625
And you?

338
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,541
Which sister are you?

339
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,041
The boring or the naughty one?

340
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,208
What do you think?

341
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,875
That's what I thought.

342
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:09,708
And Helene?
Is she the right one for my brother?

343
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,583
I'll leave that
to His Majesty and my sister.

344
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,958
I evaluate all brides.

345
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,250
-Sounds like an important task.
-It is.

346
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,458
You'd make a good wife.

347
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:27,875
Pardon me?

348
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,583
You'll never get fat.
I can tell from your wrists.

349
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:35,000
It's different with her.
I'll have to get out of this soon.

350
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,958
Don't worry, she doesn't understand.

351
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:43,583
-You're as beautiful as a flower.
-Thank you, darling.

352
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,750
Later.

353
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,583
Luziwuzi.

354
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,541
You're ruining my appetite.

355
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,250
Maybe go pet your doll in your room.

356
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:08,333
That is quite funny.
I wanted to ask you to do the same.

357
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:22,833
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
I didn't mean it like that.

358
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:31,083
Helene speaks excellent Bohemian.

359
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,875
She has also made
excellent progress in French.

360
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,500
-Isn't that right, Helene?
-Yes, Mother.

361
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,541
So…

362
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:46,000
How about we go for a little walk?

363
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,208
That way,
they could get better acquainted.

364
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,625
Undisturbed.

365
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,708
A walk in the afternoon sun.

366
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:54,958
An excellent idea.

367
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,416
Mother.

368
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,125
Cuckoo.

369
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:16,833
That was brazen earlier.

370
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,875
I beg your pardon once again.

371
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,416
No need. You were honest with me.

372
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,791
I liked that.

373
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,083
My pleasure.

374
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,500
Do not be concerned.

375
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:28,833
He will ask Helene.

376
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:32,250
Because all the men
in this family do what you say?

377
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,500
Because he knows
it is the right thing to do.

378
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,583
Prepare some music for this evening,
my dear Margarete.

379
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,500
Something lively, Highness?

380
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:48,583
On the contrary.
I'm in the mood for something tender.

381
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:53,000
Thank you for leaving
the vagabond at home.

382
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:56,375
My husband bites
when he has to put on real pants.

383
00:36:56,458 --> 00:37:00,000
There's room with my Karl in Auhof,
as I've already told you.

384
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,416
I have a gift for you.

385
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,958
For your birthday.

386
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,208
Did you make this?

387
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,541
Yes, Your Majesty.

388
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,666
Thank you very much.

389
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,916
Please.

390
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:00,666
Once you get to know me,
you'll see I'm not a bad person.

391
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,333
I believe you.

392
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,375
I'm just the black sheep
of the family like you.

393
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,166
Baroness!

394
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,291
The Archduke was looking for you.
Look what he picked for you.

395
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,583
Thanks.

396
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,916
-Go!
-Yes, I'm going.

397
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,166
Let's have a toast.

398
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,958
Thank you so much
for coming to Franz Joseph's birthday,

399
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,500
which we'll celebrate together tomorrow.

400
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,000
A new year,

401
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,750
a new chapter.

402
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,458
And to you, dear Helene,

403
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:51,916
I hope we'll soon have
something big to announce.

404
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:04,833
He just gave the handkerchief back to me.
And what was that with the bird?

405
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,375
What did he mean?

406
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,875
Nothing.
He saw me this morning in the park.

407
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,333
You two spoke?

408
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,250
No.

409
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,458
Last warning, Sisi.

410
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:17,000
We have to see if the suitcases are here.

411
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:20,708
He wanted to know so little about me.
He hardly asked me anything.

412
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,833
All he wants to know is
if you're pretty and polite.

413
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:26,416
If he wants to learn,
he'll go to the library.

414
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:47,500
It's good to see you.
I feared you wouldn't make it.

415
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,208
So you wish to marry the Bavarian sheep?

416
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,708
Not a good idea?

417
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,125
Sure, it is. She is perfect for you.

418
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,166
-Not my taste. Too…
-Virtuous?

419
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,250
Predictable.

420
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,083
Tell me about your trip.

421
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,416
Everything's fine with your troops.

422
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:07,583
And our empire, Franz,

423
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,750
it is so exciting.

424
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,000
-The people are so colourful and diverse.
-I'm glad.

425
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,666
Funnily enough,
they all have one thing in common.

426
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,833
They don't like you.

427
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,208
I'm joking, Franz.

428
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,958
But, honestly, I am worried.

429
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,416
We're not well-liked.

430
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,875
Well, you're not.

431
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,458
The general opinion is
that Maman calls the shots

432
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:34,416
and you shit your pants
when the French or Prussians come.

433
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,541
I say,
"He hasn't shit his pants in years."

434
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:39,958
-Thank you. That's enough.
-They say you have no vision.

435
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,500
But what do I know?

436
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:51,958
Let me know when you need me
to dedicate another barn for you.

437
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,500
I want you to return to Vienna with me.

438
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,416
As my counsellor.

439
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,916
I need someone I can trust.

440
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:14,541
I'll think it over.

441
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,791
Are you unwell?

442
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,833
No, I'm fine.

443
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,541
What are you doing?

444
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:57,833
It was so hot,
and the floor is nice and cool.

445
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,416
It's soothing.

446
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:26,458
You're right.

447
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,125
It feels good.

448
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,041
I heard what you said to my brother.

449
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:41,875
I'm sorry.

450
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,958
Sometimes, I say exactly what I think.

451
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,125
Maybe you could teach me.

452
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,708
You have something there.

453
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:01,958
It's not mine.

454
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,041
It's braided in.

455
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,750
Whose is it?

456
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:11,250
Puck's.
So I'll never forget what he was like.

457
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:14,208
My horse.

458
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:21,208
Don't tell me I've lost my mind.

459
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:24,000
I hear that often, but I haven't lost it.

460
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:32,250
When we were little,
I knocked my brother's tooth out.

461
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:34,500
I secretly kept it.

462
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,500
Now that's completely crazy.

463
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,208
Does that still hurt?

464
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,125
No.

465
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,375
Thank you.

466
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,083
That was very interesting.

467
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,500
I assume we'll be able to announce
the engagement before we return.

468
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,125
You can begin choosing the court ladies.

469
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:30,791
I already prepared a list of candidates,
Your Imperial Highness.

470
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:33,583
But, please,
not just inexperienced birdbrains.

471
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:37,500
I think we will include
a lady from our ranks amongst them.

472
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,083
Someone with experience.

473
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,958
Very clever, Countess.

474
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,041
But not you, Margarete.

475
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,708
I still need you.

476
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:49,500
I'm looking forward
to your performance later on.

477
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:52,666
-Go on ahead.
-With pleasure, Your Imperial Highness.

478
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:11,208
I think he looks much better
than he does in this picture, don't you?

479
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:17,333
What is with you?
Are you even listening to me?

480
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,416
Yes, of course.

481
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:29,208
I can hardly wait for tomorrow to come.

482
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,916
Your Royal Highness.
If you would please follow me.

483
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,750
Me?

484
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:46,458
Her Royal Highness, the Duchess.

485
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,875
You have me called in the middle
of the night to drink champagne?

486
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,250
It is my birthday.

487
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:19,041
I wish you a happy birthday, Your Majesty.

488
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,958
I must return
before she realizes I'm gone.

489
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:27,875
Stay!

490
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:30,916
Please.

491
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:37,291
I promised not to cause
any confusion this weekend.

492
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,333
It is too late for that.

493
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,083
Can we abandon the formalities? Elisabeth?

494
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,625
That's your name, right?

495
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,666
Yes.

496
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,375
I just haven't heard it in a while.

497
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,875
You reminded me of something today.

498
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:26,208
You reminded me
of how I was before becoming Emperor.

499
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,916
So how were you back then?

500
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Alive.

501
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:46,958
No.

502
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:48,041
No!

503
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,708
You're marrying my sister.

504
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,791
That has been arranged.

505
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:01,416
But I want you.

506
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:10,250
Everyone's always told me
what to do my whole life.

507
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,958
I can't do that anymore.

508
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,750
For months I've felt dead, and…

509
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,291
But with you,

510
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,916
I suddenly want to celebrate my birthday.

511
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,041
But you don't know me.

512
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:41,041
You tell the truth when no one else will.

513
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:43,625
And…

514
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,125
you don't see things like the others.

515
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,875
I need someone like you.

516
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,125
Long may he live

517
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:20,250
Long may he live

518
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,625
Long, long, long

519
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,083
Long may he live
Long may he live

520
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,833
Long, long, long
May he live

521
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,375
What luck that our clothes came in time.

522
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:36,375
Thank you very much.

523
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,500
Thank you all for being here.
I'm very pleased.

524
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,958
I have something to announce.

525
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,375
I'd like to ask a young lady for her hand.

526
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,958
The Duchess in Bavaria…

527
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,208
Elisabeth.

528
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:08,958
No!

529
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,291
Congratulations.

530
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:38,166
Cheers.

531
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:44,208
Please wait!

532
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:46,291
Please, Helene, I didn't want this.

533
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,541
You must say no, do you hear me?

534
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:54,291
Please.

535
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,416
Please.

536
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,208
Please say no.

537
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:04,250
I've never felt anything like this.

538
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,583
Did you sneak into his bed last night
so he'd pick you?

539
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,000
-No.
-Then what happened?

540
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,166
Why would he want to have you?

541
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:20,916
You will never be able to be an empress.

542
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,833
You will ruin him.

543
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:40,250
This woman will be the empress
of the second-largest empire in Europe.

544
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:44,500
-You had your fun with your little game.
-It's not a game.

545
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,708
I thought a lot
about which woman is the right one.

546
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,208
Helene is so well-prepared.

547
00:54:57,458 --> 00:55:00,375
She won't cause you any trouble,
Your Majesty.

548
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,666
Sisi is still so…

549
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:06,916
immature.

550
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:14,500
Elisabeth or no one.

551
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:23,500
His Majesty, the Emperor.
Her Imperial Highness, the Archduchess.

552
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:33,958
Tell your aunt
that this is a misunderstanding.

553
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:35,500
Immediately.

554
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,583
Enough.

555
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:42,708
I'm not interested in what the others say.

556
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:47,541
I want to hear what you have to say.

557
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:53,541
Do you want to be the Habsburg Empress?

558
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,875
Yes.

559
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:26,333
Until we meet again.

560
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:02,333
VIENNA
AUSTRIAN EMPIRE

561
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:05,291
Your Majesty,
my congratulations on your engagement.

562
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,708
What a great change.

563
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:12,208
Much more will change, Theo.

564
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:16,208
You, an empress? Who could believe it?

565
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:20,125
This will be a lot of work.
You are lucky I know what matters.

566
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,541
Are you listening, Sisi?

567
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:25,375
Call me Elisabeth.

568
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:31,166
Do not be concerned,
Your Imperial Highness.

569
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:34,291
Even the wildest grass can be bent.

570
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:36,083
I am not concerned.

571
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:43,000
If something won't bend,
it must be broken.

572
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:14,375
Get up!

573
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:17,625
Let me go!

574
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,375
The Emperor has outlawed begging.

575
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:35,250
We're getting an empress.

576
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,125
WEDDING
FRANZ JOSEF I., ELISABETH

577
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,166
This is the chance we've waited for.

578
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,416
For the people.

579
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:53,166
For the people.
