1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,291
We'll be in Vicenza first?

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,750
Your stamina is better
than mine was in the army.

3
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,625
-Where are we going next?
-Verona, Pula, Brescia.

4
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,375
You'll like it.
Each place is more special than the next.

5
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,583
And then we'll continue on to Milan?

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,750
What's special about Milan?

7
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,416
The fabrics. They make
the most beautiful clothes in the world.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,833
You can hardly wait.

9
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,291
Yes.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,000
See you at the carriage.

11
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,416
You haven't told him
about your plans in Milan?

12
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,541
No.

13
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,791
He wouldn't understand.

14
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,750
"With the help
of his beautiful Empress Elisabeth,

15
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,083
Emperor Franz Josef intends

16
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,083
to nip the blooming
independence movement in the bud."

17
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,375
The Empress, interesting.

18
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,708
The Empress is indeed very popular
among the people of the empire.

19
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,833
They even say that this trip was her idea.

20
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,500
"The most beautiful woman
in all of Europe."

21
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,708
I'd say "medium beautiful" at most.

22
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:29,416
Your Majesty, the Austrians have oppressed
the Lombards for over a century.

23
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,750
This visit may bring
short-term improvement,

24
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,000
but it won't solve the problem.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,125
Let's meet with the Prime Minister
of the Kingdom of Piedmont.

26
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,458
-What's his name?
-The Count of Cavour.

27
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,791
He requests an audience every week.

28
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,083
He'll get one now.

29
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,458
I thought we just had to watch
Emperor Franz Josef dig his own grave.

30
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,791
I didn't think about her.

31
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,000
My little Empress.

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,958
You think you can save
Habsburg from collapse

33
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,125
with your kind heart?

34
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,458
How charming.

35
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:57,083
THE EMPRESS

36
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,333
Minister von Bach.

37
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,208
I have to hurry.
The carriages are already waiting.

38
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,375
-I just wanted to say farewell.
-Mr Minister.

39
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,916
And to give you something.

40
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,208
So you don't forget me.

41
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,375
The first time you visited me,

42
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,500
on that hot day.

43
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,791
We shared a peach,

44
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,375
and you wiped your face
with the back of your hand.

45
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,458
And I had to kiss you.

46
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,875
Thank you.

47
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,916
I think I know now
why you don't want to marry me.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,125
You need someone of higher nobility.

49
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,625
-You fear your family will reject me.
-No, that's not it.

50
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,916
I wrote a letter to your father
asking for your hand.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,208
And I invited him here.
I sent it two weeks ago.

52
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,625
No. You cannot just go over my head
and make decisions.

53
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,333
I didn't. I just wanted
to show you how serious I am.

54
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,708
Undo this.

55
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,166
Write to my father
and tell him it was a misunderstanding.

56
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,208
But why?

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,791
I serve the Empress.

58
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,458
That's why I don't want to marry.

59
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,791
What does that mean for our love?

60
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,041
Who spoke of love?

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Your Majesty.

62
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,000
Goodbye, Elisabeth.

63
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,041
Goodbye.

64
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:43,166
You and the Emperor
will have lots of time alone on this trip.

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,875
Take advantage of it.

66
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,291
And I thought we were going
to Lombardy to win the people's hearts.

67
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,333
Whatever you say.

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,000
Giddy-up!

69
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,500
Your Imperial Highness.

70
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,000
Imperial Highness, is something wrong?

71
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,833
It is just unusual

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,625
when my son leaves the palace.

73
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,458
I also prefer when it is full of people.

74
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,250
It is so quiet.

75
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,916
The advantage is
we can finally do our work undisturbed.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,875
-With pleasure, Your Imperial Highness.
-Let's begin right away.

77
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,166
Has His Majesty approved
the Cardinal's proposals for a concordat?

78
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,833
Not yet. The Emperor instructed me
to examine the Cardinal's proposals.

79
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,916
I'd like to go over my comments with you
as soon as possible, Imperial Highness.

80
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,250
You are particularly unpleasant today.

81
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,291
Has something happened?

82
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,375
Make an appointment with the Countess.

83
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,333
I hope there are no more nasty surprises.

84
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,083
Your Imperial Highness.

85
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,375
Everything is ready for Princess Sophie
to spend the coming weeks with you.

86
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,625
This is Cleo.

87
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,875
Where did you get her?

88
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,541
I took the liberty of having
some childhood mementos sent

89
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,583
from your parents' home,
Nymphenburg Palace.

90
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,333
That is very thoughtful of you, Margarete.

91
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,916
I thought you might be pleased?

92
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,333
Look.

93
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,541
The decades
could not diminish your beauty.

94
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,250
If you dislike the painting,
Your Highness, I'll have it taken away.

95
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,333
Not necessary.

96
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,291
I just haven't seen it in a long time.

97
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,666
TWO WEEKS LATER

98
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,291
"The Empress had barely exited
the carriage in Verona,

99
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:31,041
the people erupted…"
Listen to this, "…into frenzied cheering."

100
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,541
-I can't listen to this.
-But it was like that.

101
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,666
And the Prussians wrote,

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,166
"The visit to Lombardy-Venetia shows

103
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,375
a golden era awaits the Habsburgs
under Empress Elisabeth."

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,833
But I have a question for you, Elisabeth.
And don't lie.

105
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,458
This man is next to you in every picture.
Here, there.

106
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,291
He looks grumpy here at St. Mark's Square.

107
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,291
He's grinning like a child here in Verona.
Who is he?

108
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,666
A new valet?

109
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,708
They're all writing
as if I were the only important one.

110
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,791
That's not fair.

111
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,333
You can do what I can't.

112
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,458
That's a good thing.

113
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,916
I wanted to give you more time.

114
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,125
I don't want another child.

115
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,541
Not yet.

116
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,916
But I want you.

117
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,916
MILAN, AUSTRIAN PROVINCE

118
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,041
Gino.

119
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,458
What does it say there?

120
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,500
The Emperor and the Empress
are coming to Milan.

121
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,958
Everyone come to greet our Empress
and our Emperor at the station.

122
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,041
Why don't we go see them at the station?

123
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,250
Some people say Elisabeth
is different from the Emperor.

124
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,333
It could be true.

125
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,791
No.

126
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,666
Garibaldi says she's not our Empress.

127
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,916
-Hello.
-Buongiorno.

128
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,000
Stop there.

129
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,291
-How do you greet the Emperor's soldiers?
-In German.

130
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,416
Go on, you know German.
Answer them, please.

131
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,416
Buongiorno.

132
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,750
Gino!

133
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,666
How do you greet us? Go on.

134
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,458
Buongiorno!

135
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,750
Gino!

136
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:06,041
There's nothing but propaganda
in the papers, Your Majesty, believe me.

137
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,791
The majority of the Lombards
want to be free from Austrian occupation.

138
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,166
They hate the Emperor.

139
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,500
And what do you want from me,
Count of Cavour?

140
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,750
I want the Italian-speaking territories
to finally be reunited.

141
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,291
Under one flag.

142
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,458
With one identity.

143
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,166
Like France.

144
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,666
United under Piedmont's leadership,
I presume?

145
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,000
Our brothers, the Lombards,
need weapons to revolt.

146
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,000
I want to help them.

147
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,416
But our resources in the Kingdom
of Piedmont are limited.

148
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,916
Don't cry, Prime Minister.

149
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,500
What do I get in return
if France helps you?

150
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,000
The future Kingdom of Italy would be
eternally grateful for your support.

151
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,291
Is that all?

152
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,958
In Milan, Emperor Franz Josef

153
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,791
will feel Garibaldi's resistance.

154
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,375
The world will finally see
that Lombardy must be free.

155
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,041
-Everyone get in line!
-Move away! Quickly.

156
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,916
The crowd must look bigger.
Have them stand in an orderly fashion.

157
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,208
We can fit more here!
And the pretty ladies in the front!

158
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:28,583
When the Emperor and the Empress come,
everyone wave their flags!

159
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,541
Understood? Cheer and applaud!

160
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,458
When will we finally be in Milan?

161
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,583
Any moment now.

162
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,458
I've never seen
such beautiful countryside.

163
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,583
Also, our visit to Milan
is of great political importance.

164
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,750
I'd forgotten you were here too.

165
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,416
Also, Archduke Maximilian
has been invited to Milan.

166
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,083
Keep your corsage laced, Pauline.

167
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,791
He's bringing his fiancée,

168
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,333
so the Emperor will give
his consent for the wedding.

169
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,041
I'm not sure it will work

170
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,666
after all that's happened.

171
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,875
Ladies.

172
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,208
Don't be stupid, Pauline.

173
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,416
Don't lose your heart.

174
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,958
Never.

175
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,458
Or else you're as good as dead at court.

176
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,333
Or do you disagree?

177
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,250
The imperial carriage will await you at
the station and take you to Villa Monza.

178
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:39,166
This evening your brother and his guest
will also be at Viceroy Radetzky's dinner.

179
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:44,500
Thousands of people are expected
at the station to welcome Your Majesties.

180
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,208
I have something else for you.

181
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,125
I ordered it from a jeweller
in the region.

182
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,208
This kind of goldsmith work
is only found in Lombardy.

183
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,416
I thought it would be a nice gesture
to the people if you wore it now.

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,125
Elisabeth!

185
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,166
Attention!

186
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,958
His Majesty,
Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria

187
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:41,125
and Her Majesty,
Empress Elisabeth of Austria.

188
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,166
Elisabeth!

189
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,458
Your Majesty.

190
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,958
It is an honour.

191
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,250
Esteemed Field Marshal,
the pleasure is all mine.

192
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,291
General, my wife.

193
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,625
Your Majesty, welcome to Milan.

194
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,916
-Elisabeth!
-Long live the imperial couple!

195
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,625
Elisabeth!

196
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,875
Long live the imperial couple!

197
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,958
The Emperor is here. Show some hum…

198
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,375
Remember what Garibaldi said.
We won't obey, but no violence.

199
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,541
Not yet.

200
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,000
Giddy-up!

201
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,583
It seemed as if the people were forced
to wait for us there.

202
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,666
-Franz.
-I will ask General Gyulai directly.

203
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,958
He'll be able to tell me more.

204
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,541
The last thing I need now is this dinner.

205
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,583
I tried to sneak over to you
while Duchess Bransner had stepped out.

206
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,666
I think I am perfectly capable of keeping
my primal instincts under control.

207
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,833
Maybe you could teach me one day?

208
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,750
Or maybe not.

209
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:13,250
I never thought I'd ever say this,
but I can't wait to marry you.

210
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,958
If your brother doesn't agree
to the engagement soon,

211
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,875
my father will withdraw his consent.

212
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,333
Of course, he'll agree.

213
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,500
He won't believe
I'm bringing someone like you.

214
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,125
And I've initiated things with Napoleon.

215
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,958
What can go wrong?

216
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,208
Your Royal Highness,
you must get changed for dinner.

217
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,583
Your Imperial Highness.
This is a surprise.

218
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,833
Buol, what brings you here?

219
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,875
I just arrived
from the Kingdom of Piedmont.

220
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,458
The Emperor awaits my report. And you?

221
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,333
Introducing my fiancée to him.

222
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,458
Yes? How nice.

223
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,250
Don't worry.

224
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,958
I don't plan to tell on you. Not yet.

225
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,875
I don't know what there is to tell.

226
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,833
You tried to bring me into your conspiracy
and I firmly declined.

227
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:11,000
That's how you remember it?
Who will my brother believe? Me or you?

228
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,458
Do you really want
to take that chance? Tonight?

229
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,416
Before or after introducing your fiancée?

230
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,416
Your Imperial Highness.

231
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,666
Not even our mother could tell us apart.

232
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,625
Your Imperial Highness.

233
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,875
Are you skittish?

234
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,541
I just had…

235
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,583
This painting interested me. Pardon me.

236
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,958
I was aware you have a twin sister,

237
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,625
but I too couldn't say which one is you.

238
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,208
Are all of these your comments?

239
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,458
Yes.

240
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:05,291
I can't help but question
if the Cardinal's new laws are reasonable.

241
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,791
You weren't asked if they are reasonable,
just if they are feasible.

242
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,750
But it is my duty to offer
a moral assessment, if I may.

243
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,458
Leave the moral assessment to me, please.

244
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,125
"Protestants shall be barred from teaching
in schools and from all universities."

245
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,000
"Only Catholics shall be responsible
for educating our youth"?

246
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,833
-Are you not a man of steadfast faith?
-Are you not a woman of keen mind?

247
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,000
Pardon me.

248
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,166
Why are you giving
this power back to the Church?

249
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,208
The Pope assured us he'd help
get Lombardy-Venetia under control.

250
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,083
You're a lawyer.

251
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,333
Quid pro quo.

252
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,791
Pope Pius has power we can only dream of.

253
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,125
History teaches us

254
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,958
that oppressing individual religious
groups has never furthered any empire.

255
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:04,916
On the contrary.

256
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Think of the persecution of the Huguenots
or the Thirty Years' War.

257
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,416
The Thirty Years' War, for God's sake.

258
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,166
Your Imperial Highness,
I am a man of faith.

259
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,000
But this policy draft
sets us back decades.

260
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,708
You set me back decades.

261
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,958
His Imperial Highness,
Archduke Maximilian of Austria

262
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,083
and Her Royal Highness,
Marie Charlotte of Belgium.

263
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,500
-Your Majesty.
-Maximilian.

264
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,208
Your Majesty.

265
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,083
Very pleased to meet you,
Your Royal Highness.

266
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,583
Thank you so much for the invitation,
Your Majesty.

267
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,208
Your Majesty, it is an honour.

268
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,041
I am pleased too.

269
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,833
I hear you've been travelling
a lot lately.

270
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:21,375
-Yes, indeed. I love travelling.
-Marie speaks five languages fluently.

271
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,125
Even Basque.
And, honestly, who speaks Basque?

272
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,458
Most people don't even know
where it's spoken.

273
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,625
But the Princess is extremely well versed
in European history and politics.

274
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,416
-Better than I am.
-Should I marry the Princess or you?

275
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,000
Your Majesty, champagne?

276
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:36,916
Yes, please.

277
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,583
You've clearly impressed my brother a lot.

278
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,458
I've never been so impressed by a woman.

279
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,375
Dear guests, Your Majesties,

280
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,500
what an honour it is to welcome you here.

281
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,083
Dinner is served.

282
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,333
If I may.

283
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,666
Forgive me for what I just said.

284
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,166
It's all right.

285
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,916
I wanted to show him how happy I am.

286
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,166
I know.

287
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,333
And Marie, she really is…

288
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,083
-She really is special. You can see it.
-Yes.

289
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,125
And she is so different
from me in so many ways.

290
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,875
So lucid and composed, and so clever.

291
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,416
I'm happy for you, Maximilian.

292
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,875
-You honestly mean that?
-Yes.

293
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,541
Almost.

294
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,416
Almost honestly.

295
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,458
À table?

296
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,125
Yes.

297
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,958
I read in the paper that your trip
to Lombardy-Venetia

298
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,666
has been a complete success so far.

299
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,583
We had the same impression.

300
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,166
Until today.

301
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,666
Your Majesty,
I must apologise to you personally.

302
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,333
The reception you received
was unforgivable.

303
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,500
You needn't do that.

304
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,875
You cannot force something
on the people they don't feel, General.

305
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,791
Your Majesty, if I may, I believe
the Lombards don't know what they feel.

306
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,083
They are being seduced
by Cavour and Garibaldi.

307
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:48,208
Count Buol, what were the results
of your talks in Piedmont?

308
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,916
Prime Minister Cavour ensured me

309
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,333
that he has not exerted
any influence on the rebels here.

310
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,458
But he keeps agitating against us
in Europe.

311
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,541
Once Napoleon is allied with us,
Cavour will let it rest.

312
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,666
Your Majesty, we cannot be sure
that will happen…

313
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,666
Well, I'm certain.

314
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,208
It's starting all over again.

315
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,291
Over and over again.

316
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,125
The bloodshed.

317
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,708
Field Marshal?

318
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,166
We hanged everyone. Outside the city.

319
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,625
You must mean
during the revolution of 1848?

320
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,458
That was long ago, esteemed Field Marshal.

321
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,333
Don't be ridiculous!

322
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,875
I know that!

323
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:32,875
Your Majesty.

324
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,875
The Field Marshal
just celebrated his 91st birthday.

325
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:47,750
It might be time to think about his
well-deserved retirement, Your Majesty.

326
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:52,666
Either way, if the rebels take up arms,
and we have already seen some rioting,

327
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,833
we must respond with armed force.

328
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,250
I think they are taking up arms because
we aren't listening to their wishes.

329
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,500
-Your Majesty, what wishes might those be?
-Independence?

330
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,250
I agree with the Empress.
It is time to face up to the truth.

331
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,833
Lombardy would be
a tiny, vulnerable kingdom.

332
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,625
Another major power
would conquer it in weeks.

333
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,333
Absolutely. We protect Lombardy.

334
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,916
Yes, you call it protection.
I call it oppression.

335
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,833
Max…

336
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:24,458
But if we want to retain the region,
we must do something, Your Majesty.

337
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,166
The official language should be Italian.

338
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:30,875
-We should promote education, culture.
-Yes, exactly.

339
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,833
Fight poverty,
reduce our military presence,

340
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,916
and let them govern themselves.

341
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,583
-We must win over their souls.
-Yes.

342
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,125
Thank you, that's enough.

343
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,166
-But maybe…
-I decide for our empire!

344
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,458
Not him, not her.

345
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,333
I alone.

346
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,291
You can all have your ideas.

347
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,666
In the end, I bear the responsibility.

348
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,250
I'm finished.

349
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,083
Franz, one moment please.

350
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,166
You daring to express your political
opinion publicly is grotesque.

351
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,250
I've always had ideas for our
Italian-speaking provinces, you know that.

352
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:29,708
You want to distinguish yourself
in front of your companion. That is it.

353
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,041
She is my fiancée.

354
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:34,875
If I agree.

355
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:38,125
Otherwise she's nothing.

356
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,333
I had to see you again.

357
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:10,500
Do you think he'll agree
to our marriage if you act like that?

358
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,666
I don't grovel to anyone,
not even my brother.

359
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,291
You were drunk. I was embarrassed.

360
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,791
I'm sorry that you had
to find out this way, dearest.

361
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,083
But this is who I am!

362
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:25,125
I drink too much and say what I think.

363
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:30,041
If you want to back out of this,

364
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:32,458
then do it now.

365
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:41,458
Did you want to impress Elisabeth
with your little show?

366
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,083
No.

367
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,500
You will never be able to betray me.
You know that.

368
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,750
I only want you.

369
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,250
Then do something about that.

370
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,666
What happened today
bothers me as much as it does you.

371
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,333
I don't want you cutting me off like that.

372
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,375
How can you endorse his talk?

373
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,083
In front of everyone?

374
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:33,541
I agreed with him.

375
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,666
I see. Of course.

376
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,875
I totally forgot
about your political bond.

377
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,250
I have an opinion too.

378
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,416
That has nothing to do with your brother.

379
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,166
I'm done talking about it.

380
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,125
Franz, do you know what this is?

381
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,333
This is the necklace of the rebel
who died before our eyes.

382
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,500
You have his necklace?

383
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,916
-I will visit his family.
-Excuse me?

384
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,708
You will not do that.

385
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,333
I forbid it.

386
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:06,791
That's why I kept it from you.
You don't let me do things my way.

387
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,125
What do you want there?

388
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,208
He wanted to tell us something.

389
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,708
I want to listen to these people.
You obviously don't.

390
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,666
What do you think they'll say to you?

391
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,541
These people want to leave our empire!

392
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:21,916
That's all!

393
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,458
Hugging people on their doorstep.

394
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:30,083
That's not how politics work, Elisabeth.

395
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:35,250
I have to look his mother in the eyes
and tell her that we're sorry.

396
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:37,875
You're crazy.

397
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,166
Don't say that to me.

398
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,000
Never say it again.

399
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,666
I'm going to work.

400
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,583
"All three were delighted."

401
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:59,041
"The hunter skinned the wolf
and took the fur home."

402
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:02,791
"And the grandmother
ate the cake and drank the wine

403
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:06,875
that Little Red Riding Hood had brought,
then rested."

404
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,541
"Little Red Riding Hood
thought to herself,

405
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,083
'As long as I live,
I will never again leave the path

406
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,291
and run off into the woods by myself

407
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,291
if mother has forbidden it.'"

408
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,583
Anna, come on!

409
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:57,875
Your Imperial Highness.

410
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:00,000
Pardon me.

411
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:03,166
-I'll put the Princess to bed.
-Yes.

412
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,208
Yes, of course.

413
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:31,541
Keep riding to the northeast.
It is the second village.

414
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:32,583
Thanks.

415
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:35,416
Are you not afraid?

416
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,458
I am.

417
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:39,541
A little bit.

418
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,791
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

419
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,166
Let me come with you.

420
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,250
I'll come with you.

421
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,333
Your Majesty.

422
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,833
I can't stop you.

423
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,208
No one can.

424
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,791
But I won't let you ride alone either.

425
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,375
I assume you'll have thought
your plan through.

426
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:19,458
-Will you say, "Hello, I'm the Empress"?
-Of course not. I thought it all through.

427
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:37,291
Don't you think the imperial couple's
visit will promote unity in our provinces?

428
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:41,125
-You want to talk me out of the concordat.
-I will leave no stone unturned.

429
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:44,375
The imperial couple's visit might
calm things down for a moment,

430
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,791
but that alone certainly won't save us.

431
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,291
Save us from what, Your Imperial Highness?

432
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,333
The chaos.

433
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:56,375
Catholic reforms
won't save us from that either.

434
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,708
I read the Brothers Grimm
to the Princess last night.

435
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:04,666
Do you know Little Red Riding Hood?

436
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,458
You cannot be saying the Lombards
are the big bad wolf we must beware of.

437
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:12,041
No, but the Lombards weaken us.
It is like an open wound.

438
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:15,375
You're saying an injured animal
is easy prey for the wolf?

439
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,500
Exactly.

440
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,291
The Empress can go
and embrace the malcontents,

441
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,250
but someone always has
to have a weapon ready.

442
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,500
And who is the wolf?

443
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:28,666
I don't know.

444
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,333
But there is always a wolf.

445
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:46,500
I think I know which one you are,
Your Imperial Highness, if I may.

446
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:51,833
This one is you.

447
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,583
The girl looking right at the viewer.

448
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,791
You stared at it for five hours.
Don't expect a medal.

449
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,083
This girl looks like she's seen too much.

450
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:08,583
It has got late.

451
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:11,041
Don't you have train schedules to check?

452
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,166
Your Imperial Highness.

453
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,291
Excuse me.

454
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:04,958
The Tadini family?

455
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,625
Silvia!

456
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,041
Silvia!

457
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,041
Yes?

458
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,333
Hello.

459
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:22,583
I have a message
for the family of Adolfo Tadini.

460
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:24,666
From the Empress.

461
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,541
I come from the Viennese Court.

462
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,416
Gino! Where are you? I need you.

463
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,333
I'm here.

464
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:35,041
There's a woman trying to speak Italian.
She says she's from Vienna.

465
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,041
Hello.

466
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:39,916
Hello.

467
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,875
My name is Eugenia. I come from Vienna.

468
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:49,708
I have a message from the Empress
for the family of Adolfo Tadini.

469
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,500
What does she want?

470
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,125
She has a message from the Empress.

471
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,250
It's about Ado.

472
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,083
I'll get your father.
Ask them to come inside.

473
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,250
My brother is dead.

474
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:22,875
Please.

475
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,916
A visit from Vienna.

476
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,833
What an honour.

477
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:06,875
My name is Eugenia.

478
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,500
I come from Vienna
on behalf of the Empress.

479
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,833
And this is my valet.

480
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,000
I was in the former Emperor's army.

481
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,000
Lieutenant Tadini.

482
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,458
God save the Emperor.

483
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,333
Why haven't you offered them anything?
Make some coffee.

484
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,583
-Please sit down.
-Thank you.

485
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,500
I have a message from the Empress.

486
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,250
From the Empress herself?

487
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:54,875
"On 5th July, 1856,

488
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:58,291
Adolfo Tadini performed
an act of protest in the palace."

489
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,875
"While he was attempting to escape,

490
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,791
a guard shot him."

491
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,208
"That was a mistake."

492
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:15,041
"I'm convinced that Adolfo Tadini

493
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:18,416
meant no harm to me or the Emperor."

494
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:23,166
"I regret with all my heart

495
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,333
what happened to him."

496
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,375
"Elisabeth."

497
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,250
Adolfo adored the Empress.

498
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,666
Maybe you can put this at…

499
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,083
I don't know how to say tombstone.

500
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:48,875
Una lapide.

501
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:54,166
The Empress wanted you to have this.

502
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:05,708
We are very grateful.

503
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,375
But I cannot accept this money.

504
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,791
-He won't take the money.
-Why not?

505
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:17,416
He brought shame to this family.
I no longer consider him my son.

506
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,791
-He will always be my son.
-We will no longer speak of him.

507
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:25,958
-I'll speak of him whenever I wish.
-Ado wanted what was best for his country.

508
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:28,625
All the young people
following Garibaldi are crazy.

509
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,208
And your brother was too!

510
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:33,083
Don't be an idiot like him!
You see what comes of it?

511
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,500
The soldiers.

512
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,708
Just because he didn't want
to speak German.

513
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,333
He's just a child.

514
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:44,416
Look at what they did to him. Look at him.

515
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,625
Leave these people alone. Enough!

516
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Enough!

517
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,875
We are sorry. We…
We don't wish to bother you any longer.

518
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,750
Your brother was very brave.

519
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,208
He said what he believed in.

520
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,750
I will speak to the Empress.

521
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,750
She'll learn how the soldiers treat you.

522
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,875
Can you tell your mother that?

523
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,083
I don't care about politics.

524
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,666
One ruler replaces another.

525
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,583
One bloodbath follows another.

526
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,458
Do you have children?

527
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:31,750
Do I have children?

528
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:33,875
Yes.

529
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,333
Two.

530
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,958
Very young.

531
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,958
Protect your children.

532
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
Hold them as tightly as you can.

533
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,708
My children?

534
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:53,208
Protect them.

535
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,333
Thank you.

536
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,333
Without you, I wouldn't have seen that.

537
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:38,291
Who are those two?

538
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,666
They're from the Viennese Court.

539
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,125
One of the Empress's court ladies.

540
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:44,375
Here because of Ado.

541
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,041
Maybe Ado was right.

542
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:50,125
Maybe she could be our hope.

543
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,666
I saw the Empress.
She was a helpless little girl.

544
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,958
She won't help us, Gino.

545
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:56,666
We have to help Lombardy ourselves.

546
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,125
-Hit it to me.
-Very good.

547
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,375
Yes. No.

548
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,208
Excellent.

549
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,416
Here. Yes.

550
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:29,625
Your Majesty?

551
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,083
I must speak to you.

552
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,666
I tried to forget what you did.

553
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,833
But I can't.

554
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:46,791
I've asked for forgiveness so many times.

555
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,750
I wanted you to see me, Franz.

556
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:49,791
No.

557
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:52,875
You wanted her.

558
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:55,291
She was the only one who didn't judge me.

559
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,250
Did you want the throne?

560
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,916
Or did you want to be seen?

561
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,875
All I know is
I will survive without the throne.

562
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,958
But I miss my brother.

563
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:15,666
Every day.

564
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,625
I can't forget what you did.

565
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,750
But I have to forgive you.

566
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,750
Because it's eating me up inside.

567
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,166
And Marie? Do you love her?

568
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,291
With all my heart.

569
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,458
Then marry her.

570
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:10,791
Could you imagine living in this villa?

571
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,250
-Of course.
-Would you like to live here with me?

572
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,083
Why should I live
in the old Viceroy's villa?

573
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:21,166
-Because you will marry the Viceroy.
-Old man Radetzky? He's 112.

574
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:25,958
You will be the new Viceroy?

575
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,208
And my brother agreed to the marriage.

576
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,083
Your Highness.

577
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,125
This is just the beginning.

578
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,500
You and I, Maximilian,

579
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,916
we can be something great.

580
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,541
Anna! Run home, don't turn around.

581
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,583
-Sophie!
-Run!

582
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,458
I bet you're glad to be returning home.

583
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,875
I'm glad that I can bring
you back in one piece.

584
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,375
I was really worried yesterday.

585
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:29,333
With some things, it's worth listening
to your heart and not your head.

586
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,375
No going it alone,
no unreasonable actions.

587
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:44,333
Unreasonable actions only on Tuesdays.
I promise.

588
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:48,708
I left military power
in General Gyulai's hands for now.

589
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,125
But…

590
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,208
who ultimately has the final word?

591
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:58,958
You look after the people.
He takes care of security.

592
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,500
We need both.

593
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,208
Work together.

594
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,625
I'm counting on you.

595
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:12,750
Thank you.

596
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:17,500
I know you played a role in the Emperor
giving Maximilian this chance.

597
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,416
Take care of Maximilian.

598
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:23,291
-He is more vulnerable than he lets on.
-On the contrary.

599
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,041
I think he has been
underestimated all his life.

600
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:27,458
Royal Highness.

601
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,208
It was a great pleasure.

602
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,291
Giddy-up!

603
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,708
Your Majesty.

604
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:34,625
Your Majesty.

605
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,125
Your Majesty.

606
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:49,875
You're back.

607
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:05,291
My darling.

608
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,791
Mummy!

609
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:10,125
I won't leave you alone any more.

610
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:11,666
Hello.

611
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:22,458
"The Emperor names his brother,
Maximilian of Austria,

612
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:25,208
the new Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia."

613
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:28,666
"This could finally silence
the resistance movement."

614
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:33,125
Damn.

615
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:36,041
