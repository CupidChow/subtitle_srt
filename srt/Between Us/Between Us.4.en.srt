1
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,830
Do you think...

2
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,580
what kind of a person he is
...Hia Win?

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,580
He looks mean.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,970
Sometimes, he looks calm.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,430
What's the matter?

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,009
And who are you?

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,970
Why do you have the right
to be worried about me?

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
It's okay.

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,990
Everything's okay.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
T-rex, you go to different way from me!

11
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,020
Hia Win.

12
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,960
What's up?

13
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,900
Can I have a hug?

14
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,700
I miss you!

15
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,780
Teach me my homework please.

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,760
Always!

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,990
Running to Win every time
there's an exam.

18
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,500
Cause he's not home that often.

19
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,920
Plus you cannot teach me.

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,930
Don't know shit.

21
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,030
You stupid kid!

22
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,160
Enough.

23
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,270
Look at him.

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,270
Hia, you are a grown ass man now.

25
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,030
Why're you still fighting with him?

26
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,230
You're a grown ass man.

27
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,500
Grown ass man. Grown ass man. Blahhh.

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,530
Wiew.

29
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,560
You too. Don't provoke him.

30
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,300
I'll be on mute for a sec.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,650
Even I am a grown ass man,

32
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,790
you're still his baby brother.

33
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,190
Haha!
A stupid baby brother.

34
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,820
You stupid!

35
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,560
You're also stupid!

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,030
You stupid!

37
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,660
You're also stupid!

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,329
Enough. Enough.

39
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,620
Both of you.

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,720
He started first.

41
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,210
Wiew.

42
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,329
Go study in my room.

43
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,980
I'll follow you in a bit.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,000
Fine.

45
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,110
I don't wanna be with Hia Waan anymore.

46
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,220
So sick of him.

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,650
Like I'm not so sick of you.

48
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,720
Eww.

49
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,650
Smell so dumb around here.

50
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,650
Did you chew some grass
and didn't wash your face?

51
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,970
What about you? Did you poop and didn't wash?
Stink!

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,180
Duhh.

53
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,160
You...

54
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,790
you fight with him like
you guys are the same age.

55
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,190
And how's the family?

56
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,970
I've been pretty busy with the club.
Haven't been back much.

57
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,980
Pretty much the same.

58
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,470
In terms of what?

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,410
Pressuring me the same.

60
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,000
It's never enough for them
whatever I do.

61
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,480
Hia.

62
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,750
You better graduate and come help us.

63
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,960
Maybe if their favorite runs the business,
dad would be more proud.

64
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,870
Bro...

65
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,400
Us three siblings, there's no one better than the others.

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,910
Did you forget our rule?

67
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,980
The rule that you made it up yourself
and believe it yourself?

68
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,230
Yeah.

69
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,970
You know that I'm not the kind of person
who sweat the small stuff.

70
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,410
Just relax.

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,170
You too.

72
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,970
Always worry about other people.
You should let it go sometimes.

73
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,170
Yeah.

74
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,520
If there's anything I could help, just tell me.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,980
Even I haven't graduated, I also can help.

76
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,730
Working is not fun.

77
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,659
If you have the chance to live you life, then do it.

78
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,470
Work is not going anywhere.
You should let it go sometimes.

79
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,920
Sure.

80
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,970
I'll go check on Wiew in my room then.

81
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,970
Be careful.
Don't let your kindness hurt yourself.

82
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,070
Waan.

83
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,150
Win.

84
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,900
Wiew.

85
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,050
Sounds so familiar.

86
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,910
Like I've heard of it somewhere.

87
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,490
Come on T-rex. Let's continue.

88
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,920
Come at me bro!

89
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,590
Come on!

90
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,590
Lately, you've been busy at the uni?

91
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,370
You rarely come home.

92
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,270
Yeah. A bit.

93
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,750
We're having open house soon.

94
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,490
Oh.

95
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,540
You can go check it out.

96
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,409
You might get the idea of what you wanna study further.

97
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,520
We can choose too?

98
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,180
What do you mean?

99
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,980
Well...

100
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,390
I saw you and Hia Waan study business.

101
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,790
After you guys graduate,
you both have to work for the family.

102
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,990
So I thought
I might have to go on the same path.

103
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,850
Do you ever give it a thought?

104
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,940
About what you wanna study?

105
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,760
Not really.

106
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,830
I thought I had to be like you guys.

107
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,130
Whatever you wanna be.
Just something that you wanna study.

108
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,640
About the family business,

109
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,340
leave it to me and Waan to handle.

110
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,050
I wanna help.

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,980
I can help.

112
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,750
Um.

113
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,900
I'm not gonna stop you,
if you wanna help.

114
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,990
But I just don't want you to give up on your dreams.

115
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,290
Don't want anybody to force you to do this and that.

116
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,990
Understand?

117
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,450
Understood.

118
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,430
Hey.

119
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,110
And how's the school?

120
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,050
Lots

121
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,960
of

122
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,880
girls!

123
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,930
I asked about the academic stuff. Not girls.

124
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,200
Just a little.

125
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,830
I'm fine with the girls stuff.

126
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,330
You don't have to rush things.

127
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,940
Got it?

128
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,300
Got it sir.

129
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,280
I understood.

130
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,280
Just talking.

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,340
More than friends tiny bit more.

132
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,940
More than friends?

133
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,550
What do you mean?

134
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,760
More is more, Hia.

135
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,659
Like...

136
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,030
when I eat with her,

137
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,980
it tastes better than eating with friends.

138
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,540
That special?

139
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,780
For real, Hia!

140
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,990
Or when I go see a movie,

141
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,909
it's more fun than watching with friends.

142
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,659
Or when I talk to her,

143
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:54,000
I would be super happy more than talking to other people.

144
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,470
You're so precocious.

145
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,200
Hey!

146
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,870
You asked me!

147
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,980
And...

148
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,650
are you spending a night here?

149
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,070
No.

150
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,090
What? Why?

151
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,620
You are rarely home.

152
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,940
And don't even spend a night with me.

153
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,390
I will stay for dinner though.

154
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,430
Okay?

155
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,370
Sure.

156
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,450
And...

157
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,990
do you get it?

158
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,000
Get what?

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,970
About the more than friends thing.

160
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,570
You don't have to think much Hia.

161
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,000
More than friends
is just different than others.

162
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,870
Better do my homework.

163
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,280
You friend

164
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,040
is probably not coming, I guess?

165
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,850
I already finished.

166
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,000
Tired already.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,140
What are you tired of?

168
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,140
I'm doing it alone.

169
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,820
You were playing.

170
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,130
Or it's really like people in the class say.

171
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,340
I think so.

172
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,540
Yeah.

173
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,140
I agree.

174
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,990
What do people in the class say?

175
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,120
You don't know?

176
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,130
Everyone says that...

177
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,900
he never works.

178
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,580
True.

179
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,430
Especially group work,

180
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,760
he never helps even more.

181
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,330
Yeah.

182
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,930
And today,

183
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,970
we all agree to work on it

184
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,060
- and he hasn't showed up.
- Right.

185
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,510
Did you text him to let him know?

186
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,140
Whether he's coming or not?

187
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,280
He didn't say anything.

188
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,140
Hey!

189
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,410
But when I invited him to pair up,

190
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,320
he told me that he wanted to work on his own.

191
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,970
He doesn't wanna be anyone's burden.

192
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,330
But it's just me that insist him to be in our group.

193
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,570
There see!

194
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,000
Then you do it. Work on it by yourself.

195
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,610
- Did you order Grab? (food delivery app)
- No I did not.

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,620
What? And who did?

197
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,580
I'm sorry Bee.

198
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,990
The set was delayed.

199
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,600
That's fine, Prince. Come on in.

200
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,590
A bit messy in here.

201
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,540
Oh!

202
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,390
Prince.

203
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,470
This is A.

204
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,710
This is Sea.

205
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,600
Guys. This is Prince.

206
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,550
I'm so sorry I'm late.

207
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,740
Here I brought you guys some snacks.

208
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,730
It's okay.

209
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,870
I told you that he is a nice guy.

210
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,770
- Yeah.
- You were talking nonsense.

211
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,860
Wait.

212
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,460
Your name is...

213
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,550
A.

214
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,670
Bee.

215
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,970
and Sea?

216
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,170
You guys' names fit together perfectly.

217
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,060
Yeah. And where are we on the project?

218
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,970
I will work on the rest of it myself.

219
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,070
Sure it's almost complete.

220
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,270
Be my guest.

221
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,100
Then...

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,930
I'm not gonna hold myself.

223
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,250
Sure. Eat up.

224
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,000
I choose first.

225
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,700
I wanted that one.

226
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,610
Which one?

227
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,230
Don't take it.

228
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,230
There you already grabbed it.

229
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,980
I'm trying to be supportive.

230
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,270
Hia.

231
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,960
Why?

232
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,080
What do you think am I going to give you?

233
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,540
Nothing.

234
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,960
Thank you for the support.

235
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,870
I'm gonna go train now.

236
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,560
Done!

237
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,090
Wow!

238
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,060
- You're really good at researching.
- Yeah.

239
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,990
Yeah.

240
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,560
We're done.

241
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,390
Shall we go?

242
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,370
Let's go. What are we waiting for?

243
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,190
Hey.

244
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,070
A and I will go home then.

245
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,310
And...

246
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,530
what about you, Prince?
How are yo going back?

247
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,510
Do you want us to drop you off somewhere?

248
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,470
That's fine.

249
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,580
The van from the set will come pick me up.

250
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,980
Haaa?

251
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,350
Why are you so shocked?

252
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,090
It's evening already.

253
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,990
You still have to work?

254
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,610
Yeah.

255
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,980
It's totally normal. I'm already used to it.

256
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,110
Thanks for letting me be in your group.

257
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,310
Without you guys, I'd be struggling.

258
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,570
Yeah let's go guys.

259
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,790
Go home.

260
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,250
Go!

261
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,830
Go.

262
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,330
Now kicking us out.

263
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,490
Go go.

264
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,990
Don't forget your laptop.

265
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,150
Gather all your stuff before you leave.

266
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,370
All your stuff

267
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,430
are snacks huh?

268
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,430
Done.

269
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,950
See you.

270
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,390
Go.

271
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,880
Pushing us away much?

272
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,630
This is yours.

273
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,230
Bye bye.

274
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,510
Yeah bye.

275
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,070
See you.

276
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,980
Bye bye, Prince. See you.
- Bye bye.

277
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,830
Bye bye.

278
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,980
I'll just rest for 5 mins.

279
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,410
Sweet dream.

280
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,630
Who's that?

281
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,980
Can I spend a night with you?

282
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,940
Um.

283
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,970
You can come to this room whenever you want.

284
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,950
Team.

285
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,980
Team!

286
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,450
Hmm.

287
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,470
Can I have 10 more mins, mom.

288
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,170
I'm not your mommy.

289
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,630
Wake up! Let's have breakfast.

290
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,310
Umm.

291
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,050
Get up. Come on.

292
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,330
Let's go eat.

293
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,390
Smells good.

294
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,090
Yeah when it comes to food,
you're suddenly interested.

295
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,950
Go.

296
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,600
Go eat your breakfast.

297
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,870
Wow.

298
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,120
Why're you so excited?

299
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,150
Just the sunny side up, sausages, and bacon.

300
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,610
It's the over-easy, Hia.

301
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,970
Like...

302
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,150
Apart from my mom and Pharm,

303
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,210
there's also you that make
the perfect egg in the way that I like.

304
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,750
What about other things?

305
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,990
What other things?

306
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,720
The other things I did it for you...

307
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,970
Don't you like it?

308
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,580
Hey hey calm down!

309
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,130
I meant...

310
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,520
The sausages

311
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,140
and bacon that I cooked for you.

312
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,530
Do you like it?

313
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,490
Alright then.

314
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,150
What were you thinking, naughty boy?

315
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,090
Mmmm.

316
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,350
Yummy.

317
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,070
When you're done eating,

318
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,530
let's go do grocery with me.

319
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,310
No, I'm lazy.

320
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,980
I'll buy you snacks.

321
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,830
Nah.

322
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,390
Lunch also. How's that?

323
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,430
Nah.

324
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,030
10 chips?

325
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,640
How about...

326
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,950
A giant bucket of popcorn

327
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,630
and...

328
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,150
watch a movie together tonight?

329
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,150
Deal!

330
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,530
Hop on. Hurry up.

331
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,410
Are you sure I'm gonna be safe?

332
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,590
You rode with me before.

333
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,470
I was drunk. Doesn't count.

334
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,990
Let's just take my car, Hia.

335
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,210
Hey!

336
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,980
Trust me.

337
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,750
Come on.

338
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,970
Please ride slowly.

339
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,510
If you're afraid,
then hang on tight.

340
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,450
So you wouldn't fall.

341
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,990
Why did you have to weave your way through like that?

342
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,980
Why are you complaining so much?

343
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,980
Go.

344
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,280
Let's go.

345
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,450
Hia.

346
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,860
Hmm?

347
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,250
I'm already hungry.

348
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,430
Can we eat first before go shopping?

349
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,460
You digested all your breakfast?

350
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,640
I would say that was a quick bite.

351
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,060
I don't count that as a breakfast.

352
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,010
What?

353
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,070
Yeah.

354
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,270
I'm hungry, Hia.

355
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,040
You said you're gonna buy me food.

356
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,450
Or...

357
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,510
you're breaking your promise.

358
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,200
Fine. We'll go eat then.

359
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,570
Go!

360
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,310
Let's eat.

361
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,290
Such a food fighter.

362
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,700
"SALAD FACTORY"

363
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,010
Wow.

364
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,450
Hia.

365
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,810
Stop what you're thinking.

366
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,990
Ughh.

367
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,530
You're older, you should sacrifice for your brother.

368
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,790
It's the rule of my male-only household.

369
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,290
There's no sacrifice.

370
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,670
We're all equal.

371
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,390
Not softy at all.

372
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,680
Why do I have to be soft?

373
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,230
All the girls

374
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,230
love soft and gentle guys.

375
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,550
Nice guy.

376
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,910
Don't you know?

377
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,950
Not necessary.

378
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,370
Here.

379
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,410
I don't want any girls to like me.

380
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,300
I want someone around here to like me.

381
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,190
Hmm?

382
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,390
Can I have more?

383
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,170
Want some more?

384
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,270
Yeah.

385
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,430
Just this one.

386
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,440
Shrimps here are so good!

387
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,930
Here.

388
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,900
Got some more?

389
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,620
"Tops"

390
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,610
Are you gonna eat all this alone?

391
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,070
Who is this?

392
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,600
This is Team.

393
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,330
It'll be gone by tomorrow.

394
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,420
Yeah.

395
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,290
Thought you wanted to do some grocery.

396
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,470
I haven't seen you buy anything.

397
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,070
I'll.

398
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,080
I have to.

399
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,850
I'm just...

400
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,980
waiting for you to finish buying the snacks first.

401
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,630
Oh.

402
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,250
Ok.

403
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,440
- Hia?
- Hmm?

404
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,590
Can we go get something from there?

405
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,830
Still want more?

406
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,810
Yes more.

407
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,290
Can you pass me the tape?

408
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,030
Okay.

409
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,270
We'll...

410
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,410
draw the line first then follow with the cut.

411
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:26,910
Okay?

412
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,560
Let's clear the stage.
The casts will rehearse now.

413
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,250
Chop chop.

414
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,220
Wrap it up please.

415
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,310
The casts please come up.

416
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,210
I though joining drama club, we'd get to perform.

417
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,070
What can we do?
We're not as pretty as them.

418
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,080
But...

419
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,020
the scene and decorations are also important.

420
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,200
Without them,

421
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,970
their performance wound't be complete, right?

422
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,470
And when the audience see,

423
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,690
how are they going to know

424
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,960
that this piece is made by Manow?

425
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,560
or the props over there are set by me?

426
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,540
At the end, people would only

427
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,830
notice actors, woulnd't they?

428
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,850
This industry is so unfair.

429
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,250
How's it going?

430
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,520
Soooo tired.

431
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,990
The set is very beautiful. The sky that you told me

432
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,510
you will propose to your senior, right?
They look incredible.

433
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,620
Just only looking straight.
You will found a yummy lunch.

434
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,060
Just only one person recognize and

435
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,300
love what we did

436
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,130
that's more than enough.

437
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,510
You guys don't have to feel bad.

438
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,930
We've done a very good job.

439
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,930
But I gotta go.

440
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,000
Bye bye.

441
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,490
Bye bye.

442
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,340
How was it?
Are you hungry?

443
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,490
A lot!

444
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,220
Let's go.

445
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
Woahh that's a lot.
Here, let me help.

446
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,800
Let's go eat.

447
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,490
Thank you.

448
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,930
And...are you done clearing the documents for the club?

449
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,600
Yeah.

450
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,470
Err...

451
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,440
You haven't eaten anything since this morning right?

452
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,980
I'm actually...on a diet.

453
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,070
Here.

454
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,760
Fill yourself up.

455
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,630
You know me.

456
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,070
Thank you.

457
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,620
Let's eat the fruits.

458
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,450
Looks so good.

459
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,960
Err...

460
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,320
Don't you wanna try casting
for some work outside of uni?

461
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,420
I can't compete with my friends

462
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,860
even in the uni.

463
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,470
Casting in the real world would be even worse.

464
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,960
Don't let university
be the bar to judge yourself.

465
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,470
This is only the first step of your dream.

466
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,380
The first step and I already fail.

467
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,790
Did you know

468
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,530
that before I become a swimming athlete.

469
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,050
It was not easy.

470
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,580
I had to practice more than other people.

471
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
Train more than other people.

472
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,020
I used to feel discouraged just like you.

473
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,310
Really?

474
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,990
I though this kinda thing is a talent.

475
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,690
Not really.

476
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,960
Some times an item with the same price,

477
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,130
some people

478
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,420
have enough money to buy it

479
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,420
some people

480
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,420
have to work so hard

481
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,650
to earn enough money to buy it.

482
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,200
Do you understand what I mean?

483
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,910
I do.

484
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,150
Even it's more difficult than other people,

485
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,780
but that doesn't mean you don't have the chance.

486
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,860
I will be one of the people

487
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,370
who's waiting for your success.

488
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,580
Thank you P'Phruek.

489
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,670
For both...

490
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,470
lunch and

491
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,850
the support.

492
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,380
Fighting!

493
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,220
Fighting!.

494
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,380
Num num num.

495
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,620
But on a second thought,

496
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,970
I don't want you to become an actress anymore.

497
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,530
What?

498
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,530
Why?

499
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,910
Well...

500
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,670
if you became famous,

501
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,160
we wouldn't be having lunch like this anymore.

502
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,330
But...

503
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,290
Between dating you now

504
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,360
and dating when you're famous

505
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,960
which one is more difficult?

506
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,420
Dating?

507
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,620
Um.

508
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,510
Dating.

509
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,090
Err...

510
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,510
Dating me when I'm famous

511
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,670
could be...

512
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,070
more difficult.

513
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,160
Tiny bit more.

514
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,990
Then I'll have to speed up my game then?

515
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,000
Be prepared please.

516
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,870
Bring it on!

517
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,960
I'm ready!

518
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,490
Let's do it!

519
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,250
Congrats!

520
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,250
Eat. Let's eat.

521
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,160
On me.

522
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,110
What?

523
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,110
I bought you these.

524
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,310
I'll just borrow it. I'll pay you back.

525
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,360
Let's have one chicken each. Cheers!

526
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,360
Is this a reality?

527
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,530
Is this real?

528
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,490
You're not lying?

529
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:01,530
No.

530
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,130
I can't believe it!

531
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,250
It's not true.

532
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,980
Don't you like watching movie in the cinema?

533
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,670
On the app is better.

534
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,870
You can just turn on the A/C.

535
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,420
Laying in your room.

536
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,620
You don't like that?

537
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,950
I like it.

538
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,600
But I was just wondering.

539
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,050
People like to watch movies in the cinema in general.

540
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,470
I prefer iQIYI more.

541
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,090
Lots of movies for you to choose.

542
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,460
And it's free.

543
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,270
VIP is only a few Baht.

544
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Yeah yeah.

545
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,090
Up to you.

546
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,440
Hop on.

547
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,510
Can you hold one bag?

548
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,360
It's over, the coolness of my bike.

549
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,250
Next time just drive here.

550
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,090
Hey.

551
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,620
You don't like horror movies?

552
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,710
I'm fine.

553
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,710
Shit!

554
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,530
Is it gone?

555
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,200
It's gone.

556
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,620
Are you sure?

557
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,200
If you lie to me...

558
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,180
I'll beat you.

559
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,070
It's really gone, Hia.

560
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,470
Turn around.
Open you eyes and watch it.

561
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,820
The ghost is really gone.

562
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,620
See.

563
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,940
It's gone.

564
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,780
See? I told you.

565
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,560
What are you laughing at?

566
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,870
Damn it!

567
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,000
My coolness.

568
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,020
My secret.

569
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,160
You're so funny.

570
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,330
If you dare to tell anyone about this,

571
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,000
I'll hunt you down.

572
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,050
I won't.

573
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,580
I'll keep it for my self to laugh.

574
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,290
Even more satisfied that way.

575
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,690
Oh Hia,

576
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,600
and those

577
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,500
animations like Conan,

578
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,470
are you afraid of dead bodies from those shows?

579
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,990
That's too stupid, if I do.

580
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,970
Hia.

581
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
What?

582
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,800
What about...

583
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,360
-This.
- Hey!

584
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,690
Woah! Hia stop.

585
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,880
I was just joking.

586
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,020
I'm kidding.

587
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,360
I'm kidding, Hia.

588
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,850
Let's watch something else.

589
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,330
No more horror movies.

590
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,390
More than friends?

591
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,980
What exactly is it?

592
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,560
More is just more, Hia.

593
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,080
Like...

594
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,480
when I eat with her,

595
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,610
it tastes better than eating with friends.

596
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,360
That special?

597
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,040
For real, Hia!

598
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,240
Or when I go see a movie,

599
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,190
it's more fun than watching with friends.

600
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,050
Or when I talk to her,

601
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,870
I would be super happy.

602
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,380
Something like that.

603
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,960
More special than others.

604
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,070
What are you smiling at?

605
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,510
I'll go tell Dean.

606
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,270
Don't!

607
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,200
I won't then.

608
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,430
I'll tell Manow instead.

609
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,650
Ow! Hia no.

610
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,200
I'll tell everyone.

611
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,070
I'll tell Manow.

612
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,070
- Pharm, P'Dean, Phruek.
- Team!

613
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,280
Are you used to it now?
Riding my bike.

614
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,420
I am.

615
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,010
If you do not weave through other cars.

616
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,290
I don't know how many times
I almost laid on the ground.

617
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,500
Did you know that?

618
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,430
I won't let anything happen to you.

619
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,180
That' why!

620
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,730
People said the girls in the uni

621
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,540
like you a lot.

622
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,980
How is that relevant?

623
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,510
You're so charming.

624
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,620
Probably talk like this
with whoever rides with you, right?

625
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,350
And why is that my fault?

626
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,100
I have to make sure
whoever rides with me is safe, right?

627
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,730
Team.

628
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,490
Did you ride with him here?

629
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,960
Yeah bro.

630
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,990
Don't know how many trucks we almost laid underneath.

631
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,380
I was so stiff
until I have a cramp on my legs.

632
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,460
I know

633
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,380
that one day you'll eat your own words.

634
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,580
But I didn't think it would be this soon.

635
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,220
Just a little fact.

636
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,530
Don't have to look like
you're gonna kill me.

637
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,200
I'm gonna go now.

638
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,610
Oh and I'll be at the club this evening.

639
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,170
See you.

640
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:29,930
Yeah.

641
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,420
Hia.

642
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,200
What did he mean?

643
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,250
Nothing.

644
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,440
Like you said.

645
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,560
I might say things like that with everyone.

646
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,090
But this seat here,

647
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,990
apart from Wiew, my little brother

648
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,510
you're the firs one who gets to ride.

649
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,620
More like good for those who never get to ride.

650
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,980
They don't have to risk their lives like me.

651
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,400
I only let people ride with me.

652
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,850
when they're ready to risk.

653
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,730
See you at the club.

654
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:21,850
Um.

655
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,960
Thank you for the ride.

656
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,700
I can see that.
Your ears are turning red.

657
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,110
Hia!

658
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,510
I gotta go!

659
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,220
Here I am.

660
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,380
- This is for Pharm.
- Thank you so much.

661
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,710
This is mine.

662
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,130
Cheers!

663
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:10,820
Ughhhh.

664
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
What is it?

665
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,020
Gas is so expensive lately, don't you think?

666
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,780
That's why you have to ride a bike here.

667
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,780
It's just the same way.

668
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,600
Carpooling is not a big of a deal.

669
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,200
Was it P'Win just now?

670
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:26,490
Yeah.

671
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,460
And how come you guys come to uni together?

672
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,560
We live in the same dorm.

673
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,560
Oh I remember now.

674
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,310
P'Dean told me that.

675
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,510
Humph!

676
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,250
You always mention P'Dean.

677
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,380
Probably

678
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,110
close to him more than anyone in the club already.

679
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,070
That's enough. Stop it.

680
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,070
Please stop teasing me about this.

681
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,380
When you don't know what to do,
you're always like this.

682
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
Manow.

683
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,310
P'Dean hi.

684
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,360
Hello.

685
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,480
I went to get some stuff in the car

686
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,200
and found this left in there.

687
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,330
Is this yours?

688
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,600
Oh.

689
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,570
Yes it is.

690
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,980
Thank you so much P'Dean.

691
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,820
Actually...

692
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,210
you can just call me to go get from the car myself.

693
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,020
You don't have to come all the way here.

694
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,080
I thought you might suddenly need to use it.

695
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,850
I'll get going then.

696
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,380
Enjoy your class.

697
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,980
Thank you.

698
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,850
- Good bye P'Dean.
- Um.

699
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,960
Yeahh.

700
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,970
Hmm.

701
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,890
What?

702
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:43,000
Team's story is kinda make sense cause they live in the sam place,

703
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,020
but I heard that Dean lives at home, isn't he?

704
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,110
And what did you do Pharm?

705
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,250
How come your handouts are in his car?

706
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,000
Huh, Pharm?

707
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,400
I didn't do anything.

708
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,090
Dean went to eat at my place.

709
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,090
I just asked him to drop me off here.

710
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh okay.

711
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,160
What!!?

712
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,510
Breakfast in your room?

713
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,770
- You guys are in your room together already?
- No.

714
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,050
We just had vreakfast together. That’s all.

715
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,050
Nothing more than that.

716
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:12,960
Believe me.

717
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,560
Team.

718
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,220
Manow.

719
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,890
I’m going to the class.

720
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:19,850
Huh?

721
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,220
That’s not normal.

722
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,480
-Normal.
-Very abnormal.

723
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,070
We’ll be late.

724
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,530
The professor will complain.

725
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,760
Let’s go to class.

726
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,800
Okay okay.

727
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,250
You have to tell us first.

728
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,490
What did you guys do in your room?

729
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,560
Pharm!

730
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,960
You’ve got a secret to your friends?

731
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,490
There’s an open house at the end of the month.

732
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,070
Also the exam coming up.

733
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,420
We’ve got 3 months to train before the qualifying.

734
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,450
I think…

735
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,490
I need you you help manage training schedule

736
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,820
and have Tul help you out.

737
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,560
Um.

738
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,990
Where have you been, Dean?

739
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,200
Went to get some stuff in the car.

740
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,410
You’ve disappeared quite often lately.

741
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,880
Show up late.

742
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,490
Go back early in the evening also.

743
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:21,840
F*ck off

744
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,980
Hey!

745
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,980
Erm…

746
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,560
If our club performs really well,

747
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
we’ll get more funds next year.

748
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:35,890
Oh Dean.

749
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,510
Did you tell them?

750
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,130
That if they perform well,

751
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,000
they’ll be rewarded with a special trip.

752
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,840
I already talked to my family.

753
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,500
My resort at Kanchanaburi is also available.

754
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,490
I’ll give you special discount.

755
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,970
I think that’s good.

756
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,000
I’ll inform them then.

757
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,340
Oh.

758
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,440
Win.

759
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,490
If we get to go to Kanchanaburi,

760
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,390
can we bring an external party?

761
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,530
Who’s the external party?

762
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,670
Who is it Mr.president?

763
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,050
Seriously.

764
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,200
I'm asking you for real.

765
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,310
Pharm?

766
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,710
If we bring one more,

767
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,570
all rooms will be perfectly divided.

768
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,420
Let's bring him.

769
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,660
Then...

770
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,550
For his expense,

771
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,490
It'll be on me.

772
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,410
Are you guys like together?

773
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,820
Not yet.

774
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,990
Even not officially together,
you're head over heels like this.

775
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,580
What's it gonna be like if you really are?

776
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,920
What about you?

777
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,490
I saw that kid from the club

778
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,370
riding with you today.

779
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,760
To be honest,

780
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,970
I don't want anyone to be relationship
with people in the club.

781
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,820
But it's you....

782
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,560
I trust you.

783
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,490
So what is it then?

784
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,500
You know that

785
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,790
whenever I date anyone,
I only date that one person.

786
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,490
Never double-dating.

787
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,970
Why are you saying that?

788
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,440
Are you serious with this one?

789
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,020
I don't know.

790
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,220
Right now,

791
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,920
You're very fond of Team
more than anyone.

792
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,190
If you're not gonna be serious with him,

793
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,550
don't make him fall for you even more.

794
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,550
- I'm not--
- But if you're serious,

795
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,470
please make it clear.

796
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,510
If you don't intend to,

797
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,970
don't give anyone's hope.

798
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,240
I never meant it to be that way.

799
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,070
I know.

800
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,980
that you don't intend to do that.

801
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,990
But your behaviors...

802
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,450
look like you do.

803
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,600
I already had sex with him.

804
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,130
Our relationship

805
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,000
started that way.

806
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,210
You started that way.

807
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,870
And how is it gonna end?

808
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,980
I don't know,

809
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,980
but whatever we have right now it already good.

810
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,490
And...

811
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,510
whatever you have right now is what exactly is it?

812
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,380
I don't know how I really feel at the moment.

813
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,620
I'm not fond of him

814
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,090
just because we slept together before.

815
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,330
But I do feel good about him.

816
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,330
I wanna get to know him better.

817
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,200
I wanna support him with things that he loves.

818
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,470
And...

819
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:52,910
I also care about him.

820
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,380
I worry whether he could sleep at night or not.

821
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,550
Have he eaten?

822
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,020
What is he doing?

823
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,980
Love.

824
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,180
The feeling that you're having.

825
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,200
It's called love.

826
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,970
You sigh for more than 10 times already.

827
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,390
Did you count?

828
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,420
Why don't you go home right after class?

829
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:47,450
Well...

830
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,900
I was baking happily at the club.

831
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,350
I was about to go home

832
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,850
but someone

833
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,850
called me to be here.

834
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,760
It's good for you.

835
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,090
That you know what makes you happy.

836
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,560
What's wrong?

837
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,560
You're not making any sense, Team.

838
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:12,310
Pharm.

839
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,160
What does love feel like?

840
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,180
What do you mean?

841
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,290
I mean...

842
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,760
What makes you realize

843
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,980
that whatever you feel is really love?

844
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,780
Maybe how it's special.

845
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,050
You feel like that person is more special than others.

846
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,800
You're happy when you're near that person.

847
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,820
You're in a good mood when you see their smiles.

848
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,650
Sometimes,

849
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,980
you wanna do things for them.
Make it special more than others

850
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,070
Like what you made for Dean, isn't it?

851
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,290
And...

852
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,510
was the Luk Choup

853
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,590
difficult to make?

854
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,260
Do you want me to continue or not?

855
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,070
Yes, dad.

856
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,420
Wanna be with them a lot.

857
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,980
Whatever you see, you always thought of them.

858
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,070
Yeah.

859
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,930
But what you said...

860
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,930
is just like what you have with friends, in't it?

861
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,050
I also wanna be near Pharm.

862
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,980
Cause I feel comfortable to be around you.

863
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,980
You always bring things for me to eat too.

864
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,810
It's not the same.

865
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,490
Because what I do for you,

866
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:35,160
has no possessive feeling.

867
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,290
I make yummy stuff for you and Manow

868
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,200
because I love you guys as friends.

869
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,730
But with him,

870
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,870
Woah.

871
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,200
with what I've been doing,

872
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,620
is because you wanna possess him?

873
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,360
You're so badass!

874
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,930
Manow needs to know about this.

875
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,930
Not like that.

876
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,930
I don't wanna possess him like that.

877
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,100
I just...

878
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,420
wanna be his only special someone.

879
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,180
And most importantly,

880
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,690
you cannot tell Manow at all!

881
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,690
If you do, I won't make you any food

882
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:08,820
for a week.

883
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,850
I was kidding.

884
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:13,980
I haven't had

885
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,600
your dessert for 2 days already.

886
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,090
You'll make it 1 week.

887
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,090
I could die.

888
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,930
If you love some one,

889
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,580
then you need to show it.

890
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,290
Don't just wait for the other person to do it alone.

891
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,990
Just like what I do for P'Dean,

892
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,380
Super touching.

893
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,690
Dean must be head over heels for you.

894
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,710
Team.

895
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,380
And if

896
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,710
one person loves

897
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:47,160
like...

898
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,510
has the possessive feeling

899
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,510
but the other person doesn't.

900
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,270
Do you call this love?

901
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,690
It is.

902
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,760
But it's just...

903
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,960
a one-sided love.

904
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,670
One-sided love?

905
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,560
What do you mean?

906
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,160
Hey.

907
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,910
Are you falling in love with someone?

908
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,130
You're crazy!

909
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,600
I'm just asking.

910
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:16,780
P'Win!

911
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:18,400
Hey no way!

912
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,690
I don't like Hia Win.

913
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,160
I'm just asking in general.

914
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:21,560
Like...

915
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,070
there's no way.

916
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,420
Thinking about it
already gives me goosebump, Pharm.

917
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,670
No.

918
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:26,760
I wanted to say

919
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,310
that P'Win is waiting for you over there.

920
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,540
What are you guys yelling about?

921
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,050
Since when you're here?

922
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:36,980
You're not a good liar, Team.

923
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,690
How come you're here?

924
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,160
Let's go.

925
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,400
Let's go home.

926
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,220
I'll go.

927
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:51,800
Yeah.

928
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:53,090
Oh by the way Pharm,

929
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:54,930
Dean told you to wait for 10 more mins.

930
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:55,780
He'll be here soon.

931
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,360
Sure, thank you.

932
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:58,560
I'm going home now.

933
00:54:58,690 --> 00:54:59,490
Let's go.

934
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,110
Bye.

935
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,360
I know!

936
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,360
Come on.

937
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:17,250
Ughh. I can walk by myself.

938
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,510
Please bring my car tomorrow.

939
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:32,870
Why?

940
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,620
My bike is uncomfortable that much?

941
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,310
Hia.

942
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,090
Hia.

943
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,820
Hia.

944
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:57,800
Go.

945
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,620
Hang on to me tightly.

946
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:33,960
I'm about to take off.

947
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,130
Yeah.

948
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,060
Can I spend a night with you?

949
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,640
Go to sleep.

950
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,640
Don't think much.

951
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,640
I'm always beside you.

952
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,100
Do you know how to tie a neck-tie?

953
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,960
I'll teach you.

954
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,590
Waan is my bother.

955
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,590
Hia, this is Tul. My friend.

956
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,590
Are you going back now?

957
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,240
Not yet.

958
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,240
I want to practice for 2-3 rounds more.

959
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:01,190
Why didn't you attend the club?

960
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,390
What a haunter.

961
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,590
What did you say?

962
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,590
Nothing.

963
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,830
I asked you.

964
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,650
Why didn't you attend the club?

965
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,650
We're almost late.

966
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,840
Almost.

967
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
Means not yet late.

968
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,850
Hia, that hurts.

969
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,850
Why you have to did that?

970
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,590
I'm waiting for Bee.

971
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,080
What about you?

972
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
You're the vice president.

973
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,840
You can't be late.

974
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
Everyone is equal.

975
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,000
Don't argue with me.

976
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,970
Hey, Team.

977
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,970
What? Hia.

978
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,450
Have you ever tried to flirt with anyone?

979
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,900
I have.

980
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,900
Don't tell me that you never.

981
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,950
And how did you do it?

982
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,370
Well,

983
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,750
Just like normally thing.

984
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,380
Talking.

985
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,380
Taking to have nice meals.

986
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,210
Going for movies.

987
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,480
And...

988
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,480
bring cold water and such.

989
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,480
Um.

990
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,920
I gotta go.

991
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,920
Um.

992
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,080
Here.

993
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,030
What is it?

994
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,790
Cold water.

995
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,790
For you.

996
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,420
Bye.

997
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,420
See you at the club.

998
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,870
What?

999
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,470
Perfect! It's kinda hot right now.

1000
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,000
Cold water...

1001
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,980
Or you mean...

1002
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,940
What the hell?

1003
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,860
Team!
