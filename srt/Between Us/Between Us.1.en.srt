1
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,820
Shit.

2
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,550
I’m late.

3
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,550
Ow.

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,040
Hello?

5
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,630
Yeah I’m arrived.

6
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,840
Are you okay?

7
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,450
I’m fine.

8
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,910
Sorry about that and…

9
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,910
thank you too.

10
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,970
Excuse me.

11
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,850
See you.

12
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,800
Win!

13
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,290
Come on!

14
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,360
Okay. So hurry.

15
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,420
Bro wake up!
We’re almost late.

16
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,770
Hey!

17
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,770
What!?
What’s up?

18
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,770
You just woke up?

19
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,770
- Yeah.
- Hey!

20
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,000
You have to take me to school.

21
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I told you since yesterday.

22
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,180
Why didn’t you
have Win take you instead?

23
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,839
He is already back to uni.

24
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,839
He went back to his dorm
since yesterday.

25
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,670
Ugh!

26
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,550
Next time, I won’t talk to you
when you play games anymore.

27
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,970
Never know shit.

28
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,230
Yeah yeah.
Let me brush my teeth. 3 mins.

29
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,230
Go wait in the car.

30
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,040
Hia Win!
(Hia means elder brother)

31
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,920
Where do I register?

32
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,360
I haven’t seen any.

33
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,909
Where is it?

34
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,909
- Look at the crowd.
- Wow.

35
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,600
Ow!

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I’m sorry!

37
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,960
That's fine. I’m fine.

38
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,000
Are you first year students?

39
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,140
Yes.

40
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,140
Hey me too!

41
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Oh I thought you were a senior.

42
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,010
Here for the club registration?

43
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,010
And are you guys done?

44
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,720
Not yet. We’ve just arrived.

45
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,450
On our way to register.

46
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,640
Hey.

47
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,860
Can I tag along with you guys then?

48
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,860
I’m Team.

49
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,860
Err…I’m a swimming
scholarship student.

50
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,050
Wow!

51
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,290
A scholarship student.

52
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,390
Oh wait…

53
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,600
Scholarship students have to register too?

54
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Yeah really?

55
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Yeah that’s what they said.

56
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
There’s no privilege over other students.

57
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
And…

58
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,600
What are you guys’ names?

59
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,180
- I’m A.
- I’m Bee.
- I’m Sea.

60
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,710
Huh?

61
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,710
Are you guys lying to me?

62
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,350
We’re not.

63
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,350
That’s our real names.

64
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,720
A's name is A.

65
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,360
- For Bee,
- It’s from Bumblebee

66
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,650
and I’m Sea.

67
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,180
S-E-A

68
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,180
Sea that means the beach.

69
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,180
You can try pronouncing it.

70
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,680
S-E-A. Sea.

71
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,680
Ugh.

72
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
We better go before we’re late.
Come on.

73
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,880
- Yeah let’s go.
- Let’s go Team.

74
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Do you wanna join our gang?

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,780
You’ve got any friends?

76
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,780
Nope.

77
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,050
I left not even 24 hours,

78
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,050
you guys are fighting already?

79
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,770
Stop complaining and go to class.

80
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,770
You might be late.

81
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,380
Pay attention in the class too.

82
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,280
Um see you.

83
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,920
Your brothers are fighting again?

84
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,990
In this world,

85
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,560
who else is gonna hear a soft tone of yours
apart from Wiew?

86
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,810
There might be.

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,910
But not you for sure, Pruek.

88
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,540
There he is.

89
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
Win that I am familiar with.

90
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,360
Not the one that said…

91
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,050
’See you~’

92
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,050
or ‘Pay attention in the class’

93
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,050
Those are so cringy.

94
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,470
Hey!

95
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,160
All the first years are here,

96
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Let’s get ready.

97
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,970
What are you looking at?

98
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,890
Hey Pruek.
You prick!

99
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,470
I guess you don’t have to respect me as a senior anymore
...calling me that.

100
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,470
Really?

101
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,470
I was being sarcastic.

102
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,470
And what were you actually looking at?

103
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,080
I’m looking for someone.

104
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,960
Have you ever met one?

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
The one that makes you heart beat fast.

106
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,500
Like…

107
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,980
You’ve never met them before…

108
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,240
never really talked either

109
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,020
but…

110
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,020
It was so damn cute.

111
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,750
That is so pie in the sky.

112
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,220
Shit.

113
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
He just had to destroy my mood.

114
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,080
I'm gonna introduce you
to our club members.

115
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,080
That’s Pruek.

116
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
This is Dean, club president.

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
And I’m Win, club vice president.

118
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,450
And because this year…

119
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,450
there’re so many interested
to join our club,

120
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,720
that’s why we need to qualify people
who'd like to join.

121
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,140
Who is not qualified,

122
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
you might need to find new clubs to join.

123
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,440
Shit dude!

124
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,990
I'm here just because
I wanna chill in the pool.

125
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,490
Turns out we have to qualify.
This is bad.

126
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,490
What should we do Team?

127
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,960
It’s just a club test.

128
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,620
I don’t think
it’s gonna be that difficult.

129
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,620
It might be
just a standard procedure.

130
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,950
Why are you being so polite?

131
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,070
But you’re a scholarship student,

132
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,620
- it should be easy for you.
- Yeah.

133
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,630
Teach us sometimes when you’re free.

134
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,630
- I wanna be fitted too.
- Yeah.

135
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,520
Also, I don’t wanna go join
other clubs anymore.

136
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,100
It might be full by now.

137
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,100
Sure!

138
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,090
Those athletic scholarships,
don’t be too confident.

139
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,090
Our club doesn’t have any privileges.

140
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,090
No connections or anything.

141
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,090
If you're not qualified,
you'd also lose your scholarship as well.

142
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,480
And if that happens,
prepare to pay for the tuition fee.

143
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,420
That’s all for today.

144
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
You may go home.

145
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,820
How was the club registration, Pharm?

146
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,180
It was okay.

147
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,180
and how’s yours, Manow?

148
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,990
I’m not telling you.
Oh there he is!

149
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,990
Hey.

150
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,000
How’s the swimming club, Team?

151
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,200
There were lots of people Pharm.

152
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I have to do a swim test as well.

153
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
If I’m not qualified,
I need to join other clubs.

154
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,030
Hey same as mine!

155
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,030
So many people, but…

156
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,150
I met Alex too.
He’s so hot!

157
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,430
I also got to show my talents to him too.

158
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,430
I can’t believe it!
Don’t wanna believe it!

159
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,590
And how did it turn out?

160
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,590
Did you pass?

161
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,590
It’s me.

162
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,650
You sure did pass.

163
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,930
Club takes up to 30 people.

164
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,930
there were only 25 people there.

165
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,930
So they took all of us in.

166
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,050
When is your swim test?

167
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,620
If you're not qualified,
you can join drama club with me.

168
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,910
There’re seats available still.

169
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,910
It’s the day after tomorrow.

170
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,470
You and Manow,
please go support me.

171
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,860
Please please.
I need someone to support me there.

172
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,860
- Please please.
- Sure Team.

173
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,150
I think with your experience,
you’ll definitely pass.

174
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,780
Well…

175
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Let’s just forget about that.

176
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,780
Now, I’m hungry.

177
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,420
Can you take me out for a meal?

178
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,000
- Just in front the uni is fine.
- Let’s go.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,680
Please go go?

180
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,440
- I’m starving.
- You don’t have to ask me. I’ll go with you anyway.

181
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,730
Hey hey.

182
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,580
Pharm. Team.

183
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,380
What? So hurry. You’re not waiting for me at all.

184
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,650
Hello?

185
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,950
Hey bro wait for me. Wait up.

186
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,070
Damn it!

187
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,070
He just can’t wait, can he?

188
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,970
I don’t wanna stay home
with Hia Waan anymore.

189
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,830
It’s like he’s never here.

190
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,640
Always playing the damn game all day.

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,920
Hey hey.
You cannot talk about him like that.

192
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Did you arrive school on time this morning?

193
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,570
No I did not.

194
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,180
Luckily it was just the first time,
so I just got a little warning.

195
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,430
Oh Hia,

196
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,900
can I spend a night at your dorm sometimes?

197
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,900
I feel lonely.

198
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,100
Please.

199
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,780
I will be home on Friday.

200
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,200
Really? Promise me?

201
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,200
Yeah I promise.

202
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,900
Are you freakin blind?

203
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,830
Hey bro!

204
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,830
Can you just play game quietly?

205
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,630
Tul, you dick. Open the door.

206
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,630
Damn it!

207
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,050
Sorry to interupt.

208
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,520
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

209
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,060
My club needs a hand.

210
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,060
I need your help.

211
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,940
The vice president has to ask me himself?

212
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,960
Just answer the damn question.

213
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,260
If you’re not free,
I’ll find someone else to substitute.

214
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,090
Who else you can find in uni?

215
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,030
that is really good with strategy like me?

216
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,020
It’s just a qualified round.

217
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
I want you to help with the whistle signal.
That’s all.

218
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,340
You don’t have use your brain.

219
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
Please use it for something else.

220
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,590
You’re asking me for help,
but you’re talking to me like this?

221
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,360
It’s fine if you’re not
gonna help with this one.

222
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
But the camp, you have to go.

223
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,590
Come pick me up then.

224
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,730
Why do I have to?

225
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,730
My bike is not for everyone
to ride randomly.

226
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,050
I really want to know

227
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,050
what kind of person
who'd get to ride with you?

228
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,490
That’s all I have to say.

229
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,490
Please continue
with whatever you’re doing.

230
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,300
Hey!
Tomorrow Team has the qualifying.

231
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,110
What time is it?
After class right?

232
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,020
Team, are you okay?

233
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,020
Team!

234
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
Huh?

235
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,520
Are you alright? Are you sick?

236
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,710
I’m fine.

237
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,710
What did you say just now?

238
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,950
I said 'what time is it for the qualifying?'

239
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,400
4pm.

240
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,980
Oh it’s right after class.

241
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,500
Pharm.

242
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,890
Let’s go together.

243
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,890
Let's go support Team.

244
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,310
Please.

245
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,480
Are you gonna be there for Team
or for something else?

246
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
I wanna be there for Team.
Really!

247
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,840
But the rest is just an extra benefit.

248
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,060
I'm gonna go home.

249
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,460
What?

250
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,640
You're not gonna have lunch together first?

251
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Yeah you promised us.

252
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,140
I just have a little headache.

253
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Wanna go back and lay down.

254
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,140
Okay fine.

255
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,140
Text us in the group
when you arrive at your dorm.

256
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,930
See you.

257
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,180
Team, what's the matter?

258
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,609
I'm kinda stressed about today's qualifying.

259
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,540
Wow...

260
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,540
If you're stressed,

261
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,329
- shouldn't we withdraw from joining?
- Yeah.

262
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,220
It's not like that.

263
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,780
Hey let's get goin guys!

264
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,780
If you are done,
then go wait out side.

265
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,780
Yes.

266
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,940
Manow.

267
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,940
That's Team.

268
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,940
Team!

269
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,860
Wow Pharm!

270
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,310
Look at the guy.

271
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,310
He's hot.

272
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,830
Looks like there're many good ones
among the freshmen this year.

273
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,150
Dean.

274
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,060
Hey Dean!

275
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,450
What are you looking at?

276
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,090
Let's go Mr.president.

277
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,860
If you're ready, you may start.

278
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,100
Step up please.

279
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,550
Take your mark.

280
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,950
- Help.
- Team.

281
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,580
- Go Team!
- You can do it, Team!

282
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
Team.

283
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,580
Go Team go!

284
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,390
- He's leading.
- Team!

285
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,540
Yayy.

286
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,540
Finally done with the qualifying.
I'll get to sleep more.

287
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,630
Why? You didn't get enough sleep
before the qualifying?

288
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,720
Were you stressed?

289
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,040
That's why...

290
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,140
I saw you were having
a not-so-okay face

291
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,860
Yeah I was. A bit.

292
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,860
I'm always like this before any competition.

293
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,860
I'm already used to it.

294
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,320
But you did great.

295
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
You also were the first one who finished.

296
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,120
Yeah.

297
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
You don't have to pressure yourself.

298
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,620
Yes dad. Yes mom.

299
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,620
Stop it Team.

300
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,130
Oh and I'm going on a trip
with the club next week.

301
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,800
All the seniors said...

302
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,340
it's some sort of ice-breaking kinda camp.

303
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,380
Oh it's the camp of swimming club.

304
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,860
How come do you know about this?

305
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,950
- Um.
- Did you sneakily talk to someone?

306
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,950
Ahaaa!

307
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,660
Who can I possibly talk to?

308
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
I only know Team out of the whole team.

309
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,660
There's Dean.

310
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
The one I pointed to show you.

311
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,830
How can I talk or even know him, Manow?

312
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,020
Swimming club just asked my club
to make them some snacks.

313
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
I didn't talk to anyone.

314
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,340
And I also have to prepare ingredients
for the baking tomorrow.

315
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,340
Wow.

316
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,820
We would get to eat stuff made by Pharm?

317
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
Thinking about it already makes me hungry.

318
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,320
If you're hungry,

319
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,250
then eat the food in front of you.

320
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,220
You left uneaten until the flies already
laid some eggs here and left.

321
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,220
Sure mom.

322
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,790
Shall we just eat?

323
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,790
Yeah I'm hungry.

324
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,780
I give you one bite.

325
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,320
What else do we need to buy?

326
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,070
We already got basic essential medicines.

327
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,960
Alcoholic drinks are not allowed.

328
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,520
Ugh.

329
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,130
Just relax.

330
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,130
Don't be so conservative.

331
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,820
That's enough.

332
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,820
Go get some soda pops and water.

333
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,900
Fine. Packed water is right over there.

334
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,380
(Split Mung beans, Peanuts, Black beans)

335
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,930
Thank you.

336
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,190
I love you, Ein

337
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,510
Dean.

338
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,250
Where the hell are you?

339
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,250
I cannot carry all the water by myself.

340
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,510
What were you doing?

341
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,780
What are you looking at?

342
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Let's go.

343
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,550
Damn it!

344
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,620
I got a chance to talk,
but you ruined it.

345
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,510
Dean.

346
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,510
Do you think we forget something?

347
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,380
Dean.

348
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,170
Hey Dean!

349
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,010
What's wrong with you?

350
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,440
Nothing.

351
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,620
- Carry it properly, Sea!
- Where shall we put this?

352
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,620
Be careful.

353
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,620
Sure sure.

354
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,060
- Why do you have to huddle?
It's you.

355
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,180
- Hello Pharm?
- Are you still at uni?

356
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,100
Pharm.

357
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Why are you sounding so shattered?

358
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
Where are you right now?

359
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Stay right there.

360
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
I will be there soon.

361
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,060
Guys, excuse me.

362
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,700
Pharm.

363
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,770
Pharm!

364
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,380
What's wrong?

365
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,580
Why are you crying?

366
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
I don't know, Team.

367
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,970
Did someone
doing something to you?

368
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,970
Tell me.

369
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,640
I don't know, Team.
I really don't know.

370
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,170
It's fine Pharm.

371
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,910
It's okay if you don't know.

372
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,310
It's fine.

373
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,990
I...

374
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,720
I met Dean...

375
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
and...

376
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,470
I suddenly just cried.

377
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,110
I don't know what's wrong with me.

378
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,110
You can take your time to think.

379
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,200
It's totally okay,
if you don't know.

380
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,430
Take your time.

381
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,940
Good.

382
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,090
Smile smile.

383
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,090
Smile.

384
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,690
Today's lunch is on me, okay?

385
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,640
But if you have something's going on,
you need to tell me

386
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,950
- Got it?

387
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,820
Thank you so much Team.

388
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,240
Woahh the beach.

389
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,140
Hey you guys.

390
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Are you done having fun?

391
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
I didn't bring you here just to have fun.

392
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,100
This camp is to discipline you.

393
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
If only this, you guys cannot behave...

394
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,380
You're the one who woke up late
and had to drive yourself here.

395
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
Still dare to talk about discipline?

396
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,980
I'm here to help you!

397
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,780
Why are you shaming me in front of them?

398
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,300
How's it goin?

399
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
About the stuff I ask you handle?

400
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,300
All in here.

401
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,300
In here?

402
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,490
or you just didn't prepare?

403
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,540
It's really in here.

404
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,240
Shall we start?
I'll be in charge.

405
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,920
Hey you guys!

406
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,330
Let's train.
Come on. Now!

407
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,400
Come on. So slow!

408
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,060
- Go!
- Come on.

409
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,580
Come on!

410
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Go. Hop. Hop.

411
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,810
- Good.
Keep going.

412
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,210
Bee come on.

413
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,190
Don't cheat.

414
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,470
Go go.

415
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,540
Stay focused!

416
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,220
That's it for today.

417
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
Go get rest.

418
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,220
and we will have dinner together at 6pm.

419
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,220
You may go rest.

420
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,220
- Hey!
What the hell!

421
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
1 2 3!

422
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,130
Ow.

423
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,130
Ow.

424
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,000
What's the matter?

425
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,320
What is it?

426
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
- What's the matter?
- It hursts, dick head.

427
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,320
- Where?
- Here!

428
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,780
Hey!

429
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,900
I wasn't even involved in this.

430
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,590
1 2 3!

431
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,820
Hey hey!

432
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,820
It's the same trick he just did dude.

433
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,420
Hey Team is bleeding.

434
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,950
Ow.

435
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,950
What's happening?

436
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,860
You guys go get the first aid kit from inside.

437
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,860
I will take it from here.

438
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,170
Sure.

439
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,170
Go go.

440
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,850
Hey bro, I'm fine.

441
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,850
My feet are dirty.

442
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,680
Stay still.

443
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,510
It's just a small cut.

444
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,510
Stay still.

445
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,320
If you cannot walk,

446
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
it's not an excuse for you
to get away from training.

447
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,449
It's only a small cut.

448
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,090
I can run around the resort
just fine in 10 mins.

449
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,520
It's just a small cut.

450
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,090
Then take care on your own.

451
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,020
Win...

452
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,210
Thank you.

453
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Now I feel guilty asking you to be here.

454
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,260
Looks like we are taking
your game time away.

455
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,960
That's fine. I'd love to help.

456
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,470
I'm gonna plan
a new training strategy for this year.

457
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,470
I'll make our uni become the first rank.

458
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,700
Then push our juniors to national team.

459
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,120
Shit go for it.
Why didn't you go in?

460
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,240
Now I know what Wiew is talking about.

461
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
He complains about Waan to me that he always...

462
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,440
talks a bit and then
turn to yell at the game back and forth.

463
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,440
So it's like this.

464
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,190
Luckily you're pretty smart.

465
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,890
Bro I'm not deaf
even though I'm playing games.

466
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,890
If you're gonna talk bad about me this close.

467
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,710
Next time just yell it in my ears.

468
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,710
I intentionally want you to hear it.

469
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,580
And what the hell is Dean doing over there?

470
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,040
I feel like he's been acting weird
since we've arrived.

471
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
It's like he always has something on his mind.

472
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,980
He seems to have a wall up high.
Difficult to get to know.

473
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,200
Even I'm his friend,

474
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
sometimes I still feel...

475
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,970
like he's not the Dean that I know.

476
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,970
how can I explain?

477
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,580
Sometimes he's not even himself at all.

478
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,680
Why didn't you protect the post!?
Ugh!

479
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,800
Oh hey Win.

480
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
You've known Dean
since you guys were young,

481
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,800
does he have some issues?

482
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,740
I asked him that before.

483
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,150
but he doesn't know what's wrong with himself as well.

484
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,360
How?

485
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,260
He always look for something...

486
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
been like that since he was younger.

487
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,260
Often distracted.

488
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,990
Whenever I ask, he always says 'don't know'.

489
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,230
I thought he doesn't want me
to be nosy at first,

490
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,230
but after awhile,

491
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,380
I realized that he doesn't really know
what's going on with him.

492
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,060
What are you doing here?

493
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,240
Hey!

494
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,690
Have you ever lost something?

495
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,630
What?

496
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,170
Have you ever lost...

497
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,150
...an important thing in your life

498
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,580
and suddenly

499
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,580
you found it again?

500
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,730
I never lost anything.

501
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,020
No.

502
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,380
Even if I lost it,

503
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,380
I didn't care as much.

504
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
I never had something important.

505
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,190
Right now...

506
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,190
I feel like...

507
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,190
I found it.

508
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,840
The thing that you've been looking for?

509
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,540
You knew?

510
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,580
How long have I known you, Dean.

511
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
You've always been looking.

512
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,730
Even I don't know
what exactly you're looking for.

513
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,700
But if you found it,
I'm happy for you.

514
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,660
What about you?

515
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,620
Like I said...

516
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,890
I never had anything important.

517
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,240
I think...

518
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,380
more like you just never let anything
be important to you.

519
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,980
I guess so.

520
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,980
I'd be inherited everything
from Hia Waan.

521
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,580
and then I would have to...

522
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,580
give everything to Wiew eventually.

523
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,240
So...

524
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,980
there's nothing truly mine

525
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,980
in the first place.

526
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,980
Win...

527
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,530
and there's nothing

528
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,530
that will stay with me forever.

529
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,710
You cannot live your life like this forever.

530
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,920
Really?

531
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,440
One day...

532
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
when you find the one...

533
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,330
you will do everything in your power

534
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,330
to not loose him.

535
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,140
Let's go inside.

536
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,140
They about to start.

537
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,020
No. You go ahead.

538
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,020
I'll have to work on the report for the professor.

539
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,740
Then you can go back to your room,

540
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,140
Me and Pruek will take care from here.

541
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,980
Um I'll leave it to you then.

542
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,470
Don't be too loud.
They might complain.

543
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,970
Cheers bro!

544
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,660
Hey where have you been?

545
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,880
I went to shower and changed.

546
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,300
- Hey!
- Hmm?

547
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,940
I've got something awesome.

548
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,640
You guys...

549
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,220
Wanna see something nice?

550
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,220
What is it?

551
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,220
Follow me.

552
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,040
Come on.
Stop grilling.

553
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Come on.
Come come.

554
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,100
What?

555
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Stop teasing and show us already!

556
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,180
Yeah.

557
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,460
Imported drink?

558
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,910
- If it's not that awesome, I'll go back to eat.
- Yeah.

559
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,520
More than that.

560
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,530
The latest leak.

561
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,530
Really!?

562
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,740
Let's watch it.

563
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,240
What's wrong, Team?

564
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,170
Don't tell me

565
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,170
you've never watched this stuff before?

566
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,700
This is your first time?

567
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,840
Stop it!

568
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,840
Such a baby.

569
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,310
Bee, give me the key.

570
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,310
I'm gonna back to the room.

571
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,310
Why are you in a hurry?

572
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,310
Let's finish this.

573
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,450
Hey hey.

574
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,620
Don't tell me that you can't hold it anymore?

575
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,620
Bee!

576
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,620
Give me the key.

577
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,650
Hey!

578
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,650
you're leaving?

579
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,110
Don't fall asleep yet.

580
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,820
Stay awake to let me in the room too.

581
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,790
- He ran so fast.
- Don't do something naughty when you're alone.

582
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,260
Why is the room so damn far?

583
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,810
What are you doing?

584
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,810
You could get sick.

585
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,540
Win.

586
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,540
Yeah it's me.

587
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,940
What the hell were you doing?

588
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,940
You wound might get wet.

589
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,420
So you are aroused
because of the nice stuff from Sea?

590
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,000
No.

591
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,920
You're warm.

592
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,020
You're blushing.

593
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,980
and you're also breathing heavily.

594
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,830
Don't touch me yet.

595
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,230
Go handle yourself.

596
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,170
But if you can't do it...

597
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,270
follow me...

598
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,680
to my room.

599
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,990
How many drinks have you had?

600
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,330
3

601
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,460
Are you drunk now?

602
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,450
No.

603
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,450
Are you sure?

604
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,510
Then answer my question.

605
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,100
You're dating anyone?

606
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,310
What are you trying to do?

607
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,500
I'm not gonna do this if you're drunk

608
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
or unconscious.

609
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,120
Answer the damn question.

610
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,700
Are you dating anyone?

611
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,020
No.

612
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,900
Where are you right now?

613
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:38,900
Win's room.

614
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,140
Last question...

615
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:58,300
who is this person...

616
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:00,300
in front of you?

617
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,220
Win.

618
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,690
Call me Hia Win.

619
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,930
Hia Win.

620
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,240
How are you holding up, sick boy?

621
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
Did you find the person you're looking for?

622
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
Oh Hia! What are tou doing?

623
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
I'm going with you.

624
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,260
Excuse me. Are you Phruek?

625
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,260
Yes I am.

626
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,890
Do you wanna tell me something?

627
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,330
If you do tell, I'd just have to listen.

628
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,960
Because I don't really know who you are.

629
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
Or you feel bad about last night?

630
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,010
There's a camera here.

631
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,010
We should go back inside.
