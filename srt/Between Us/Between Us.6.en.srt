1
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,020
Are you asking me
to be your boyfriend?

2
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,490
If that’s the case,

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,270
do you have the answer for me?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,810
And did you…

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,010
really mean to ask me that?

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,210
Are you still mad at me?

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,690
And I'll bring mom the silver medal!

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,220
What?
Why the silver only?

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,630
Cause the gold medal has to be yours.

10
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,650
Easy. Just breath.

11
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,820
Just like that.

12
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,620
Hia.

13
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,480
Hia.

14
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,079
I'm sorry.

15
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,420
I think I told you

16
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,450
that it's a day-off for the club.

17
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,050
I'm sorry, Hia.

18
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,310
You broke into the pool without any permission.

19
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,330
You could have been on detention
and got your scholarship taken away.

20
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,900
Look at me!

21
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,770
If I didn't walk pass and saw the lights,

22
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,290
If I didn't walk in to check,

23
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,430
what do you think was gonna happen?

24
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,870
Tell me.

25
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,590
What was gonna happen?

26
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,210
Why did you do that?

27
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,050
I just wanted to practice.

28
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,770
What?

29
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,510
I just wanted to practice.

30
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,690
Why do you have to be so pissed?

31
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,350
F*ck the practice!

32
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,730
You almost drowned. Damn it!

33
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,870
You almost died right in front of me.

34
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,870
Did you realize that?

35
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,430
Ugh!!

36
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,530
Hia...

37
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,330
If I came here just a little late,

38
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,310
just a little...

39
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,570
you'd probably drowned, you know that?

40
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,950
Hia...

41
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,010
I'm sorry.

42
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,670
Don't do that again.

43
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,850
Hia...

44
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,570
I'm sorry, Hia.

45
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,610
I'm sorry.

46
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,830
My heart almost torn apart.

47
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,610
I'm sorry.

48
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,410
What am I gonna do
if something happened to you?

49
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,590
What am I gonna do, Team?

50
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,910
If you were drowning,

51
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,170
If I didn't get here in time.

52
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,870
Promise me.

53
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,490
That you won't do that again.

54
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,270
I promise, Hia.

55
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,810
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

56
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,790
Hia.

57
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,410
Have you eaten?

58
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,710
Are you hurt still?

59
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,990
Umm...

60
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,630
No.

61
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,610
Err...

62
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,970
Actually, I'm still a bit sore.

63
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,050
But not like hurt.

64
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,810
Thought you're gonna spend a night with Pharm?

65
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,370
How many lies did you tell me?

66
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,950
It's not like that.

67
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,730
I was really going spend a night with Pharm.

68
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,230
But P'Dean came to pick him up
for dinner first.

69
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,010
So that's why...

70
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,010
Sneaked into the club

71
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,210
even I repeated for so many times.

72
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,390
But you did not listen.

73
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,930
I never wanted to lie to you.

74
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,130
Not even once.

75
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,930
You're the only person the world.

76
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,190
That I tell everything.

77
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,450
Hia.

78
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,070
Get out.

79
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,470
Ow.

80
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,250
Where are we?
Why did you bring me here?

81
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,130
My home.

82
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,230
Huh!?

83
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,070
There's no huh.

84
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,130
Go.

85
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,110
Hia.

86
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,150
I can do it myself.

87
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,650
Stay still.

88
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,190
Hia.

89
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,730
Are you still mad at me?

90
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,190
You're so stubborn.

91
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,390
I should have let you drown.

92
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,150
I'm sorry.

93
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,870
I didn't really mean that.

94
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,790
Hia.

95
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,090
Did you know...

96
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,470
when I was in the water

97
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,650
it was super scary.

98
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,060
Even I know

99
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,390
how to bring myself up.

100
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,390
But I couldn't.

101
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,990
I couldn't move my legs.

102
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,130
Couldn't breath.

103
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,260
I really understand now

104
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,990
what's it like when you're about to die.

105
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,130
Me too.

106
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,510
When I saw you drowning,

107
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,530
I also felt like I was gonna die.

108
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,220
Hia.

109
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,950
Let's stop thinking about that.

110
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,170
Go take a shower and rest.

111
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,109
For the clothes,

112
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,369
you can pick it out from my closet.

113
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,280
Ok.

114
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,510
Please take a seat.
The porridge is ready to serve.

115
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,680
And...

116
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,060
where are the others?

117
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,330
Oh.

118
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,820
You parents and Mr.Waan
left since early morning.

119
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,370
Okay.

120
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,420
And...

121
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,260
whose food is that?

122
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,350
It's Win's and his friend.

123
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,020
He's back home?

124
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,280
Yes.

125
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,660
Hia Win!

126
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,190
Hia.

127
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,220
Hia.

128
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,550
Hia Win.

129
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,550
Why didn't you tell me!?

130
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,750
Ahhh.

131
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,330
Hey!

132
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,750
Who did you bring home with?

133
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,970
Wiew.

134
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,460
Why didn't you knock the door?

135
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,420
Who is this?

136
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,750
So who is this guy?

137
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,220
Oh.

138
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,750
- A kid--
- A 1st year from the club.

139
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,820
Hi. I'm Wiew, Win's younger brother,

140
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,280
What's your name?

141
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,860
I'm Team.

142
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,860
Hi Team.

143
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,510
Let's eat. Eat.
The porridge with fish.

144
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,990
You're fine with that right? My cook makes the best porridge.

145
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,860
He can eat pretty much everything.

146
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,420
This is so nice.

147
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,760
I have some company
having breakfast with me today.

148
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,150
What about you?
How are you doing?

149
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,220
I'm kinda lonely.

150
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Hia Waan is always up in his room.

151
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,530
Dad is always frustrated with something.

152
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,930
It's not fun at home.

153
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,550
I'm sorry.

154
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,440
I haven't been back to see you.

155
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,480
Oh Hia!

156
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,330
My grades this term.

157
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,820
Here.

158
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,130
Nothing below 3.00.

159
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,110
Mmm.

160
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,110
Yeah I'm pretty good right?

161
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,910
Very well.

162
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,550
I actually got it for awhile.

163
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,550
But there's nobody care enough for me to show.

164
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,880
I'm free this weekend.
I'll be home with you.

165
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,510
Really!?

166
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,730
You too P'Team?

167
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,530
Please, come spend a night with me?

168
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,770
I also have Gundam in my room.
Do you like them?

169
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,350
Come on.
Team is a grown up.

170
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,190
Hey I'm like obsessed with it!

171
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,660
I have a ton back home,
but when I moved to the dorm I didn't bring any with me.

172
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,440
Now you should finish your breakfast,
if you don't wanna be late for school.

173
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Eat.

174
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,260
But today...

175
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,260
Drop me off at school please.

176
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,240
Please Hia. Please please please.

177
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,990
You too. Take me to school please.

178
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,820
Please take me please.

179
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,510
Okay.

180
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,170
Yeah!

181
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,170
You're so kind.

182
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,510
Your uniform of Mr.Team's,

183
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,130
I washed it and already dried it for you.

184
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,420
Er...

185
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,190
You can just call me Team.

186
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,240
Sure.

187
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,750
Thank you aunty.

188
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,240
You welcome.
Would you excuse me?

189
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Yes.

190
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,660
[Chuckle]

191
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,190
Good right, P'Team?

192
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,440
Yeah real good.

193
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,660
Right?

194
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,510
- Hey Team!
- Team!

195
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,730
Prince!

196
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,340
Thank you... about last night

197
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,870
I owe Pharm a meal.

198
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,360
No need.

199
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,360
This time they gave him
the benefit of the doubt.

200
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,580
Next time, they won't let him get away with it.

201
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,690
Entering the club without the permission.

202
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,140
and caused an incident.

203
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,360
Luckily you saved him just in time.

204
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,820
If not...

205
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,690
Yeah.

206
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,690
I already rebuke him that.

207
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,360
But that's good.

208
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,540
That you called me last night.

209
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,820
So I can deleted the files beforehand.

210
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,760
The CCTV had it very clear.

211
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,870
It was really risky.

212
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,580
I didn't dare to even think,

213
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,940
If I didn't get there in time

214
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,180
what could have happened.

215
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,050
And...

216
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,820
what's the matter with Team?

217
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,710
Why did he...

218
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,340
let himself drown like that?

219
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,290
He had a cramp.

220
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,850
Whenever he's ready,

221
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,110
you can talk to me then.

222
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,600
Thank you.

223
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Take your mark.

224
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Team!

225
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,310
When you said...

226
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,560
you'd never let anything be important to your life...

227
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,290
are you eating your own words now?

228
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,360
What do you mean?

229
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,470
You should ask yourself first...

230
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,470
that what is happening right now

231
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,980
Is it real?

232
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,310
and you need to be able to answer that.

233
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,910
Whatever you're feeling right now,

234
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,140
Whether you just worry about him,

235
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,710
Or you really love him.

236
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,160
Yesterday...

237
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,800
when I saw him drowning,

238
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,870
my heart almost ripped into pieces.

239
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,110
I was terrified.

240
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,510
I was afraid that he's gonna disappear from my life.

241
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,140
Afraid that something was gonna happen to him

242
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,220
and I can't live with that.

243
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,910
Then what kind of feelings
do you think I'm having?

244
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,420
Win.

245
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,960
I don't like this feeling at all.

246
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,650
I don't wanna have the feeling that I might lose something.

247
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,540
It feels like...

248
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm not good enough

249
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,620
to keep him.

250
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,910
Hey.

251
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,250
You need to think it though.

252
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,890
I think...

253
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,050
He and I...

254
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,310
has already crossed the line a little.

255
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,250
I didn't start off...

256
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,450
and meant it to turn out this way.

257
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,650
Listen to me.

258
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,020
You need to calm down.

259
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,420
I don't wanna love anyone.

260
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,540
I don't wanna start loving anyone.

261
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,490
Cause I don't wanna lose anyone.

262
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,980
But that's running away form the problem.

263
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,820
If you don't wanna lose,

264
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,820
then keep him.

265
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,580
Not trying to avoid like this.

266
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,870
Your time was good.

267
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,670
Thank you.

268
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,850
Err...P'Dean.

269
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,820
So...

270
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,000
Pharm is waiting for you outside.

271
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,850
Oh.

272
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,890
Okay, Thanks.

273
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,290
Hey guys!

274
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,020
Do you wanna go out for some drinks?
Been tired for many days.

275
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,000
- That sounds nice.
- Wanna go?

276
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,740
Guys, I'm gonna get going.

277
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
What?

278
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,310
My friend will come with us.
I'll be back.

279
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:53,200
Oh hey where're you going?

280
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,420
He'll probably catch with us later.
Come on.

281
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,420
I didn't think you'd come.

282
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,800
You invited me yourself.

283
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,090
You were so good in the water.
Probably wins over the sharks, if you competed with them.

284
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,070
You're exaggerating.

285
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,270
And where are you going next?
Do you wanna go for dinner with me?

286
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,870
I have go in a bit.

287
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,940
Oh so you're here just for to see the practice?

288
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,620
Yeah why?

289
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,600
Can I?

290
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,160
No cause...

291
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,980
you could have rejected me.
I invited you, but didn't expect you to come.

292
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,000
What do you mean?

293
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,110
Was it just a courtesy invite?

294
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,270
And I actually showed up unexpected?

295
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,690
No, not like that.

296
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,560
You rarely get to rest
and your condo is so far away from uni.

297
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,540
You come all the way here
just to see the practice is not worth it.

298
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,110
Is there such thing as not worthy?

299
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,470
I think it's totally worth it.

300
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,400
That was the first time,
I got to watch swimming competition.

301
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,270
And now I know that I like.

302
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,800
Like?

303
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,690
Yeah I like to be at the swim meet and watch.

304
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,580
I like it too.

305
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,470
I like swimming.

306
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,780
And I also like that you're here too.

307
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,160
Here.

308
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Ow.

309
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,850
My cheek is all bruised.

310
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,600
What is it?

311
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,800
It's a sunscreen.

312
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,160
Do you ever use it?

313
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,050
This is a spray one.

314
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,910
You can spray it before going in the water.

315
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:10,090
Even the pool is indoor,
but there's chlorine that could damage your skin.

316
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,600
This one is also really good.
I'm the ambassador myself.

317
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Woww.

318
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,380
I'll use it now.

319
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,420
Like that?

320
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Are you crazy?

321
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,800
Oh! Bee I have to go.
I'll see you later.

322
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,800
Prince.

323
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
Thank you for coming.

324
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,380
Thank you too for inviting me.

325
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,270
I gotta go.

326
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:28,179
I can't believe it. Am I dreaming?

327
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,179
What the hell are you talking about?

328
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,780
I'm not used to this.

329
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,290
Since I've known you, you rarely step into a bar.

330
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,760
But today you asked me to come yourself.

331
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,449
I think today will be the day,
dolphins will give birth to little chicks.

332
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,470
Why didn't you tell me
that you're gonna invite you brother too?

333
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,800
He's nearby, so I just did.

334
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,160
You're never into the night life.

335
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,710
What's going on?

336
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,140
Hia.

337
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,270
This is Tul.

338
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,450
Tul, this is Waan.

339
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,160
He's my brother.

340
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,850
Yeah we've met.

341
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,850
I remember him.

342
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,180
You asked me to come out here,

343
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,420
is something wrong?

344
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,180
How is it with dad?

345
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,670
It's the same.

346
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,890
Why do you ask?
He asked you to spy on me?

347
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,000
No, I was just asking.

348
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,850
Got your heart broken?

349
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,710
We're not even a couple.

350
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,890
How can you say that it's heart broken?

351
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,760
So it's about love?

352
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,160
I don't even know whether I can call it love.

353
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,250
You need to try to find out, right?

354
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,140
What if I'm afraid that it is love?

355
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,580
If...

356
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,760
I didn't want it to be love in the first place?

357
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,940
What's really going on?

358
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,490
I feel like...

359
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,110
I started to have a feeling for someone,

360
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,340
but I'm scared.

361
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,820
Win.

362
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,910
You should take it slow.

363
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,380
And what are you afraid of?

364
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,270
I'm afraid that, if I loved him,

365
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,420
I might lose him someday.

366
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,140
What makes you think that way?

367
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,000
I feel like...

368
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,510
I can never kept anything.

369
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,180
So I'm scared...

370
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,090
that I might not be able to save him.

371
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,420
Like everything else I have lost.

372
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,740
[Sigh]

373
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,290
[Ringing]

374
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,290
[Ringing]

375
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,250
[Ringing]

376
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,250
[Ringing]

377
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,710
[Ringing]

378
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,140
Where is he?

379
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,420
P'Dean.

380
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,160
You don't have to pick me up like this everyday.

381
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,870
It's fine. It's very little thing.

382
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,960
Oh Pharm.

383
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,090
There'll be a swimming competition soon.

384
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,580
If the result came out great,

385
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,560
I'm thinking of taking the club
to a floating resort in Kanchanaburi.

386
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,910
Floating resort in Kanchnaburi?

387
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,290
I've never been to one before.

388
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,760
That's great.

389
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,160
I even want you to come with us more.

390
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,070
If the result turned out great,
can I really go?

391
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,600
Yes.

392
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,740
People from the club are around 10.

393
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,450
One raft can pack around...

394
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,000
5-6 people.

395
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
All good, Pharm.

396
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,580
But I...

397
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,560
I'm not a member of the club.

398
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,180
Why do you have to be concerned?

399
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,740
Aren't you the boyfriend of the club president?

400
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,020
P'Dean...

401
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,760
Let's go.

402
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,850
Let's go eat.

403
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,000
You mean..

404
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,760
eat dinner, right?

405
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,000
Or you want to eat something else?

406
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
P'Dean...

407
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,050
I meant the dinner.

408
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,420
Let's go!

409
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,470
Oh.

410
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,580
Win texted me.
He said that he's already gone home.

411
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,850
What?

412
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,890
I thought he only went to the restroom.

413
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,540
I thought so too.

414
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,760
So shall we go home then?

415
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,820
Never.

416
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,250
Er...I mean...

417
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,070
I've never seen him like this before.

418
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,850
Yeah.

419
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,780
Do you have any ideas who does he like?

420
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,470
I can kinda guess.

421
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,050
He's a kid from swimming club.

422
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,780
I wanna see his face.

423
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,870
Really want to know...

424
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,650
who could possibly
make him losing his grip like this?

425
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,140
What about you?

426
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,820
How is it at home?

427
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,870
Win often tells me about you.

428
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,140
Sorry if I asked inappropriately.

429
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,000
Nothing much.

430
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,020
It's normal

431
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,290
for father and son who don't get along.

432
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,710
Sometimes...

433
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,450
If you've got something on your mind,

434
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,890
you should get it off your chest.

435
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,000
Keep it all to yourself like this

436
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
it's gonna do you any good.

437
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,760
I think you should try

438
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,510
having someone to talk to.

439
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,220
It's better than keeping it all to yourself.

440
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,870
Thanks.

441
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,070
But I already got someone to talk to.

442
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,650
He's a good listener

443
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,600
but also nosy at the same time.

444
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,760
[Clearing throat]

445
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,980
Oh and...

446
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,290
Do you like talking to him?

447
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,580
Yeah, but it's kinda weird

448
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,420
cause we've never really met.

449
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,490
We don't even know each other in person.

450
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,650
But it's nice.

451
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,000
I can tell him pretty much everything.

452
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,760
Some of the things I told him,

453
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:08,270
I just wanna let it out, but didn't expect him
to listen or help me solve or anything.

454
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,250
But it's good that I have someone listening to me.

455
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,470
And...

456
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,160
Have you ever thought...

457
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,420
of meeting him in person?

458
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,310
No.

459
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,620
I don't wanna see him in person.
What we have right now is already perfect.

460
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,450
Yeah.

461
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,490
Shall we...

462
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,160
go home then?
It's getting late.

463
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,670
Ok sure.

464
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,620
Check please.

465
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,580
Why did you kill my son?

466
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,490
Why did Ton has to die?

467
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,710
Ton.

468
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,490
Sorry I had to ask you for a favor.

469
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,380
I probably forgot to bring my keycard with me.

470
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,670
I don't know where Win went also.

471
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,020
I tried calling him to come get me.

472
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,270
But it went straight to voicemail.

473
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,360
It's okay.

474
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,540
If you didn't volunteer to drop me off at my dorm,

475
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,670
I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight either.

476
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,400
Do you wanna sleep in Win's room instead?

477
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,070
I can ask the maid for the key.

478
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,090
It's okay.

479
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,250
I can sleep on the couch.

480
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,160
It's already late.
All the maids probably went to sleep.

481
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,310
If you sleep here,
when you wake up you'd probably got bitten.

482
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:22,850
Huh?

483
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,400
The mosquitos.

484
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,890
We always leave the door open in my house.

485
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,780
You can't sleep here.
Too many mosquitos.

486
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,110
You're funny too, you know that?

487
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,220
Oh if you don't mind,

488
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,450
you can sleep in my room.

489
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,160
I don't mind.

490
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,310
Let's go upstairs. It's already late.

491
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,070
The maid probably took all the blankets to wash.

492
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,690
It's okay. The sun will rise soon.

493
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:15,200
I'll just snuggle up on this pillow here.
It should be warm enough.

494
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,380
- You want to sleep on the bed with me?
- Can I?

495
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,940
I...

496
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,940
don't wanna disturb your sleep.

497
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,470
Well then--

498
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,400
What the hell?

499
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,760
Your bed...

500
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,510
is super comfy.

501
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,760
Playing games now?

502
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,620
Yeah you can go ahead to sleep.

503
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,050
What's wrong?

504
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,580
T-Rex ditched me.

505
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,580
He's not online.

506
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,980
So grumpy.

507
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,140
You probably miss him a lot.

508
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,960
Yeah play games together everyday.

509
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,570
When I don't see him online,
it feels like I miss something.

510
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,460
He seems...

511
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,660
so important to you.

512
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,080
Yeah he is.

513
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,300
It's late.

514
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,540
You shouldn't wait up for him.

515
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,480
Just talk to him tomorrow.

516
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,340
Yeah I'll complain him real good.

517
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,660
Yeah do it. I like it.

518
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,380
What?

519
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,020
Nothing.

520
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,340
Sweet dream.

521
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,340
Hia.

522
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,460
Hia.

523
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,740
Hia, are you there?

524
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,900
Hia.

525
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,540
Hia.

526
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,040
Where is he gone to?

527
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,130
What's wrong with you?

528
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,450
I'm not ok, Hia.

529
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,100
Why they have to say like that?

530
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,170
And are you still confused?

531
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,390
So what do you want?

532
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,470
It’s up to him.

533
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,210
I feel like I’ve known you before.

534
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,460
Your voice sounds so familiar.

535
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,350
Prince.

536
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:05,950
- Cheers.
- Bottom ups dude.

537
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,310
Wow.

538
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,470
You're good.

539
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,770
You came out with us,

540
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,510
why don't you have some drinks with us?

541
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,350
Cause this is good.

542
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:23,890
Tastes better than you guys' bitter drinks.

543
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,150
Normally, you drink it too!

544
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:26,890
- Yeah.
- Right.

545
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,990
What the hell is wrong with you?

546
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,250
Yeah.

547
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,570
Nothing.

548
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,030
I promised someone before.

549
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,430
What promise?

550
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,270
You don't need to know.

551
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,450
Cause when I drink with you guys, I always get wasted.

552
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,170
He'll worry about me.

553
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:46,490
Who is he?

554
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,230
Who?

555
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,230
Which one?

556
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,570
Just drink it.

557
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:53,990
What?

558
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,670
Hurry up, I'll take you guys home.

559
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,890
Suddenly just chewed us out.

560
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,970
Yeah what the hell.

561
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,590
Hia!

562
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:10,450
What are you doing?

563
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,710
Rewarding, good boy.

564
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,610
Hia.

565
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:22,770
Hia.

566
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,590
You guys.

567
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,130
I gotta go.

568
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,770
See you later.

569
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,770
Look at what you did!

570
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,270
I witnessed it with both of my eyeballs.

571
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,950
Everything happened so quickly.

572
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,030
Now I know who he was talking about.

573
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,130
Yeah.

574
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,790
Let's just get drunk.

575
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,210
I am drunk already. So drunk.
