1
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,740
there's nothing truly mine

2
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,180
in the first place.

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,200
and there's nothing

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,980
that will stay with me forever.

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,620
Then answer my question.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,160
You're dating anyone?

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,570
No.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,160
Call me Hia Win.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,970
Hia Win.

10
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Protection.

11
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,280
If you already made the decision to do it,

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
just enjoy it.

13
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,770
Don't feel guilty.

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,960
Don't feel guilty.

15
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Ugh.

16
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,220
What are you gonna do now, Team?

17
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,810
He's such a child.

18
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,970
I'm skipping school today.

19
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,970
Not feeling well.

20
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,360
Pharm: How serious is it, Team?

21
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,050
It's not that bad.

22
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,050
I'm sure I'll feel better soon.

23
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,860
Pharm: I will keep all the handouts for you.

24
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,860
Manow: What about the club?

25
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Manow: You want me to let them know?

26
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,940
Manow. I don't feel obligated at all.
I'll take care of it for you.

27
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,860
Whatever you'd like, mom.

28
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,170
Push harder!

29
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,890
Hey! Keep up the pace.

30
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,800
Err...excuse me.

31
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,530
Are you Phruek?

32
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,530
Yes I am.

33
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,700
Oh Team asked me to let you guys know that he's sick,
so he'll skip today.

34
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Oh.

35
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,840
Your name is Manow, right?

36
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,840
Yes.

37
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,330
Wow...you pay attention to the details.

38
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,660
I'm flattered.

39
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,280
Where's Team?

40
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Well...

41
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Manow is here to let us know that
he won't be here today.

42
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,760
Why?

43
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,570
Ahh..he said he has a cold.

44
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,570
Team has a cold?

45
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,260
Yes it's true.

46
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,540
He texted me to take leave
for both classes and the club.

47
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,360
Then...

48
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I will get going.

49
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,280
Hang on!

50
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,260
What's up, sick boy?

51
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
Shit!

52
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,260
Let me in!

53
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,680
How come you're here?

54
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,090
You friend said that you're sick,
so I come here to pay a visit.

55
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,690
And what do you actually have?

56
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,240
Nothing.

57
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
I'm just being lazy.

58
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Wanna sleep. Get it?

59
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,220
You may leave now.

60
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,930
Just lazy, really?

61
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,530
Hia!

62
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,400
Um.

63
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,410
Thought you're here just to visit me.
You're done now, you can go.

64
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,130
I bought some food to eat too.
Can't you see?

65
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,490
You can eat back at your own dorm.

66
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,890
I bought this for you too.

67
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,380
Come on.

68
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Eat!

69
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,280
How is this possible to be food for a sick person?

70
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
It's all spicy.

71
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,500
Just eat the damn food.

72
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,890
Are you gonna eat or not?

73
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,420
Fine. I'll eat.

74
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,970
Wait...

75
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,840
and how do you know where my room is?

76
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,700
- Dean.
- Yeah?

77
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Where did you keep the sign-up paper?

78
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,080
Why do you need it?

79
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,760
Just tell me.

80
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm not gonna do anything weird.

81
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,660
There.

82
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
The top drawer.

83
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,660
Thank you dude.

84
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,400
Swimming Club Registration Form.
Pinyo University.

85
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,650
Did you find the person you're looking for?

86
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,960
What are you talking about?

87
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,850
You abused the authority.

88
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,850
Ow.

89
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,340
Hia!

90
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,970
Shut up.

91
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,480
Just eat the food.

92
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Why do you care about it so much?

93
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,090
I have to be responsible of what I did.

94
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,940
If it's about that,

95
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,940
I can handle it myself.

96
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,690
Then what does it have to be?

97
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,690
So I can be in your room?

98
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
And how did you get into the building?

99
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
You need a keycard to get in.

100
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,720
I also live here.

101
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Room 1010.

102
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,060
Shit.

103
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,020
Destiny.

104
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Don't you think?

105
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,360
What destiny?

106
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
More like karma leads to me.

107
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,600
Eat up.

108
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,080
- Just in time!
-Hi!

109
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,080
Because you were the one eating!

110
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,740
Let's check attendance.

111
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,280
Kittisak.

112
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,060
Kanyarat.

113
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,440
We're late.

114
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
- Kasidith
- Here.

115
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,040
- Teep.
- Here.

116
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,540
- Panupat.
- Here.

117
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,140
Pusith.

118
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,340
Hey!

119
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,540
Do you think Team will be at the club this evening?

120
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,300
I don't know.

121
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
I texted him, but he didn't reply.

122
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,410
I don't know why Win is pissed so much.

123
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,120
If Team's gonna skip the club,
I think I would skip too.

124
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
I think I might just skip it.

125
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,730
Miss the training together,

126
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,080
so we can make-up for it together later.
I think it's better that way.

127
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
This is really your thought?

128
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
But I heard

129
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Phruek said that today...

130
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Win is not gonna be at the club either.

131
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,080
Really?

132
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,180
That's a relief.

133
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,570
I'm not sure what he usually eats,

134
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,080
to make him has such a sharp tongue

135
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,820
and stay moody all day like that.

136
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,130
It's because of you.

137
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,020
If you didn't do anything wrong,
why would he be moody?

138
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,360
Yeah you're right.

139
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,650
Sea!

140
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,650
You also got scolded at just like me.

141
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,650
How dare you to talk like that?

142
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,650
I forgot.

143
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,650
Pawee.

144
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,360
Pawee Kamweerasakul.

145
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,360
Are you here?

146
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Any of his friends here?

147
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Is he gonna attend the class still?

148
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,820
- Since the term starts,
- Who could be under the desk?

149
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
I haven’t seen his face before.

150
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,210
- Who? I’ve never seen him before.
- If anybody knows him, please tell him

151
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,810
That if he misses one more class.

152
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,810
- He will get an F.
-Get an F?

153
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,300
Who’s that guy?

154
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,490
Should I get an F with this Pawee then?

155
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Sounds so familiar…Pawee.

156
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
So why did you have to skip school?

157
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,780
I'm just lazy.

158
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,500
Skip because of laziness,
I kinda understand.

159
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
But someone like you
who loves swimming

160
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
wouldn’t skip the club, don’t you think?

161
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,640
I’m just lazy, Hia.

162
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Do you know what it means to be lazy?

163
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,580
Not because you’re trying to avoid me?

164
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,020
Or because…

165
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,540
Stop right there.

166
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,540
If you’re gonna talk about that.

167
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
One more thing,

168
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,140
I don’t have a reason to avoid you at all.

169
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,450
Why?

170
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,450
Or you feel bad about that night?

171
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,329
It’s not like that.

172
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,050
Then that means it was nice.

173
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,560
Don’t think highly for yourself.

174
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,450
Hey!

175
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,450
You didn’t say you feel bad about it.

176
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,450
So that means you feel good about it, doesn’t it?

177
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,450
Hmm?

178
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,280
Hey!

179
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,220
You’re full now.
Go back to your dorm already.

180
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,720
Whyy?

181
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
I came here to check on you.

182
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
But you push me away like I'm nothing.

183
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,260
Go.
Go back to your room.

184
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Wait.

185
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
What is it, Hia?

186
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,920
But for me it was really nice.

187
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,140
and I also liked it

188
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,140
when you call me Hia Win.

189
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,940
Go! Go back to your room.

190
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Go.

191
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
- My bag!
- Right!

192
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,770
Go.

193
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,930
Don’t you like it?

194
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,930
Ugh.

195
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,660
You talk too much, Hia.

196
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Go.

197
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,340
Get a grip, Team.

198
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,700
Hey Win!

199
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,530
What are you doing on this floor?
Isn’t your room upstairs?

200
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,530
Mind your own business.

201
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,660
T-rex! You shoot them!

202
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,260
Left to the left.

203
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,180
Saw it?

204
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
You’re a grown up now,

205
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,180
But still playing games?

206
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,940
Hello dad.

207
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,940
Waan.

208
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,170
Calm down.

209
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,170
Both of you.

210
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,050
Acting like this,

211
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,050
how can we rely on you when we’re older?

212
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,620
You should stop acting like a child already.

213
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
I’m tired of talking about all these.

214
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,460
If you're free,
you should do something useful for family business instead.

215
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,940
Not just following my orders and that’s it.

216
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,480
That’s all I can do as you can see.

217
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
If you want more than this,

218
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,600
you might have to sleep and dream about it instead.

219
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,340
Waan!

220
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,860
Calm down guys.

221
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,860
Our son iust graduated.

222
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
It might take some times to adjust,

223
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,970
for him to take over and manage the company.

224
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,520
I’ve been calmed for so many years already.

225
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,920
I might really have to send him
to work at the resort.

226
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,890
At least he might have been
more grown up that way.

227
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,610
But from what I’ve seen,

228
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,200
he already tries and works so hard.

229
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,760
Cause he has you who always spoil him.

230
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
that’s why he’s like this.

231
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
Shit!

232
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,020
I forgot to turn off the mic!?

233
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,500
T-Rex!

234
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Did you hear all of it?

235
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,500
Yeah…

236
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,400
but I can’t tell anyone anyways.

237
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,260
Even I want to, but I can’t

238
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,720
cause I don’t really know who you are.

239
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Only...

240
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,720
Only what?

241
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Only I know that your name is…

242
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,520
Waan.

243
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Right?

244
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,520
Don’t be nosy.

245
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,160
Is there anything you would like to tell me?

246
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
I’m a good listener.

247
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,240
Why do I have to tell a stranger my personal matter?

248
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Think about it again,

249
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
If you tell me,

250
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,240
I would just listen only.

251
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,240
I cannot really gossip with anyone.

252
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,740
because I don’t know you.

253
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,740
You’d get that stuff off your chest.

254
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,740
I’d get to snoop on your personal matter.

255
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,660
And everything is over. Win-win situation.

256
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,560
I’m such a bad elder brother.

257
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,560
No.

258
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,770
No matter how hard I try, it’s never enough for them.

259
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,060
Have you ever talked to them openly?

260
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,600
That’s all I'm gonna tell you for today.

261
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,610
Can you log into the game already?
If not, I’ll go play with others.

262
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,960
Yeah yeah.

263
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,130
I’m logging in now.

264
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,610
Oh Hia!

265
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,220
What are you doing?

266
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
I’m going with you.

267
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,000
Where’s your bike?

268
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,700
Gas is expensive.

269
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
We are going to the same place!
Be generous!

270
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,160
An heir of a resort like you?

271
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Concern about gas price?

272
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,260
Did you spy on me?

273
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,960
I will try to lie better next time.

274
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,700
It’s okay Pharm.

275
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,020
Pharm!

276
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,020
Oh hello Dean.

277
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,800
Pharm.

278
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
How are you?

279
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,800
Are you feeling better?

280
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,220
I’m fine now.

281
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,720
Hello Dean.

282
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,180
Thought you said…

283
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
Team’s gonna pick you up?

284
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,740
Well...he woke up late today.

285
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
It's more convenient to come by myself.

286
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,880
Then…

287
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
don’t forget to tell him about tomorrow.

288
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,880
I'm gonna get going.

289
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,170
Good bye.

290
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,960
So!?

291
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Tell us now!

292
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,160
Yesterday...

293
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
when I separated from you to go home,

294
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,530
there was an explosive sound,

295
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,530
I was panicked

296
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,530
and my symptoms were acting up.

297
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,120
Dean found me in that condition, so he helped me.

298
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,920
And took me to the hospital.

299
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,530
And...

300
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,530
are you alright now?

301
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,540
I'm fine.

302
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,770
I'd also be fine if I got to sit back and relax.

303
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,520
But Dean insisted,

304
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
so he took me to see the doctor.

305
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,220
Whoa...

306
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,130
Pharm.

307
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,140
Next time, if somethings happened,
please call me!

308
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,140
If we didn't meet Dean today,

309
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,140
you wouldn't tell us about this right?

310
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,740
That was too risky.

311
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,660
If Dean didn't see you, what would happen?

312
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,250
I'm sorry.

313
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,600
I will tell you everything next time
when things happen.

314
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,620
Please don't be mad at me.
Please.

315
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,360
Promise me first.

316
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,980
I promise.

317
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,480
Promise!

318
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,210
You really need to tell us.

319
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,210
Yeah just tell us anything.

320
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,210
- Got it?
- I got it.

321
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,860
Oh!

322
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,860
And what was it?

323
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,860
that he told you...

324
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,860
to tell me.

325
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,210
It's just...

326
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,800
that you don't have to come pick me up at my apartment.

327
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,570
because...

328
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,570
he will come pick me up instead.

329
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,210
What!?

330
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,210
But! Just one day.

331
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,210
Just one day.

332
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,660
I just wanna make some breakfast to thank him.

333
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,680
Hmm?

334
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
I hope it's really just breakfast.

335
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,210
It is just that, Manow!

336
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,100
What about you, Team?

337
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
What's the matter with you this morning?
You look grumpy.

338
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,480
Yeah.

339
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,440
Someone messed with me a little.

340
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,800
Huh?

341
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Who dares to do that to Team?

342
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,900
Why? Are you gonna handle him for me?

343
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
- That's fine.
- No.

344
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,800
I'm gonna go thank him. He did a good job.

345
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
He did for us...on our behalf.

346
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,240
You always mock other people.

347
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
What about you, yourself?

348
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,340
People can see you yesterday. You know.

349
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,280
I was just accidentally met Phruek in front of the uni.

350
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
And he asked me to have a meal wit him.

351
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
I was hungry so I just went with him.

352
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
After the meal, we went on our own way.

353
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
And he walked me to the bus stop.

354
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,200
That's all. That's all really.

355
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,640
No LINE exchange.
No phone number. Nothing. I swear.

356
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Manow.

357
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,980
That's why you didn't walk home with me.

358
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,650
A told me you went and told them about my leave.

359
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,650
He said he just saw you talked to Phruek like...

360
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,650
shyly. That' it.

361
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,820
aah!

362
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Tell us everything now!

363
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,160
I told you guys everything.

364
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
I made up some stories. Even exaggerating a little.

365
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,330
I told you everything.

366
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,340
I was kidding. There's nothing.

367
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,420
Why are their records not so good?

368
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,160
I think we need to change training strategy.

369
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,160
Yeah.

370
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,160
Then...

371
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
I will leave it to you, Phruek, and Tul to handle.

372
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,410
Dean.

373
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,740
Pharm wanted me to give you this.

374
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
Oh.

375
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,700
Why didn't he give it to me himself just now?

376
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
He was probably too nervous and forgot.

377
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,300
Thanks Pharm for me.

378
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Sure.

379
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,340
Since when did you become close with Pharm?

380
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Made you some breakfast too.

381
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,370
I'll tell you about it later.

382
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,530
Where's mine?

383
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,000
Is your name 'Dean'?

384
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,540
Pharm specifically made this for Dean only.

385
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,460
Hey Hia!

386
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
That's my breakfast.

387
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,400
Calm down.

388
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
What time is your class?

389
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,920
9.

390
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,920
Good.

391
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,920
Come have breakfast with me first then.

392
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
You go by yourself. I’m not going, Hia!

393
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,380
Hia!

394
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,930
You add on seasoning very little.

395
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,540
Hurry up and eat.

396
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Stop observing me.

397
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,500
Eat up boy, so you can grow more.

398
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Who’s your boy?

399
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,860
Oh you learn to have breakfast now?

400
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
Normally you just drink coffee.

401
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,500
You too.

402
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Know how to wake up early too?

403
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,060
This is the first year from our club, right?

404
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,060
I remember him.

405
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,700
What did he do
to make you have breakfast?

406
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,220
He’s hungry. That’s why I brought him here.

407
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,300
This one…

408
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,300
is the one that’s really good.

409
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
And his name is Team right?

410
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,450
Yeah.

411
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,900
Keep it up bro!

412
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
So you can become the successor after Win.

413
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,170
It’s rare that
we find him liking someone.

414
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,280
I will put the plate away first. See you in the class.

415
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Yeah.

416
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,780
What’s the matter? Why are you so quiet?

417
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,500
Nothing.

418
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
What time is your class?

419
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,500
9am just like you.

420
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,640
We still have some time left to talk.

421
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,940
Hia…

422
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,940
you’re very good at taking care of other people.

423
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,840
You’ve been observing me?

424
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,540
I can tell even I don’t observe.

425
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Carrying the plate for me,

426
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,540
opening the bottle cap,

427
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,760
taking me to eat,

428
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
and even paid for me.

429
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,659
Maybe because I’m the middle child.

430
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,580
Middle child?

431
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,850
Yeah.

432
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,850
I have one elder brother and one younger brother.

433
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,850
Both are so stupid.

434
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,850
So I always have to take care of them.

435
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,850
What about you?

436
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,980
Me?

437
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,980
Yeah…any siblings?

438
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,460
Not really.

439
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,500
I bleached my hair blonde first…

440
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
then got some tattoos.

441
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,530
because I wanted to get some attention.

442
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,620
Wow Hia. You are such a child.

443
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
Yeah I actually was a child back then.

444
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
Rebellious stage, get it?

445
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,800
Parents always care about my siblings.

446
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,850
I skipped school many times in 9 grade
til I got called in the principal office.

447
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,440
In high school,

448
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,160
I started dying my hair, piercing my ears,

449
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,160
and then tattoos.

450
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,960
But fortunately, I’m pretty smart.

451
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
My grades were good.

452
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,450
Won many gold medals in academic competitions.

453
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,880
I can also play basketball.

454
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,460
Good at swimming too.

455
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
so I didn’t get any punishment.

456
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,810
Enough.

457
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,360
Stop complimenting yourself. I’m begging you.

458
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,770
I’m telling the truth.

459
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,770
But my dad kinda knew what was going on,

460
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,120
so he openly talked to me.

461
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,120
Talked it through and love each other the same.

462
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,400
Are you sure?

463
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
You still have tattoos all over the body.

464
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,610
People with tattoos,

465
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,610
that doesn’t mean they are always troublemakers.

466
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,600
I like tattooing

467
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
because I wanna show my identity.

468
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,970
Um.

469
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,440
I have some on my stomach.

470
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
You have seen it before.

471
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,440
I never have!

472
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,400
Everyone has seen it!

473
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
The whole club has seen it.

474
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,850
Oh right.

475
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,360
But the tattoo below the swim trunk,
only you who have seen it.

476
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,360
Are you full, Hia? I’m full now.

477
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,360
Why do you have to talk abouts that?

478
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,500
The professor hasn’t come yet?

479
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,500
Do you see him?

480
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,500
Smart mouth!

481
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,920
And where’s Dean?

482
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Still haven’t seen him.

483
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,820
And how was it with him?

484
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,820
Your noodle was probably so sweet huh?

485
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,180
That was a loud slap.

486
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
Shut up.

487
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,160
Are you for real?

488
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,160
What?

489
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,660
He’s a kid from our club.

490
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
- Dean said it before, didn’t he?
- Yeah.

491
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,660
I know.

492
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,240
I know what I’m doing.

493
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
Up to you then.

494
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,080
Hia.

495
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,490
You came out of where again!

496
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,490
You scared me!

497
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,490
Don’t be a chicken.

498
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,490
What are you doing here?

499
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,300
Why?

500
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,240
Why? You dad built this place?
Am I not allowed to get in?

501
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,090
What’s your latest record? Is it up to the criteria.

502
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,250
Better than the criteria.

503
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,920
Make sure you can keep this momentum going.

504
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,600
But…

505
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
I’m still nervous every time I swim.

506
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,810
Hia what are you doing?

507
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,060
I’m trying to be supportive.

508
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,420
Hia!

509
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,730
Why?

510
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,730
What do you think I was gonna give you?

511
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,730
Nothing.

512
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,520
Yeah.

513
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,900
When're you gonna announce
who is uni representative?

514
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,540
In a day or two I think.

515
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,200
Let me handle some stuff first.

516
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,260
I will leave early today.

517
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,980
I have an errand to run.

518
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,980
Take care the rest for me.

519
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,410
You wanna leave early today?

520
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,800
Is something wrong with you?

521
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,580
Hey!

522
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,580
And where are you going Phruek?

523
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,330
Oh well…

524
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,640
I have some stuff.

525
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
Well…

526
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Watch them train for me.

527
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,640
I’m leaving.

528
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,540
What the hell?

529
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,540
Hey you guys!
What do you wanna do with the project?

530
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,040
They want us to work in pairs.

531
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,040
But we have 3 people.

532
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,040
I’ll pair up with A.

533
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
- I will!
- Let me pair up with A!

534
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
I don’t know anyone else. Please let me pair up with A.

535
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
Let me pair up with A, please.

536
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Ugh! Stop arguing!

537
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,620
I will go ask the professor
to work in a group of 3 instead.

538
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,620
Might have to hand in 2 works.

539
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,200
Fine 2 it is.

540
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,480
Yeah.

541
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
We’ve known each other for awhile already.

542
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,610
Never knew what do you guys study?

543
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,260
Communication Art.

544
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
All 3 of you?

545
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
Yes.

546
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,740
Actually…

547
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,740
I want to study in Com. Art anyway.

548
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,740
But these two…

549
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Hang on to my legs and follow me.

550
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,740
Like some ticks.

551
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,650
Ticks? Thats too much. Maybe just fleas?

552
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,650
If you have ticks that means you’re like a dog!

553
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,100
Do wanna work by yourself?

554
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,100
Want a head slap?

555
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,730
Hey!

556
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,730
If you’re done warming up
then jump in the water.

557
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,730
Stop chitchatting.

558
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,460
Today...

559
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,460
I will record everyone’s times.

560
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,420
Oh Hia!

561
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
Why don’t you tell us in advance to prepare?

562
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,380
It doesn’t matter when.

563
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,920
It depends on your fitness and your determination.

564
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,920
If you’re ready, go stand by.

565
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,970
Manow.

566
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,960
Hey!

567
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Are you in a hurry to somewhere?

568
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,560
I’m hurry to see you.

569
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
To see me?

570
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,530
Err…

571
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,400
How’s the casting?

572
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,840
You remember it?

573
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,660
It’s actually not that big of a deal.

574
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,500
Why would you say that?

575
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
Yesterday you were not like this.

576
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,730
You were more excited yesterday!

577
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,980
To be honest,

578
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,520
I’m not as pretty as other friends.

579
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,290
I thought I was actually gonna got cast for the role.

580
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,290
But what really happened,

581
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,640
was they chose people they already have in mind
to play anyway.

582
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,850
And I ended up,

583
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,850
playing as a rock.

584
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,850
Are you kidding me?

585
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,460
No I’m not.

586
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,460
I got assigned to work backstage with all the props.

587
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,090
I would be on the stage
when I go set up only.

588
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:28,130
But the stage is also important.

589
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,380
Wait and see I will make the stage looks the best I could.

590
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,160
Oh Manow.

591
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,160
Are you hungry?

592
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,440
A bit.

593
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,290
There’s a chicken noodle place nearby. It’s really good.

594
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,290
Just this side of the uni.

595
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,370
Do you like it?

596
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,850
I do. I really like…

597
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,850
the chicken feet to be super soft!

598
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:03,730
Show me your soft feet.

599
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,730
- Soft feet?
- Like this.

600
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,690
How?

601
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,690
Like this and suck on it too.

602
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,740
I’m kidding. Let’s go eat.

603
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,740
Do like this when you walk.

604
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,740
Why do I have to do that?

605
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,740
And where you did you just come from?

606
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,740
The club?

607
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,540
I’m so exhausting today. I wanna die.

608
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,170
It’s like my legs are gonna fall off the joint.

609
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,170
Why are you complaining? Go get your stuff.

610
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,600
So we can go back and sleep.

611
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,600
Why do you complain so much?

612
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,200
You’re done?

613
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,570
I’m waiting for you now

614
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,570
So shall we go?

615
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,280
Oh what about you, Team?

616
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,280
How do you go back?
Do you wanna go together?

617
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,860
It’s okay. I drove.

618
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,970
Do you wanna walk to your car together?

619
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,940
I have to wait for a friend..

620
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,940
You guys go ahead. I’m fine.

621
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,410
Okay Team…

622
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,050
- We will go then. - Yeah.

623
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,080
See you tomorrow.

624
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,080
- See you.
- Ok bye.

625
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,080
Waiting for a friend?
We're also his friends?

626
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,880
Who is he waiting for?

627
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,120
I'll wait outside.

628
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,120
If you are too slow,
find a way home yourself.

629
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,100
Hia.

630
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,100
I'm so damn tired today.

631
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,100
Don't be a loser.

632
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,100
Come.

633
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,740
Can I kiss you?

634
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,080
There's a camera here.

635
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,330
Let's go back inside.

636
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,650
Nobody's gonna see us, right?

637
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,980
No.

638
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,980
What if there is?

639
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,980
There's no one.

640
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,120
You know so well.

641
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,120
Probably do this a lot?

642
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,300
You are the club vice president.

643
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,300
But you break the rules yourself.

644
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,600
I never brought anyone here.

645
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,050
Let me ask you something.

646
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:47,280
Our relationship right now...

647
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,400
we both are beneficial from it, aren't we?

648
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Nobody got taken advantage of, right?

649
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,520
Yes we are.

650
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,300
What if i got bored?

651
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,130
Then we'll breakup.

652
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,710
Team! Team!

653
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,710
We're going to have

654
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,770
a competition for 1st year student soon.

655
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,630
I recommend you all to attend.

656
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,370
Couldn't sleep again last night?

657
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:46,190
It's getting close to the competition though.

658
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,410
Team.
