1
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,450
Did you find the person you’re looking for?

2
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,570
You abused your power of authority.

3
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:18,160
Or you feel bad about that night?

4
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,410
But for me it was nice.

5
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,920
I’m such a bad elder brother.

6
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,340
Anything you wanna tell me?

7
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,300
I’m a good listener.

8
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,390
You are the vice club president,

9
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,560
but you break the rules yourself.

10
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,990
I’m gonna go rest a bit.

11
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,990
Yeah.

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,920
What the hell is wrong with you, Team?

13
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,780
Nothing.

14
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,250
I just wanna exercise.

15
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,250
Why?

16
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,950
Can we just go to the club already?

17
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,950
We could be late for the class again.

18
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,620
If you already skipped then just skip!

19
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,820
Why do we have to go back there again?

20
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,620
I wanna go take a shower there.

21
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,620
Are you really gonna...

22
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,350
go to class so stink like this?

23
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,490
And what is going on?

24
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,190
Why did you ask me
to skip the club with you?

25
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm bored.

26
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,490
Aren't you bored
being in the club everyday?

27
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,210
I just wanna change the routine.

28
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,060
Why?

29
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,210
Do you have a problem with that?

30
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,510
Did you eat something
that makes you moody?

31
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,440
Huh?

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
What's wrong?

33
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,380
Let's go.

34
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,390
Do you gonna shower?

35
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,690
I'll ask the seniors
from basketball club for you.

36
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,190
Do you gonna shower, right?

37
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,060
Pack your stuff.

38
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,300
I'm leaving guys.

39
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,300
But this evening
you have to be at the club, alright?

40
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,640
- Sea.
- Hmm?

41
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,140
Is Bee gonna be in the class?

42
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,140
or is he gonna skip?

43
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,650
He said he would.

44
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,530
He just skipped for Team.

45
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,950
Yeah and what's wrong with him?

46
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,390
Don't know why
he suddenly wanted to skip.

47
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,750
Why is he skipping?

48
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,430
Thanks for dropping me off.

49
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,460
And you're gonna be at the club
this evening?

50
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,320
Still thinking?

51
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,970
How can you still thinking?

52
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,500
You need to be there.

53
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
If you're not there,

54
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Win is gonna eat you alive.

55
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,740
I know.

56
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
I gotta go.

57
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,620
See you. Ride safely.

58
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,620
Sure.

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,390
I'm sorry. Are you alright?

60
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm alright.

61
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,190
Shit.

62
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,940
Why is he here?

63
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,320
Bee!

64
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,830
Bee...wait for me.

65
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,560
I'm going with you. My class got cancelled.

66
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
- Can I go sit in with you?
- Sure.

67
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:01,030
Today we'll talk about documentary movies.

68
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,770
Documentary movies...

69
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,210
I thought you said he's gonna come.

70
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,080
He said so.

71
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,490
Where's he?

72
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,490
Where's he?

73
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,210
Over there.

74
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,210
There he is.

75
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,550
Why is Team here?

76
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,680
I don't know.

77
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,660
Anybody doesn't understand?

78
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,260
You ask him.

79
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,909
Let's check attendance.

80
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,409
Why are you here?

81
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,390
Shut up.

82
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,810
I'm gonna watch anime.

83
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,810
You should just focus on the class.

84
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,810
What!?

85
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,940
Hey!

86
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,940
Why are you at my faculty?

87
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,710
You too.

88
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,710
Just shut up.

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,710
Wow.

90
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,020
Hey Team.

91
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,870
This morning when you skipped the club,

92
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,870
Win almost ate me alive.

93
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,500
Yeah I skipped.

94
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,640
And why did he have to eat you alive?

95
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Am I supposed to know?

96
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,260
You look like Mochi probably.

97
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Mochi. Mochi.

98
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,680
- Mochi?
- Pawee.

99
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,180
Pawee Tumweerasakul.

100
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,050
Does anyone know him?

101
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,810
Please tell him to go drop the class
and take it again next term.

102
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,450
Pawee is here.

103
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,740
I thought you already dropped out
of the class.

104
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,770
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,520
And where have you been?

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,000
Are you aware that
if you missed the class one more time,

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you'll get an F.

108
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,460
I am aware.

109
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,810
Even if you're an actor,

110
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,210
for my class,

111
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,940
you don't have the privilege
over other people.

112
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,600
Finally I can see his face.

113
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,660
Hey!

114
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,990
Your faculty has an actor too?

115
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,929
To be honest,

116
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,780
I just knew now.

117
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,780
Me too.

118
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,400
I never thought that way, professor.

119
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,159
You can assign me
some make-up assignments.

120
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,160
But please do not give me an F.

121
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,740
I do have some works for you,

122
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
but you need to pair up with your friends.

123
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,260
Can I work on my own?

124
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,980
No, you cannot.

125
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,010
You have to do the same as your friends.

126
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,010
But Miss...

127
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,010
I don't know anyone from the section.

128
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,010
One more thing,

129
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,210
they might already all paired up already.

130
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,460
Shit guys...

131
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,700
Why?

132
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,220
When you jumped on my bike,

133
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,530
I almost crashed the bike into him.

134
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,820
Shit really?

135
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,010
Yeah.

136
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,250
I told you.

137
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,920
You have to work in pairs
just like your friends.

138
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,720
But...

139
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,620
He can pair up with me.

140
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,280
What's wrong?

141
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,250
Nothing.

142
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,840
This morning,

143
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,100
you didn't have breakfast that boy.

144
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,840
Did you dump him already?

145
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,980
Don't talk about him like that again.

146
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980
He's a kid from the club.

147
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,620
But he is the only kid from the club,

148
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,780
that can make you be this grumpy.

149
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,380
What are you talking about?

150
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,230
You're like this...

151
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,230
not because of
Team was skipping the club?

152
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,780
Dean!

153
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,960
If it's not like what Dean said,

154
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,760
you can just deny it.

155
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Just deny it.

156
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,220
Stop minding my business.

157
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,690
Team, I leave my stuff here with you.
I'll be back.

158
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,110
Do you remember me?

159
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,610
I almost crashed into your just now.

160
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,500
Well...

161
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,760
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,490
That's fine.

163
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,850
But...

164
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,850
I can really pair up with you?

165
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,580
Sure.

166
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,750
I just told her you can.

167
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,030
But...

168
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,030
I'm pretty busy.

169
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,100
I'm afraid
I might be a burden for you.

170
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,030
What? Why do you think that way?

171
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,910
Let's put it this way,

172
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,030
take this opportunity as my apology

173
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,930
that I almost crashed you.

174
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,790
My group has 3 people.

175
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,450
And asked her to work on 2 pieces of work.

176
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,370
So if we have 4,

177
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,420
it's even more efficient.

178
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,070
But I'm really busy. Really.

179
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,850
So if you wanna meet up to work on the project,

180
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,850
It's impossible.

181
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,190
It's okay.

182
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,780
If you're not convenient on this project,

183
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,840
I'll do it for you.

184
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,060
For other projects, we can discuss later.

185
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,550
Are you sure?

186
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,550
I don't wanna be your burden.

187
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,680
Give me a sec.

188
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,150
Yes, P'Tum.

189
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,320
You need to be on the set ASAP.

190
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,620
I'll send the car to pick you up.

191
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,110
But I told you before,

192
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,110
that I have to be in the class today.

193
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,370
You can study whenever.

194
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,290
But opportunities don't always arise.

195
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,610
I told you,
if you decided to be in the industry

196
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,200
work is your top priority.

197
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,380
Fine.

198
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,800
Then...

199
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,730
I'll go wait downstairs.

200
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,730
What's up?

201
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,570
I have to go to work again.

202
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,940
By the way,

203
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,700
what's your name?

204
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
I'm Bumblebee.

205
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,700
Or you can just call me Bee.

206
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,060
Um.

207
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,060
I'm Prince.

208
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,400
Well,

209
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,630
about the pair work,

210
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,630
you can't change your mind okay?

211
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,860
I gotta go.

212
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,860
- Thank you so much Bumblebee.
- Um.

213
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,860
Bye.

214
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,890
Bee.

215
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,550
What did you just talk to him?

216
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,550
Why did he walk away like that?

217
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,220
He just went to work.

218
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,200
Oh guys.

219
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,200
The pair work...

220
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I'll be working with Prince by the way.

221
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,920
Huh.

222
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
You call him like
you're super close to him.

223
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,590
Like you've known each other for 3 years.

224
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,590
Not bad at all.

225
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,170
What are you guys talking about?

226
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,170
But...

227
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,170
you need to help me on this project anyway, A.

228
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,380
What?

229
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,760
Why me?

230
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,860
You have your own pair already,
then go work with him.

231
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,060
Yeah.

232
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,520
I'm not helping you.

233
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,760
You can't refuse me.

234
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,640
Why?
What are you gonna do?

235
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,040
Because...

236
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,700
I'll beg you to do it.

237
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,680
Whatever you want

238
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,320
jasmine,

239
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,220
sun flower,

240
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,650
paper flower...anything just let me know.

241
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,860
I want flowers...

242
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,280
from the Everest.

243
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
- Can you do that?
- You've got any from the Everest?

244
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,720
You need to help me, A.

245
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,530
Don't just sit there and listen.

246
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,850
So why are you at my faculty.

247
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,700
My class is cancel.

248
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,470
I just come here to chill.

249
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,470
Any problem?

250
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,880
You have to prepare your proper answer for skipped the club.

251
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,460
Or...

252
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,260
Or what?

253
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,740
Or...

254
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,390
You're gonna be in trouble by Win!

255
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,600
How come?

256
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Bee also skipped the club with me.

257
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,160
You guys cannot threaten just only me.

258
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,410
He is not my father.

259
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,170
Nor mother.

260
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,940
Why do I have to be afraid of him?

261
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,860
I really want a playback.

262
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,980
He's not the father.

263
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,640
Nor the mother.

264
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,280
Why do I have to be afraid of him?

265
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,800
I wanna laugh so much.

266
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,140
You're such a chicken.

267
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,810
I'm asking you
why did you skip the club?

268
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,390
You're avoiding me.

269
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,380
I'm not.

270
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,260
Hey!

271
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,280
If you're ready,
go to the starting block.

272
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,859
We'll record the time again today.

273
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,099
Ughhh.

274
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:09,460
Come on.

275
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:09,960
Get up.

276
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,060
Quickly!

277
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,560
Go.

278
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,119
Hey.

279
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,920
Are you gonna let me wear my pants?

280
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,300
Why are you in such a hurry, Team?

281
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,300
Can I go back with you?

282
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
I...

283
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,900
don't wanna walk
to the parking lot alone.

284
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,360
We're going for some drinks.

285
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,010
and...

286
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,940
didn't drive either.

287
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,160
I'll go with you guys.

288
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,240
You wanna go?

289
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,960
Hey.

290
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,420
You act a little weird today, Team.

291
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,260
What's the matter?

292
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,560
Are you guys crazy?

293
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,130
I just wanna go out for drinks.

294
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,600
Leave the car here.

295
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,180
I'll come get it in the morning.

296
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,050
You can tell us everything,
you know that right?

297
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,640
You guys should hurry and change.

298
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,420
Yeah finish it now.

299
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,680
So slow cause you're busy playing.

300
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,400
It's you!

301
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,700
You're the one hitting me. I couldn't wore my pants.

302
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,140
You guys just hurry up!

303
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
I'm done. Go.

304
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,750
Hey wear your pants first!

305
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,490
Are we leaving?

306
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,700
Hey. Why so hurry?

307
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,940
Really?

308
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,060
And he said...

309
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,980
he didn't try to avoid me, really?

310
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,580
Hurry!

311
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Wait for sec!

312
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,260
Wow.

313
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,040
You're drunk already, Team?

314
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,170
You're such a baby.

315
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,160
Yeah.

316
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm not drunk.

317
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Who's drunk?

318
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,340
Huh.

319
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,040
No one.

320
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Win: Where are you?

321
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,760
Who can possibly do that?

322
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,300
You guys.

323
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,540
What?

324
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,380
Can I ask you something?

325
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,840
Do you think...

326
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,700
what kind of a person he is
...Hia Win?

327
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,660
Err...

328
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,000
Why do you call him Hia?

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah.

330
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,420
Where are you right now?

331
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,470
Win's room.

332
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,520
And lastly,

333
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,030
who is this person...

334
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,520
right in front of you?

335
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,040
P'Win...

336
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,630
Call me Hia Win.

337
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,830
Hia Win.

338
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,840
Come on.

339
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,620
I already used to call him that.

340
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,900
And what do you think...

341
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,400
What kind of a person he is to you?

342
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,180
Umm...

343
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,170
I don't know.

344
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,220
I never really talked to him.

345
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,590
Sometimes,

346
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,640
he looks mean.

347
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,890
Sometimes,

348
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,060
he looks calm.

349
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,910
But...

350
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,730
I heard that so many girls like him.

351
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,240
Um.

352
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,480
Hmm?

353
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,800
What?

354
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,900
Is there a lot?

355
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,480
Yeah.

356
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,290
Even the girls from my faculty know him too.

357
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,690
I think

358
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,200
He is like the one.

359
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,570
Like the cool one?

360
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,500
Super cool.

361
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,580
The cool one?

362
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,440
He's not that cool.

363
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,060
What do you mean?

364
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,620
Woahh.

365
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,240
I'll pour it for you.

366
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,120
Go. Walk.

367
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,940
Walk properly.

368
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,280
The door. The door.

369
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,500
A B C D E F G.

370
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,580
How are you going back?

371
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,670
How are you going home?

372
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,550
Win.

373
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,900
Hello!

374
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,290
You guys!

375
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,860
Who let him go?

376
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,310
Who let go of his body?

377
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,060
- Who let go of you?
- What the hell are you guys doing?

378
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,670
Why are you guys freaking out?

379
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,160
Err...

380
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
So...

381
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,930
I'm just a senior from your club.

382
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,620
Not the owner of your life.

383
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,160
You don't have to be afraid of me.

384
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,190
Wow.

385
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,440
Looking so cold like that,

386
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,570
let me be afraid a bit.

387
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,200
See you at the club tomorrow morning.

388
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,440
If you can drink,

389
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,310
then you have to be responsible too.

390
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,710
Yes sir.

391
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,210
Hey!

392
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,900
Go. All of you.

393
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,820
I'll handle it from here.

394
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,660
Please take care of my friend.

395
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,780
Please take care of my friend.

396
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,740
Hia.

397
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,460
I don't wanna ride your bike.

398
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,880
The wind will blow in my face.

399
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,590
My eyes will get dried up.

400
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,310
Huh?

401
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,900
And why did you leave your car at the uni?

402
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,440
Huh?

403
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,690
What?

404
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,590
I can't hear you.

405
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,130
Why weren't you at the club
this morning?

406
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,080
You told me youself,

407
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,250
to rest.

408
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,440
So I am resting now.

409
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,740
Sleeping.

410
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,090
Resting so much, huh?

411
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,730
Who was it then playing...

412
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,360
basketball this morning?

413
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,920
Hmm?

414
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,010
Did you stalk me, Hia?

415
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,810
Huh?

416
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,030
I've got a friend in that club.

417
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,050
In case you might forget.

418
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,460
If you're not gonna show up, let me know beforehand.

419
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,190
I'm not gonna scold at you.

420
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,730
I don't have to tell you.

421
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,150
You don't take attendance anyway.

422
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,800
I was just worried.

423
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,200
And who are you?

424
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,430
Why do you have the right
to be worried about me?

425
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,060
Huh?

426
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,730
And who would I have to be?

427
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,140
So I can be protective over you.

428
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,340
I wanna go home.

429
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,100
Let's go.

430
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,500
Don't ride too fast.

431
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,410
Sure.

432
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,130
Why is it so tight?

433
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,130
Hop on.

434
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,980
Hop on.

435
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,020
Hang on tight, you could fall.

436
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,180
Yeah.

437
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,760
Hia...

438
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,940
Walk properly.

439
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,900
Yeah.

440
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,600
Ow Hia.

441
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,610
Where's the key?

442
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,560
In my pocket.

443
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,840
Give it to me.

444
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,560
Here.

445
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,000
That's your phone.

446
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,660
Here.

447
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,590
Open it.

448
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,580
I'll just do it myself.

449
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,090
Go take a shower.

450
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,640
You smell so drunk.

451
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,530
No.

452
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,040
I'm too lazy to shower.

453
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,990
You are so damn nasty.

454
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,440
If you're not gonna shower,
then go change.

455
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,420
No!

456
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,330
I'll leave now then.

457
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,180
[Panting]

458
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,480
Team!

459
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,320
Team!

460
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:11,980
Team!

461
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,990
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,290
Can you hear me?

463
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,790
I can't...

464
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,890
I can't breathe.

465
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,610
Team.

466
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,870
Team.

467
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,030
Hia!

468
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,580
What just happened?

469
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,350
I had a bad dream.

470
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,990
But...

471
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,090
I cannot remember

472
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,630
what I was dreaming.

473
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,650
Go take a shower.

474
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,710
Thank you, Hia.

475
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,630
You should go.

476
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,020
It's already late.

477
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,830
Let's go take a shower.

478
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,880
What happened there?

479
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,120
I cannot see it.

480
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,890
Looks like a bug bite.

481
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,660
Pharm.

482
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,340
Do you have something to eat?

483
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,730
Wow.

484
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,950
You're so cheerful.

485
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,400
There's fried rice.

486
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
Wow!

487
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,400
Looks so good, Pharm!

488
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,040
I'll just eat it then.

489
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,610
Yeah looks really good.

490
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,480
Easy there.

491
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,420
I'm gonna eat it now!

492
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,930
Go ahead.

493
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,970
Mmmm. Yummy!

494
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,700
You do eat a lot.

495
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,020
What can I do?

496
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,800
You need lots of energy
when you swim.

497
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,700
I also have to train this evening.

498
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,830
Just eat.

499
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,470
What kind of things are in the fried rice?

500
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,820
Oh!

501
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,130
This is the dessert.

502
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,130
I tried making it for the first time.

503
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,130
You guys should try it.

504
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,130
It looks beautiful.

505
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,910
What do you call this?

506
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,210
It's called Chor Muang.

507
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,410
You're so talented and also nice.

508
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,160
Wow. You're really good.

509
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
It looks difficult to make.

510
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,190
And...

511
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,810
what is this?

512
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,990
Team...

513
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,330
Fine!

514
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,390
But this one...

515
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,670
is for the president of swimming club. Is it?

516
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,950
Woww.

517
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,430
You guys are perfect together!

518
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,560
If you ended up with Dean,

519
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,370
it would probably...

520
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,820
be like a big brother,

521
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,510
and a younger brother.

522
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,980
- Right?
- There's no bigger and younger brother, Manow.

523
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,090
One more thing,

524
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,969
this is not only for Dean alone,

525
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,969
I made for everyone in the club too.

526
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,290
Hey!

527
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,500
Wait...

528
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,159
why didn't you make some for my club too?

529
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,980
And does your club...

530
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,980
have anyone named 'Dean'?

531
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,980
Oh right.

532
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,179
Or do I have to switch to swimming club?

533
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,780
so I can get to eat Pharm's stuff?

534
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,139
The club is only taking guys.

535
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,570
I just wanna have Chor Muang.

536
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,219
Here.

537
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,460
Made by you.

538
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,300
It's not the same.

539
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Can I have that box?

540
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,570
Where has he been?

541
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,990
Since last night...

542
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,770
Hello. Hello. Hello.

543
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,370
Where have you been?

544
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,080
I'm out of town,
checking on the resort

545
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,390
I arrived here last night, passed out and woke up just now.

546
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,210
What about you?

547
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,210
Just woke up or haven't slept at all?

548
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,220
You're an owner of a resort?

549
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,700
You must be rich.

550
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,830
Nosy about my personal matter again.

551
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,160
You're running a resort,

552
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,140
that means you've graduated.

553
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,890
Should I call you P'?
(used to call one who's older).

554
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,240
Whatever you'd like.

555
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,300
Come on. Let's play one round.
I'l have to work in a bit.

556
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,100
Sure, P'

557
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,170
Oh hey!

558
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,890
Be quiet.

559
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,340
As you all know,

560
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,150
we'll have an open house soon.

561
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,350
Our club,

562
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,480
- has agreed to do-
- the Dunk Tank Boys.

563
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,970
Wow.

564
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,080
Laugh about it now, those 1st year.

565
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,500
Since you guys are the majority
of people here

566
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,270
then...

567
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,370
you guys will be the one on the tunk.

568
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,550
Ughhh.

569
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,370
No.

570
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,650
I don't wanna show my body.

571
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,650
I haven't got any six pack.

572
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,000
You don't have any anyway.

573
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,050
Hey!

574
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,800
Enough.

575
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,130
Stop complaining.

576
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,490
Our work

577
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,810
is divided into 2 sections.

578
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,170
1st year, 2nd year.

579
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,490
you'll be switching shifts to work.

580
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,680
Do you understand?

581
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,430
Understood.

582
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,000
And those 2nd years, you'll decorate the booth and prepare materials.

583
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,060
3rd year will be reported to P'Phruek.

584
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,590
Manage and solve
on-site problems.

585
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,460
You'll stay
for another meeting after this.

586
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,630
For the budget,

587
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,290
if you need anything,

588
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,920
come reimburse from the vice president.

589
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,870
Understood?

590
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,000
Understood.

591
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,170
If you're done dividing people
into each shifts,

592
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,400
send me the name list too.

593
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,510
Team.

594
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,430
Yes?

595
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,310
Gather the name list for me.

596
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,140
Sure.

597
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,950
Another thing,

598
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,780
we'll have

599
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,530
an internal competition

600
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,940
looking for the representative

601
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,590
to compete with other universities.

602
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,030
All years are welcome to qualify.

603
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,350
For 1st year,

604
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,350
to gain more experience

605
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,680
I suggest you all to participate.

606
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,120
Let's swim, P'Ton!

607
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,670
Is that a good idea?

608
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,060
The pool is already closed.

609
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,970
That's even better.

610
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,450
So no other people will be here.

611
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,320
If mom finds out, she'll punish me.

612
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,450
Ugh P'Ton.

613
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,910
Let's compete with me.

614
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,350
Please Ton.

615
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,200
Fine.

616
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,200
But we need to warm up first.

617
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,280
P'Ton!

618
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,310
We've learned how to swim already. What are you afraid of?

619
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,010
Please Ton. Please.

620
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,730
Please.

621
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,520
Sure.

622
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Yayyy.

623
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,010
Team.

624
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,230
But just one hour.

625
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,550
Okay.

626
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,430
Having snacks since early morning?

627
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,320
Hia!

628
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,800
Showed up out of no where again.

629
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,860
You scared me.

630
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,560
I'll pay for him.

631
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,630
I should've brought 10 more.

632
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,900
Are you going to train this morning?

633
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,230
Yeah.

634
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,590
Couldn't sleep again last night?

635
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,020
It's getting close to the qualifying.

636
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,460
I know.

637
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,810
You're acting like a dad.

638
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,720
I'm just worried about you.

639
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:56,970
Yes, dad.

640
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,960
Whatever you wanna call me.

641
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,550
Daddy, husband or wifey.

642
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,310
Hia!

643
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,640
Here.

644
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,950
Stop complaining and take this.

645
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,990
I didn't buy it.

646
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,730
Eat more

647
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,540
so you can grow up, baby.

648
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,500
Take it.

649
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,560
Hia!

650
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,810
The time is not so good.

651
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,150
Normally, it's better than this.

652
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,570
Team.

653
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,600
Yes, Dean?

654
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,260
Your record is not so good.

655
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,530
Yes.

656
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,060
Get out of the water.

657
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,910
What's going on?

658
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,560
Probably because lack of training.

659
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:44,710
Um.

660
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,410
Your performance has dropped.

661
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,940
Train harder please.

662
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,670
It's getting close to the qualifying.

663
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,170
Sure bro.

664
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,400
You may go rest.

665
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,560
Faster!

666
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,830
So tired.

667
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,940
My arms are so sore.

668
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,870
Everything will be okay.

669
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,060
Maybe you're just tired.

670
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,050
What if I'm like this
during the qualifying,

671
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,490
what am I gonna do?

672
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,690
Hey.

673
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,410
Don't be too stressed out.

674
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,670
I'll go take a shower then.
Excuse me.

675
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,420
You guys should go rest now.

676
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,730
I'll close this up myself.

677
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,280
What's the matter?

678
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,440
Nothing.

679
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,210
I'm fine.

680
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,220
Just tired.

681
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,240
Your under-eyes are dark.

682
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,260
How many hours
did you sleep last night?

683
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,110
Four.

684
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,980
Let me ask you again.

685
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,400
What time did you go to bed?

686
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,560
10pm.

687
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,200
So you woke up at 2am

688
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,580
and didn't go back to sleep.

689
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,030
That's normal, Hia.

690
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,050
I often have insomnia.

691
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,150
Go put some clothes on.

692
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,800
You'll sleep at my place tonight.

693
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,420
Huh?

694
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,310
There's no huh.

695
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,540
Or you want me to help you.

696
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,120
Heyy!

697
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,900
No.

698
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,440
I can do it myself.

699
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,080
Gee!

700
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,750
Come in.

701
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,130
Why are you standing there?

702
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,900
I just realized

703
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,650
that your room is right above my room.

704
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,140
Come to bed.

705
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,340
It's only 11pm, Hia.

706
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,180
Team.

707
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,640
Move closer to me.

708
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,790
We've done things more than this, haven't we?

709
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,510
Arghh.

710
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,400
What the hell are you talking about?

711
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,430
I'm just joking.

712
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,090
I'm not gonna do anything to you.

713
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,060
You're puffing up like a cat.

714
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,520
Help!

715
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,370
Team!

716
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,320
It's okay.

717
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,360
I'm here.

718
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,440
You're fine.

719
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:16,840
Everything's okay.

720
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,300
Hia!

721
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,480
Wake up. You're heavy.

722
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,420
Ow.

723
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,700
Hia.

724
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,220
Hia.

725
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,460
Wake up.

726
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,440
Ow.

727
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,520
That hurts.

728
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,360
Why were you hugging me like that?

729
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,680
Are you a squid?

730
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,610
You can wake me up in a nicer way.

731
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,350
Didn't have to kick me like that.

732
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,200
Hia.

733
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,790
I tried to wake you up till your neighbor almost rebuke me.

734
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,730
Do you have any class today?

735
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,170
No.

736
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,840
You're lying.

737
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,120
You have a 10am class today.

738
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,750
Just tell me if you're gonna skip.

739
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,000
If you knew, and why bother asking?

740
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,900
Fine. I'll go to class.

741
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,660
Hia.

742
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,350
Can I just borrow your shirt?

743
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,380
I don't wanna go back to my room.

744
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,230
Sure.

745
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,360
Hey Hia!

746
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,700
Shit!

747
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,800
I'm sorry.

748
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,120
I forgot that you're here.

749
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,340
Why didn't you lock the door?

750
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,610
Were you be able to sleep last night?

751
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,580
Um.

752
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,170
Did you know that
you had a bad dream again?

753
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,890
But I managed to go back to sleep.

754
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,300
Thank you.

755
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,800
Thank for what?

756
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,770
Well...

757
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,980
I just wanna thank you. That's all.

758
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,760
You should go take a shower.

759
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,420
Go!

760
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,390
What are you smiling at?

761
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,210
Nothing

762
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,920
Can I sleep at your place?

763
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,920
You can come to this room whenever you want.

764
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,920
For now,

765
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,960
you're adore Team more than other 1st first year in the club.

766
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,760
If you're not gonna take this serious,

767
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,930
then don't make him think too far ahead.

768
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,560
I didn't want to let it be this way.
