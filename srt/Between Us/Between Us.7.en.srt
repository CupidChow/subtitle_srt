1
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,780
What am I gonna do
if something happened to you?

2
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,730
What am I gonna do, Team?

3
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,590
Whatever you're feeling right now,

4
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,100
Whether you just worry about him,

5
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,100
Or you really love him.

6
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,100
I feel like...

7
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,720
I started to have a feeling for someone,

8
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm afraid that, if I loved him,

9
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,130
I might lose him someday.

10
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,060
If you don't wanna lose,

11
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,980
then keep him.

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,979
Not trying to avoid like this.

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,979
Where is he gone to?

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,740
Mom, what's wrong with P'Ton?

15
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,580
Why is he not awake?

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,479
Did I just kill him?

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,600
No, you did not.

18
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,420
It's not like that. It was an accident.

19
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,240
No.

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,970
No, Ton.

21
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,680
Ton.

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,570
Ton.

23
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,180
Team.

24
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,360
Did you kill my son?

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
Why did you kill him?

26
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,540
Why?

27
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,600
Ton

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,340
Why did you kill Ton, Team?

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,360
Why did you have to kill him!?

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,620
Why did you kill my son?

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,090
It was an accident.

32
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,530
Why did you kill my son?

33
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,450
It was an accident. They were just playing.

34
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,360
Why did you kill him?

35
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,220
Why did you kill my son?

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,320
Why did you kill my son, Team?

37
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,260
Did you kill my son?

38
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,970
Why did you kill Ton?

39
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,210
Watch me.

40
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,140
When I grow up,

41
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,540
I'll become a national athlete.

42
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,620
You can be whatever,
but we have to stick together.

43
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,880
Ok, I promise.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,040
Promise?

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,100
I promise.

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,900
When I grow up, I'll become a national athlete.

47
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,530
I'll bring mom the silver medal!

48
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,420
Why only the silver one?

49
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,770
Cause the gold medal belongs to you!

50
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,960
Team!

51
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,580
Team!

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,890
What's happening?

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,440
Why are you here?

54
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,490
Team!

55
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,690
Hia.

56
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,120
Where have you been?

57
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,730
I'm sorry, Team.

59
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm not gonna disappear from you again.

60
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,770
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

61
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,880
What promise?

62
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,020
That I'll always be there for you.

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,140
Hia.

64
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,960
I'm fine.

65
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,970
I'm just waiting for you. That's all.

66
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm kinda tired today.

67
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,980
So I fell asleep.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,820
Really.

69
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,860
I'm totally fine.

71
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
What about you? Are you okay?

72
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's go inside.

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Go to bed.

74
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,690
Oh Hia.

75
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,260
You didn't come watch me
at the swim meet today.

76
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,260
I beat my time record.

77
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,320
First one that finished too.

78
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,640
I got caught with an urgency.

79
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,440
So...

80
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,810
I couldn't be there.

81
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,330
Umm.

82
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,220
Okay.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,440
You should go take a shower.

84
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,610
You should go to sleep too.

85
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,460
Ok.

86
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,120
Were you having a bad dream just now?

87
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,360
Yeah.

88
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,180
Thought it only happens
before the competition.

89
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,570
Why is it still happening after?

90
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,980
I don't know why either.

91
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,340
But it's been happening a lot lately.

92
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,570
Sometimes,

93
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
It happens
when I nap during the day too.

94
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,020
But...

95
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,490
It never happened...

96
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,090
when I'm with you.

97
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Sweet dream.

98
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,260
Okay.

99
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,490
Look at me!

100
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,880
If I didn't walk pass and saw the lights,

101
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,610
If I didn't walk in to check...

102
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,920
what do you think was gonna happen?

103
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,260
Tell me.

104
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,160
What would happen?

105
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,610
Why did you do that?

106
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,450
I just wanted to practice.

107
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,290
What?

108
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,060
I just wanted to practice.

109
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,500
Why do you have to be so pissed?

110
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,880
F*ck the practice!

111
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,320
You almost drowned. Damn it!

112
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,620
You almost died right in front of me.

113
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,080
Did you realize that?

114
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,820
But if you're serious about this,

115
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,180
please make it clear.

116
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,210
If not,

117
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,560
don't give anyone's hope.

118
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,890
I didn't meant it to turn out this way.

119
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,900
I know that you didn't intend to.

120
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,570
But your actions...

121
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,120
make it seems like you mean it.

122
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,970
I already slept with him.

123
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,450
We started off our relationship that way.

124
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,290
You started like that?

125
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,730
And how is it going to end?

126
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
I don't know.

127
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,420
But what we have right now is already perfect.

128
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,490
And...

129
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,720
what exactly do you mean by what we have?

130
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,700
I don't know what exactly is my feeling.

131
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,980
I'm not fond of him

132
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,530
just because we slept together for sure.

133
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,940
It's just a nice feeling.

134
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,700
I wanna get to know him better.

135
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,520
Wanna support him to do what he loves.

136
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,960
And I also...

137
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,850
worry...

138
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,530
about his sleep.

139
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,800
Have he eaten?

140
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,100
What's he doing?

141
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,080
Love...

142
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,360
is the feeling that you're having right now.

143
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,290
It's called love.

144
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,170
Yeah.

145
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,020
I don't wanna start loving anyone.

146
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,290
Because I don't wanna lose anyone.

147
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,020
But you can't run away from it like this.

148
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,200
If you don't wanna lose it,

149
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,480
then keep it.

150
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,020
Not avoiding like this.

151
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,080
I'm not gonna disappear anymore.

152
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,240
There's a reimbursement.

153
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,740
I'll sign on their behalf.

154
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,220
Bring it down.

155
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,760
I did. See!

156
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,740
Just bring it down.

157
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,000
There's the queue left.

158
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,960
Who should do this?

159
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,480
You're not helping us.

160
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,170
I'll be here supporting you guys.

161
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,540
Hey! ABC gang.

162
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,940
Come here.

163
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,800
P'

164
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,860
You called us like kindergarten kids.

165
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,490
My nickname is Bumblebee, FYI.

166
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,600
It's too long.

167
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,440
Mine is also Sea that means the beach and such.
Not C as a letter.

168
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,220
Yeah whatever.

169
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,410
When I call you three it's A,B,C anyway.

170
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,500
Or you want me to call...

171
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,000
Kasidis, Theep, and Panuphat

172
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,020
He remembers all of our first names?

173
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,340
I heard that he has good memory.

174
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,480
Probably remembers everyone in the club.

175
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,570
He's really good.

176
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:27,580
- Yeah.
-He is.

177
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,320
Real good.

178
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,980
Are you gossiping in front of me?

179
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,560
Here.

180
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,690
Bring this to the 1st year,
they need to draw the queue to be on the tank.

181
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,260
This way.

182
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,530
And write down the names for me.

183
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,780
Move, Hia.

184
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,810
Hey you guys.

185
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,770
Go hand these out to the 1st year.
I'll go hand out this to the rest.

186
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,020
Why don't you let they come get it themselves?

187
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,460
Stop complaining.

188
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,880
Help me out. Come on.

189
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,460
I think we've got our first boy.

190
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,100
What?

191
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,450
The queue to be on the tank.
You're the first one to draw.

192
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,490
Come on.

193
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,300
Here.

194
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,580
Congratulations!
You're the last one to be on the tank.

195
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,080
Shit!

196
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,900
The last one will probably get picked on a lot.

197
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,300
I'll be the last one who dunk you.

198
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah especially you! Such a jerk.

199
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,970
I'll help.

200
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,540
After you're done with this,
I'll buy you a meal.

201
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,060
You said it!

202
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,420
I'll eat until you're broke.

203
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,770
Go.

204
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,780
Go that way.

205
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,119
In front of us again?

206
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,079
Yeah...

207
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,859
They're pretty close.

208
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,890
Right.

209
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,920
I mean you and Prince!

210
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,120
Right!

211
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,640
Hey Sea!

212
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,160
You don't like being a human right?
Wanna become a dog?

213
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,540
Who's gonna become a dog?

214
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,680
You!

215
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,180
He is so out of your league.

216
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,050
And you are just a temple dog.
(Thai idiom)

217
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,720
You don't think we notice, huh?
You've been putting on sunscreen lately.

218
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,330
Don't you think we know?

219
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,210
Oh but...

220
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,080
you need to be careful as well.
He's a superstar.

221
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,200
He's also a human just like us.

222
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,130
Why do people nowadays love to
snoop on others' business so much?

223
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,810
Actors can be in love too.

224
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,820
Why do you have to be so negative?

225
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,170
Aren't you a little overreacting?

226
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,330
Speaking of the devil...

227
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,260
Yeah...speaking of the devil.

228
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,440
If I was a dog, then you guys would be bats.

229
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,090
What do you mean bats?

230
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,690
Bat friends!
(Bad friends)

231
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,880
Wow.

232
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,980
When he shows up, he suddenly lightens up.

233
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,660
Wow look at him.

234
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,240
Temple dog!

235
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,460
Look at him, looking all flirty.

236
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,730
Such a poet. Playing with words.

237
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,650
Try to reach for him.

238
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,520
Doggo!

239
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,250
I'm full.

240
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,160
Continue with snacks?

241
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,660
You might be too stuffed.

242
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,080
Please.

243
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,800
Just a tiny bit to satisfy.

244
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,320
I'm gonna go buy. Will be back.

245
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,120
How much is this?

246
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,130
40 Baht.

247
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,850
40 Baht.

248
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,160
Here.

249
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,820
Thank you.

250
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,580
Hia.

251
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,050
Here check this out.

252
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,100
So smiley when he's with his boy.

253
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,320
But he's so cold with his friends.

254
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,440
Don't know where they're now.

255
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,560
That's the business faculty.

256
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,180
There's a Buddy event there.
Do you wanna go?

257
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,640
No.

258
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,130
I'm so glad

259
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,610
seeing Pharm so happy.

260
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,250
Always care for him,
got me thinking that you guys're secretly dating?

261
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,640
Are you crazy?

262
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
How could you think that way?

263
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,090
Pharm is my friend.

264
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,880
Why?

265
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,330
I care for the person I have nice feeling for.

266
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,090
Doesn't mean we're dating.

267
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,540
Yeah.

268
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,490
What about me?

269
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,050
Do you care for me?

270
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,160
Are you messing with me?

271
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,090
Hmm?

272
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm not messing with you.

273
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,840
I'm being frank.

274
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,720
Do you care for me?

275
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,460
Well...

276
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,130
I guess.

277
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,100
So you care for me and...

278
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,520
also feel protective of me?

279
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,420
Both.

280
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,320
You ask too many questions.

281
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,480
I'm leaving.

282
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,360
Hia, come on!

283
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,500
Yeah.

284
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,770
Why so hurry?

285
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,610
You're too slow.

286
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,450
Hey P'Team. Hi!

287
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,530
Oh.

288
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,700
Hi there.

289
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,200
Thought you're not coming anymore.

290
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,680
You wanted him to come, didn't you?

291
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,100
He ringed me since early morning.

292
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,660
Wouldn't let me stay to finish my work first.

293
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,530
So I have to bring him here.

294
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,140
Oh.

295
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,980
Team.

296
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,660
This is Hia Waan, my brother.

297
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:44,920
Hia.

298
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,120
This is Team.

299
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,090
Hello P'.

300
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,880
Hi.

301
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,090
P'Team.

302
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,010
Take me around the uni please.

303
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,900
It's super big here.

304
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:58,980
Sure.

305
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,700
I'll take you to have some good food.

306
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,480
Ok let's go.

307
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,340
Hia, I'll see you at the the club.

308
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll show your brother around.

309
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,500
Bye P'.

310
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,940
So it's this one?

311
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,120
Yeah.

312
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,520
Are you still confusing?

313
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,100
What are you gonna do now?

314
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,490
It's up to him.

315
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,140
Are you interested in Cooking club?

316
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,580
- Feel free to try.
- You can try this.

317
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,140
Here's the brochure.

318
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,020
Do you wanna try?

If you're interested, please join!

321
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,770

322
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,920
Pharm.

323
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,340
Wow P'

324
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,360
What kind of snack is that?

325
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,260
It's called Bulan Dan Mek.

326
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,980
Can I have one?

327
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
Thank you.

328
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,920
How is it?

329
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,170
Is it good?

330
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,180
So good!

331
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,290
Pharm.

332
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,480
This is Wiew.

333
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,720
Hia Win's brother.

334
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,100
Wiew.

335
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,450
This is Pharm.

336
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,650
Hello P'Pharm.

337
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,480
Hi.

338
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,250
This is so yummy.

339
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,210
I told you.

340
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,330
Seeing only Pharm and it's already worth the drive.

341
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,490
You're exaggerating.

342
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,570
Hey.

343
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,580
There's more in the club,
do you wanna go check them out?

344
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,970
- Sure.
- Let's go.

345
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,250
Can I leave it here with you guys?

346
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,400
- I'll be back in a bit.
- Sure.

347
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,600
Let's go.

348
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,580
Where are you going next?

349
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,920
Waiting for Wiew or leaving?

350
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,560
Probably wait for him here.

351
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,560
I'd love to take him back for you.

352
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,460
But I'll probably finish my work late.

353
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,680
That's fine.

354
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,040
I'll just hang around here.

355
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,280
Ok.

356
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,820
Hey! Tul.

357
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,360
Oh P'Waan.

358
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,690
Hello.

359
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,220
Which faculty are you interested today?

360
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,160
Smart mouth.

361
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,720
Oh Tul.

362
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,000
I'll leave Hia Waan with you.

363
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:50,930
What?

364
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,280
See you.

365
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,530
What?

366
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,930
Hey!

367
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,440
I can be by myself.

368
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,600
Why?

369
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,140
What's wrong with staying with me?

370
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,760
My tummy is crying.

371
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,690
I'm hungry P'.

372
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,060
Do you wanna go eat?

373
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,640
Let's go.

374
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,180
I'll take you.

375
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,620
Fine.

376
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,090
Here.

377
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,240
This shop

378
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,130
is the best one in the uni.

379
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
Try, if you don't believe me.

380
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,160
If it's not good, I'll let you kick.

381
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,520
Really?

382
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,620
Yeah.

383
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,860
Kick...

384
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Kick the shop owner.

385
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,370
Try it.

386
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,320
How is it?

387
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,380
Do you have to kick the owner?

388
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,820
It's good.

389
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,860
See?

390
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,970
I knew that you're gonna like it.

391
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,810
What?

392
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,180
Why are you looking at me?

393
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,900
Is something on my face?

394
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,170
Nothing.

395
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,220
I just feel like I've known you before.

396
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,240
Your voice sounds so familiar.

397
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,890
You're crazy.

398
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,280
Maybe my face just looks like other people.

399
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,290
For the voice,

400
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,980
it could similar to other people too.

401
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,160
Eat eat eat eat.

402
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,500
Eat.

403
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,140
Probably.

404
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,370
Do you have to go back to the club?

405
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,420
Yeah.

406
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,940
You too, Team?

407
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,240
Yes.

408
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,880
Hey!

409
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,610
I'm the last one on the tank today.

410
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,480
People from the club will mess with me
more for sure.

411
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,300
You'll be fine.

412
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,850
I'll go see you in the evening.

413
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,180
Okay.

414
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,800
Well...

415
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,770
Here's for you.

416
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,010
Thank you.

417
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,700
If you wanna try anything else,

418
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,170
just let Team know.

419
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,660
I'll make it for you.

420
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,760
Sure.

421
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,260
Would you excuse me?

422
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,210
Okay.

423
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,890
Bye P'.

424
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,650
See you this evening.

425
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,650
- See you this evening.
- Bye bye.

426
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,000
Let's go.

427
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,500
P'Waan is waiting for you.

428
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,580
Go.

429
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,570
Fine.

430
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,290
Brrr It's freezing.

431
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,560
Here's the towel.

432
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,010
Take it.

433
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,640
Can I play too?

434
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,300
Ughh.

435
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,740
Enough.

436
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,180
After this round, my shift is over.

437
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,120
Oh and today...

438
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,780
you don't need to hurry back to work?

439
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,120
No.

440
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,530
I cleared all my schedules
just to come see you as a dunk boy.

441
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,520
You like it huh?

442
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,020
When all of this is over,

443
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,370
I'll force you to be up here.

444
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,730
So you'll know

445
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,730
that it's not fun.

446
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,290
Look at you.

447
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,410
Prince!

448
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,820
P'Tum!

449
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,960
Excuse me.

450
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,260
Thought you're tired.

451
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,280
So I gave you a slot to rest.

452
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,410
But this is how you spend it?

453
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,490
P'Tum.

454
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,320
It's not like that.

455
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,240
Then what is it then?

456
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,780
Prince just wanted to join uni activities.

457
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,530
And...

458
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,090
come to see my friend.

459
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,240
Friend?

460
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,240
The friend that you rode behind his bike?

461
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,330
The friend that you went to his dorm?

462
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,040
Is he really a friend?

463
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,260
P'Tum...

464
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,650
The show is almost on aired.

465
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,970
So what?

466
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,840
I cannot have any friends?

467
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,960
It he is really just a friend then it's fine.

468
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,920
P'Tum.

469
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,760
I created you.

470
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,160
We've been through together since day 1.

471
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,890
I know what are you thinking
in just a blink of an eye.

472
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,370
What if I really like him?

473
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,050
What are you gonna do then?

474
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:16,060
- Prince.
- What are you gonna do?

475
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,600
Prince.

476
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,400
This is not something you can joke about.

477
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,850
You know what...

478
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,820
I've worked since I was very young.

479
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,280
I never got to live a normal life like other kids.

480
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,610
But when I met Bee,

481
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,340
he let me do things I've never done.

482
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,360
Like just eating on the side of the road.

483
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,700
But did you know that it was really good for me?

484
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,450
It's like...

485
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,160
I just learned how to be happy for the first time.

486
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,730
But you are not a normal person, Prince.

487
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,250
I am!

488
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,680
a normal person.

489
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,460
Who just happens to work as an actor.

490
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,690
Prince.

491
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,220
What if the company finds out?

492
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,090
Or the fans find out?

493
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
This is a very serious matter.

494
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,360
It could be worse than you can ever imagined.

495
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,000
Why?

496
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,220
Why can't an actor be in love?

497
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,040
Prince.

498
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,850
It's not that actors can't be in love.

499
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,770
But not every guys in this world can accept who you are.

500
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,770
Maybe,

501
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,380
if he finds out that you like him this much,

502
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,490
not only disappointing

503
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,280
but the friendship with him

504
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,480
might no longer exist even.

505
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,690
You need to learn a lot more, Prince.

506
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,000
Still here?

507
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,170
Yeah.

508
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,240
Just now...

509
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,210
you heard all of it, right?

510
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,050
Do you want me to hear it?

511
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,300
If I said no...

512
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,100
is that possible?

513
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,969
I'm afraid that...

514
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,159
after hearing those things,
you might turn into whatever P'Tum said.

515
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,690
That guy is Tum?

516
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,530
Yeah.

517
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,889
He's my manager.

518
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,920
Why do you ask?

519
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,420
So I can remember

520
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,639
that he's not nice to you.

521
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,210
Don't let me see him next time.

522
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,860
I'll take my revenge on him.

523
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,040
Can I have his car license number?

524
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,080
Should I flatten his tires?

525
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,889
Just kidding!

526
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,620
Let's put it this way,

527
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,840
I am...

528
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,179
not going to be what he said.

529
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,280
Feeling better?

530
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,460
So relieved!

531
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,180
Tum...

532
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,570
I'll keep an eye on him.

533
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,480
I can't rely on you

534
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,400
like at all.

535
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,420
I wanted Wiew to check out faculties.

536
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,700
But for 2 hours,
you guys spent in the Cooking club?

537
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,980
Cause the dessert was good, Hia.

538
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,090
I wanted to have some.

539
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:48,940
Why?

540
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,860
- Again?
- Shit I disappointed in them.

541
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,730
The president of swimming club is gay?

542
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
He is so cool.

543
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,210
His face looks pretty too.

544
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,440
Why is he has to be gay?

545
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,770
Yeah.

546
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,370
I'm so disappointed.

547
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,680
Yeah thinking about it already makes me cringe.

548
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,640
Hey!

549
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,170
Calm down.

550
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,370
Hia.

551
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,980
Listen to them talk.

552
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,520
Calm down. Come here.

553
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,320
They're talking about P'Dean.

554
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:13,850
come here!

555
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,730
Hia.

556
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,330
I'm gonna go punch them.

557
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,660
What's the matter with you?

558
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,210
I'm not okay with that.

559
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,290
Why do they have to say those things?

560
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,130
You can't control people's thoughts.

561
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,940
If you went to punch them,

562
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,650
do you think you can change their minds?

563
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,010
or stop talking?

564
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,520
How many people out there?

565
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,200
That are homophobic?

566
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,140
You can't expect everyone to understands us.

567
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,640
But they don't have to be that rude.

568
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,540
Cringe or disgusted?

569
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,160
What did Pharm and P'Dean do to deserve that?

570
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,140
Why did they have to say those things?

571
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,650
If you're not like what they said,

572
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,900
then you shouldn't care about their words.

573
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,890
Also,

574
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,040
they posted pictures like that.

575
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,050
People will talk about it anyway.

576
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,020
All walks of life out there.

577
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,440
I just freaking hate that.

578
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,970
Those smart mouths,

579
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,720
when they're done gossiping.They're done.

580
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,240
But those on the internet,

581
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,640
the more rude, the better for them.

582
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,090
But people who got bullied,

583
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,600
is there anyone who actually care about them?

584
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,600
What if P'Dean and Pharm heard that...

585
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,040
Even I heard that...

586
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,880
it still makes me feel shitty.

587
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,580
Dean knows.

588
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,050
and he has always known.

589
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,920
And..

590
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,060
He's not gonna do anything about it?

591
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
He doesn't care.

592
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,930
Do you wanna know what he said?

593
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,490
Don't value

594
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,160
those who don't value us.

595
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,460
But Pharm is easily concerned.

596
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,210
Why?

597
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,000
Love is just about two people.

598
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,000
Why do people have to be discriminated?

599
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,810
Pointing out that they are...

600
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,370
like this and that.

601
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,610
It's not fair, Hia.

602
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:46,930
Come here.

603
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,250
You don't have to worry.

604
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,240
Pharm has Dean.

605
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,290
And also us.

606
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,000
If people talk bad about him,

607
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,010
both you

608
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,420
and Manow

609
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,360
will always be by his side, right?

610
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,490
What about you?

611
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,130
What?

612
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,890
About you and me...

613
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,420
Does it worry you?

614
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,260
What if I say no,

615
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,480
are you gonna believe me?

616
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,220
Are you afraid?

617
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,020
No.

618
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:01,940
Not at all.

619
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,570
I'm never afraid of anything when I'm with you.

620
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,850
Like you said,

621
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,980
we can't control anyone.

622
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,720
but we can choose

623
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,340
not to care.

624
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,610
Then...

625
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,330
let's fight this together.

626
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,930
You're so adorable.

627
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,900
But I'm going to wait...Hia

628
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,250
wait for the day the P'Dean and Pharm's love

629
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,490
will become a norm for everyone.

630
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,200
That's good.

631
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,500
Let's go.

632
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,850
Are you ready, dunk tank boy?

633
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,020
Ahhh.

634
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,780
No, I don't like it.

635
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,360
- Let's go, kiddo! Go.
- No, I don't want to.

636
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,720
- I don't like it, Hia.
- Go go.

637
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,690
- Why do you have to force me? Stop Hia.
- Go!

638
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,180
- No!
- Come on.

639
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,680
Oh.

640
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,730
P'Phruek.

641
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,290
Err...

642
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,940
it's been super busy at my club today.

643
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,610
so I couldn't make it to see you on the stage.

644
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,880
I was just...

645
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,210
walking around a bit on the stage.

646
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,490
But I was...

647
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,980
super nervous too.

648
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,490
My heart was beating so fast.

649
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,660
Err...

650
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,840
can I take some pictures with the actress?

651
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,300
I shouldn't have changed.

652
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,380
That's fine.

653
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,890
I just wanna take pictures with you.

654
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,220
Not with the outfit.

655
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,520
P'Phruek!

656
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,530
Why are you still there?

657
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,400
Come take pictures with me!

658
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,900
Okay.

659
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,400
Smile.

660
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,140
1

661
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,760
2

662
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,380
3

663
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,400
One more?

664
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,480
Sure.

665
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:51,810
1

666
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:52,850
2

667
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,530
3

668
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,980
Today...

669
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,080
you look so pretty.

670
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,090
Thank you.

671
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,890
Bottoms up at the same time?

672
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,640
P'Phruek and P'Dean are not coming?

673
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,930
No.
They said they have some stuff to do.

674
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,420
Do stuff with my friend probably.

675
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,450
Here guys. Cheers!

676
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,180
- Cheers!
- Wooo!

677
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,440
Bee.

678
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,090
Bee.

679
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,130
Come on!

680
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,480
Take it easy.

681
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,900
I don't wanna carry you home.

682
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,290
Hey Bee.

683
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
When did Prince leave?

684
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,760
I didn't see him leave.

685
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,740
Yeah right.

686
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,040
In the evening.

687
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,080
Bee.

688
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,130
What's the matter?

689
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,710
You seem depressed like a sad dog.

690
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,370
You.

691
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,040
Not just an ordinary dog too,

692
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,140
he's a temple dog that wants things out of his league.

693
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,520
Am I missing something here?

694
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,420
Try and ask him.

695
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:30,660
Bee.

696
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,620
Or you and Prince...

697
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,810
that actor...

698
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,400
Hey don't be too loud, Team!

699
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,610
He might be affected.

700
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,090
Ooh be affected?

701
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,800
So you really like him, huh?

702
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,530
I'm not sure.

703
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,540
But can we just don't talk about this now?

704
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,000
Let's drink!

705
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,130
Cheers! Cheers!

706
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,250
Here.

707
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,440
Cheers then.

708
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,640
Keep drinking.

709
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,980
We're really good.

710
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,880
Cheers to the shyness.

711
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,840
But hey...

712
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,850
when you said you're not sure

713
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,360
that phrase has destroyed many couples too.

714
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,700
It's not easy.

715
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,410
To be sure that you really love someone.

716
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,090
If you made the wrong decision,

717
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,210
there's only regret.

718
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,940
If you're not sure, then prove it.

719
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:17,640
Yeah.

720
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,410
Huh?

721
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,600
If you like him, then tell him.

722
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,210
Yeah.

723
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,320
If you love him, then tell him.

724
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,010
How?

725
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,140
You're hogging him to yourself.

726
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,880
He could feel bad about that.

727
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:26,760
Right.

728
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,290
Don't play hard to get.

729
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:29,970
That's right.

730
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,770
Yeah.

731
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,960
Sitting here being depressed.

732
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,170
- You two.
- Hey guys..

733
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,680
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

734
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:38,600
Okay.

735
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,740
Hia.

736
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,250
Need to use the toilet?

737
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,240
I came to see you.

738
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,320
To see me?

739
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:15,970
Why?

740
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,160
Hia.

741
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,840
What are you doing?

742
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,410
Can I?

743
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,340
Dad. Mom.

744
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,870
This is Team. He is a junior from my club.

745
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,570
Team, what’s the matter?

746
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,370
I’m just a junior.

747
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,370
I’m not sure

748
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,790
whether Hia’s feeling is reciprocated with me.

749
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,890
I’m afraid that Hia Win probably can’t take this.

750
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,000
If you don’t wanna lose him,

751
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,350
then try first.

752
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,040
Hia.
