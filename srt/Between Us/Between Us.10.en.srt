1
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
This is not a competition.

2
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,070
This is just a swimming club.

3
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,070
There's only me...

4
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,020
and you.

5
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,340
Just the two of us.

6
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,700
You are a guy.

7
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,330
And I like you.

8
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,970
So that means...I'm gay just like you.

9
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,450
What is this?

10
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,539
Are you telling me that you like me?

11
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,229
Why not me?

12
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,460
If I were the one who died,
everything would have been better.

13
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,540
Hello.

14
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,579
Err...

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,710
Who’s that?

16
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,579
Is this Team’s number?

17
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,720
Yes it is.

18
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,280
It’s just…

19
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,829
Team is still asleep.

20
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,180
Oh.

21
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,890
That’s Win, right?

22
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,610
Yes.

23
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,360
I am Win.

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,720
I just wanna call and let you know that…

25
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,500
Dad has prepared breakfast for you guys already.

26
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,840
What time are you guys gonna be here?

27
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,500
It’s gonna be awhile.

28
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,870
No more than 1 hour.

29
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,620
Okay then.

30
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,580
Hurry up son.

31
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,480
Dad and I will heat up the food for you guys.

32
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,650
Sure.

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,540
I will take Team there as soon as possible.

34
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,160
Here’s your key.

35
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,330
I have a staff bring it back to Bangkok already.

36
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,650
***

37
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,730
Thank you so much.

38
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,250
Hia.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
How come my car is here?

40
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,620
You left it parking there last night, didn’t you?

41
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,380
So I have a guy drove it back for you.

42
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,620
Who is that guy?

43
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,500
Why did he bring my car for me?

44
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,580
You hired him?

45
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,600
How much was it? I will pay myself.

46
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,300
And…

47
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,090
the hotel last night too.

48
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,170
I'll take care of it.

49
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,310
This is my hotel.

50
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,970
Huh?

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,580
And the guy who brought your car back

52
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,420
is one of the hotel staffs.

53
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,300
You don’t have to pay anything.

54
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,830
Why are you looking at me like that?

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,750
I don't look like a hotel owner to you?

56
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,060
Well…

57
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,310
something like that.

58
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,010
Can we go now?

59
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,810
Sure.

60
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,580
Let’s go rich boy.

61
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,210
Give me the key.

62
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,030
Here.

63
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,100
Err…

64
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,900
Mom. Dad.

65
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,130
This is Hia Win.

66
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,430
Hia.

67
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,820
These are my parents.

68
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,030
Hello dad.

69
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,000
Hello mom.

70
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,050
How is it?

71
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,010
Is this guy difficult to deal with?

72
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,830
Dad!

73
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,700
What were you saying again?

74
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,690
You’re his senior from the club right?

75
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,510
Is team...

76
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,650
difficult to handle?

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,530
Oh.

78
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,760
A bit.

79
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,260
Just like any other kids.

80
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,230
Hia!

81
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,860
I’m a grown man.

82
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,770
You’re just 2 years older than me.

83
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,700
As if you've lived way longer than me.

84
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,560
Exactly like this.

85
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,220
Hia.

86
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,760
Come on.

87
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,270
Let’s just eat.

88
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,420
Someone is hangry.

89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,570
Yes.

90
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,080
Give him some of that too.

91
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,310
Here’s for you. The rest you do it yourself.

92
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,200
Easy. Be careful.

93
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,950
It’s so good!

94
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,900
You eat a lot.

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,409
You too eat more.

96
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,420
Here take this.

97
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,470
You guys are only here for a short while.

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,740
I still don't get enough of my son.
You're going back already.

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,210
I'll come visit another time.

100
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,030
Come see us when you're free.

101
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,300
You too, Win.

102
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,770
Come dine with us.

103
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,610
Sure.

104
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,130
Then we'll get going.

105
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,190
Good bye dad. Goodbye mom.

106
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,180
Bye!

107
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,990
Drive safe.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,440
Yes. We gotta go.

109
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,870
Bye bye.

110
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,890
Drive safe guys.

111
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,730
Sure.

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,010
I was right.

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,460
A person like our son,

114
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,890
wouldn't let anyone drives his car easily.

115
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,020
I think so.

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,530
Yeah.

117
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,490
Hia.

118
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,900
You want some fried pork?

119
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,790
My dad makes the best fried pork.

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,300
I'll put some in the box for you.

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,470
Are you feeling better now?

122
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,870
About yesterday.

123
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,840
Umm.

124
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,390
I'm okay.

125
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,840
Hey.

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,700
Hia.

127
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,380
What's the matter?

128
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,180
Just a little headache.

129
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,080
Sit down.

130
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,460
You're on fire.

131
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,660
Why don't you tell me you're sick?

132
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,780
And still drove all the way back too.

133
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,180
I'll be better once I take some medicines.

134
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,110
This is because you rode your bike in the rain right?

135
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,400
Sick people,

136
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,510
can be sick without any reasons.

137
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,150
You should rest.

138
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,850
I'll bring you medicines.

139
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,390
If you can find out who I am,

140
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,330
are you gonna be thrilled or regret?

141
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:54,760
***

142
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,080
Hia.

143
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,840
Hia.

144
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,650
Get up and take these meds.

145
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,490
You should go to sleep already.

146
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,700
You have an early class tomorrow, don't you?

147
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,490
Yeah.

148
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,060
I'll go to sleep after I finished cleaning this up.

149
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,410
You're cold?

150
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,580
Yeah.

151
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,860
Get well soon, Hia.

152
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,980
Hey.

153
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,730
Imsomnia again?

154
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,480
No.

155
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,460
I had to take care of a patient.

156
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,910
A patient?

157
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,890
Who is it?

158
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,970
Hey.

159
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,340
- Hello P'Dean.
- Hi P'Dean.

160
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,120
Hi.

161
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,480
Win is not here, right?

162
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,760
How is he?

163
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,500
What's wrong with him?

164
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,540
He's sick.

165
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,980
Right?

166
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,910
Yes he is.

167
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,100
He had the fever all night.

168
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,900
But it's better this morning.

169
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,720
Well...

170
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,220
you can go back and take care of him.

171
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,340
Don't have to be at the club this evening.

172
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,940
Win rarely gets sick.

173
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,820
But when he does, he's often severely sick.

174
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,140
Please take care of him.

175
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,770
Sure, P'Dean.

176
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,410
I have to go, Pharm.

177
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,260
Please concentrate in your class.

178
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,780
Sure.

179
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,800
I'll come pick you up after.

180
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,640
Sure.

181
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,610
- Bye/Bye.

182
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,800
Wowww.

183
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,660
When you said 'you had to take care of a patient',

184
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,610
and that patient

185
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,360
is P'Win?

186
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,050
So what is it?

187
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,940
Where are you at in a relationship?

188
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,890
What are you talking about?

189
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,590
So...

190
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,780
what are you guys' status?

191
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,740
I don't know...

192
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,900
what we are either.

193
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,740
Do you have anything

194
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,510
you wanna tell us?

195
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,820
Well...

196
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,070
About Hia Win and I...

197
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,300
we started off by just wanting to have fun.

198
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,580
It happened in the heat of the moment.

199
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,960
I believed it that way in the beginning.

200
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,620
But after sometimes have passed,

201
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,660
I've started to feel a bit odd.

202
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,790
How?

203
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,480
I've started to feel used to...

204
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,790
having him around.

205
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,850
And I always feel bad

206
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,130
when he pays attention to others more.

207
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,150
Also,

208
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,140
I wanna be someone that is important to him.

209
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,010
You love him already, right?

210
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,850
Yeah.

211
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,590
And...

212
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,590
for Hia Win...

213
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,950
how does he feel about this?

214
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,720
I don't know.

215
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,970
Sometimes...

216
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,980
he feels the same way with me.

217
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,099
But sometimes,

218
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,810
he does not.

219
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,810
Calm down.

220
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,260
Just take things slow.

221
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,390
Whatever you're not sure,

222
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,970
you have to make it clear.

223
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,369
I'm afraid that

224
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,950
if I did something,

225
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,580
and it's not reciprocated with his feeling

226
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,400
I might lose him.

227
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,970
I can't picture myself without him anymore.

228
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,660
But one thing that I'm sure...

229
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,610
is that it's not a good idea to ask.

230
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,740
But if you're not gonna do anything,

231
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,180
one day...

232
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
you could lose him because of that too.

233
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,230
What if he met someone that he loves?

234
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,940
Someone he wants to start a family with.

235
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,150
If that day comes,

236
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,440
you might lose him too.

237
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,990
What do I have to do, Pharm?

238
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,680
Follow your heart.

239
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,190
Give it a try.

240
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,670
I believe you can do it!

241
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,280
1 2

242
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,140
1 2 3 1 2.

243
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,990
1 2 1 You can do it!!

244
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,410
You can do it.

245
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,410
You can!

246
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,410
I can do it!

247
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,300
Our Team is in love.

248
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,190
Thank you...Pharm Manow.

249
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,930
Now, can you smile?

250
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,800
Smile~

251
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,580
Christmas is over more than a month already,

252
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,640
you still leave the decorations on?

253
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,910
Yeah.

254
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,750
I told you. I love Christmas.

255
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,940
And...

256
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,140
do you like the person who created Christmas tree too?

257
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,060
Who is it?

258
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,430
Santa Claus?

259
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,430
Santa doesn't create Christmas trees.

260
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,870
Where did you attend kindergarten?

261
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,460
Wait a min.

262
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,280
***

263
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,990
When we go on a trip,

264
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,790
it must be super sunny.

265
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,720
Here.

266
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,850
This is the body sunscreen.

267
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,240
This is facial.

268
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,590
And this one...

269
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,750
is the Aloe vera gel.

270
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,040
After exposing to the sun,

271
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,900
You need put a thick layer on your skin.

272
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,150
Put it on for me please.

273
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,110
Who puts sunscreen on at 8pm?

274
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,400
Go wash your face.

275
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,840
I'll mask your face for you.

276
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,230
So you'll look good tomorrow.

277
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,320
For real?

278
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,070
Yeah.

279
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,150
Done!

280
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,600
I'm ready.

281
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,240
Oh that's cold.

282
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,480
Your face looks so funny.

283
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,990
Hey.

284
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,610
I'm not a funny person.

285
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,370
Do you...

286
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,140
like someone who is funny?

287
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,310
If you do,

288
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,180
then you need to go date those people.

289
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,600
Not me.

290
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,080
Don't tell me to be fond,

291
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,750
Ahhh.

292
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,890
Fussy Ahhh. Oh...funny.

293
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,580
Ahhh.

294
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,100
That was already correct.

295
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,080
Don't make me laugh, Bee

296
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,710
My stomach hurts.

297
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,810
You're so cute even you don't smile.

298
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,940
You're also cute when you smile.

299
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,020
And especially when you laugh,

300
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,230
you are so damn cute!

301
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,250
So cute~

302
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,240
So you think I'm cute and do you love me?

303
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
I am loving you.

304
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,890
Ayy.

305
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,940
You make my mouth wet.

306
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,120
Wait.

307
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,090
I'm not done putting it on.

308
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,500
You've got some crow's feet on your eyes.

309
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,960
Prince!

310
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,010
Masks it up, so you'll look good tomorrow.

311
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,980
I'll just pour everything here.

312
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,600
Oh it's cold.

313
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,920
What are you doing?

314
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,180
Are you gonna open a snack shop or something?

315
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,510
No no, Hia.

316
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,840
We have to be prepared going into the woods,

317
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,020
what if I suddenly wanna have some snacks?

318
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,650
My resort is not that remote.

319
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,190
I'm just trying to be prepared.

320
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,240
Oh.

321
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,540
I almost forgot

322
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm bringing that with me too.

323
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,960
Are you gonna play?

324
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah.

325
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,270
We're going to a raft resort.

326
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,580
I wanna play my guitar by the river.

327
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,700
And are you almost done here?

328
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,650
We have to wake up in a few hours.

329
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,690
I'm done.

330
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,940
You're complaining like a dad.

331
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,820
Let's go to bed then.

332
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,380
Hey Hia.

333
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,760
Go back to your room.

334
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,160
I'm still having a bit of fever.

335
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,960
What if I ended up shock and died?

336
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,120
I touched your body just now.

337
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,400
It's completely cold.

338
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,460
Come on.

339
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,200
I'm just trying to be cautious.

340
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,030
Good night.

341
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,880
Hia!

342
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,180
Don't be loud. A patient is trying to sleep.

343
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,630
- Scoot over.
- Ouch.

344
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,080
What are you doing?

345
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,050
Look!

346
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,960
The view is amazing!

347
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,920
Is this

348
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,390
P'Win's resort?

349
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,350
Yeah.

350
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,560
I think he has another hotel in Chonburi too.

351
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,520
And...

352
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,210
I don't remember where else.

353
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,620
P'Win is so rich.

354
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,990
Pharm look!

355
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,020
Look at that.

356
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,360
Let's take pictures there later.

357
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,030
Thank you.

358
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,620
Sure.

359
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,890
Here's yours, P'Phruek.

360
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,240
Hand this out to the boys.

361
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,020
Here.

362
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,660
You know where to sleep tonight.

363
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,820
You know the drill.

364
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,700
F*ck you, Win.

365
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,890
Ahhhh.

366
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,660
So refreshing.

367
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,520
Thank you.

368
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,500
Or you wanna sleep in my room?

369
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,860
I can take such a deep breath.

370
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,010
Is this the key for Pharm and me?

371
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,660
Pharm.

372
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,170
Your room key is with Dean.

373
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,230
Okay P'Win.

374
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,050
And you!

375
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,480
come with me.

376
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,320
Hia.

377
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,740
I wanna sleep with Pharm!

378
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,430
Pharm.

379
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,420
Hey you're just gonna leave me like this?

380
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,250
Pharm.

381
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,330
Pharm.

382
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,240
Help me.

383
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,300
Please take care of that.

384
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,610
Let's go, Pharm.

385
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,740
Let's go put our bags in the room.

386
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,160
Sure.

387
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,720
It's all gone P'

388
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,290
Let's go.

389
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,890
You sleep with me.

390
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:08,960
Pharm.

391
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,020
Did you send pictures to Manow?

392
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,610
I did.

393
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,810
P'Phruek.

394
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,260
So what is it with my friend?

395
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,080
Well...

396
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,240
like you all see.

397
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,780
I've been trying to date her.

398
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,430
And...

399
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,060
It's about to be successful.

400
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,790
Woww.

401
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,450
You're so cool.

402
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,380
Super straightforward.

403
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,470
Why do I have to deny?

404
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,500
If I like someone, I'll admit that I like someone.

405
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,780
There's no point

406
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,980
of keeping it to myself.

407
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,040
Also,

408
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,780
there'd be no one in my way, if I'm being forward with her first.

409
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,310
Pharm.

410
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,880
Hmm?

411
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,500
Why are you laughing?

412
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,600
Nothing.

413
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,740
Don't you wanna be

414
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,120
like that, Team?

415
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,030
Nonsense!

416
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,330
Team.

417
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,740
Pharm!

418
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,850
I'll tell P'Win!

419
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,770
Go ahead.

420
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,260
Run to him and tell him.

421
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:15,960
Team.

422
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,500
Go tell him!

423
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,640
Go go.

424
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,900
You've been smiling more lately.

425
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,540
What are you talking about?

426
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,210
You look happier.

427
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,810
You found your own happiness?

428
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,520
Yeah.

429
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,600
I think so.

430
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,100
When are you going to tell him?

431
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,480
Maybe tonight.

432
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,190
Good luck, dude.

433
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,680
And I'm happy for you.

434
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,260
Thanks dude.

435
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,580
I don't even know what are you guys playing.

436
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,690
What are we playing?

437
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,340
Ouch!

438
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,660
You're so drama!

439
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,510
Your turn, Bee!

440
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,010
Any question for him guys?

441
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,590
I do!

442
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,050
What the hell, Sea?

443
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,450
I want to know

444
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,310
how's it going with the temple doggo mission?

445
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,730
Where are you at now?

446
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,410
That's a good one.

447
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,040
I've been dating him.

448
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,090
Awwww.

449
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,130
Temple doggo!

450
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,830
My turn to spin.

451
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,100
Do it. Do it. Spin.

452
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,370
Guys!

453
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,180
You got the chance.

454
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,910
Come up with a real good one.

455
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,160
I need apologize to you in advance P'Dean.

456
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,630
It will be a light question.

457
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,630
Who made the first move

458
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,930
you or Pharm?

459
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Answer him.

460
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,310
It was me.

461
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,490
Wowwww.

462
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,210
What's up?

463
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,580
The guy who fell for him.

464
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,460
Leave me!

465
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,010
Shit.

466
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,110
Be kind to him.

467
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,200
Do you have a boyfriend?

468
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,640
Shit...

469
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,470
That's harsh.

470
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,440
Super harsh.

471
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,110
Ooohh my god.

472
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,370
I don't.

473
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,370
***

474
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,260
What's going on, Tul?

475
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:31,830
[Chuckle]

476
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,940
You seem like a depressed dog.

477
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,490
Are you here to comfort me or to make it worse?

478
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,270
You guys...

479
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,040
I think...

480
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,760
I'm in love someone.

481
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,690
But my love is like...

482
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,110
happens in a complicated way.

483
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,380
How?

484
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,140
I love him.

485
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,150
I know him.

486
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,570
I know who he is.

487
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,040
But...

488
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,900
he doesn't know me.

489
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,760
I met him in a game.

490
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,790
At first,

491
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,860
we just had fun in the game and such.

492
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,020
But then as the time goes by,

493
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,980
I hear more stories of his life.

494
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,370
And he...

495
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,940
is comfortable to talk to me about everything

496
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,179
because we don't know each other.

497
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,180
And how did you find out who he is?

498
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,490
It was a coincident.

499
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,020
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

500
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,120
About who you are.

501
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,170
It's like...

502
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,440
I'm his safe zone.

503
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,810
Like...

504
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,700
the situation that I'm in right now..

505
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,180
he's comfortable to tell me,

506
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,420
comfortable to talk to me.

507
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,940
I'm afraid that one day, if he found out the truth

508
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,420
everything would be different.

509
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,630
Are you sure that you love him

510
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,800
with all these reasons?

511
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,290
Not just having fun.

512
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,700
What is love then?

513
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,640
When I want...

514
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,090
to take care of him

515
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,070
I want to make him happy

516
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,210
or when he's sad

517
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,230
I wanna be by his side.

518
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,110
When he's smile,

519
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,340
I'm also happy with him.

520
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,160
Can you call those things love, Dean?

521
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,320
If we can,

522
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,040
then I guess I love him.

523
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,630
But for him,

524
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,660
he doesn't even know...

525
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,280
my name.

526
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,700
You don't let me know where you'll be again.

527
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,610
Happy birthday to you...

528
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,710
Happy birthday to you...

529
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,110
Happy birthday...

530
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:53,540
Happy birthday to Hia.

531
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,490
Hey! Not yet.

532
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,220
You need to make a wish first.

533
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,330
I do this every year

534
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,740
and it never came true.

535
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,420
Can I try not to make any wishes this year?

536
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,310
Umm.

537
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:09,940
Sure.

538
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,020
I'll let you try.

539
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,910
Happy birthday, Hia.

540
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,300
I completely forgot that it's my birthday today.

541
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,220
Since when did you remember your birthday?

542
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,190
You only remember mine and Hia Win's.

543
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,470
It's not that important.

544
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,860
Can I sleep with you tonight?

545
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,370
So comfy~

546
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,990
Good night, Hia.

547
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,300
Good night.

548
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,000
Hia.

549
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,670
What?

550
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,770
I don't care what other people think of you.

551
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,840
But for me,

552
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,130
you are super cool, you know that?

553
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,480
Why are you being sweet?

554
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,960
It's cringy!

555
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,360
I'll finish school and come help you work.

556
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,380
You're talking too much.

557
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,780
Let's go to sleep.

558
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,160
Can I cuddle?

559
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,510
No!

560
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,170
It's weird.

561
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,600
How is it weird?

562
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,740
Let me cuddle you.

563
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,790
I can't breath.

564
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,340
I love you.

565
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,200
Even you have a bad mouth sometimes,

566
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,480
but I still love you.

567
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,340
Did you eat anything different today?

568
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,800
I'm not used to this.

569
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,660
Hia.

570
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,700
What?

571
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,450
Your armpit smells.

572
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,330
Did you shower?

573
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,610
Really?

574
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,910
I did shower.

575
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,730
Wow.

576
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,360
Shit look at each one of you.

577
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:58,800
Hey!

578
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,630
Let's go!

579
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,250
Go back to your room.

580
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,080
Hey. Get up. Get up.

581
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,900
Are you guys drunk?

582
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,790
Before complaining others,
you look at yourself first.

583
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,910
I'm okay.

584
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,690
Go to your room.

585
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,970
I can stand by myself.

586
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,000
I can. I can.

587
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,990
Come on.

588
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,890
Hurry up.

589
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,020
You go carry Bee.

590
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,930
Get up now!

591
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,490
Get up.

592
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,040
Just walk. Easy. Easy.

593
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,200
Step 1 2 3.

594
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,860
Why do we have to be here?

595
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,940
Hey hey. Wait wait.

596
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,050
Is that a ghost?

597
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,680
No!

598
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,570
Oh it's...

599
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,450
Team.

600
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,410
Yeah.

601
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,900
Team.

602
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,060
What are you doing over there?

603
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,010
Stop talking.

604
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,690
Team.

605
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,010
Why don't you go to bed?

606
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,090
I'm not sleepy.

607
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,120
You guys go ahead.

608
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:09,750
Okay.

609
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,680
Let me see your face.

610
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,430
You might fall, A!

611
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,440
Hey.

612
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,460
You're not drunk, right?

613
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,580
I'm not.

614
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,500
You guys should go to sleep.

615
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,410
- We're not drunk either.
- Sure

616
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,000
Hey hey.

617
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,830
I mean it's me, who's not drunk right?

618
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,180
Hey.

619
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:31,800
What?

620
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,620
Guys. I don't wanna walk anymore.

621
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,130
Huh?

622
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,500
I don't wanna walk anymore.

623
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,670
I told you guys.

624
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,700
It's okay that we drink.

625
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,820
But we have to be careful.

626
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,460
Drinking too much is troublesome.

627
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,680
This is my friend, isn't it?

628
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,960
Hey that's the damn P'Win.

629
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,490
Win! My dude.

630
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,980
He's not your damn friend!

631
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,090
Hey.

632
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,380
What are you doing here alone?

633
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:15,910
Are you drunk?

634
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,050
No, I'm not.

635
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,480
You shouldn't be sitting by the river alone.

636
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,230
Hia.

637
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,130
I'm an athlete from the swimming club.

638
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,400
But this is the river.

639
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,860
Not a swimming track in the club.

640
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:45,560
Yeah.

641
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,520
I'm sorry.

642
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,770
Good boy.

643
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,180
What are you doing here alone?

644
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,500
You might got bitten by mosquitos.

645
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,490
Just watching the stars.

646
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,980
We don't often get to relax like this.

647
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,450
Look at those.

648
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:17,590
Wow.

649
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,720
It's beautiful.

650
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,100
Yeah.

651
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,360
It's kinda relaxing looking at it.

652
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,420
Hia.

653
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,270
I'm sleepy.

654
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,440
I'm just gonna go.

655
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,780
Are you happy?

656
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,380
I am.

657
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,220
I love you, Pharm.

658
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,660
I love you a lot.

659
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,620
I love you the most.

660
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,330
I...

661
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,170
love you too P'Dean.

662
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:18,430
I always have.

663
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,170
Right now...

664
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,290
you're fond of him more than anyone else.

665
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,660
If you are not serious about him,

666
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,350
don't lead him on.

667
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,080
I'm not--

668
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,350
But if you are,

669
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,870
then make it clear for him.

670
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,150
If you're not,

671
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,300
then don't give anyone's hope.

672
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,900
I didn't mean it to be this way.

673
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,080
I know

674
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,760
that you didn't mean it.

675
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,570
But you actions,

676
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,970
seems like you mean it that way.

677
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,300
I already have sex with Team.

678
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,100
Our relationship...

679
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,560
started off that way.

680
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,460
You started like that...

681
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,480
and how is it going to end?

682
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,570
I don't know.

683
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,300
But what we have right now is already good enough.

684
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,130
Hia.

685
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,220
What are you doing?

686
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,340
You're such a jerk.

687
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,700
Always teases and seduces me.

688
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,450
If I do it for real,

689
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:37,540
can you promise me...

690
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,540
that you're not gonna run away from me?

691
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,140
You can be afraid of anything in this world,

692
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,180
I'm ready and can always be by your side.

693
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,140
But you can't be afraid of me.

694
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,580
Do you understand?

695
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:44,100
Especially my feelings for you.

696
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,310
Man up!

697
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,800
I'm not gonna run away from you.

698
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,020
But you need to catch me if you can.

699
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,340
Our relationship right now,

700
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,300
we both are beneficial from it, aren't we?

701
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,130
Yes.

702
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,390
And if one day I got bored,

703
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,820
then we can break up.

704
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,320
What's the matter?

705
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,140
Can I ask you something, Hia?

706
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,140
Is everything...

707
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,600
the same right now?

708
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,150
What do you mean?

709
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,660
The question I asked you long ago,

710
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,140
what were we back then?

711
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,280
And right now...

712
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,860
is it the same as we used to be?

713
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:58,580
Well...

714
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,410
I...

715
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,750
Thank you for the answer.

716
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,750
Let’s go.

717
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,750
You’re such a good person.

718
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:08,000
You’re too good until I’m scared.

719
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,000
I’m afraid that when you make me a special person,

720
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,710
But in fact…

721
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,980
you’re justjust doing this to everyone.

722
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:18,980
Team.

723
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,430
Shit!

724
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:25,760
P’Waan.

725
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,040
Can you hear me?

726
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,930
P’Waan!
