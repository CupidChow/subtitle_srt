1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not gonna disappear from you again.

2
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,590
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,950
I care for the person I have nice feeling for.

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,750
Doesn't mean we're dating.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,930
What about me?

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,620
Do you care for me?

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,030
Oh P'Waan.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,680
I just feel like I've known you before.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,020
What if the company finds out?

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,020
Or the fans find out?

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,090
This is a very serious matter.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,960
It could be worse than you can ever imagined.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,500
It's not easy.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,430
To be sure that you really love someone.

15
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,370
Ughh.
Why do I have to born stupid like this!?

16
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:06,930
What?

17
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,810
All gone?

18
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,380
Who is that?

19
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,990
Hia.

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,510
Here.

21
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,210
Please come inside, Hia.

22
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,790
Stop right there.

23
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,340
You can have one,

24
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,620
when you finish 1 chapter.

25
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,670
Arghh Hia.

26
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,440
You're so mean.

27
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,580
So that means

28
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,160
just now I finished 2 chapters

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,730
I can have 2 bags then?

30
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,700
You need to read and understand it too.

31
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,579
Not just skimming through.

32
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,650
Ughh Hia.

33
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,100
What was the score did you get for English?

34
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,390
5

35
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,560
Not bad.

36
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,780
Out of 10, right?

37
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,270
Out of...

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,020
30

39
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,940
You're so dumb.

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,160
Hia.

41
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,980
Even you've got the scholarship now,

42
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,890
but if your grades
do not meet the criteria

43
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,170
you could lose it too.

44
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,150
You threaten me for the millionth time.

45
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,590
I know if my grades are bad,
I'd lose my scholarship.

46
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,570
But I'm stupid.
What do you want me to do?

47
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,150
That's why I'm here to tutor you.

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,180
You are here to tutor me!?

49
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,530
You think I'm here just to bring you snacks?

50
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,510
Or...

51
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,800
you invited me in

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,500
because you think I would do something else?

53
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
Hey Hia!

54
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,830
Are you sure?

55
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,700
that you're smart enough to tutor me?

56
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,130
You can't just teach me randomly.

57
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,920
Hey hey.

58
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,780
I'm technically an honor student.

59
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,740
And are you tutoring me...

60
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,180
just because you want something in return?

61
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,700
Just saying,

62
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,120
I don't have the money to pay you.

63
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,340
For you,

64
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,140
that's all I want in return

65
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,740
per one tutoring session.

66
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,800
Do you normally...

67
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,140
ask people to pay you
like what you did to me?

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,780
Normally, I teach others for free.

69
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,560
There's only you,

70
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,400
that I charge with a kiss.

71
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,590
Let me ask you for real.

72
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,220
Why is it only me?

73
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,030
Because it's YOU.

74
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,700
Me?

75
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,850
Yeah.

76
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,300
Here.

77
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,330
Let's do it.

78
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,570
Teach me.

79
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,500
Ughhh!

80
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,950
Is it really!?

81
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,240
What if I really like him?

82
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,170
What are you gonna do then?

83
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,280
Why can't actors be in love too?

84
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,250
Hello?

85
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,220
Er...

86
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,900
Are you asleep?

87
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,500
Not yet.

88
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,860
I'm reading my script.

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,570
For a TV series?

90
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:00,990
Yeah.

91
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,700
I won't disturb you then.

92
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,360
Hey wait!

93
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,620
I just finished reading it.

94
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,390
Oh.

95
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,380
And...

96
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,410
What's up?
Why are you calling me?

97
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,020
Er...

98
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,870
Well...

99
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,910
About...

100
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,760
the bike incident.

101
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,440
Was it inappropriate?

102
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,630
And...

103
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,350
where did you hear that?

104
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,930
From the internet.

105
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,679
So...

106
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,659
does that affect you?

107
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,500
Is there anyone bugging you because of that?

108
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,000
Hey!

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,330
No. Not at all.

110
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,230
If it troubles you,

111
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm so sorry.

112
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,750
Being with me,

113
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,740
can be pretty uncomfortable, right?

114
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,430
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,110
It's not like that, Prince.

116
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,680
Well...

117
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,130
Oh hey I gotta go. A is calling me.

118
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,860
Ughhhhhh!

119
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,750
Why did I have to say that?

120
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,060
What if he's overthinking because of that?

121
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,780
Why are you so stupid, Bee?

122
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,100
Get a grip! Get a grip!

123
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,200
What's up?

124
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,170
A didn't call me earlier.

125
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,990
I was being stupid.

126
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,020
Being with you is not uncomfortable at all.

127
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,660
Even though it could be,

128
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,660
but I will

129
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,100
squeeze myself to fit with your lifestyle instead.

130
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,540
What?

131
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,450
I wanna be by your side.

132
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,860
Can I be by your side?

133
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,780
Sure thing.

134
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,380
Squeeze yourself right in!

135
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,590
For real, Prince?

136
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,270
Yeah.

137
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,230
Yayyyy!

138
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,820
Prince. I gotta hang up.

139
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,830
Hey!

140
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,090
I did it! I finally did it!!

141
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,360
Er…

142
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,340
We'll take my bike today.

143
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,280
Okay.

144
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,860
"You can do it"

145
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,190
What is this?

146
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,720
My support.

147
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,100
Like you used to say.

148
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,250
What support?

149
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,310
You have an exam today, haven’t you?

150
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,630
I can’t tutor you either.

151
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:30,970
Here.

152
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,960
So here's my support.

153
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,500
But back then this drink
was not the only support I got though.

154
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,100
You have too good of a memory.

155
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,950
Happy now?

156
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,500
We need to go before we’re late.

157
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,890
Come on!

158
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,020
Ughh what should I do?

159
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,360
I’m doomed.

160
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,300
You are not gonna die, Team.

161
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,150
Manow.

162
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,880
What?

163
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,660
I don’t understand a thing on this.

164
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,560
Arghh.

165
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,040
If you don’t understand,
how can you survive until today?

166
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,060
I randomly guess.

167
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,900
You can’t really do it?
For real?

168
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,410
I saw you guys were tutoring until late night.

169
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,500
How do you know!?

170
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,780
Cause P'Win posted pictures.

171
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,180
The whole uni probably knows.

172
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,410
Huh?

173
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,440
Here.

174
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,250
Do we have any snacks left in this world?

175
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,860
Where am I going to get snacks then
as it's all gone, Pharm?

176
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,110
Stop talking. Stop talking.

177
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,740
Snacks ~

178
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,840
Stop mocking me.

179
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,080
I wanna have some snacks~

180
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,710
Manow. Stop it!

181
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,730
I wanna have some snacks~

182
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,420
Stop talking!

183
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,850
Team! She might die.

184
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,520
Stop.

185
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,370
Manow. / Manow.

186
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,600
All the snacks in this world are all gone.

187
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,700
Manow!

188
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:45,750
Stop!

189
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,890
Manow!

190
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,630
- I wanna have some snacks. Can you please take me?
- Manow!

191
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,630
Manow.

192
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,240
How was today’s exam?

193
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,100
Exactly like what you tutored me!

194
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,680
See you can do it.

195
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

196
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,140
Where are you sleeping tonight?

197
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,690
Your room.

198
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,220
Good boy.

199
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,020
I know. Let's go.

200
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,950
Do you believe what Pharm said about the red thread?

201
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,020
Red thread as in the soulmates?

202
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,800
Yeah.

203
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,280
I believe half of it.

204
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,170
If it's real, it'd probably be fun.

205
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,510
But I do wonder...

206
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,790
Wonder what?

207
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,260
Such small thread like that,

208
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,660
is it gonna be able to hold?

209
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,860
A little pull and it's torn apart.

210
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,660
Why are you laughing?

211
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,980
Hia.

212
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,339
You're the least romantic person, did you know that?

213
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,000
The red thread.

214
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,040
Can't be easily broken.

215
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,109
Hey.

216
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm just looking at it based on reality.

217
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,340
A small thread like that can be torn easily.

218
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,540
And why would they tie each other with that?

219
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,600
I don't get it.

220
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,510
It should be this.

221
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,540
Here.

222
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,460
Wait.

223
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,320
Why do you have hemp rope in your room?

224
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,880
What kind of a person are you?

225
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,340
This is the leftover from the project.

226
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,040
So I brought it back with me.

227
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,500
Why?

228
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,420
You think I have this to tie you up?

229
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,140
Hmm?

230
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,480
You're freaking creepy.

231
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,700
The red thread

232
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,540
is only for little boys like Dean and Pharm.

233
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,570
For you and me,

234
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,860
it has to be hemp rope only.

235
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,170
More suitable.

236
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,340
What are you talking about?

237
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,340
Hey!

238
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,800
What are you doing?

239
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,330
- See?
-Hia!?

240
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,220
Never gonna break.

241
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,430
Hia.

242
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,600
You're a grown ass man.

243
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,920
What are you doing?

244
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,550
Why?

245
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,700
I wanna do what I want.

246
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,320
Are you the only grown up one?

247
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,940
You want to tease other people, huh?

248
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,450
You want to play?

249
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,320
Hia.

250
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,020
Wait!

251
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,990
Here.

252
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,170
You tie yourself too.

253
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,140
Hemp rope, huh?

254
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,430
It's not gonna torn apart right?

255
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,770
Then you're not going anywhere.

256
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,600
I wanna have what P'Pharm made again.

257
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,430
It's good.

258
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,010
Right?

259
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,800
I told you it's so damn good.

260
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,320
Yeah.

261
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,900
Is this how you put this together?

262
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,830
Cool right?

263
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,580
Oh Win!
How come you're here?

264
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,880
Dad. Mom.

265
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,640
This is Team.
A junior from my club.

266
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,360
Where's Waan?

267
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,910
He's not back yet?

268
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,520
He slept at the hotel

269
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,870
He was there last night to clear some work.

270
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,030
Just another excuse.

271
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,180
If he doesn't wanna come home, let him be.

272
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,790
Just tell him to move out.

273
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,810
Or perhaps change his last name.

274
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,000
Dad.

275
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,300
When will you stop talking about him like that?

276
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,100
I've always been like this.

277
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,830
Why?

278
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,520
Are you another one who can't accept me?

279
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,540
Wiew.

280
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,030
Calm down.

281
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,800
Not true.

282
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,660
You're not the same.

283
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,270
Not at all.

284
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,960
You can't even

285
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,080
let me finish speaking.

286
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,640
Wiew.

287
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,870
Team.

288
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,860
Take Wiew outside.

289
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,760
Wiew.

290
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,140
Let's go.

291
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,860
Dad.

292
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,730
Can I talk to you?

293
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,130
Did you know?

294
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,160
When...

295
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,820
my family's business was smaller than this

296
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,920
we used to go on a lot of trips during weekends.

297
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,110
But when my Dad...

298
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,660
opened more branches,

299
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,990
he has less time for us.

300
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,080
Hia Win and Waan have to

301
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,270
study business.

302
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,060
So when they graduate,
they could help him out.

303
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,360
He talks to us less.

304
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,630
Pressure us more.

305
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,340
I feel bad for Hia Waan the most.

306
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,590
I don't know

307
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,590
whether his work is good or not.

308
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,260
But from what I've seen,

309
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,870
he is very determined.

310
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,340
I don't understand why dad can't see that.

311
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,270
Or it's just...

312
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,040
not good enough for him?

313
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,540
If I were Hia Waan,

314
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,980
I wouldn't be able...

315
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,340
to stand him this long.

316
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,480
I just...

317
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,500
want my old family back.

318
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,860
One more thing,

319
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,060
I don't want this big of a house too.

320
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,090
I just...

321
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,760
I just...

322
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,780
wanna have dinner with everyone on the table sometimes.

323
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,490
Like a normal family.

324
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,260
That's all.

325
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,940
Each families has their own problems, Wiew.

326
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,190
It's either big or small.

327
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,300
Either you can adjust to it quickly or slowly.

328
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,660
Give him some time.

329
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,620
There might be a lot for him to think about.

330
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,860
Also many things that he's responsible for.

331
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,500
Good thing is!

332
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,140
Hia Win will take care of it for you.

333
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,490
I brought you guys some snacks.

334
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,330
Thank you.

335
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,130
I have to apologize on his behalf.

336
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,380
You shouldn't have to witness that.

337
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,640
That's fine.

338
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,870
I understand.

339
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,830
You're a junior from Win's club right?

340
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:58,990
Yes.

341
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,030
I'm a junior from his club.

342
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,110
How's it going at the uni?

343
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,650
Is Win dating someone?

344
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,730
Win rarely talks to me about this stuff.

345
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,760
I really have no idea.

346
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,110
Ok then make yourself at home.

347
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,600
Please stay for dinner before going home.

348
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,690
Oh...

349
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,690
I have an urgent errand.

350
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,450
I probably can't stay.

351
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,540
Too bad.

352
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,100
Come visit us another time then?

353
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,170
Sure.

354
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,930
Please carry on.

355
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,680
Wiew, don't bother him much okay?

356
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,890
You have something urgent ?

357
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,540
Yeah.

358
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,230
So...

359
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,900
your brother's probably gonna be in there for awhile?

360
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,610
Please tell him for me

361
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,730
that I have to go.

362
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,300
I already promise to go see Pharm.

363
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,720
Sure bro.

364
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,250
Thank you...

365
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,930
for staying with me.

366
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,130
Don't overthink.

367
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,660
You can call me anytime.

368
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,300
Understood?

369
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,960
Yes.

370
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,370
Have one before you go.

371
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,070
It's good.

372
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,340
Yeah it is.

373
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,270
I gotta go. Bye bye.

374
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,570
See ya.

375
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,370
Are you telling me

376
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,870
that I pressure you guys too much?

377
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,660
Look at your brother!

378
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,770
How can I die in peace?

379
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,820
I create all of these for you guys.

380
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,380
The money.

381
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,840
Secure jobs.

382
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,380
What if I died?

383
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,640
And everything collapsed?

384
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,020
How are you guys going to live?

385
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,670
Have you ever asked us?

386
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,460
Whether we want all of these?

387
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,680
The money.

388
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,230
The hotel.

389
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,780
The resort.

390
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,460
Or happiness we used to have?

391
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,710
I choose the happiness.

392
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,490
Win!

393
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,980
Do you remember our family back then?

394
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,860
When you got back from work,

395
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,450
and taught us homework.

396
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,490
We had dinner altogether.

397
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,460
Went on many trips.

398
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,020
I'm not sure whether you've forgotten all those moments.

399
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,080
But I never have

400
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,220
and miss it a lot.

401
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:52,910
Hey.

402
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,730
Where's Team?

403
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,580
He's gone.

404
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,410
How did he go back?

405
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,250
Well...

406
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,750
Taxi.

407
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,260
Excuse me

408
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,690
then.

409
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,620
Um.

410
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,100
It's super crispy. Try it.

411
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,490
Why is it so salty?

412
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,560
My hand.

413
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,420
Team.

414
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,810
You asked us to come out with you.

415
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,390
But you're sit there sadly.

416
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,280
What's the matter?

417
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,330
Yeah.

418
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,100
Team.

419
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,620
What's wrong?

420
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,870
I'm just a junior.

421
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,770
Huh?

422
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,120
You guys,

423
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,980
what's it like

424
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,160
when we love someone?

425
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,270
Team.

426
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,470
Are you...

427
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,640
P'Win right?

428
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,080
What makes you guys think that way?

429
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,240
Wow...

430
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,110
We never said anything

431
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,300
doesn't mean that we've never seen stuff, you know?

432
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:28,730
For me.

433
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,690
I've never seen P'Win interested in anyone like you.

434
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,080
Always mention you.

435
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,950
When people skip the club,

436
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,960
he never complained a word.

437
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,730
Yeah.

438
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,360
But when you only come in late,

439
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,650
he would ask about you for millions of times.

440
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,830
But...

441
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,740
we've never discussed what are we.

442
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,980
Never really talked about it.

443
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,180
He doesn't treat me differently from others also.

444
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,670
Then you just tell him.

445
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,400
What are you waiting for?

446
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:04,920
I'm...

447
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,040
I'm not sure

448
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,380
whether his feeling is reciprocated with me.

449
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,550
What if he does?

450
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,790
but why does he never say it?

451
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,500
Just like you.

452
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,340
You know how you feel right?

453
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,870
Then just tell him directly.

454
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm afraid that he might not accept it.

455
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,310
Afraid that he might not feel the same way.

456
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,400
Have you tried?

457
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,790
You need to try first.

458
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,860
Don't just think by yourself.

459
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,690
If you don't wanna lose him,

460
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,920
then you should try first.

461
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,180
Cheers?

462
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,560
Yeah.

463
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,370
Hey hey hey.

464
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,440
You might get too drunk.

465
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,440
Hia.

466
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,300
You're late.

467
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,360
Only 3 minutes late.

468
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,540
Where do you wanna study?

469
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,150
At your room.

470
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,110
Let me go buy some coffee first.

471
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,620
Buy some for me too!

472
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,840
I tutor you for free.

473
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,020
But I still need to buy you drinks, really?

474
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:17,930
Let's go.

475
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,740
I'll just get a lemon iced tea.

476
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,330
Lemon iced tea.

477
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,580
Not gonna order something else?

478
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,010
I can't pronounce it.

479
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,710
Order for me too then.

480
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,620
I'll get a Mocha Frappuccino.
With whipped cream and half a pump of syrup.

481
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,250
Go order it yourself.

482
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,440
I'll buy you a drink,

483
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,820
but you still ask me to order it for you?

484
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,920
Fine fine.

485
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,300
What's your drink again?

486
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,520
Mocha Frappuccino.
With whipped cream and half a pump of syrup.

487
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,969
Mocha Cappuccino.

488
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,409
Frappuccino.

489
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,440
Frappu--

490
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,989
What's Frappuccino?

491
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,679
It's a blended drink.

492
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,949
Why can't you just say blended Mocha?

493
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,230
Yeah.

494
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,949
That's my favorite drink.

495
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,920
If you can remember it,

496
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,580
next time you'll be able to order it for me.

497
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,920
Mocha Cappu...

498
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,510
Frappuccino.

499
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,540
Frappuccino.

500
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,160
whipped cream and half a pump of syrup.

501
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,590
Yeah.

502
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,720
Here.

503
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,600
Oh!

504
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,430
Good job.

505
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,290
I'm not a little kid.

506
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,590
Why do you keep patting on my head?

507
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,340
Let's go.

508
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,330
[Gentle Hit]

509
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,180
Oww.

510
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,690
You don't have to put an S right there.

511
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,890
How many times have I told you?
Remember it!

512
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,390
I just can't remember it.

513
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,020
You have such a short memory.

514
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,720
I don't understand why I can't remember either.

515
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,140
Maybe I'm just good with physical things
more than things that I need to use my brain.

516
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,870
My favorite drink is...

517
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,920
Mocha Frappuccino.
With whipped cream and half a pump of syrup.

518
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,260
What if I don't want any syrup that day?

519
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,880
Then iced Americano.

520
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,420
What are you laughing at?

521
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,780
But you can remember my favorite drink name.

522
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,710
It's just a type of a coffee.

523
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,870
It's not the same.

524
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,700
Or you want me to teach you intensely?

525
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,460
Until you cannot forget a thing?

526
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,390
No!

527
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,280
What!?

528
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,640
I tutor you for free

529
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,770
and sometimes I have to buy you food as well.

530
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,930
You already charged me.

531
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,020
Don't pretend like you don't know.

532
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,090
You kissed my forehead!

533
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,890
And did you remember...

534
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,370
what I said?

535
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,100
That's all I want in return

536
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,690
per one tutoring session.

537
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,450
Shit!

538
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,220
I haven't charged for other sessions.

539
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,840
After the exam, I'll come for all of it.

540
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,040
Are you going to kiss me until my forehead is bruised?

541
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,410
Or...

542
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,780
you'd give me more than just a forehead kiss?

543
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:36,800
Hia.

544
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,480
Hmm?

545
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,090
If that night...

546
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,660
If that night we didn't sleep together,

547
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,670
What?

548
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,400
Nothing.

549
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,410
That's my deposit.

550
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,940
It's already late.

551
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,220
I'm gonna go shower.

552
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,540
Thank you for teaching me.

553
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,540
I should be fine for tomorrow's exam. Bye.

554
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,150
A!

555
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,340
I got an A!

556
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:43,970
Hey!

557
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,460
I got an A too!

558
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,710
Really Manow!?

559
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,560
What about you, Team?

560
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:50,790
Hey!

561
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,540
Open your eyes.

562
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,660
No, I don't wanna look.

563
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,160
B.

564
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,270
Team got a B.

565
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,530
Hey you really got a B!

566
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,660
Hey!

567
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,170
I really got a B!

568
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,100
I did it!

569
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,150
See! If you actually try,

570
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,110
you can do it too.

571
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,860
P'Win is probably good at tutoring, huh?

572
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,540
Can he tutor us too?

573
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,270
Better not.

574
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,780
Why not?

575
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,030
P'Win will charge you guys.

576
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,290
Really?

577
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:27,890
And...

578
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,460
is it expensive?

579
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,150
It's not about the money.

580
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,340
What?

581
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,410
If it's not the money, then what is it?

582
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,220
He wants...

583
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,780
Nothing!

584
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,170
You guys are already good.
Just study by yourself.

585
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,950
Trust me.

586
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,520
Just tell me what P'Win wants
if we want him to tutor us.

587
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,630
He doesn't want anything.

588
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,630
Ughh I'm hungry.

589
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,920
My stomach is growling.

590
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,460
Take me for some food, please.

591
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,180
Let's go.

592
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,680
Go eat some food.

593
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,910
What?

594
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,700
Let's go eat.

595
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,510
So what does Hia Win want?

596
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,290
Let's go eat now, shall we?

597
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,450
I want to join your tutoring session!

598
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,560
Let's go eat first. Shut up, Manow.

599
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,640
The score was really good this time.

600
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,380
Yeah.

601
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,860
Let me show off a bit.

602
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,090
I got a good score.

603
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,360
Never got this much before.

604
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,760
But Prince got full marks.

605
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,800
You're really good.

606
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,280
Those things were on the exam.

607
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,350
Like A said,

608
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,850
everything you taught us was on the exam.

609
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,420
Let me ask you for real, Prince.

610
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,670
Did you steal the exam from the professor?

611
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,700
Are you nuts?

612
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,660
I just studied what we learned in the class. That's all.

613
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,270
Oh...

614
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,220
Do you wanna do something

615
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,230
on Christmas?

616
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,180
Do you wanna come party at my place?

617
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,300
Er...

618
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,180
we already have a plan.

619
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,680
Do you wanna join us?

620
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,480
Just a bar around here.

621
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,720
No, I cannot.

622
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,670
Why not?

623
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,290
He's an actor.

624
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,510
He can't be seen at the bar.

625
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,580
Oh right.

626
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,570
I forgot.

627
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,280
Why?

628
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,650
Why can't actors drink?

629
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,140
Actually...

630
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,300
I really like seeing Christmas lights.

631
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,060
But...

632
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,450
I haven't really gone to anywhere lately.

633
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:23,910
Then...

634
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,520
if we're done from the bar,

635
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,540
can we continue at your place?

636
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,160
Sure.

637
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,940
Come over.

638
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,270
I'll share you my location in the group chat.

639
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,760
Okay.

640
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,470
Finally, we have a place to continue!

641
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,280
Would you excuse me? I gotta go.

642
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,370
See you.

643
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,700
Enjoy your night.

644
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,170
Okay.

645
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,330
Bye bye.

646
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,320
Thank you.

647
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,100
What's wrong with you?

648
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,580
What's the matter?

649
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,120
- Walk like you have no energy.
- You look like a sad dog.

650
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,660
- You don't know what I'm going through.
- Lighten up.

651
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,610
Come on.

652
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,220
You got a good score.

653
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,190
Be careful, Manow.

654
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:16,830
Woahh.

655
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:17,470
Pharm.

656
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,700
I shouldn't have said that.

657
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,740
Oh!

658
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,530
P'Dean.

659
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,380
P'Dean.

660
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,740
Go go.

661
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,020
You're done with the exam?

662
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,600
How come you're here?

663
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,280
I'm gonna take you to see Christmas lights.

664
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,800
But...

665
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,170
I'm still in my uniform.

666
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,980
I already brought some clothes for you.

667
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,460
It is really my clothes.

668
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,330
How did you get this?

669
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,060
Er...Team.

670
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,890
Yes?

671
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,420
You have a swim meet this Tuesday, haven't you?

672
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,470
Why don't you go back and rest?

673
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,730
I'll...

674
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,180
go soon.

675
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,100
Or you want win to motivates you?

676
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,350
P'

677
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,850
Please have a mercy on me.

678
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,280
Hia Win is a pure devil.

679
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,330
I'm gonna go back to sleep today.

680
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,820
Sure.

681
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,840
Go back and rest.

682
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:36,840
Well...

683
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,040
excuse me then P'

684
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,280
You too come with me.

685
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:43,440
Excuse us.

686
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,850
No.

687
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,580
Hey.

688
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,530
Pharm.

689
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,220
See you.

690
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:46,980
You can do it!

691
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,760
Bye bye, P'Dean.

692
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,060
Pharm you can do it!

693
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,540
Don't change the subject.

694
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,680
Did you go to my room?

695
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,280
I got a permission.

696
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,380
Your mother called me at noon.

697
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,700
So I asked for her permission to take you out tonight.

698
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,190
Chit chat with her a bit,

699
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,990
then she said I can go get the clothes
from your room myself.

700
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,360
We don't have to waste time.

701
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,920
For the clothes,

702
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,890
your mother and Poom chose it for you.

703
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,110
Poom?

704
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,680
Yeah.

705
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,860
He probably saw me asking your mom
too many questions

706
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,030
and got annoyed.

707
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,400
So he chose it for me.

708
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,020
Wait.

709
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,460
How did my mom know your phone number?

710
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,480
P'Dean.

711
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,680
And how did she know that you have my key?

712
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,030
Since when did you call her mom?

713
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,860
P'Dean!

714
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,700
P'Dean!

715
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,300
Is he gonna be here on Christmas day?

716
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,460
Oh hey.

717
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,860
You're not going anywhere?

718
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,730
Where do you want me to be?

719
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,900
This whole week is all about exam.

720
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,700
I just submitted an assignment too.

721
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,970
Why do people have to go out today?

722
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,710
It's Christmas, Hia.

723
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:07,720
You're not going anywhere too.

724
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,180
So you're not going out with Pharm

725
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,290
and friends after the exam?

726
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,690
You probably slept all day huh?

727
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:18,770
There.

728
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,840
P'Dean came to pick him up right after the exam.

729
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,250
On Christmas day,

730
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,490
people would be with their loved ones.

731
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,630
Manow and I were a bit sad about that

732
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,020
so we changed our mind and went home instead.

733
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
What are you talking about 'Manow's gone home'?

734
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,930
What!? Manow!

735
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,060
She lied to me!

736
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,180
What are those things you're bringing here?

737
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,880
Snacks again!?

738
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,280
You're so--

739
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,820
I was gonna go home, watch movies and eat these snacks.

740
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,180
But I forgot,

741
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,560
I have something I want to tell you.

742
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,460
Tell me what?

743
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:25,440
About...

744
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,190
my English grade.

745
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:32,900
Is your grade out?

746
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,840
What did you get?

747
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,820
I got...

748
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,430
a B.

749
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,750
Next time get an A!

750
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,800
You do understand English

751
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,820
but you just don't wanna remember vocabulary

752
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,790
Kept saying that you can't do it.

753
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:57,790
Hia.

754
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,880
Who would have thought that I could do it!?

755
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,570
Where's my prize?

756
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,760
Hey!

757
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,970
I tutor you,
but you still ask for a prize from me?

758
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,090
Come on!

759
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,740
Is there any? Come on.

760
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:37,820
Hia.

761
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,140
So you don't have to knock.

762
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,060
Don't have to stand there and wait.

763
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,820
Or when I'm not in the room you can just come in.

764
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,050
Keep it safe.

765
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,820
Thank you.

766
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,160
Good boy.

767
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,920
I'm so proud of you.

768
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:10,880
Hia.

769
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:11,880
Hmm?

770
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,900
Let's go see the lights.

771
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:14,860
Huh?

772
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,210
Christmas lights.

773
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,730
Please~

774
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,820
Then let's get changed first.

775
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,710
Yes!!

776
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,440
Happy New Year, Hia!

777
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,750
Happy New Year.

778
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,000
Hope we can count down together next year.

779
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,100
No matter what happens,

780
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,100
just look over here.
