1
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,680
Hey. Hia.

2
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,680
What's the matter?

3
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,039
Just a little headache.

4
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,940
Get well soon, Hia.

5
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,430
You found your own happiness?

6
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,820
I think so.

7
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
When are you going to tell him?

8
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,560
Maybe tonight.

9
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
What were we?

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,140
Well...

11
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,140
I...

12
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,110
Thank you for the answer.

13
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,780
Hia.

14
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,410
Team.

15
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,730
I'm sorry, Hia.

16
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,250
I'm not in the mood today.

17
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,579
Are you mad at me?

18
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,250
Mad at you?

19
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,000
How can I be mad at you?

20
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,400
A guy like me...

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,290
has a right to be mad at you too?

22
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,329
Team.

23
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,910
I remember seeing a guitar at your house.

24
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920
You know how to play?

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,750
It's Waan's.

26
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,090
Don't change the subject.

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,460
Play it for me.

28
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,510
"I haven't said a word,"

29
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,100
"but you already showed up in the middle of my heart~"

30
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,570
"Who are you?"

31
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,360
"My heart trembles"

32
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,100
"trembles...trembles deep inside"

33
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,480
"I used to not care about anything"

34
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,310
"But now I tremble because of you."

35
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,310
"I close my eyes and I see you"

36
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,080
"I don't know how..."

37
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,240
"and why it happens..."

38
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,850
...just after I met this person

39
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,410
Do you understand the meaning of that song?

40
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,600
You played that song just now

41
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,170
are you trying to imply something?

42
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,390
And if I ask you right now?

43
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,810
what's your answer gonna be?

44
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,100
Hia.

45
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,600
Do you remember...

46
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,570
that I said I have something to tell you?

47
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,780
Umm.

48
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,750
You told me that I'm special.

49
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,520
You're kind to me.

50
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,860
Take care of me better than anyone else.

51
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,320
I'm so glad.

52
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,860
Like very much.

53
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,510
But I've always wondered,

54
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,660
that with...

55
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,610
with all these things that you do.

56
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,580
Do you really know

57
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,760
who you are?

58
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,450
I...

59
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,810
You're kind to everyone.

60
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,510
No matter who asks for your help,

61
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,409
you always help them.

62
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,150
What abour yourself?

63
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,360
Have you ever asked for help from others?

64
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,620
I've seen you as Wiew's brother.

65
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,450
As P'Waan's younger brother.

66
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,610
As a friend who always gives P'Dean advice.

67
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,610
As a guy whose his family relies on.

68
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,300
And...

69
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,940
as a good brother for me.

70
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,600
When you tutored me,

71
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,400
you also did it until late night.

72
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,020
What about yourself?

73
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,039
When did you study?

74
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,550
When I couldn't sleep,

75
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,220
you also waited up for me.

76
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,120
Wait for me to come over.

77
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,840
Even it was 1-2am, you still waited.

78
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,580
And did you

79
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,620
get to sleep yourself?

80
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,100
You're such a good person.

81
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,680
Too good and you make me afraid.

82
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,940
I'm afraid that when you make me feel special...

83
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,510
is in fact...

84
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,320
you're just being like this to everyone.

85
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,620
Team.

86
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm afraid, Hia.

87
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,790
I'm afraid that It's just all in my head.

88
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,660
You know me better than anyone.

89
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
You know what I like.

90
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,050
and what I don't like.

91
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,730
But when I look back at myself,

92
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,310
All I can--

93
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,080
All I can remember is your favorite coffee menu only.

94
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,340
I never do things for anyone

95
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,380
in the way I do it for you.

96
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,590
If you have to try so hard like this,

97
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,170
if you have to sacrifice who you truly are,

98
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,080
if that's the case.

99
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,200
I don't want to be special.

100
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,570
If the song you played just now...

101
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,060
portrays your feeling,

102
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,170
maybe you should try to listen mine.

103
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,030
"If today,"

104
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,660
"I don't get to let it out"

105
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,190
"If I don't confess..."

106
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,420
"my love..."

107
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,550
"to you,"

108
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,000
"I can't hold it in..."

109
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,990
"anymore"

110
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,510
"I don't know how to keep it to myself anymore."

111
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,750
"The more I wait"

112
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,370
"The more I want"

113
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,630
"I wanna be more"

114
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,510
"More than other people"

115
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,950
"More than just a special person"

116
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,460
"I wanna know where I am"

117
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,140
"What am I to you?"

118
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,040
"I wanna use the word 'love'."

119
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,500
"Can I use it with you?"

120
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,710
"I wanna be able to say I miss you"

121
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,340
"Use it with you..."

122
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,070
"...only"

123
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,750
"I wanna use the word 'love'."

124
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,550
"with you everyday"

125
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,930
"I wanna repeatedly tell you I love you"

126
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,670
"that I love you"

127
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,560
"I don't know whether it's possible."

128
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,990
"Please..."

129
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,420
"...tell me"

130
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,150
I just wanna tell...

131
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,900
I just wanna tell you, Hia.

132
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,640
I want you to know...

133
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,430
that I love you, Hia.

134
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,850
If you don't wanna be the one who initiates,

135
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,610
I'll be the one who initiate.

136
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,650
If you are afraid to love...

137
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,410
I'll be the one who loves you first.

138
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
But if all of these....

139
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,410
is not something you want right now,

140
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,020
can we at least try first?

141
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,520
I don't know what to do anymore.

142
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,450
If you're not there with me.

143
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,150
Enough.

144
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,850
That's enough, Team.

145
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,430
I'm sorry.

146
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,190
I'm sorry, Team.

147
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,370
I'm sorry that I make you worry.

148
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,050
I'm sorry that I make you feel afraid.

149
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,010
Hia.

150
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,020
I love you.

151
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,300
Did you hear me? I said I love you.

152
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,480
You fool.

153
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,630
I love you so damn much.

154
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,560
You’re not just someone special.

155
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,950
But I love you.

156
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,890
Am I telling you too late, am I not?

157
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,890
I love you too, Hia.

158
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,490
Will you be my boyfriend?

159
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:08,640
Umm.

160
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,820
You’re crying like a baby.

161
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,970
You said like you didn’t just cry.

162
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,250
So we’re together?

163
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,060
Yeah.

164
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,420
Noted.

165
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,890
You were so off-key.

166
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,720
As if…

167
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,210
you’re pretty good at singing?

168
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,130
I sing better than you as far as I know.

169
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,550
Scoot over.

170
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,230
This time will be different.

171
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,720
How?

172
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,410
We were not boyfriends previously.

173
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,760
But now,

174
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,930
we will act like we're supposed to.

175
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,990
I really wanna know

176
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,050
what’s gonna be different?

177
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,890
I want this one. What are you gonna do?

178
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,730
There’re so many bottles. Why do you have to fight?

179
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,240
It’s mine. / Give me!

180
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,170
Why fighting over this?
Give me that.

181
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,650
Hey!

182
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,580
You guys.

183
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,710
What are you doing over there?

184
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,890
Yeah.

185
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,480
Sitting close to me?

186
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,930
You’re not afraid of others to see anymore?

187
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,030
Yeah.

188
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,930
People are not gonna question just because of this.

189
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,290
I used to be jealous of Dean.

190
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,440
But now I’m not.

191
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,490
What makes you jealous of him?

192
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,370
I’m jealous that he gets to know what it feels like to love someone.

193
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,810
I’ve known him since I was in Junior high school.

194
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,690
He always looked for someone.

195
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,630
But when I asked,

196
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,730
he just said something very important.

197
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,010
It’s pretty cool actually.

198
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,470
For so many years,

199
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,210
he’s never interested in anyone.

200
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,260
Until he met Pharm.

201
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,700
The way he looks says it all

202
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,770
that this guy is the one

203
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,450
that he's always been waited.

204
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,540
I never wanted to have anyone

205
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,510
until I met Dean and Pharm.

206
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,410
They changed my perspective.

207
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,160
When Dean is tired,

208
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,690
just a call from Pharm would make all that go away.

209
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,980
That’s why I started

210
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,970
to wanna have someone by my side like him.

211
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,050
And then I found you.

212
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,390
You’re a lucky guy, Hia.

213
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,390
You met the first one

214
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,490
and he’s already good looking.

215
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,900
Nice behaviors too.

216
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,510
Plus he's such a good guy.

217
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,470
You’re so annoying.

218
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,530
Always getting on my nerves.

219
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,190
And also damn stubborn.

220
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,190
Hia.

221
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,800
But…

222
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,210
I also love you so damn much as well.

223
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,310
Oww.

224
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,550
That hurts!

225
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,250
Hia.

226
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,870
People might have seen that.

227
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,540
You are my boyfriend.

228
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,010
You dare to slap me?

229
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,270
Or you want more?

230
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,010
You're sure you can do it?

231
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,910
I’m gonna go

232
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,050
So tired.

233
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,790
Go back and get lots of rest.

234
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,650
Umm.

235
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,010
Get home safely, Pharm.

236
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,860
Let me know when you’re home.

237
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,390
Got it?

238
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,060
Got it.

239
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,860
Get home safe and sound.

240
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,300
Umm.

241
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,040
P’Dean.

242
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,770
I'll leave Pharm to you.

243
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,210
I gotta go.

244
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,990
See you.

245
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,360
Bye P’ / Bye P’Win.

246
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,190
See you.

247
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,830
See you.

248
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,230
Let’s go.

249
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,190
Hia.

250
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,210
Be careful, babe.

251
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,930
Hia!

252
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,770
People could hear it!

253
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,880
Just let them hear it.

254
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,890
This is my boyfriend.

255
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,190
Or you’re not?

256
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,770
Yeah.

257
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,470
I am your boyfriend.

258
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,150
Let’s go.

259
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,190
It’s so hot.

260
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,250
Wait up boyfriend!

261
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,660
There’s a shabu place just opened across the uni.

262
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,570
Wanna go try?

263
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:12,830
Err…

264
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,240
No, I cannot. I already have a thing coming.

265
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,190
Pharm.

266
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,200
Come with me.

267
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,440
Well…

268
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,370
I already have a date with P'Dean too.

269
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,570
What!?

270
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,450
What is it today?
You guys're so attached to your boyfriends.

271
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,840
Team, you’re crazy.

272
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,130
I’m not even P’Phruek’s girlfriend.

273
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,890
And people are busy...

274
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,130
cause today's Valentine's day.

275
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,980
Who's gonna hang out with friends?

276
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,500
Today is Valentine's?

277
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,190
Umm.

278
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,840
So...

279
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,970
Where have you been?

280
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,910
What do I have to do on Valentine's?

281
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,460
Happy Valentine's.

282
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,080
Thank you P'Phruek.

283
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,580
Err...

284
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,450
Are you done with your thing?

285
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,820
I am.

286
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,200
Then...

287
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,960
Let's just go.

288
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:14,810
Let's go.

289
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,170
I gotta go Pharm, Team.

290
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,270
Let's go Pharm.

291
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,730
I already booked the restaurant.

292
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,890
I'm gonna get going then, Team.

293
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,680
Err...

294
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,400
Good bye, P'Win.

295
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,650
Let me carry that.

296
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,530
What are you looking at?

297
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,090
Stand up.

298
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,230
Let's go.

299
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,890
Where are we going?

300
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,460
Go back to the room.

301
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,130
Where could we possibly go?

302
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,900
Fine. Let's just go back.

303
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,110
Hold this.

304
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,320
Mind your steps.

305
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,420
Careful.

306
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,380
Now open your eyes,

307
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,090
Happy Valentine's.

308
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,530
You don't have to do all this, Prince.

309
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,350
How is it?

310
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,570
Do you like it?

311
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,060
P'Tum.

312
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,070
You give it all in for this love, huh?

313
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,550
P'Tum.

314
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,720
I already warned you.

315
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,210
Why don't you listen to me sometimes?

316
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,180
It's impossible.

317
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,890
You and Prince.

318
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,660
Eventually you guys will have to break up.

319
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,920
P'Tum!

320
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,210
It's fun for now.

321
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,310
But after this...

322
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,050
can you bear with his conditions?

323
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,670
You can't hold hands in public.

324
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,310
Can't eat out together.

325
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,310
No couple pictures.

326
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,530
Prince also have to kiss other actors on screen.

327
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,770
This is the only 10% you might have to face.

328
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,310
What if I told you, I can.

329
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,410
Are you gonna allow us to be together?

330
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,250
For real?

331
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,000
You have no idea

332
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,310
how tired Prince is.

333
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,530
He sometimes falls asleep in the class.

334
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,550
After class,

335
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,910
he has to go work.

336
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,510
Also,

337
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,450
he can't go out and see Christmas lights like other people.

338
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,200
He cannot meet

339
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,250
a lot of people too?

340
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,910
It's his own choice.

341
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,480
He made the decision himself to be here.

342
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,870
I think I said it all.

343
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,050
All the things that you'd have to face.

344
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,570
Actors are also a human P'.

345
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,650
They have their own lives.

346
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,060
They have feelings.

347
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,990
You treat them like a fish in the tank.

348
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:58,830
Prince.

349
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,650
Choose. What're you gonna do?

350
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,550
Why do I have to choose, P'Tum?

351
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,130
Acting is my career.

352
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,070
Bee is the person that I love.

353
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,810
Can't it just happen at the same time?

354
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,220
It can.

355
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,810
If the society can accept that.

356
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,970
You've been in the industry long enough.

357
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,360
You should know.

358
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,670
what's it like

359
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,020
in this industry.

360
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,160
People don't want to see you kiss with everyone in the world.

361
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,330
People only want you to kiss the person they wanna see.

362
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,490
That's all I'm saying.

363
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,240
Do you understand?

364
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,430
But with me,

365
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,730
Prince wouldn't have to choose.

366
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,510
I will be with him

367
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,570
in the way he can also have his career.

368
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,530
Why does it have to be this guy?

369
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,810
Because Bee is...

370
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,680
the person who brought Christmas Tree to my room.

371
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,570
and he can be there seeing Christmas lights with me, P'.

372
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,430
Hia.

373
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,130
Hmm?

374
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,520
What should we watch?

375
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,390
There’re so many movies and TV shows here.

376
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,890
Any categories you wanna watch?

377
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,170
Just watch whatever you want.

378
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,890
I just wanna be by your side. That’s all.

379
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,730
Let’s just watch this then.

380
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,550
Here.

381
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,050
What is it?

382
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,020
Valentine’s day present.

383
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,790
Happy Valentine’s day.

384
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,389
I’m sorry, Hia.

385
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,210
I forgot that it’s Valentine’s today.

386
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,460
It’s not that important actually.

387
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,850
You don’t have to pay much attention to festivals.

388
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,800
See.

389
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,090
You get to watch movies

390
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,430
and have pizza with me.

391
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,090
Don’t you like it?

392
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,260
I do.

393
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,090
That’s good that you like it.

394
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,990
This is it.

395
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,490
Valentine’s for you and me.

396
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,690
If you want me to run around carrying flowers like P’Phruek,

397
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,810
I would be a bit shy doing that.

398
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,380
Or if I take you to a fancy

399
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,330
and pricy restaurant like Dean,

400
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,490
they serve small bites

401
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,570
you wouldn’t be full either.

402
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,930
Hia!

403
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,390
Are you subtly mocking me?

404
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,020
No.

405
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,570
You’re overthinking yourself.

406
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:54,630
Hia.

407
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,380
Hmm?

408
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,200
Have you ever heard of

409
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,280
the tale of Valentine’s day?

410
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,840
What is it?

411
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,080
They said…

412
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,930
if a couple

413
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,530
kisses each other underneath the broccoli doll

414
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,720
on Valentine’s…

415
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,020
they said…

416
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,540
their love will last very long.

417
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,450
Happy Valentine’s day, Hia.

418
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,000
Umm.

419
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,080
Let’s eat the pizza.

420
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,940
You want some?

421
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,710
Looks so good!!

422
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,270
No, it might not be enough for you.

423
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:21,980
Team.

424
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,700
Hmm?

425
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,370
You have the sauce all over your mouth.

426
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,240
Where is it?

427
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,280
On the right.

428
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,660
Up up.

429
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,230
Upper.

430
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,290
Move down a bit.

431
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,720
There’s none of it.

432
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,240
You might get one.

433
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,780
Get what?

434
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,950
I know now

435
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,720
what I want as a Valentine’s present…

436
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,440
What do you want?

437
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,870
You!

438
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,440
Hia.

439
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,590
What are you doing?

440
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,730
I’m just gonna clean your mouth for you.

441
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,310
Remember this.

442
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,530
No matter what festival it is,

443
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,530
just having you with me

444
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,610
is the best present that I could ever ask for.

445
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,340
Understood, stupid kid?

446
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,270
Umm.

447
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,010
Why did you have to knock on my face like that?

448
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,730
Hia.

449
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,920
What?

450
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,620
Don’t you want your present?

451
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,450
What are you talking about?

452
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,010
Valentine’s day present?

453
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,110
You want it or not?

454
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,090
If you don’t take it, I’m not gonna give you anymore.

455
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,410
You have an early class tomorrow.

456
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,010
Don’t complain to me later them.

457
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,740
Go.

458
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,520
Get up.

459
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,820
Take it easy!

460
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,470
Come on.

461
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,230
Hia.

462
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,600
Hia.

463
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,190
Ow.

464
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,930
Stay still!

465
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,540
Just take it slow.

466
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,570
You’re not seeing any girls on Valentine’s?

467
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,770
No. Headache.

468
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,410
You’ve probably got too many girls.

469
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,210
and don’t know who to spend time with. right?

470
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,380
I’m having a headache.

471
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,790
Like pain in my head.

472
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,010
Already took the pill and it doesn’t help.

473
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,650
Oh.

474
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,030
You’re sick?

475
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,030
Why don’t you go lay down?

476
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,730
I’ve been in bed all day.

477
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,110
Cannot sleep now.

478
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,710
And feeling any better?

479
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,860
I don’t know.

480
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,050
But I already took the pill.

481
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,170
If you don’t feel better, you should go see the doctor.

482
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,210
You want me to take you?

483
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,210
Don’t mind other people’s business.

484
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,340
I don't wanna meet you.

485
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,070
P'

486
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,390
To be honest,

487
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,230
you're not gonna

488
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,090
meet up with me at all in this life?

489
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,730
Does it necessary?

490
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,040
Depends.

491
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,240
But if you don't want to, then it's fine.

492
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,440
You go ahead and play.

493
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,050
I'm gonna go get some water.

494
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,840
Sure.

495
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:34,840
Shit!

496
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,040
P'Waan.

497
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,910
P'Waan.

498
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,230
P'Waan.

499
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,970
P'Waan.

500
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,720
P'Waan, can you hear me?

501
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:44,890
P'Waan!

502
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,690
F*ck.

503
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,620
My forehead is bleeding.

504
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,660
Can you hear me, P'?

505
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,720
P'Waan.

506
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,640
Hello?

507
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:18,910
Win!

508
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,030
You brother fell.

509
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,280
Huh?

510
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,520
What did you just say?

511
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,470
Just now, I was talking to him then I heard a sound like someone fall
and he didn't answered me.

512
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,580
You mean Hia Waan?

513
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,080
Wait.

514
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,370
How did you talk to my brother?

515
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,430
Don't ask questions now.

516
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,700
Can you call someone at home to go check on him?

517
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,310
Please.

518
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,850
Yes. Yes.

519
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,130
Dad and mom are waiting out front, Wiew.

520
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,690
Yes.

521
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,280
Please take care of Hia Waan.

522
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,370
He's been working late at night lately.

523
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,530
Rarely get to sleep.

524
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,990
I always see the lights in his room on.

525
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,890
I'm gonna get going then.

526
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,690
Bye guys.

527
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,040
See you, Wiew.

528
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,600
Tul.

529
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,570
Don't ask me anything yet, ok?

530
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,670
No, I can't.

531
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,570
Hia.

532
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,570
Calm down.

533
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,490
The guy you talked about

534
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,890
the one you met in the game.

535
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,270
So it's my brother?

536
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,930
Umm.

537
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,600
I didn't want to lie.

538
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,240
I was just afraid

539
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,170
that if he found out,

540
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,530
he wouldn't trust me the same.

541
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,330
I don't want him to see me...

542
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,690
as his little brother's friend.

543
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,310
I don't wanna be in that kind of situation.

544
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,090
And what do you wanna be for him?

545
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,360
Answer me.

546
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,890
You've been having fun, huh?

547
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,300
P'Waan.

548
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,300
You're awake.

549
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,760
Do I seem like a fool to you?

550
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,130
I trusted you and told you everything.

551
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,050
You act like you don't know anything.

552
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:33,880
Doing poker face.

553
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:35,880
P'Waan...

554
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,490
Hear me out first.

555
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,970
And you were laughing about my stories, weren't you?

556
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,850
Damn it!

557
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,470
I'm such a looser like my dad says.

558
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,720
It's not like that P'.

559
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,100
Get out.

560
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,500
P'Waan.

561
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,380
P'Tul.

562
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,330
I think talking to him right now wouldn't do any good.

563
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,970
I'll come see you again tomorrow.

564
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:10,810
No need.

565
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,250
You should get out of this room.

566
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,360
and also out of my life.

567
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,030
P'...

568
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,130
P'Tul.

569
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:23,530
Let's go.

570
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:48,510
Hia.

571
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,890
I wanna be alone.

572
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,270
Tul has gone home?

573
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:22,350
Umm.

574
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,620
He was crying.

575
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,380
What is all this?

576
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,290
I'm confused.

577
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,650
Just take your time to think.

578
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,410
I'm always here by your side.

579
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,090
Which matter should I be concerned first?

580
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,480
Hia Waan works hard until he's fallen sick.

581
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,330
Or about my bestfriend, liking my brother,

582
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,530
and also been lying to my brother too?

583
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,060
But...

584
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,540
it seems like P'Tul

585
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,510
didn't mean it to turn out this way, Hia.

586
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,780
But Hia Waan hates liars.

587
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,350
And he trusted Tul so much.

588
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,050
He told him everything.

589
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,930
But then got blindsided.

590
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,010
Don't know how he feels right now.

591
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,330
I feel bad for him.

592
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,170
I understand.

593
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,130
But you need to calm down first.

594
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,400
Please step out, Mr.Team.

595
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,530
Why are you looking at that?

596
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,330
I'm not used to this.

597
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,930
Seeing you driving a car.

598
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,700
Not an ordinary car too.

599
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,050
It's a Mercedes.

600
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,440
I have to drive this to pick up Hia Waan.

601
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,370
You want me to take him home with my bike?

602
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,280
One more thing,

603
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,970
this one is the cheapest one of my family's

604
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,630
My boyfriend is so rich.

605
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,530
I can more rich than what you see now.

606
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,480
Pharm will take me home this evening.

607
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,630
You don't have to worry.

608
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,890
Okay.

609
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:08,970
Call me when you're done with your thing.

610
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,000
Okay?

611
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,450
We will have a lot going on today.

612
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,740
A guy like you,

613
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,400
I'm sure you've got this!

614
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,230
Believe me.

615
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,610
You're not afraid of others to see anymore?

616
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,330
I am still.

617
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,240
And why did you kiss me?

618
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,000
I do care what other people think,

619
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,280
but I care you more than them.

620
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:48,890
Got any problems?

621
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,540
No.

622
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,150
But one side is not enough?

623
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,830
Can I get another one?

624
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,580
You're so cheeky.

625
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,570
Happy now?

626
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,490
Okay.

627
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,410
See you tonight.

628
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,410
Pay attention in the class too.

629
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,490
[Groaning]

630
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,370
You can't tell me that while you're skipping your class.

631
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,850
It's not like I wanna skip.

632
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,580
Go to your class already.

633
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,390
Umm.

634
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,390
I gotta go.

635
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,960
See you.

636
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,710
Bye.

637
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,920
How are you, buddy?

638
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,900
Are you feeling better?

639
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,710
I am, mom.

640
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,430
Well...

641
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,490
I'm gonna go upstairs and rest.

642
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,060
Sure.

643
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,220
Go get some rest.

644
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,260
I'm sorry.

645
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,980
I'm sorry I put lots of pressure on you.

646
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:43,780
I'm sorry that I take you guys for granted.

647
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,850
I'm sorry I'm the reason...

648
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,040
why our family is in this situation.

649
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,410
Can you forgive me?

650
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,420
I'm sorry too, dad.

651
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,370
I'm sorry that I've been self-centered.

652
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,730
Never done anything successful.

653
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,420
Always talk badly to you, dad.

654
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,680
Not at all.

655
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,210
You've been doing great with everything.

656
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,230
But it's me...

657
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,170
who is never satisfied enough.

658
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,110
I'm sorry.

659
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,490
Hia come hug with us!

660
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:41,890
Dad...

661
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,260
I have something I wanna ask you.

662
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,130
Ask me.

663
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,160
When you told me to go take care of the hotel in outer cities..

664
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,320
I was just threatening you.

665
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,970
You can just go check on them from time to time.

666
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,290
You have to go there for board meetings anyway.

667
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,030
No.

668
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,330
I'm asking you to be there.

669
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,160
Manow.

670
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,160
Bye bye.

671
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,890
Manow.

672
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,250
How was the show?

673
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,610
Is it over?

674
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,120
It is.

675
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,210
They're taking group pictures in there.

676
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,840
Oh and why don't you go take pics with them?

677
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,420
They only do it among main casts.

678
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,410
I would be in their ways in there.

679
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:01,820
Oh..

680
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,730
Err...

681
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,060
I'm hungry.

682
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,160
Wanna have some chicken feet.

683
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,590
Manow.

684
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,060
I'm super hungry, P'Phruek. Like my stomach is almost torn apart.

685
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,220
Let's go eat. Please. Please.

686
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,430
Manow.

687
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,410
Why are you repeatedly calling my name?

688
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,650
Why do you to act strong at all time?

689
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,120
People

690
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,430
cannot just smile and laugh at all time.

691
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,260
If you feel sad,

692
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,660
you have to let it out and cry.

693
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,820
So you'd feel better.

694
00:57:58,510 --> 00:57:59,800
But...

695
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:02,720
I don't wanna cry.

696
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,940
I don't wanna people to see me cry.

697
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:09,850
Why?

698
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,240
I want people around me

699
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:16,880
to be happy.

700
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:19,150
I--

701
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,750
I wanna make people laugh.

702
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,800
Even yourself is not happy at all?

703
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,570
P'Phruek.

704
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,550
Let's do this.

705
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:53,720
You can be...

706
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,140
anyone else's happiness.

707
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,230
But I will be...

708
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,960
happiness for you myself.

709
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,300
Can I?

710
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,390
P'Phruek.

711
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:18,680
I wanna comfort you

712
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,140
when you cry.

713
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,450
I wanna be happy

714
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,270
when you laugh.

715
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:40,660
And I also...

716
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,230
want to have chicken feet with you everyday.

717
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,510
Yes, I will.

718
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,660
I haven't asked you anything?

719
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,170
Are skipping the script?

720
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,630
Ok start over.

721
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,410
Will you be my girlfriend?

722
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,820
I'll marry you.

723
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,160
I love you, Manow.

724
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:35,650
I...

725
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,740
love you too, P'Phruek.

726
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,920
I have a boyfriend. Finally!!

727
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,420
I already have a boyfriend!

728
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,120
Spin again P'Phruek. Spin again.

729
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,870
My arms are tired.

730
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,020
Why aren't you up in the room?

731
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,530
Pharm just dropped me off.

732
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:24,770
You were almost arrived,

733
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:26,270
so I waited to go up with you.

734
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,260
You might...

735
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,770
got bitten by mosquitos.

736
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,420
There's none.

737
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,330
And what about you? How was it?

738
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,540
It's good.

739
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,130
All opened up and talked things through.

740
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,810
P'Waan and your dad are in good terms now?

741
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,740
Umm.

742
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,560
They were hugging.

743
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,280
That's nice.

744
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,050
To be honest,

745
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:54,760
those two didn't have anything against each other.

746
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,530
Just two person who are so similar in every ways.

747
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:58,690
How?

748
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:08,930
Dad and Hia Waan...

749
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,570
are very serious when it comes to their work.

750
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,030
So when the two works together,

751
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:15,990
it'd turn out this way.

752
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,080
Still confused.

753
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:22,490
Yeah just like that.

754
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,450
Let's just say they are good now.

755
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,550
Wiew was so happy, smiling so big.

756
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,310
And...

757
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,570
we're going to the beach at the end of this month.

758
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,340
Umm.

759
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,200
My mom asks you to join.

760
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,170
Asking...

761
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,160
me?

762
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:43,420
Umm.

763
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,880
We'll send Hia Waan off too.

764
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,480
Why?

765
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,060
He wants to work at the branch in outer cities.

766
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,390
What?

767
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,630
I thought you said they're good.

768
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,790
They are.

769
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,550
He just wanna go heal his mind there.

770
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,340
As you know.

771
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,260
About P'Tul?

772
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:16,560
Umm.

773
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,690
But that's good that he's going there.

774
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,000
Living by the beach,

775
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:23,590
let the nature heals.

776
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,260
What about you, Hia?

777
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,170
Don't you want nature to heal you too?

778
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,050
No need.

779
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,690
I've got you to heal me already.

780
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,360
Hia.

781
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,320
We're underneath the dorm.

782
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,470
People might have seen that!

783
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,200
Let's go.

784
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,820
Let's go heal.

785
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,490
Don't rush.

786
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:01,360
Come on.

787
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,660
I already prepared to give you this.

788
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,660
I’ll really give it to you this time.

789
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,020
Team.

790
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,240
If you get to talk to him again,

791
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,440
are you gonna talk?

792
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,500
P’Waan.

793
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,500
I’m here to beg for your forgiveness.

794
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:54,010
Why do we have to hide? We are a couple now.

795
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,220
Guys…I have something to tell you.
