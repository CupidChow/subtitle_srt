1
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,460
I love you.

2
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,080
Did you hear me? I said I love you.

3
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,960
You fool.

4
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,280
You give it all in for this love, huh?

5
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,360
Acting is my career.

6
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,460
Bee is the person that I love.

7
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Can't it just happen at the same time?

8
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,890
You can be...

9
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,300
anyone else's happiness.

10
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,320
But I will be...

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,530
happiness for you myself.

12
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,610
Can I?

13
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,280
You've been having fun, huh?

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,380
Do I seem like a fool to you?

15
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,860
It's not like that P'.

16
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,370
Get out.

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,040
I already prepared to give you this,

18
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,800
but I didn't get a chance to do it.

19
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,760
I'll really give it to you this time.

20
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,400
Are you ready?

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,770
I am ready, Hia.

22
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,880
Whose vehicle should we take?

23
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,880
Mine.

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,110
No Hia.

25
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,340
Riding your bike to Chonburi?

26
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,940
My butt would be numb.

27
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,680
I didn't complain a thing when I rode it to see you last time.

28
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,950
Hia...

29
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,570
Just take my car.

30
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,190
Full tank.

31
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,800
Plus, I will feed you snacks along the way too.

32
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,700
I was just kidding.

33
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,460
Here.

34
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,530
I'm taking my car.

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,770
Woww.

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,210
And it's a Mercedes too.

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,030
I also have a Porsche.

38
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,040
If you wanna take that one,

39
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,000
I will go back and switch the car for you.

40
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,540
That's okay, Hia.

41
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,640
Mecedes Benz is more than enough.

42
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm afraid that I might not know

43
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,840
how to open Porsche's door.

44
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,850
Mmmm.

45
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,380
You don't have to be afraid of anything when you're with me.

46
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,820
I only talked about car's door.

47
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,080
You don't have to be romantic just because of that.

48
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,060
But I love youuu~

49
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,630
Hia!

50
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,920
Why?

51
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,560
Cause I love you.

52
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,850
I know that you love me.

53
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,880
Why do you keep saying that?

54
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,399
If you don't want me to say...

55
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,750
Then...

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,810
Hmm.

57
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,240
What are you doing?

58
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,550
I'll bring this doll with me.

59
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,530
To protect myself from you.

60
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,600
Let's go.

61
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,070
Go.

62
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,450
Let's go.

63
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,490
Let's hit the road.

64
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,280
How is it dating an actor? Fun?

65
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,120
Oww. My back hurts.

66
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,760
You're probably tired.

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,690
I'll prepare a hot bath for you today.

68
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,500
Thank you.

69
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,300
Hey!

70
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,720
I'm still standing here.

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,220
Ohhh.

72
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,150
You should close your eyes, P'Tum.
I'm about to kiss him.

73
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,950
You're so annoying!

74
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,430
Guess I'm leaving!

75
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,900
So sick of love birds.

76
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,730
Driver will come pick you up same time in the morning

77
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,520
Sure.

78
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,230
The coast is clear.

79
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,450
Shall we?

80
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,130
What? No!

81
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,370
Let's put this upstairs.

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,030
So you can go bath.

83
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,270
Let me kiss first.

84
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,180
I missed that!

85
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,060
Go!

86
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,830
Come on!

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,830
So you can go take a warm bath upstairs.

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,730
Are you sure you can?

89
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,340
I'm sure.

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,290
Heavy huh.

91
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,290
It's okay. I'll carry it myself.

92
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,370
That's fine, Team.

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,660
It's his job. Let him do it.

94
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,290
Thank  you.

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,450
Hia Win.

96
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,080
Can I sleep with you tonight?

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,150
No, you cannot!

98
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,390
What!?

99
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,409
Why?

100
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,920
And where is Team going to sleep?

101
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,500
With us. The three of us.

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,280
We can just take the big room. There're 3 beds.

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,890
Please please please.

104
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,050
Sure / No!

105
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,930
He is his boyfriend. They have to sleep together.

106
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,810
Just leave them alone. มันขวาง***

107
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,930
Hia!

108
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,390
You told everyone!?

109
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,630
Why do I have to keep it a secret?

110
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,970
You are my boyfriend.

111
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,890
Hia!

112
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,920
There're lots of people here.

113
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,820
I'm so sick of these two.

114
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,010
Hia.

115
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,350
Here here here.

116
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,590
Let's go.

117
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,480
You're sick of them? Let me kiss you then.

118
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,200
Why are you bringing the medal?

119
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,170
Do you remember...

120
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,880
that I have something I wanna tell you?

121
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,679
I'm ready to talk about it now.

122
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,370
This is for you P'.

123
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,780
When we were young,

124
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,960
I promised you...

125
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,720
that when we grow up

126
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,940
we both will become athletes.

127
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,920
The silver medal is for me.

128
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,760
And the gold medal belongs to you.

129
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,880
Hia.

130
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,310
This is P'Ton.

131
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,980
He's my cousin.

132
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,140
P'Ton! Let's swim.

133
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,200
Is this a good idea? The pool is about to close.

134
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,860
That's even better, so no one will be here.

135
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,050
If my mom found out, she'll punish me.

136
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,080
Let's swim and compete with me.

137
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,960
Please P'Ton.

138
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,280
Fine.

139
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,320
But we have to do a warm up first.

140
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,670
P'Ton...

141
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,550
we've taken classes already. What are you afraid of?

142
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,130
Please P'Ton.

143
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,400
Um.

144
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,640
Yayy.

145
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,240
Team.

146
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,410
Just one hour, okay?

147
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,840
Okay.

148
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,600
1 2 3 go!

149
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,000
I am ahead of you...keep up!

150
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,410
I will do my cheating move.

151
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,920
I have to win.

152
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,310
Help!

153
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah I won!

154
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,670
Help!

155
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,230
Hey Team!

156
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,840
I was stubborn.

157
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,190
I wanted to swim

158
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,310
even he tried to stop me.

159
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,850
But I didn't listen.

160
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,570
And I drowned.

161
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,820
But why was he the one who died?

162
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,360
And not me?

163
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,690
You can't think like that, Team.

164
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,090
Don't think that way.

165
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,090
I'm so damn guilty, Hia.

166
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,880
We promised each other

167
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,360
that we'll become swimming athletes when we grow up.

168
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,050
And why there's only me left?

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,810
Everytime before any competition...

170
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,850
I would always dream about that incident.

171
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,000
I always see him drowning to the bottom of the pool.

172
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,080
I always see people gather around trying to save him.

173
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,950
I see him lying there not breathing.

174
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,830
Calm down, Team.

175
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,880
It's been a long time a ago.

176
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,730
Not at all, Hia.

177
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,000
Everything...

178
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,480
feels like it happened yesterday.

179
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,690
All the memories are still in my head.

180
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,740
I can still see aunty Ta...

181
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,090
P'Ton's mother

182
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,200
bringing the food to his grave and talk to him like he's still there.

183
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,570
She's still in grief.

184
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,510
She still cries.

185
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,870
She's still in that conditions.

186
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,750
Everything is like this because of me.

187
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,430
Team.

188
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,200
Before you ask anyone to forgive you...

189
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,280
you need to forgive yourself first.

190
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,280
Do you understand?

191
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,980
Why am I not the one who died?

192
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,830
If I died...

193
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,840
everything would have been better.

194
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,630
No, it would not.

195
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,550
You can't die. Do you hear me?

196
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,430
Team...

197
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,620
Why do you still think that way?

198
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,770
I'm not angry or hate you at all, son.

199
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,790
Aunty Ta.

200
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,910
But I am the reason why he's dead.

201
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,430
You said I killed him.

202
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,820
Oh boy...

203
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,300
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,720
I said that...

205
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,270
becasue I was miserable.

206
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,600
I said things without actually thinking it through.

207
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,250
Why did you kill him? Why did kill Ton?

208
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,720
Ton.

209
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,500
Ton.

210
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,070
I didn't know...

211
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,330
that..

212
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,050
it's still haunting you.

213
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,280
Aunt Ta.

214
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,800
Aunt Ta.

215
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,630
I'm sorry, aunt Ta.

216
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,890
I'm sorry I'm the cause of all these.

217
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,160
Can you please tell me?

218
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,770
What can I do to repay for what I did?

219
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,540
Nothing.

220
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,790
You've...

221
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,589
repaid more than enough.

222
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,040
But I--

223
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,500
From now on,

224
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,190
you need to become a great athlete

225
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,770
and be happy.

226
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,819
for him please.

227
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:25,940
Aunt Ta.

228
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,600
I love you, Team.

229
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,100
I love you like I love P'Ton.

230
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,740
Thank you.

231
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,200
Get some rest.

232
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,520
We'll have dinner downstairs in the evening.

233
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,720
I have my staffs prepare lots of seafood for you.

234
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,280
Thank you, Hia.

235
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,720
Do you realize?

236
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,810
That you've thanked me a lot,

237
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,870
since I've known you.

238
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,350
But I really do want to thank you.

239
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,700
Go get some rest.

240
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,200
I'll bring a cold cloth to compress your eyes.

241
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,550
So it won't get puffy.

242
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,720
Sure.

243
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,020
***

244
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,330
Go to sleep.

245
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,750
Yes.

246
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,380
You have very little happiness...

247
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,960
but still pushed him away from your life.

248
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,590
Win!

249
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,480
F*ck you.

250
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,990
You love him,

251
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,120
but you keep your lip tight.

252
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,240
You know me.

253
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,960
What I hate the most

254
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,170
is liars.

255
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,250
But he didn't mean to lie to you.

256
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,880
Are you actually on your friend's side rather than mine?

257
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,470
I'm not.

258
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,910
I'm just speaking the truth.

259
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,950
He told me everything.

260
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,610
He didn't know

261
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,960
who you are

262
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,980
at first, did he?

263
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,980
But when he found out,

264
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,410
he chose not to tell me.

265
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,640
He treats me like a fool.

266
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,920
Doing poker face when we meet.

267
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,850
He's really good at lying.

268
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,640
You said it yourself

269
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,840
that you don't wanna meet up with him.

270
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,490
I said that

271
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,890
because I didn't know

272
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,400
that he's your friend.

273
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,250
The reason he lied...

274
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,370
is because he didn't wanna lose you.

275
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,260
Think about it.

276
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,200
If you knew who he is,

277
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,360
were you gonna be able to see him more than your brother's friend?

278
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,330
How is it different with right now?

279
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,800
Even now

280
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,440
I feel for him more than I should have

281
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,150
but at the end

282
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,720
we can't be together anyway.

283
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,330
So you're accepting that

284
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,320
your feeling for him is more than a friend.

285
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,020
I don't know!

286
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,640
I'm just comfortable to talk to him

287
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,260
And...

288
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,560
would you talk to him again if you got a chance?

289
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,440
Even if I want to, but I already pushed him away, didn't I?

290
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,510
If I go back to him now, I would lose my cool.

291
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,640
One more thing,

292
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,400
I don't even know who he really is.

293
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,650
If you don't know,

294
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,490
then you need to get to know him.

295
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,190
Let's do this.

296
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,490
If he came to talk to you,

297
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,460
would you talk to him nicely?

298
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,880
I don't know.

299
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,880
What the hell, bro?

300
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,270
He has to try first, right?

301
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,600
Hey!

302
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,510
P'Waan.

303
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,730
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness!

304
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,410
P'Waan!

305
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,550
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,450
Please stay calm.

307
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,510
Why are you arresting me? I came to apologize the hotel owner?

308
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,330
Please come this way.

309
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,800
P'Waan. Help me!

310
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
P'Waan.

311
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,530
You betrayer!

312
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,840
After I'm done with this, you'll be doomed.

313
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,130
How are you going to do it?

314
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,040
I'll come back and deal with you later.

315
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,840
Wow.

316
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,450
Is this really your hotel?

317
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,420
You know all of it.

318
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,490
About my life.

319
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,610
Why do you ask?

320
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,040
P'Waan...

321
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,430
I did not dare to tell you

322
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,970
who I am.

323
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,780
I was afraid that if you knew the truth,

324
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,200
you wouldn't talk to me the same way.

325
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,880
How long were you thinking to fool me?

326
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,890
If I did not fall,

327
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,040
were you gonna lie to me until I die?

328
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,160
Maybe.

329
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,260
Tul!

330
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,930
I was trying to find the time to tell you.

331
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,920
But you found out already.

332
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,800
Then...

333
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,170
Let's not talk about the past.

334
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,700
You're here but...

335
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,350
not gonna talk about the past,

336
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,480
then why are you here?

337
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,720
I'm here to talk about the future.

338
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,700
The future of you and me.

339
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,680
What are you talking about?

340
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,030
What are you doing?

341
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,900
Kissing you.

342
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,510
You're crossing the line.

343
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,160
P'Waan.

344
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,450
Can you be my future?

345
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,250
I wanna have you in my future.

346
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,170
But I have to move and work here.

347
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,140
You study in Bangkok.

348
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,540
Two different cities.

349
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,910
Bangkok and Chonburi.

350
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,710
It's not that far.

351
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,880
I can drive to see you.

352
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,440
I can drive to see you morning and night everyday.

353
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,420
I'm almost 4 years older than you.

354
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,080
That's fine.

355
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,080
I like old people.

356
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,000
P'Waan!

357
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,560
Can we just don't talk about things that haven't happened yet?

358
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,240
I really wanna be your safe zone.

359
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,410
I want you to be comfortable to say...

360
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,450
...comfortable to talk to me.

361
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,720
Just like when you trusted T-Rex.

362
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,130
I can try.

363
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,380
Try what?

364
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,010
I can try dating you.

365
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,390
I'm also old already.

366
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,840
Don't wanna be picky. It's a waste of time.

367
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,640
Tul.

368
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,970
I've always wanted to do this.

369
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,160
Too much.

370
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,520
Eat up, so you can grow more.

371
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,070
Hia.

372
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,250
I'm a grown up already.

373
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,150
It is already perfect then.

374
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,780
Easy to carry.

375
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,050
Hia.

376
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,230
Carry?

377
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,880
Where are you going to carry him?

378
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,640
Can't P'Team just walk by himself?

379
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,550
Hia.

380
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,470
Stop talking and eat.

381
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,150
Poor boy.

382
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,470
Why don't you pass some food for Tul, Hia?

383
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,020
Your hand.

384
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,530
I can get it myself.

385
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,400
Hia.

386
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,200
You scared me.

387
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,460
I came to ask you to go eat.

388
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,240
If you're hungry, you can eat first.

389
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,800
Let me breath fresh air in for

390
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,210
a few more seconds.

391
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,770
I can't eat without you.

392
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,170
Blahh.

393
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,420
You brought this for me?

394
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,890
You forgot our little tradition already?

395
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,800
What do you have to do before you drink?

396
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,300
Since when did it become our tradition?

397
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,520
I just made it our thing.

398
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,060
Kiss me. Come on.

399
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,640
I'm already bored of your cheek.

400
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,480
Team.

401
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,830
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.

402
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,510
Why?

403
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,570
Don't you like it, hmm?

404
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,400
Not that I don't like it.

405
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,470
But if you do that,

406
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,980
you might not get to eat.

407
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,460
What are you trying to say?

408
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,980
Let's go eat.

409
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,010
Hia.

410
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:44,700
Let's go.

411
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,820
Come on!

412
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,050
Wait up.

413
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,400
I'm hungry already.

414
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,240
You know what...

415
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,690
today is the day that I have the clearest mind.

416
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,550
It's like...

417
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,450
someone took the rocks out of my head.

418
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,110
That good?

419
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:43,990
Yeah.

420
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,990
That good.

421
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,480
When things first happened,

422
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,090
I had insomnia.

423
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,430
I had to take medicines.

424
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,080
It was torturing, Hia.

425
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,470
No matter how tired you are,

426
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,090
you cannot sleep.

427
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,040
Cause you're afraid to have nightmares.

428
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,340
But now...

429
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,960
you can sleep, right?

430
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,690
I have to try, Hia.

431
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,900
Since I've been sharing my bed with you,

432
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,730
it keeps getting better everyday.

433
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,790
Is there any reasons behind?

434
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,760
I don't know either.

435
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,610
When I'm with you,

436
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,850
I feel safe.

437
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,730
I'm super comfortable

438
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,510
being with you.

439
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,920
Me too.

440
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,690
When I'm with you,

441
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,180
I never wanted go anywhere.

442
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,500
I can't believe it.

443
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,840
We started off from a random situationship.

444
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,390
I don't care.

445
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,700
I just know...

446
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,620
that I love you so damn much.

447
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,409
This is so good, Pharm!

448
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,670
Pharm.

449
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,469
You want some?

450
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,460
Hmm..

451
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,900
I have chicken breast salad.

452
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,530
Pharm's cooking

453
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,800
is always yummy!

454
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,960
Really?

455
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,840
Aren't you only like P'Win's cooking?

456
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,350
Manow.

457
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,060
Yeah.

458
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,110
I have a swim meet to record my stat today.

459
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,480
Do you wanna go watch me?

460
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,190
But...

461
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,280
even if I didn't invite you guys,

462
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,190
you two would probably go anyway.

463
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,120
Right?

464
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
Was there any time that we didn't go see you?

465
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,070
Yeah.

466
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,640
There're other people in the club too. Not just me.

467
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,390
There's also P'Dean.

468
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,060
P'Phruek.

469
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,860
Don't you dare be mad, Team.

470
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,560
Lately, you've been with P'Win all the time also.

471
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,580
Me? Being with him all the time?

472
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,550
It's him who is attached to me.

473
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,900
Can't help it.

474
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,080
Since I'm too hot.

475
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,850
Handsome? Got it?

476
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,070
I don't wanna waste Pharm's sandwich.

477
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,720
If I was not, I would throw up.

478
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,140
Stop talking and just eat, Manow.

479
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,970
Thank you Pharm.

480
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,470
Eat up.

481
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,640
I wanna have that too.

482
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,770
Manow.

483
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,990
There're lots of people here.

484
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,650
Yeah so many people.

485
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,300
Where should we sit, Pharm?

486
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,560
Over there?

487
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,200
I'll lead you there.

488
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,390
Team!

489
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,460
Team!

490
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,850
Go Team!

491
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,430
You can do it Team!

492
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,050
Take your mark.

493
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,970
Team!

494
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,720
Team!

495
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,130
Go Team!

496
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,460
Come on, Team!

497
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,790
Go Team!

498
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,770
Team.

499
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,750
Swim swim.

500
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,420
Swim.

501
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,780
Swim swim swim.

502
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,340
He's ahead now.

503
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,700
Team!

504
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,440
Go Team! / Come on swim!

505
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,790
Team!

506
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,950
Well done, Team!

507
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,920
You're so good.

508
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,790
Wait a bit more, Bee.

509
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,400
Soon, our relstionship won't have to be a secret anymore.

510
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,900
Let's just wait until everything is settled.

511
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,980
And I'll stop working in this industry.

512
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,360
You don't have to do that, Prince.

513
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,220
Working as an actor,

514
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,970
is something thast you love, right?

515
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,710
And why...

516
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,200
do we have to give up on your career?

517
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,490
I don't want you to wait anymore.

518
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,360
But...

519
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,340
leaving the industry

520
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,280
is not a way out.

521
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,690
But...

522
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,740
both of us...

523
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,310
and many other people

524
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,910
have to wait...

525
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,720
until society changes.

526
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,190
When that day comes,

527
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,180
it's gonna be the day

528
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,300
that the problem will be truly solved.

529
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,150
Do you understand?

530
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,410
Thank you.

531
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,900
Then...

532
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,320
can we do it one more round?

533
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,920
P'Phruek.

534
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,610
Hmm?

535
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,130
Read this for me.

536
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,520
Read this for me.

537
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Is it real? Am I reading correctly?

538
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,240
"Passed the casting"

539
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,540
Huh?

540
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,030
Are you really getting the role?

541
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,140
The name...the name is correct right?

542
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,010
Yes, it is.

543
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,200
I am really getting to play a real role!

544
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,330
I am you first official fan.

545
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,990
You can't forget that!

546
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,730
I won't.

547
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,340
You're both my fanclub...

548
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,220
and also...

549
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,010
my boyfriend too.

550
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,240
You're crazy!

551
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,170
Yayy.

552
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,810
Very well!

553
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,370
Nice!

554
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,690
My boyfriend.

555
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,420
Thank you for dropping me off.

556
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,270
Sure.

557
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,260
See you after class.

558
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,400
Yes.

559
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,850
Hia.

560
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,600
You sneaked here alone again.

561
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,910
I did not.

562
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,990
I just...

563
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,320
came to think about stuff.

564
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,340
What are you thinking?

565
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,980
Tell me.

566
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,140
Well...

567
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,610
I'm thinking about the future.

568
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,990
Thinking about tomorrow

569
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,910
and the next days.

570
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,850
Wonder how is it gonna turn out?

571
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,590
And what does it look like...

572
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,610
the future that you have in mind?

573
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,400
I don't know either, Hia.

574
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,670
But...

575
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,340
no matter what it is...

576
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,670
you'll always be there.

577
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,510
Then our thoughts are the same.

578
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,160
Ready?

579
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,030
Ready for what?

580
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,470
Hia.

581
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,710
Hia.

582
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,210
What are you doing?

583
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,140
Hey!

584
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,610
I can walk by myself.

585
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,720
I really like the beach.

586
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,120
I love listening to the waves.

587
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,550
I love soft sand.

588
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,050
I love it too.

589
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,940
You mean the beach?

590
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,370
I love the person who loves the beach.

591
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh.

592
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,320
After...

593
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,310
you graduate,

594
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,410
we might have different schechdules.

595
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,040
I would have to work.

596
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,000
You'd also have to do your thing.

597
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,360
When that time comes...

598
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,090
I'm afraid that... / It's fine.

599
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,050
I totally understand you and everything.

600
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,320
Then...

601
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,990
this coming up break,

602
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,220
let's go see your mom

603
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,740
in America together.

604
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,420
P'Dean.

605
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,590
We'll get married there.

606
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,960
Like I promise you.

607
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,360
P'Dean.

608
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,430
Please Pharm.

609
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,160
I know

610
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,450
that

611
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,450
we will never stop loving each other.

612
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,650
But I wanna have a solid thing

613
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,450
to show you

614
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,240
that I will love

615
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,050
and take care of you for the rest of my life.

616
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,430
I love you P'Dean.

617
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:37,540
You love me as much as I love you?

618
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,020
Maybe even more.

619
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,790
Really?

620
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,450
You have to prove it.

621
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,330
P'Dean.

622
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,870
Let's see...

623
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,840
Try kissing me please.

624
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,060
P'Dean!

625
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm gonna go.

626
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,930
I'm gonna go see Team.

627
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:16,730
You're not gonna fight me back?

628
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,160
I will catch you later!

629
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,960
Pharm.

630
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:27,970
Hia.

631
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,800
Let me go!

632
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,530
No.

633
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,040
What are you doin'? Let me down.

634
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,810
Hia.

635
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,670
What?

636
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:46,790
Thank you...

637
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,180
for trusting me to take care of you from now on.

638
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,690
I'll be here for you to take care forever.

639
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,710
I love you, Hia.

640
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:05,020
I love you too.

641
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:11,290
But...

642
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,720
I have something I wanna ask you.

643
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,060
What?

644
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,260
Let's compete swimming with me.

645
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,600
Woww.

646
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,260
What Pharm?

647
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,840
You're blushing.

648
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,890
How's it going, Mr.Vice?

649
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:36,720
Not blushing.

650
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,760
What's up with you?

651
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,210
Always mocking me.

652
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,280
Team: You're also blushing.

653
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,430
Look at your boy.

654
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,710
The pic you took was bad.

655
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,820
You better stay fit.

656
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,830
I took a lot already.

657
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:45,300
Swim!

658
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,190
Look at that!

659
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,880
There's only you.

660
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:49,640
Oh.

661
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,790
Stop arguing.

662
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,150
I look shitty / Stop arguing.

663
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,100
Where's Bee?

664
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:54,910
Oh.

665
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,670
Oh hey! / You guys!

666
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,290
Wow.

667
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,500
What was that? What was that?

668
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,980
As you can see.

669
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,250
Temple dog is leveled up.

670
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,730
Temple doggo.

671
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,020
Not me. You are!

672
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,450
Don't be a bully!

673
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,980
But you were slow too.

674
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,070
- Not true.
- You were slow.

675
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,020
Not true.

676
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,380
What's up P'Phruek?

677
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,300
Manow.

678
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,030
This is my girlfriend, you guys.

679
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,550
Hia Win.

680
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,280
What about me?

681
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,320
Guys.

682
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,760
So...

683
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,940
I have something to tell you.

684
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,190
Hey! Don't tell me that you guys are getting married?

685
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,890
No no.

686
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:56,530
Well...

687
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,270
I challenge Hia Win to compete with me.

688
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,570
That's no fun.

689
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,140
Are you sure you'd win?

690
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,950
Why wouldn't I?

691
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,850
- What's up with you?
- I don't know.

692
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:14,840
We'll see.

693
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,170
