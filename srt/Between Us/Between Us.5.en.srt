1
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,940
Right now,

2
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,460
You're very fond of Team
more than anyone.

3
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,950
If you're not gonna be serious with him,

4
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,950
don't make him fall for you even more.

5
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,650
I don't know how I really feel at the moment.

6
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,650
I'm not fond of him

7
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,650
just because we slept together before.

8
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,350
But I do feel good about him.

9
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,440
P' Win.

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,380
Hey no way! I don't like Hia Win.

11
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,210
The feeling that you're having.

12
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,210
It's called love.

13
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,800
Do I really have a friend with me here?

14
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,320
Hello!?

15
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,800
I would love to talk to you.

16
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,800
You do eat snacks nowadays?

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,680
Yeah it's good, once in awhile.

18
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,040
You probably got it from Team.

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,880
Pharm said that
he has snacks everyday.

20
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,180
What is this?

21
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,180
Husband club?

22
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,860
Are you guys consulting
household matter?

23
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,840
F*ck you, Tul.

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,540
If you don't have anything to say,
you can shut up.

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,140
So how's it goin, Dean?

26
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,440
You guys seem so close lately.

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,200
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,780
Pharm.

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,380
I often see you guys posting
pictures together.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,540
Where was the last one taken?

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,180
At the aquarium.

32
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,380
At night under the sea ~

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,180
Nosy!

34
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,080
Ouchh.

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
I changed my mind.

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,020
I was gonna do the presentation
by myself at first,

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,500
but since it's a group project,

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,320
then...

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
all of us, let's do one each.

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Ughh what?

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
I already did the content.
Why do I have to present?

42
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,100
I shouldn't have done that.

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,100
Oh yeah and next week
we have to prepare for the open house.

44
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,079
I'll go buy some stuff with Team this Saturday

45
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,579
And come work at the club.

46
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,720
Can you coordinate with the uni for us?

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,140
Sure.
If you need anything else, just let me know.

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,720
What if we need the food made by Pharm,

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,840
can you make that happen for us?

50
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,580
Win. F*ck you.

51
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,360
Another nosy one.

52
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,300
What are you listening to?

53
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,360
Music.

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,260
That's weird.
You never really listened to any music.

55
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,480
Have you ever...

56
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,200
wanted know about the things that

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,400
the person you're interested like?

58
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,540
Wanna know their thoughts
from the song they listen to?

59
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,220
Manow!
You scared me.

60
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,480
Let me listen too.

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,880
Hey! The same song again?
Don't you wanna listen to some other songs?

62
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Never heard of it?

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,640
When you're into a certain song for awhile,

64
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,540
if you go back and listen to it again...

65
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,840
it'll become a story that
tells you what happened during that time.

66
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,100
See what I said was super cool, wasn't it?

67
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,159
No. It was confusing.

68
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,260
What!?

69
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
Did you know...

70
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,780
I put this song on repeat in the car.
Now, Hia Win can't get it out of his head.

71
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,260
Wow...you've been mentioning him a lot lately.

72
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,580
Why?
Are you jealous of me?

73
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Totally not.

74
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,880
So this song has to be a love song

75
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,760
that's still unsure
whether it's really a love or not?

76
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,940
That means...

77
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,940
you're still indecisive?

78
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,600
Hmm? Indecisive?

79
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,080
No, I'm not.

80
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
It's just a good song.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
Who is it that makes Team indecisive?

82
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,420
Or is it because...

83
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,700
the person who picked you up yesterday?

84
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,060
Stop talking. Stop it.

85
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,820
Team.

86
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,500
You think I'm gonna miss out
on this kinda stuff?

87
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,540
You too Manow.

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,480
I heard that you know a lot about swimming club.

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,680
Are you close to anyone in particular?

90
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,860
Hey the professor is here.

91
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,740
Let's just focus on the class.

92
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,260
Let me borrow your handout.

93
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,940
Which page?

94
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,480
Is he here?

95
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,140
Ow my neck is all strained.

96
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,720
Just stay still.
Stop pushing each other.

97
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,560
Why did you have to push me?

98
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,640
I'll just go sit somewhere else.

99
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Yeah why did you have to push.

100
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,860
Who push?
Nobody pushed or anything?

101
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,680
Where's Team?

102
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,840
Do we really have to wait for him here?

103
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,720
Yeah he called just now.

104
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,420
He said he'll go pick up P'Win first,
and come to us later.

105
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,280
And what do we have to buy again?

106
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,000
The wood, some paints, and what else?

107
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,320
Canvas sheet.

108
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Yeah canvas sheet.

109
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,640
A bunch of big stuff.

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,880
Can Team's car fit it all in?

111
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
Or...

112
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,940
should I volunteer not to go?

113
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Mmmm.

114
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,140
Such a good idea, dude.

115
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,760
You have to go.
All the big stuff, they can deliver for us.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,060
You're always like this.

117
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,220
Lazy as a pig.

118
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,080
I was gonna go take a nap.

119
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,820
If I don't get to nap,
then you also don't.

120
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,220
Hey that's Prince!

121
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,480
Prince!

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,700
Oh!

123
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,620
Why aren't you in class?
Why are you guys here?

124
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,900
The professor just let us go.

125
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,140
We thought you are not coming.

126
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,880
So we didn't call you.

127
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,800
I thought I'd be here in time for the latter half.
Turned out I came here for nothing.

128
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,760
Did you just come from work?
You look tired.

129
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,720
Yeah I was on the set all night.

130
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,540
I went back to shower
and came straight here.

131
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540
I have another event this evening.

132
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,380
Huh? More?

133
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,320
Can we take some pictures with you?

134
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,840
Sure.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,300
Thank you so much.

136
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,980
Sure.

137
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,280
Prince.

138
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
Do you wanna go back and rest then?

139
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,340
If you stay,
you wouldn't be able to rest for sure.

140
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,640
Yeah.

141
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,840
What is it with him?

142
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Do you know how to ride
as a passenger?

143
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,580
Kind of.

144
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,700
You guys.

145
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
I don't think
I can go help anymore.

146
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,100
What?
Where are you going Bee?

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,700
- Who's gonna help us carry!?
- What!?

148
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
What is wrong with him?

149
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,100
Yeah.

150
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,640
Bee...

151
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
Left us without even saying good bye.

152
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,620
You need to be the one who carries then.

153
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,460
It's you.
You're his substitute.

154
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,400
Who said so?

155
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,700
It has to be you.
Not me.

156
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,480
You better come help me.

157
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,460
What?

158
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,920
Please wait here, Prince.

159
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,800
Hand on to me.
I'll go full speed.

160
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,420
Okay.

161
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,360
Hang on tight.

162
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,260
This looks good.

163
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,740
Should we?

164
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,680
Let's split up, so it'll be quicker.

165
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,880
Buy lots of packed water too.

166
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,920
We'll give those to the visitors.

167
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,100
Sure.

168
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,940
You want the small or big bottle?

169
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,860
Small one is fine.

170
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,540
Err...what if they ran out of the small one?

171
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,480
Then just buy the big one.

172
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
What if the big one is also ran out?

173
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,000
Then just buy whatever.

174
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,100
Oh!

175
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,170
What are you doing?

176
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,250
What?

177
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,770
Buy some for everyone in the club.

178
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,870
We're here to buy for the kids,
not for your own.

179
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,650
The army needs to be fed.

180
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,030
If they're hungry,
the work is not gonna come out well.

181
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,970
Can I just buy 2 then?

182
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,710
Let's go to other aisles.

183
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,530
Can this fit?

184
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,430
Yeah.

185
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,810
And are you guys gonna
drop this off at the club?

186
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,250
Or we'll do it tomorrow?

187
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,730
No, I don't wanna do it today.

188
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,730
Let's just do it tomorrow.

189
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,310
Oh if we don't have to drop this off,

190
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,310
we'll split up from you guys then.

191
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,490
Don't you wanna go back together?

192
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,710
I'll drop you guys off.

193
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,830
We'll go watch a movie.

194
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,450
Do you wanna join?

195
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,450
What movie?

196
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,770
There's a horror movie
just came in this week.

197
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,810
- Wanna join?
- You wanna go?

198
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,890
That's fine.

199
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,110
I'll see you tomorrow.

200
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,370
Ok then we'll split up here.

201
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,050
See you.

202
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,050
Bye.

203
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,050
See ya.

204
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,250
What do you mean
by looking at me like that?

205
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,210
You think I was gonna tell them...

206
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,010
that you're afraid of horror movies?

207
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,010
No.

208
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,870
Actually, you can go watch that movie
with your friends.

209
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,330
Nah.

210
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,330
I have to meet up with Pharm at his club.

211
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,790
What are you gonna do there?

212
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,610
Well...

213
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,930
I asked Pharm to help me with my English.

214
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,130
He's baking right now
while waiting for me.

215
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,660
Are you actually gonna go there
to learn or to eat?

216
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,560
Both of them.

217
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,680
You're not good at English?

218
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,220
To be honest...

219
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,640
I'm not good in all subjects.

220
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,020
You’re so reckless.

221
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
You could lose your scholarship.

222
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,120
Because of that…

223
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,920
that’s why I asked Pharm to help me.

224
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,320
Go go. Get in the car.

225
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,700
Oh Hia, Can I drive?

226
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,700
I will drive.

227
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,040
If someone else drives,
I will get a carsick.

228
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,040
Go.

229
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,040
Slowly.

230
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
I know.

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,080
You can just drop me off
at some hotel nearby.

232
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,520
I don’t wanna bug you.

233
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,000
There’s no hotels around here.

234
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,200
It’s only a few hours.
You can just chill at my place.

235
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Why do you have to pay for the hotel?

236
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Here make yourself at home.

237
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,400
You can lay on the bed.

238
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,500
I don’t mind.

239
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,440
It’s okay. I haven’t showered.

240
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,060
I’ll just nap on the couch.
That’s enough.

241
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,740
Err…

242
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,460
You’ve got only a bit of time left.

243
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,900
Why don’t you go to sleep?

244
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,780
Let me clean my face first.

245
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,240
I can’t sleep like this.
I might break out.

246
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,600
Aren’t you tired?

247
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,740
Even I study only,

248
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,840
I still get tired at the end of day.

249
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,080
I am tired, but what can I do?

250
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh hey I always want to know.

251
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,319
When strangers ask for pictures,
are you like uncomfortable?

252
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,520
It was at first.

253
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,020
But now I got used to it.

254
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,599
And why don't you just refuse them?

255
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,520
If I reject one person,
people will say that I'm arrogant right away.

256
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,079
I'm used to it. Forget it.

257
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,440
Smile a bit and it's done.

258
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,400
I'm gonna make myself at home then. I'm so tired.

259
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,820
It was so much fun riding with you today.

260
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,940
Sweet dream.

261
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,540
Thank you.

262
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,500
I gotta go.

263
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,900
Bye bye, Bumblebee.

264
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,640
What's wrong with me?

265
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,980
That smells good.

266
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,460
Are you really waking up
because the smell of the food?

267
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,560
Wow.

268
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,640
As requested,
you're so talented Pharm!

269
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,000
If you put your heart into it,
it's not difficult.

270
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,620
But...

271
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,160
Are you gonna make it?
Not even 3 chapters and you already fell asleep.

272
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,440
Are you gonna make it?

273
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,920
Cause whenever I see the English alphabets,

274
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,300
my brain would always shut down, Pharm.

275
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,640
Professor has lots of pop quizzes too lately.

276
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,180
Be careful with your scores!
You could lose your scholarship.

277
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
You're threatening me like Hia Win.

278
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,240
Don't understand why athletic scholarship
requires good grades.

279
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,720
Do you want P'Win to teach you instead?

280
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,520
What?

281
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,660
P'Dean told me that he's super smart.
He always teaches all his friends.

282
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,800
He might even teach better than me.

283
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,300
Nah.
He always teases me.

284
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,320
Hmm?

285
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,160
He is a teaser? Really?

286
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,540
You don't know anything, Pharm.

287
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,200
He is a real teaser.
Always gets on my nerves.

288
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:18,760
Umm...have you ever heard that people tend to
tease people that they like?

289
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,380
Like...

290
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,440
Find an excuse to tease because

291
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,000
they just wanna be close.

292
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,300
Are you crazy?

293
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,400
You can always talk to me.

294
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,220
About what?
I don't have anything to discuss with you.

295
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,320
Oh...

296
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,680
and is there anyone picking you up today?

297
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,460
No! I drive today.

298
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,240
I'll drive myself back to my place.

299
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,360
There!

300
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,440
Stop. I'm not gonna play anymore.

301
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,480
- Don't splash the water too much.
- It's all over my face.

302
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,000
Ow.

303
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,300
It has to be all over your face.

304
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,720
My turn!

305
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,660
I'm going to get you.

306
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,320
Why?

307
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,440
Wait.

308
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,600
Just go.

309
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,560
You know what?
I'm gonna be a national athlete one day.

310
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,160
I'll be the coach who scolds at you then.

311
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,040
No, you can't.
You have to be an athlete just like me.

312
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,900
Fine.

313
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,960
You can be whatever,
but we have to stick together.

314
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
Ok I promise.

315
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,920
Promise?

316
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,120
Here take this!

317
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,260
My turn. My turn.

318
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,260
It's in my face.

319
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,980
Hello?

320
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,520
"What's up?"

321
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,720
"You haven't called me lately"

322
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,340
Mom.

323
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,600
What are you up to?

324
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,100
"Watching some soaps"

325
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,580
"When.."

326
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,500
"...are you gonna come home?"

327
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
"Dad misses you."

328
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,040
I have lots of activities going on here.

329
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,380
When I get back to my room,
I always pass out.

330
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,400
When I'm done with the qualifying,

331
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,880
I'll come home.

332
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,120
"Sure"

333
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,880
"Whenever you're free"

334
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,540
"How's the qualifying?
If you think it's too much, don't pressure yourself"

335
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,800
It's fine, mom.

336
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,140
There's a long holiday next month.

337
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,140
Maybe I'll go back then.

338
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,240
"Good. Good."

339
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,460
"I'll make you your favorite chill paste dip"

340
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,000
"Oh and come see your brother too."

341
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,660
"He probably misses you a lot"

342
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,360
P'...

343
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,520
Are you still mad at me?

344
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,180
Can I spend a night with you?

345
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,620
Go to sleep.

346
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,700
Don't think too much.

347
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,820
I'm always here beside you.

348
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You didn't lock the door.

349
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,260
I left it unlocked
for someone to come

350
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,800
And how did you know that I was coming?

351
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,020
And did you?

352
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,480
Were you still awake?

353
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,140
Did I wake you up?

354
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,020
Go to sleep, good boy.

355
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,920
Hia.

356
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,280
Don't you wanna know
why am I like this?

357
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,600
I do.

358
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,020
But I'd love to know
when you're ready to tell me.

359
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,640
Which is not right now, isn't it?

360
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,660
Thank you.

361
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,900
Stop thanking me.

362
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,860
Hia.

363
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,040
What?

364
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,060
Until I’m better from this stupid symptom,

365
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,520
can you please
don’t be with anyone yet?

366
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,440
Team.

367
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,420
I’m sorry, Hia.

368
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,620
Just forget what I said.

369
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,580
I promise.

370
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,840
I’ll only have you.

371
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,840
Hia.

372
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,340
I don’t know for how long...

373
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,440
but until you’re better.

374
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,610
Until there's someone
who takes care of you better than me.

375
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,620
Until you are bored of me.

376
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,760
Or until whatever.

377
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,260
I would still only have you.

378
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,020
Are you asking me
to be your boyfriend?

379
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,800
If that’s the case,

380
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,160
do you have the answer for me?

381
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,660
And did you…

382
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,040
really mean to ask me that?

383
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,280
Good night, Hia.

384
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,660
Wake up.

385
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,860
Wake up.

386
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,620
What are you doing in my room?

387
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Open your eyes and look around.

388
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,040
This is my room.

389
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,200
Oh right.

390
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,000
Get up.

391
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,140
Get up and go brush your teeth.

392
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,620
Go.

393
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,000
Go brush your teeth.

394
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,660
Ow.

395
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,360
I don’t know for how long...

396
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,340
But until you’re better.

397
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,530
Until there's someone
who takes care of you better than me.

398
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,580
Until you are bored of me.

399
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,800
Or until whatever.

400
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,440
I would still only have you.

401
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,160
Are you asking me
to be your boyfriend?

402
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,640
If that’s the case,

403
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,220
do you have the answer for me?

404
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,220
And did you…

405
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,080
really mean to ask me that?

406
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,980
He probably does this to everyone.

407
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,980
Why are you hoping?

408
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,840
Ughh.

409
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,800
Nutritious food.

410
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,460
You can eat, right?

411
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,860
I can eat everything.

412
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,340
Maybe…

413
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,340
I will eat you too some day.

414
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,880
Watch out for yourself.

415
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,640
Who’s really gonna get eaten?

416
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,340
Ouch...Hia.

417
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,180
That hurts.

418
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,180
I'm already stupid.

419
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,780
If you're stupid,

420
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,980
I'll make you smarter.

421
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,960
Thank you.

422
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,280
You're judging me with your eyes.

423
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,990
You think I'm doing all these to everyone?

424
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,820
Correct?

425
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,830
What are you trying to say?

426
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,920
Even I'm kind to everyone,

427
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,260
but with you

428
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,640
it's different.

429
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,940
What are you trying to say?

430
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,140
What we talked last night,

431
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,920
I didn't talk in my sleep.

432
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,840
I just want more time.

433
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,360
Do whatever you want.

434
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,540
Up to you.

435
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,920
Just eat.

436
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,500
So we can go.

437
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,240
Hey that's my egg.

438
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,120
Mmm.

439
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,660
Yummy.

440
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,900
You're such a pig.

441
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,140
Should I charge you my wardrobe fee?

442
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,120
So greedy.

443
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,740
Do you know how to tie a necktie?

444
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,240
Not really.

445
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,400
Normally, I'll have Pharm do it for me.

446
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,740
I'll teach you.

447
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,480
You sure you can?

448
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,200
Pharm already taught me many times,
I still don't know how to tie myself.

449
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,040
Even I'm not sure, I still need to try.

450
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
Here let me teach you.

451
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,440
Come.

452
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,820
Stand there.

453
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,300
Done.

454
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,700
Easy right?

455
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,580
Umm.

456
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,040
Try to tie on your own next time.

457
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,380
So you don't have to ask your friend.

458
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,200
I know.

459
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,220
Let's go.

460
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,160
Why are you standing there smiling?

461
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,540
Fine I'm coming.

462
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,260
Oh Hia!

463
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,920
Just got home?

464
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,080
Yeah.

465
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,120
Why? What happened?

466
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,880
There's an issue at the resort,
so I had to stay longer.

467
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,140
Are you going to school?
If yes, I'll wait to drop you off.

468
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,280
Umm...you can go to bed.

469
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
I can go by myself.

470
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,300
Have you eaten?
There's porridge with fish. Want some?

471
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,500
Nah. I think I'll go to bed.

472
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,420
Did you just get home?

473
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,160
There are so many problems at the resort

474
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,380
but you still manage to go out and have fun.

475
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,000
Dad...he was--

476
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,840
This is not about you.
Shut up, Wiew!

477
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,500
You can be furious with me,

478
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,240
but don't take it out on others.

479
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,080
You are such a lousy son.

480
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,860
I shouldn't trust you
to run the business in the first place.

481
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,760
Since you were born,

482
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,500
Not a single day that you make me proud.

483
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,760
That means...

484
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,120
my effort is paid off.

485
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,680
Cause I meant it to turn out this way.

486
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,600
The day you're proud of me

487
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,500
- will be the day I regret the most.
- Waan!

488
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,780
I can be worse than this.

489
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,500
Wait and see.

490
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,880
Hey Hia!

491
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,940
- Where're you goin'?
- Don't stop him.

492
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,580
Let him go wherever he wants.

493
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,000
Dad.

494
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,940
In case you didn't know,

495
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,280
Waan was gone all night

496
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,560
because he was dealing
with the issues at your resort.

497
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,500
I promised Hia Win

498
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,320
that when I grew up,

499
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,540
we'll help each other run the resort.

500
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,660
But now,

501
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,780
I wish it could go bankrupt.

502
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,880
Wiew!

503
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,820
I'm also curious

504
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,400
if you don't have that stupid hotel

505
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,320
would you gonna be the old dad
we used to have?

506
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,860
Thanks Hia for dropping me off.

507
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,340
Umm.

508
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,200
Oh Hia.

509
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,880
I'll sleepover at Pharm's tonight.

510
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,860
You can drive the car back.

511
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,200
Ok have fun with your class.

512
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,740
Oh you knew that today is a day-off
for our club, right?

513
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,060
I knew.

514
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,380
Hey.

515
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,440
I'm late.
I gotta go. See you.

516
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,620
Ok.

517
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,900
Oh I forgot.

518
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,020
Hmm?

519
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,380
Thank you for doing
the tie for me, daddy.

520
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,680
Team!

521
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,500
I really gotta go.
Bye bye. See ya.

522
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,180
Umm.

523
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,600
What's up?
Calling me this early.

524
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,500
You came all the way here.

525
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,200
Probably a big issue huh?

526
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,200
Wiew is not

527
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,940
gonna let you find out by yourself, right?

528
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,520
He called me this morning.

529
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,000
Sounded like he was almost crying.

530
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,740
You're fighting with dad big time?

531
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,220
It's normal. I'm used to it.

532
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,040
If you really are used to it,

533
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,280
you wouldn't be here, brother.

534
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,200
I'm never enough for him.
No matter what I do.

535
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,480
No matter how hard I try.

536
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,480
Or how good I am.

537
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,480
It's never going to be enough.

538
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,740
I wanna know

539
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,940
what does it take
for me to be good enough for him?

540
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,320
I'm tired.

541
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,500
So damn tired.

542
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,720
I'm sorry.

543
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
I couldn't help you.

544
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,820
Hey it's not your fault.

545
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,680
Oh.

546
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,760
and where're you going after this?

547
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,640
I'll probably drive around here a bit.

548
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,100
Then I'll go back
and work on some stuff at the resort

549
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,760
before going home.

550
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,060
Okay.

551
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,120
Just call me if you need anything.

552
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,700
Or if you're free,
you can come spend a night with me.

553
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,300
At your dorm?

554
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,120
Hey can I? Really?

555
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,180
Sure. Why not?

556
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,480
I don't know.

557
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,720
You might have a company there.

558
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,280
Nonsense, Hia.

559
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,960
You're not going to the class, Win?

560
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,060
About to.

561
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,120
What are you doing here?

562
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,500
Oh...I woke up late.

563
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,900
Almost to the point where I have to run.

564
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,780
Bullshit right in front of me.

565
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,320
Nagging me again.

566
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,480
Oh...

567
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,940
This is Waan, my brother.
Hia that's Tul, a friend of mine.

568
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,800
Waan. Win. Wiew.

569
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,340
Sounds familiar.

570
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,500
Feels like I've heard it somewhere before.

571
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,320
Hello Hia Waan.

572
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,300
Hi.

573
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,020
Well...

574
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,200
I'm gonna get going then.

575
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,140
Drive safe Hia.

576
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,560
Call me anytime.

577
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,120
Sure. See you.

578
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,920
Why are you smiling?

579
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,820
No, I'm not.

580
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,440
Why is your brother here at the uni?

581
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,720
He fought with my dad.

582
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,520
Same old shit.

583
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,650
What do you mean 'same old shit'?

584
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,760
Oh yeah right.

585
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,500
I don't make any sense.

586
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,370
But I think this time is worse.

587
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,220
He normally fights with dad.

588
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,260
But this time he seems more depressed.

589
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,400
Really?

590
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,600
And he's the kind...

591
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,330
that doesn't like to tell anyone anything.

592
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,800
Just like you.

593
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,540
Yeah just like me.

594
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,620
Mr. Know it all.

595
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,080
Umm.

596
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,200
Yeah.

597
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,720
Let's go to class.

598
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,900
We're late.
Come on.

599
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,740
Team.

600
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,430
Close to the qualifying already, right?

601
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,560
You can do it!

602
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,560
I'll be there for you on that day.

603
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,320
Me too.

604
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,120
Are you gonna be there for me?

605
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,020
or for someone else?

606
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,360
Yeah right.

607
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,400
How's it goin'?

608
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,860
with P'Phruek?

609
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,880
What are you talking about?

610
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,140
We're just...

611
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,800
--talking. That's all.

612
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,800
Really?

613
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,440
Stop teasing her, Pharm.

614
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,440
You too!

615
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,960
When you said you'll be there.

616
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,960
It's for me

617
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,040
or for P'Dean?

618
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,940
Did I just hear my name?

619
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,860
No.

620
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,620
I don't have to be at the club today.

621
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,620
Let's go have dinner.

622
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,940
But...

623
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,940
today...

624
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,220
Team and I...

625
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,560
are going back together.

626
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,200
Hey that's fine.

627
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,500
I can go back by myself.

628
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,960
You can go with P'Dean.

629
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,160
But--

630
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,160
Take care of him for me, P'Dean.

631
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,300
Go.

632
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,480
I'll see you later.

633
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,860
See you.

634
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Bye bye.

635
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,240
Are you going back home right away?

636
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,460
Umm...not yet.

637
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,020
I wanna practice 1-2 rounds first.

638
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,240
It's getting close to the day.

639
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,800
Hmm...but the club is closed today, isn't it?

640
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,920
I'll go check first.

641
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,920
If it doesn't lock, I still can practice.

642
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,100
Okay okay.

643
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,680
I will see you tomorrow then.

644
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,280
Okay.

645
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,880
I gotta go.
See you, Manow.

646
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,880
Bye bye.

647
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,480
You've been gone all day.

648
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,200
Busy with work?

649
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,200
It’s been hectic.

650
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,660
You sound so stressed.

651
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,040
Fought with the family again?

652
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,120
Mr.Know it all much?

653
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:44,180
Hey.

654
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,540
P'

655
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,640
I asked because I'm worried about you.

656
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,180
You knew with just how I sound like?

657
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,000
I have something to tell you.

658
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,610
I fought with my dad about the same old thing.

659
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,350
But sometimes it’s too much.

660
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,470
You should talk to others
to get it off your chest.

661
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,030
Your brother for instance.

662
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,030
How do you know I have a brother?

663
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,920
Cause...

664
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,300
you told me before.

665
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,900
You've forgotten already?

666
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,510
My brother always overthink. I don’t want this to agitate him.

667
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,740
The youngest is still in high school.

668
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,740
Also don’t want him to be worry about all these either.

669
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,740
I only tell you all these stories.

670
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,400
I feel so honored.

671
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,630
I’ll make you stressed with me.

672
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,600
Come at me.

673
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,780
Give me all in.

674
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,120
Can you just go in the game?

675
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,120
Why did you keep talking to me?

676
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,260
Who's the one who initiated the talk?

677
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,720
Are you arguing with me, kid?

678
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,480
Come at me brah.

679
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,760
One on one?

680
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,120
Wait.

681
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,860
Don't forget to warm up before swimming.

682
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,860
Ughh.

683
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,280
I'm too lazy.

684
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,360
No! We have to warm up first.

685
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,420
If not, we could drown
due to cramps.

686
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,240
When I grow up, I'll become a national athlete.

687
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,040
And I'll bring mom the silver medal!

688
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,120
What?
Why the silver only?

689
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,520
Cause the gold medal has to be yours.

690
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,810
Team!

691
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,060
When you said…

692
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,870
you’d never let anything be important to you your life…

693
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,480
are you eating your own words now?

694
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,780
I think…

695
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,780
He and I…

696
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,780
has crossed the line a bit.

697
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:31,430
I don’t wanna start loving anyone.

698
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,030
Hia

699
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,460
Hia.

700
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,900
Since when you're here?

701
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,000
The meeting is not over yet.

702
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,150
Who allowed you to come out here?

703
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,620
I was thirsty.

704
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,540
There're water in the meeting room,
aren't there?

705
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,900
I didn't wanna drink water.

706
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,180
I just wanna drink this a little.

707
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,180
Just one sip.

708
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,020
Please.

709
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,520
Sure.

710
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,100
But in return...

711
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:43,740
No.

712
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,220
People will see us.

713
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,780
Up to you.

714
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,430
Wait!

715
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:02,930
Give me that.

716
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:03,720
I'm gone.
