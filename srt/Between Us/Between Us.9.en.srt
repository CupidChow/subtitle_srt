1
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,220
Do you normally...

2
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,220
ask people to pay you
like what you did to me?

3
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,850
There's only you,

4
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,850
that I charge with a kiss.

5
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,850
Why is it only me?

6
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,510
Because it's YOU.

7
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,440
I wanna be by your side.

8
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Can I be by your side?

9
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,440
I'm gonna take you to see Christmas lights.

10
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,020
Keep it safe.

11
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,729
When I'm not in the room you can just come in.

12
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,729
Thank you.

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,420
We will begin in a few minutes.

14
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:19,020
You should go check on your boy.

15
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,940
Sure.

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,660
I'll go check on him.

17
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,140
You better hurry.

18
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,190
Come with me.

19
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,660
We don't have much time.

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,260
What the hell are you doing?

21
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,400
Putting on sunscreen.

22
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,460
Your...

23
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,760
face looks so grey.

24
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,720
Well...

25
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,520
it's the 2 fingers rule.
It'll absorb.

26
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,580
Who turns my friend into this kind of a person?

27
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,160
Bee.

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,850
You ass is still dark.

29
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,580
Why suddenly you're worried about skin?

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,900
It's none of your business.

31
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,329
Hey I gotta go.

32
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,180
Wait!

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,600
You're going with the face like that?

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,700
Hey!

35
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,270
I don't have that much time.

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,760
Use it efficiently!

37
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,360
Next time, blend it too.

38
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,700
May I go use to the restroom, P'Dean?

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,200
We're warming up!

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,360
Yeah we are.

41
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,440
- We're working so hard.
- Ready!

42
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,160
Hia.

43
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,240
Why did you bring me here?

44
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,160
It's about to start.

45
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,840
And are you ready to do it?

46
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,380
You got enough sleep last night, didn't you?

47
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,230
Yeah.

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,410
I don't know...

49
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,380
Whenever I have a competition,

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,240
it's always like this.

51
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,220
I always have this unease feeling.

52
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,500
But you always end up perform really well.

53
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,500
You don't have to look at others.

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,420
Don't be nervous.

55
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,100
This is not a competition.

56
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,500
This is just a swimming club.

57
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,730
There's only me...

58
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,400
and you.

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,320
Just the two of us.

60
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,370
Remember this...

61
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,159
no matter what happens,

62
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,760
just look over here.

63
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,380
Understood?

64
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,000
Umm.

65
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,290
Hia.

66
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,390
Hmm?

67
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,760
Please wait for me.

68
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
When I'm ready,

69
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,270
I will tell you everything.

70
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,960
Okay.

71
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,070
I can wait.

72
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,610
Here.

73
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,540
Let me give you a blessing.

74
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,810
The blessing--

75
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,240
Hia...

76
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,230
Good luck.

77
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,000
People might have seen that.

78
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,510
And this time,

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,760
you can't disappear from me again.

80
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,520
Whenever I look for you,

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,960
you always have to be there, got it?

82
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,170
I know!

83
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,540
I'm not going anywhere.

84
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,320
I have to go.

85
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,440
What did you do?

86
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,300
Why does your face look like that?

87
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,909
What?

88
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,950
It's the 2 fingers rule sunscreen.

89
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Like you told me to do it.

90
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,590
Am I misunderstanding?

91
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,200
No, you're not.

92
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,620
It's just that you have to blend it better.

93
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,430
Come here.

94
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,310
Let me see.

95
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,470
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,299
Can I ask you something?

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,580
What...

98
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,200
you did just now...

99
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,000
how did you feel?

100
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,460
I don't know.

101
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,700
Don't know at all?

102
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,470
I don't know...

103
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,260
whether I should feel good or not.

104
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,170
Seems like our relationship is impossible.

105
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,280
How?

106
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,090
Well...

107
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,580
my friends said that...

108
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,000
you're out of my league.

109
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,810
I'm just a temple dog.

110
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,430
I'm afraid that...

111
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,780
My weird feeling that I have for you,
will make you uncomfortable.

112
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,800
It's me...

113
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,340
who has to worry more.

114
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,720
I worry that...

115
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,200
You might don't understand...

116
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,010
who and what I am.

117
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,320
What do you mean?

118
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,510
It's this condition where...

119
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,120
I'm a guy...

120
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,560
who likes guys.

121
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,090
Or...

122
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,400
what others call it...

123
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,870
gay

124
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,040
Gay as in...

125
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,570
guys that like guys

126
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,950
like that right?

127
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,920
Then I am gay too.

128
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,330
Well...

129
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,510
You are a guy.

130
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,020
And I like you.

131
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,470
So that means...

132
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm gay just like you.

133
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,960
What is this?

134
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,860
Are you telling me that you like me?

135
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,280
Am I...

136
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,480
listening to you confessing your love to me?

137
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,930
But...

138
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,540
being with me

139
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,520
is not easy.

140
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:33,960
There're lots of

141
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,220
limitations.

142
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,950
Another thing,

143
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,010
we can't tell other people too.

144
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
Do we...

145
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,640
have to tell others?

146
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,990
Love

147
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,980
It's just about us loving each other.

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,080
There's only...

149
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,490
the two of us that matters.

150
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,300
We don't have to care about others.

151
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,130
So that means...

152
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,450
we're officially a couple right, Prince?

153
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,090
Ow that hurts.

154
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,050
Are you crazy?

155
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,620
You have to date and flirt with me
before becoming my boyfriend.

156
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,100
Ughhh.

157
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,600
Fine fine.

158
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,540
Well then...

159
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,620
I'll try to flirt with you now.

160
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm gonna start!

161
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,080
Flirting for real.

162
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,280
What?

163
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,170
What are you doing?

164
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,130
Again?

165
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,060
Can I kiss you one more time?
So I can get some love before the swim.

166
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:41,980
Hey!

167
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,930
Don't move away.

168
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,050
Go get ready.

169
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,680
I'll go get ready then.

170
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,860
You can do it!
(Susu in Thai)

171
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,800
Manow

172
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,130
That's Team.

173
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,410
Team su su.

174
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,000
Go Team!

175
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,720
Check your mark.

176
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,320
Go Team!

177
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,540
Team su su!

178
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,740
I'll help you paddle.

179
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,320
This is a swimming competition, Manow.

180
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,850
Come on!

181
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,430
Well done, Team!

182
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,810
Awesome!

183
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,720
I guess

184
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,580
we might have to book your whole resort in Kanchanaburi.

185
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,990
I'll bring you this, brother.

186
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,000
When I grow up,

187
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,830
I'll become a national athlete

188
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,440
and I'll bring mom the silver medal.

189
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,100
What?

190
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,620
Why only the silver medal?

191
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,400
Because gold medal belongs to you!

192
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,580
You did a very good job.

193
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,590
Well done, Team.

194
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,530
Thank you.

195
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:25,930
Hey.

196
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,660
Since we all are here,

197
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,480
to celebrate

198
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,330
that our university performed really well,

199
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,320
after the New Year

200
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,330
we will

201
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,880
go to

202
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,600
Kanchanaburi.

203
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,400
Everything

204
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,580
will be free of charge!

205
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,860
We have to thank our kind sponsor.

206
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,220
Our vice president.

207
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:55,820
Wow.

208
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,180
You're really gonna have
the whole resort for us?

209
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,360
Only for one night.

210
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,740
It's not gonna make my dad go bankrupt.

211
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,190
So rich.

212
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,720
- He's so rich.
- He's so rich.

213
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,000
I wanna be able to say that.

214
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,680
Now our gang knows someone who's rich.

215
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,900
Hey hey. Let's do this.

216
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,500
Before we actually go to Kanchanaburi,

217
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,869
shall we go party tonight?

218
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,520
Let's go wooooo!

219
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,829
- I've been super tired.
- Let's go. Go go.

220
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,450
Do you guys wanna--

221
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:28,880
Oh.

222
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,810
They're not going?

223
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,760
Why are they not going?

224
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,150
Well...

225
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,020
There's only one

226
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,060
two

227
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
three.

228
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,870
- Let's go.
- Three is fine, right?

229
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,810
Let's go.

230
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm here.

231
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,930
You're so late P'

232
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,420
We agreed to play at this time.

233
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,220
I waited until I almost fell asleep.

234
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,880
Who asked you to wait then?

235
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,570
Hey!

236
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,060
You might got punched someday talkin' like that.

237
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,320
How's school today?

238
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,370
Why do you ask?

239
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,560
Why can't I ask?

240
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,240
Well...

241
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,630
How do you know

242
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,620
that I have school today?

243
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,420
You told me before that you're still in school.

244
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,830
And today is a weekday.

245
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,520
Is it odd that I ask?

246
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,050
Oh.

247
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,400
Not really.

248
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,030
Well...

249
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,170
It's just another school day.

250
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,820
Business degree is such a headache.

251
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,560
You study business?

252
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,040
Yes.

253
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,520
Hey me too!

254
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,570
Which year are you?

255
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,070
Third year.

256
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,580
Realy?

257
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,620
Same age with my brother.

258
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,980
If you told me you're in the same uni with him too,
that would be hilarious.

259
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,610
Probably not.

260
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,390
How can it be such a coincident?

261
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,660
Yeah.

262
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,420
You know my name

263
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,820
but I still don't know yours.

264
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,040
What's your name?

265
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,610
My name is...

266
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,550
My name is...

267
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,370
Tee.

268
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,130
Tee!

269
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,720
Oh

270
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,350
Your username is T-Rex

271
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,000
is because your name is Tee.

272
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,110
Yes! That's right.

273
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,710
Just like that.

274
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,360
What a stupid idea.

275
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Oh hey...

276
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,800
Why?

277
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,790
Here.

278
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,290
Let's play so we can go to bed.

279
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,100
I have work early tomorrow morning.

280
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,460
Don't work too hard P'

281
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,620
Take care of your health too.

282
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,130
Your under eyes are all dark.

283
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,820
Wait...

284
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,700
how do you know that my under eyes are dark?

285
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,040
N--No, P'

286
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,640
You're such a weirdo.

287
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,760
Let's play the game.

288
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,600
So we can go to sleep.

289
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,310
Come on.

290
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,480
Get in the game!

291
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,110
Are you sure you can drive?

292
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,950
I'm sure.

293
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,230
It's just Chonburi.

294
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,500
I'll be there in just a blink of an eye.

295
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,370
Don't drive too fast, okay?

296
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,220
Sure dad.

297
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,380
Let me know when you're there.

298
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,950
Don't worry!

299
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,410
It's my hometown.

300
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,980
I can drive there with my closed eyes.

301
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,640
Have a safe trip.

302
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,300
I will.

303
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,220
I'll buy you some BIG Khao Lam.

304
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,040
Okay?

305
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,990
Sure. You can buy me whatever.

306
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,020
But please hurry back here.

307
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,280
I will.

308
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,390
But aren't you gonna
let me stay with my parents for a bit?

309
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,610
Go go now.

310
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,640
I'm going.

311
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,080
Mom!

312
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,510
Oh!

313
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,550
You're here.

314
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,890
You showed up like this,

315
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,000
almost gave me a heart attack.

316
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,610
I miss you so much mom!

317
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,080
I miss you too.

318
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,200
Like you know we're making food for you.

319
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,140
Dad!

320
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,560
Something for me to eat?

321
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,680
I'm super hungery.

322
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,130
There're tons in the kitchen.

323
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,940
Okay I'll bring it out then.

324
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,180
Everything looks so good, dad.

325
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,500
Which girls are you sending that picture to?

326
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,220
There's no girls.

327
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,160
Nothing.

328
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,000
If you already have a girlfriend,

329
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,270
bring her here to introduce.

330
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,260
I don't have any girlfriend mom.

331
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,090
Have smaller bites!

332
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,530
You might choke.

333
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,240
Don't pretend like that.
It's not funny.

334
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,960
I was just kidding.

335
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,540
Oh.

336
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,550
Can I sleep with you guys tonight?

337
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,630
You're a grown ass man.

338
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,400
Still wanna sleep with us?

339
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,440
Dad!

340
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,880
This is your own son.

341
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,360
I'm not some calfs in the field.

342
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,630
I think he looks like one.

343
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,200
Yeah.

344
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:55,960
And...

345
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,460
when will you go see him?

346
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,570
I think tomorrow.

347
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,500
I'll bring him the gold medal.

348
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,950
He would have been so happy.

349
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,840
Yeah.

350
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,220
Hey.

351
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,710
Let's continue eating.

352
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Eat up, son.

353
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,010
Yes mom.

354
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,740
It's been awhile,
since we last had a meal altogether like this.

355
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,030
Yeah.

356
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,960
Missing the old times, yeah?

357
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,010
When all of us had to be here

358
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,470
so we could actually eat.

359
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,370
Hia.

360
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,860
You're not gonna eat with us first?

361
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,310
I'm not hungry.

362
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,390
Enjoy your meal.

363
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,970
Don't look at me like that.

364
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,950
I haven't said a word out of my mouth.

365
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,100
Let's just eat.

366
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,040
So you really went for it?

367
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:17,920
Yeah.

368
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,120
He told me to flirt and date him first.

369
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,770
And I've been trying.

370
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,430
Way to go

371
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,050
my temple doggo.

372
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,950
You're jealous huh?

373
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,360
And...

374
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,420
if you could officially date him,

375
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,860
how is it going to work out?

376
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,210
He's a famous actor.

377
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,040
People know him wherever he goes.

378
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,510
Yeah.

379
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,710
I'll just be myself like this.

380
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,450
I don't have to

381
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,220
tell the whole world to know about us.

382
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,400
Hey hey hey.

383
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,530
Here it is.

384
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,430
About to countdown.

385
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,120
Hey.

386
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,600
5

387
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,610
4

388
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,650
3

389
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,420
2

390
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,240
1

391
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,110
Happy birthday. Wooooo!

392
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,110
Happy New Year.

393
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,110
Here here. Cheers guys!

394
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,300
- Cheers cheers.
- Come come.

395
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,820
Bring me my glass.

396
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,570
Here's yours.

397
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,320
Cheers! Yayy!

398
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,800
Hold this.

399
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,990
I think Prince is here.

400
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,440
Go go. I'll take care of it.

401
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,010
Oh you're here.

402
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,850
Yeah.

403
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,910
You guys enjoy your time.

404
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,310
I can't do anything else.

405
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,490
I need to sleep.

406
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,260
Hey hey hey.

407
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,140
What?

408
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,600
And why is he sleeping here?

409
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:08,570
Well...

410
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,280
He works nearby here.

411
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,590
And today

412
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,090
his manager

413
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,280
worked with someone else.

414
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,650
so he had to go back by himself.

415
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,960
I just thought it's already late so...

416
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,580
I told him he can spend a night here.

417
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,140
And why didn't you go pick him up?

418
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,940
If he...

419
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,800
is on my bike again,

420
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,200
there'll be more dramas.

421
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,420
Famous person thing, huh?

422
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,060
You can adjust yourself to his life so well.

423
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,160
But now you guys

424
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,940
should go.

425
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,710
- What?
- Huh?

426
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,470
Go home.

427
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,740
Why are you forcing me to go gome?

428
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,160
I just had one chicken.

429
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,570
It's already late.

430
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,760
I care about you guys.

431
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,170
Care about us suddenly.

432
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:50,730
Huh?

433
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,360
What?

434
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,220
Damn you.

435
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,840
Go go go.
Happy birthday.

436
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,490
- Happy New Year.
- New Year.

437
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,920
Send us off too.

438
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,160
You've been ditching us lately.

439
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,320
See you later friends.

440
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,850
Can't we stay longer?

441
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,030
Bye dude.

442
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:04,770
Fine!

443
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,660
Thought you said you might...

444
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,700
have acnes,
if you don't clean your face before sleeping?

445
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,050
Happy New Year, Hia.

446
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,030
Happy New Year.

447
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,860
Hope we can countdown
together next year.

448
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,220
I hope this year will be a good year for you.

449
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,420
You too.

450
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,370
Hia.

451
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,640
I gotta go.

452
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,780
I'll buy you something before I go back.

453
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,440
Err...

454
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,250
Aunty Ta.

455
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,070
Oh

456
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,950
Team!

457
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,750
Hello.

458
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,580
You're home during New Year?

459
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,030
Yes.

460
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,160
I came to visit my parents.

461
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,480
How's it going at the uni?

462
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,070
Which year are you in now?

463
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,070
1st year.

464
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,420
You're in 1st year.

465
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,300
If Ton was still here,

466
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,050
he would have been in 3rd year, right?

467
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,290
Cause he's 2 years older than you.

468
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,080
Yes.

469
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,930
I have to go.

470
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,970
Good luck.

471
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,560
Good bye aunt Ta.

472
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,340
Hey.

473
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,020
The calf wants to sleep with us for real.

474
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,840
If Team was a calf,

475
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,990
then both of us are his cow parents then.

476
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,450
Maybe you should think
before you actually say something.

477
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,310
Yeah right.

478
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,500
Never thought of that.

479
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,100
Mom.

480
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,560
I met aunt Ta earlier.

481
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,200
Really?

482
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,410
What did she say?

483
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,130
She didn't say anything.

484
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,330
She just asked...

485
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,970
which year am I in.

486
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,860
and told me

487
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,880
if P'Ton was alive,

488
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,480
he would have been in 3rd year.

489
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,910
You still think about that, son?

490
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,040
By now,

491
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,620
he probably borns in his new life.

492
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,990
But aunt Ta looks sad still.

493
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,070
That's the way she is.

494
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,550
Rarely talks to anyone.

495
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,640
Even though,

496
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,960
other people don't forgive you,

497
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,730
but

498
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,390
you need to learn to forgive yourself.

499
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,620
You know that right?

500
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,640
My calf son...

501
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,930
That's enough.

502
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,640
Stop thinking and go to sleep.

503
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,330
I will make your favorite food tomorrow.

504
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,720
I'll eat all of it.

505
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,310
Let's go to sleep.

506
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,990
Sweet dream...

507
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,170
Dad cow.

508
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,080
Mom cow.

509
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,250
You never gets old bro.

510
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,250
I brought you the gold medal.

511
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,940
I swam until my arms almost torn apart.

512
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,430
How is it?

513
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,280
Pretty, right?

514
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,660
How have you been?

515
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,000
How are you?

516
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,680
I miss you a lot P'

517
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,050
P'

518
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,230
Have you forgiven me?

519
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,670
Are you still mad at me?

520
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,110
I'm so sorry P'

521
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,490
Happy New Year son.

522
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,680
I made all the food that you like today.

523
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,750
Let's eat.

524
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,330
Yesterday...

525
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,290
I met Team.

526
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,490
But I'm not mad or hate him anymore.

527
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,470
But whenever I see him,

528
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,190
I can't help but think about you.

529
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,340
If that day,

530
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,030
I didn't allow you to go play with him,

531
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,240
you'd probably be alive still.

532
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,670
I miss you so much.

533
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,320
I have to go now.

534
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,370
I'll come see you again tomorrow.

535
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:48,700
Hia.

536
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,030
Hmm?

537
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,340
What are you doin'?

538
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,080
Watching the TV.

539
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,200
Where's P'Team?

540
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,060
You didn't invite him over today?

541
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,800
He's at his homwtown.

542
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,630
When is he gonna be back?

543
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,380
He said

544
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,720
probably tomorrow.

545
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,660
Oh.

546
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,460
You're waiting for him to call, aren't you?

547
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,440
Don't be Mr.Know it all.

548
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,500
If he doesn't call, then you call him first.

549
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,340
You're not gonna loose your cool.

550
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,420
I'm not afraid of loosing my cool.

551
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,940
I just don't wanna bug him
while he's with his family.

552
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,130
Hey.

553
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,900
And...

554
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,060
so are you guys like together?

555
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:44,890
Ahhhh.

556
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,010
Not answering.

557
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,050
You're talking too much, Wiew.

558
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,060
Why am I repirmanded?

559
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,420
See!

560
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,740
Now you're smiling cause he's calling.

561
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,510
Shut up.

562
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,370
Hello.

563
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,800
What are you up to?

564
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,550
Team!

565
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,680
Where are you right now?

566
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,290
What's happening?

567
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,870
Wait there. Don't go anywhere!

568
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,200
I'll be there in 2 hours.

569
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,190
Where're you going?

570
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,130
I'm going to see Team.

571
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,880
Huh?

572
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,970
Isn't he's at his hometown?

573
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,800
Are you taking bike?

574
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,470
P'

575
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,880
How much do I have to make up for it?

576
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,390
When is it gonna enough?

577
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,880
Why did it have to be you who died?

578
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,620
Why not me?

579
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,610
Hia.

580
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,600
Hia.

581
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,380
Why...Hia?

582
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,900
Why not me?

583
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,490
If I were the one who died,
everything would have been better.

584
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,990
It's okay.

585
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,080
I'm here now.

586
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,640
Nobody can do anything to you.

587
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,900
Why not me, Hia?

588
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,590
Let's go home.

589
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,100
I'm here to bring you home.

590
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:51,680
Hia.

591
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,450
It's okay.

592
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:28,400
Yes mom?

593
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,090
He happens to be in town.

594
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,910
So we kinda met up.

595
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,150
Yes.

596
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,680
Sure.

597
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,640
I'll take him

598
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,140
to have breakfast at home tomorrow.

599
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,380
Yes.

600
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,480
Love you, mom.

601
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:07,950
Team.

602
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,820
You rode your bike all the way from Bangkok?

603
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,660
You should worry about yourself first.

604
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,320
Look at you.

605
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,350
It's super dangerous.

606
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,010
I shouldn't have called you.

607
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,900
You did the right thing that you called me.

608
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,920
No matter what happens.

609
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,510
No matter how far you are,

610
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,240
I can always be there for you.

611
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,400
Understood?

612
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:06,920
Hia.

613
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,970
I'm the reason why he died.

614
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,430
I killed my brother, Hia.

615
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,300
You don't have to talk about it now.

616
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,260
I don't wanna hear any of those.

617
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,420
Just you're here...safe and sound

618
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,740
is more than enough for me.

619
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,540
So…

620
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,540
What are you guys’ status?

621
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,800
I don’t know what are we either.

622
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,520
Do you have a boyfriend?

623
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,180
My love is like…

624
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,440
happened in a complicated way.

625
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,440
Man up.

626
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,440
I’m not gonna runaway from you.

627
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,970
But you need to catch me if you can.
