30
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,840
(Bashang Post Station)

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,950
Search every single corner.

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,840
Check them all.

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,520
Have you found him?

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,850
Lord Gong has had the carriages ready.

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,910
He's urging us to set off.

36
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,990
Keep searching.

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,790
All of you, keep looking.

38
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,990
If we can't find Wang Heng,

39
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,120
I'm not going to Chang'an.

40
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,070
Well?

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,320
Duke.

42
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,760
Wei Xian and his men have arrived.

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,480
Why haven't you set out yet?

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Lord Gong.

45
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,230
Wang Heng is missing again.

46
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,840
Could he have run into trouble again?

47
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,350
It's almost time to enter Chang'an.

48
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,780
Duke, you mustn't delay any longer.

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,100
That's exactly why

50
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm feeling so uneasy.

51
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,870
What if we can't find Wang Heng?

52
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,240
How about this?

53
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,280
You set off first.

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,920
I'll arrange for the attendants
to search along the road.

55
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,250
I'll also leave a message here
at the lodge.

56
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,630
We've just arrived here after all.

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,920
We mustn't neglect proper etiquette.

58
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,800
Then that's the only way.

59
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Come on, let's go.

60
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,310
Let's go.

61
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,500
(6th month of 74 BC, Yuanping Year 1)

62
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,080
Duke,

63
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm here to change your carriage

64
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,960
into the imperial one.

65
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,460
(Wei Xian, Grand Herald)

66
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,870
This is Du Yannian, Grand Coachman.

67
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,870
According to our rites,

68
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,640
(Du Yannian, Grand Coachman)
he'll steer the carriage.

69
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,360
We will ride together into the capital.

70
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,160
That will not be necessary.

71
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,870
Li Qi.

72
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,180
Get in.

73
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,360
Yes.

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
After you, Lord Gong.

75
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,320
(The Grand Herald in charge
of ritual affairs)

76
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,430
(welcomed him on the outskirts.)

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,630
(Groom officer readied)

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,630
(the carriage for the Emperor.)

79
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,700
(Thus,)

80
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,150
(Liu He got in the carriage,)

81
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,900
(and the Grand Coachman
drove in the middle.)

82
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,840
(Chamberlain Gong Sui got in)

83
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,860
Set out.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,340
(as an attendant.)

85
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,960
(Bashang, Bashang Lodge, Chang'an)

86
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,320
(As they arrived
at the Guangming East Gate,)

87
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,370
(the gate guards came into view,)

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,950
(standing in neat rows,)

89
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,750
(and looking solemn and grave.)

90
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,590
The Duke of Changyi
has arrived in Chang'an

91
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,990
to pay respects before the spirit.

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,870
Duke.

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,590
We've reached the East Gate.

94
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,030
As per the funeral rites,

95
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,830
you must cry out three times.

96
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,040
I can't cry.

97
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,190
Tell them my throat hurts.

98
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,050
Wait...

99
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,910
This...

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Duke, welcome.

101
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,500
By order,

102
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,710
I've come especially

103
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,270
to welcome you.

104
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,600
Why are you here?

105
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,730
Look up.

106
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,000
Why?

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,320
Stare straight at the sun.

108
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,270
Don't blink.

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,630
The Duke of Changyi cherishes
the late Emperor's affection.

110
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
His feelings run deep,

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
which has moved the world.

112
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,920
You've worked hard today.

113
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,630
That's all for show.

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,700
Wang Heng acted rather strangely today.

115
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,970
First, he vanished from the lodge.

116
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,830
Then he reappeared at Huo Guang's side.

117
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,510
Tell me.

118
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,430
Why would he do that?

119
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,240
Does he have other plans in motion?

120
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,190
We agreed
we'd all enter the city together.

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,340
Then he turned away and left us behind.

122
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,880
(Huo Mansion)

123
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,840
Lord Wang has arrived.

124
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,190
Lord Huo has given instructions.

125
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,830
Please follow me to the study to wait.

126
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
Much obliged.

127
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,940
(Huo Mansion)

128
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,110
The Duke of Zhou Assisting King Cheng.

129
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,830
Lord Wang.

130
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,710
You...

131
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,600
What does this mean?

132
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,190
Lord Huo.

133
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,560
Before I take my leave,

134
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,160
I have a word of advice for you.

135
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,600
Impudent scoundrel!

136
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,640
Guards!

137
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,120
Well, Lord Huo.

138
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,800
Your career is indeed flourishing,

139
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,480
but something's wrong
with your household discipline.

140
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,560
Your wife is not being well managed.

141
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,160
Your sons and nephews
are arrogant and overbearing.

142
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,240
Anyway, the fate awaiting your family

143
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,130
will be far from good.

144
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,970
You can take my advice

145
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,870
or ignore it.

146
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,410
Liu He is just a child.

147
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,950
Why act against him?

148
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,360
You treacherous knave.

149
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,000
How dare you be so brazen before me?

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
That's enough.

151
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,620
When your family
is wiped out entirely one day,

152
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,460
don't say I failed to warn you today.

153
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,560
Heaven sends the Qilin
to guard Heaven and Earth.

154
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,050
The firmament shines bright
and grants its wish.

155
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,710
Endless cycles
exist as long as the sun and moon.

156
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,050
All mysteries and connections

157
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,500
are at my command.

158
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,820
At my command...

159
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,720
At my command.

160
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,390
With all mysteries and connections,

161
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,390
I'll have everything.

162
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
Foolish beyond measure.

163
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,310
At my command.

164
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,000
With all mysteries and connections,

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,830
I'll lose everything...

166
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,750
Lord Huo, please don't be angry.

167
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,910
I...

168
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,140
Hand it over.

169
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,780
(26th day)

170
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,820
(25th day of the 6th month, 74 BC)

171
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,070
Make sure to rest early tonight.

172
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,660
Do we have any special game here?

173
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,150
Duke.

174
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,160
We're close to Chang'an.

175
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,070
You must watch your words and actions.

176
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
Alright, alright.

177
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,820
What's wrong with you?

178
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,300
I've found the one
who killed your master.

179
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,590
Who is it?

180
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,040
Wait here for me.

181
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,890
Go in.

182
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,800
What happened?

183
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,110
You gave me a fake spell.

184
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,200
How do you know it's fake?

185
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,030
The way you asked proves it's fake.

186
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,440
What's the real spell?

187
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,990
If I tell you,

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,080
what if you run off again?

189
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,920
Say it.

190
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,590
As long as I can get the Qilin back,

191
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,550
and I can make my wish,

192
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,840
I'll tell you the real spell.

193
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,000
I just want you

194
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,960
to stay by my side and help me.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,170
Do you really have to make me
say such cheesy things?

196
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
Then let's talk about the Qilin.

197
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,320
The Qilin is now in Huo Guang's hands.

198
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,550
The one who killed your master

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,060
is most likely him as well.

200
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,030
So,

201
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,080
our goals are perfectly aligned now:

202
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,320
Bring down Huo Guang,

203
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,810
and reclaim the Qilin.

204
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,080
How do you know the Qilin
is in Huo Guang's hands?

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Trust me.
I'm never wrong about these things.

206
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
Let's sneak into the Huo Mansion

207
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,630
and quietly take the Qilin back.

208
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
It's not like
we haven't done this before.

209
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,450
The servants are easy to deal with.

210
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,620
But Huo Guang's place
is crawling with soldiers,

211
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,010
guarded by the Huben Army.

212
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,750
There's no blind spot at all.

213
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,390
What's a blind spot?

214
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,870
It's the chance to slip in unnoticed.

215
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,580
All the troops are
under Huo Guang's command.

216
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,010
We stand no chance against him.

217
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,270
In seizing power,

218
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,420
the army has never mattered.

219
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,880
To bring down Huo Guang,
it takes three steps.

220
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,880
First,

221
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
seize the armory.

222
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,110
Second,

223
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,600
cut off all official communications.

224
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,770
Third,

225
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,650
take control of the government center.

226
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,270
What do you mean?

227
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,130
Simply put,

228
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,930
we shall send troops
to seize the armory.

229
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,540
(Armory)

230
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,270
Wait for the right moment.

231
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,720
When Huo Guang is alone,

232
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,870
restrain him,

233
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,630
so he won't be able
to alert his allies or the army.

234
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,460
Then, accuse him of treason

235
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,970
in the Empress Dowager's name.

236
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,780
That's Lord Huo.

237
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,460
Empress Dowager.

238
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,630
He intends to commit regicide.

239
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,480
Regicide?

240
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,510
Drag him out and behead him.

241
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,320
The defense of Chang'an

242
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,900
has always been in the Huo Clan's hands.

243
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,830
If Huo Yu learns Huo Guang
has been executed...

244
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,750
Hyah! Hyah!

245
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,240
He'll rally the Huo Clan to rebel.

246
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,160
Hyah!

247
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,390
Right now,

248
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,360
we must reclaim the token

249
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,850
and alert the North and South Armies

250
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,250
so they can protect the Crown Prince

251
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,470
and suppress the uprising.

252
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,480
Yu.

253
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,910
The Huo Clan has fallen.

254
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,970
Any who still plot treason
will meet the same fate.

255
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,390
If Huo Guang loses his power...

256
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,360
His Majesty is wise.

257
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,560
His allies will be gone, too.

258
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,750
We won't need to control

259
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,820
the government center,

260
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,320
for you are the Crown Prince.

261
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,810
Once you ascend the throne,

262
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,080
everything

263
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,510
will be set in stone.

264
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,850
Do you think the Empress Dowager
will stand with us?

265
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,750
The Empress Dowager's entire family

266
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,890
was slain by Huo Guang.

267
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,820
She grew up without parents,

268
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,000
confined within the palace.

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,750
It's only natural
she harbors resentment.

270
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,250
Having no parents

271
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,930
is something I understand best.

272
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,510
How about...

273
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,350
- No.
- Don't.

274
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,510
I have a plan.

275
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,680
Let me handle this.

276
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,870
Alright.

277
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,970
There's one more thing.

278
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,200
We need a brave warrior

279
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,470
who can help us seize the armory

280
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,540
and control Huo Guang.

281
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,390
We have so many men from Changyi.

282
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,560
- How...
- Don't.

283
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,440
We need a brave one.

284
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,930
It's not a game here.

285
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,000
Me alone?

286
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
No, that's far too dangerous.

287
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,710
We'll have to enter the city first

288
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,730
and then take it one step at a time.

289
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,440
Hey, Heng.

290
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,840
You seem quite versed
in power struggles.

291
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,240
I heard it from an Up master.

292
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,440
Up master?

293
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,000
Up means "up".

294
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,480
The master of an Immortal
is an Up master.

295
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,720
Please bless us.

296
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,840
I shall take my leave.

297
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,200
Senior, where are you going?

298
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
Wait for my word.

299
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,030
May the Up master keep you safe.

300
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,080
Qingge.

301
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,960
Look at Heng...

302
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,440
I'll take my leave for now.

303
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
I'll find a way to get close
to Huo Guang.

304
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,150
First, I'll learn more about his habits.

305
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,490
Then we can act when the chance comes.

306
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,050
You're going to use this
to approach Huo Guang?

307
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,160
Yes.

308
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
May the Up master keep you safe.

309
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,750
Hey, where are you going?

310
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,590
I'm going to give it a try.

311
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,510
Maybe I can find the warrior you need.

312
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,200
Hyah!

313
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,630
Be careful out there.

314
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,120
Well.

315
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,290
Go and bring Wang Heng here.

316
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,360
Yes.

317
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,840
Such refined taste for someone so young.

318
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,870
There's unease in my heart.

319
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,320
I can hardly sleep in peace.

320
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,800
So, I came here to fish

321
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,870
and calm my heart.

322
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,970
Where does the anxiety come from?

323
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,910
With the utmost sincerity.

324
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,270
It's a good thing.

325
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,160
Why the unease?

326
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,670
The closer we get to Chang'an,

327
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,920
the more I feel I fall short of him.

328
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,070
Who is he?

329
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,370
A young man.

330
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,910
Years ago, his elder brother
brought him to Chang'an.

331
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,320
Since then, he has stayed
by Emperor Wu's side.

332
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,020
Diligent and devoted.

333
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,330
Cautious in every step.

334
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,410
Afraid to make
even the slightest mistake.

335
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,680
Emperor Wu was a ruler for the ages.

336
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,910
His standards were exacting
beyond measure.

337
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,480
Yet this young man never once erred.

338
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,880
I imagine each night before sleep,

339
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,110
he must feel both relieved and uneasy.

340
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,920
He was relieved

341
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,580
that he made it through another day
of treading around the Emperor.

342
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,470
Yet what gnawed at him was

343
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,080
not knowing
if tomorrow he'd make a mistake

344
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,160
that could turn into a grave offense,

345
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,230
bringing shame to his brother
and the whole family.

346
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,720
Life was unbearably hard for him.

347
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,880
But those very hardships

348
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,270
shaped the man he would one day become.

349
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,840
It was his tireless diligence

350
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,890
and his cautious restraint

351
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,130
that led him to a high rank,

352
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,420
with power that swayed the realm.

353
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,270
Everyone claimed he was ambitious,

354
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,640
but I knew he wasn't.

355
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,790
From the moment he set foot in Chang'an,

356
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,000
all he ever wanted was to survive.

357
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,420
Now, I too have come to Chang'an.

358
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,920
This was where his fate began,

359
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
and where mine begins as well.

360
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,960
I am Wang Heng.

361
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,480
I have been waiting here
for you for quite some time.

362
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,670
Young man.

363
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,670
Come back to Chang'an with me tonight.
