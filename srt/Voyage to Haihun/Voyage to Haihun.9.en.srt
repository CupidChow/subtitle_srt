=Episode 9=

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Hey.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,640
Two things. First...

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,480
De Jiu is gone.

33
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,330
What?

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,640
She and Master tricked me
out of tuition,

35
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,230
then held me hostage, and just left?

36
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,740
Don't you want to be a wandering hero?

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,570
- You...
- Wandering heroes are like this.

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,960
Second thing,

39
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,680
Lord Gong says there will be an exam?

40
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,710
Duke, don't worry.

41
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,330
- The exam
- The exam?

42
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,040
is just a show
for the people of Chang'an.

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,590
Besides, every man here is gifted.

44
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,400
Shouldn't we let
the people of Chang'an see that?

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,280
Gifted.

46
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,790
An exam is enough to prove it?

47
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,680
Of course.

48
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,560
Aren't I the examiner?

49
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,920
When the time comes,

50
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,590
I'll set the questions nice and easy.

51
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,850
The scores would naturally soar.

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
The fairness of the exam

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,280
is just to silence the court.

54
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,450
You understand?

55
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,830
Yes.

56
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,820
I'll go prepare the questions.

57
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,150
Wait for my word.

58
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,270
Thanks.

59
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,550
Duke.

60
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
How's it going?

61
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,940
No need to ask that.

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,520
Wang Heng is the examiner.

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,890
How could there be any problem?

64
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,280
I've taken care of everything.

65
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,630
Oh.

66
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,140
(Longshan Inn, Examination Area)

67
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,120
Mathematics problems.

68
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,430
A cage holds both chickens and rabbits.

69
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,560
Look up,

70
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,680
and you see 35 heads.

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Look down,

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,710
and you see 94 feet.

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
How many chickens

74
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,000
and how many rabbits are there?

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,870
These fowl and livestock
do reflect daily life,

76
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,820
but such rustic puzzles

77
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,270
hardly match the grand strategies
of the realm.

78
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,590
Logic problems.

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,750
There are four officials:
A, B, C, and D.

80
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,910
Each comes from a different county.

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,240
Here are four statements about them.

82
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,630
Only two of them are true.

83
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,410
First,

84
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,400
A comes from County A
and performs excellently.

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,350
Second,

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,030
if B is from County B,

87
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,190
then he has made a mistake.

88
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,190
Third,

89
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,180
C has made no mistake

90
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,270
and is not from County C.

91
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,190
Fourth, D is from County D

92
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,310
and performs the worst.

93
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,190
So, among these four statements,

94
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,750
which two are correct?

95
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,830
Lord Wang, please, stop.

96
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,630
I'm all muddled now.

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,080
Though an official must always discern
right from wrong,

98
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,840
this puzzle...

99
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,870
I understand.

100
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,530
Logic questions don't concern the realm.

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,320
Alright, fine.

102
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,710
Let me handle it instead.

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,910
Much obliged to you.

104
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,580
Why can't I go in?

105
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,200
Ignore him; keep writing.

106
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,120
Forgive me, Duke.

107
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,520
Lord Wang has given instructions.

108
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,750
This exam concerns
the selection of talents.

109
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,430
It must be treated with utmost secrecy.

110
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,680
So, when setting the questions,

111
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,780
the one drafting them
must be kept in isolation.

112
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,270
No contact with outsiders is allowed.

113
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,120
That won't do.

114
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
I must see Wang Heng.

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,710
Wang Heng, I know you're inside.

116
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,400
You shameless rascal.

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Take it back.

118
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
Lord Wang.

119
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,360
The exam papers are ready.

120
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,270
Very well, thanks, Lord Gong.

- Bushi.
- Alright.

129

130
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
This is...

131
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,630
Why is it so much smaller?

132
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,020
Why is your font so big?

133
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Just make do.

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,560
It's all the same.

135
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,220
Fine.

136
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
Impressive, Duke.

137
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,870
Should we memorize it all?

138
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Yeah.

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,130
What kind of scribbles are these?

140
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,430
What's this fork-shaped mark
supposed to mean?

141
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,270
Fork-shaped mark?

142
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,720
There are 23 chickens

143
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,150
and 12 rabbits.

144
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,240
You don't get it?

145
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,560
Yeah.

146
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,950
Well.

147
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,630
There are 23 chickens

148
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,750
and 12 rabbits.

149
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,000
Come on.

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,080
Has your family ever raised
chickens or rabbits?

151
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,240
Oh.

152
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,750
Why don't we just memorize them?

153
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,070
No need to overthink it.

154
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,690

159
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,360
present your badge and exam permit

160
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,830
to the examiner for verification.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,680

Then receive an inspection.

Examinees must undergo the checks.

163
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,240

into the exam room.

164

If you already have them,

165
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,560
you must place them
in the small belongings storage area.

166

you may proceed to the exam room.

Hey.

173
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,810
- Hey, Duke.
- How did it go?

174
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,830
All good.

175
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,950
- You?
- All good.

176
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,800
And you?

177
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,680
Let's go.

178
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,790
Hey.

179
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,640
Why are you going in there?

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
You go in first.

181
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,800
It's alright.

182
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
Come on, let's go.

183
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,480
When you were reading it seriously,

184
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,870
your voice sounded wonderful.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,870
Come back here.

00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,230
Move aside.

190
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,830
(Longshan Inn)
Please, Duke.

191
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,070
Come on, you can do it!

192
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,750
The bamboo slips are sealed.

193
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,040
(Examination Paper Seal)

194
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,980
(B)

195
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,980
(B)

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,840
This is Test Paper B.

197
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,390
This session is a listening test.

198
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,700
Examinees,
please listen to the question.

199
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,150
Question one.

200
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,200
Wang Heng.

201
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,390
What is the way to secure
the nation's army?

202
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,150
Second question.

203
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,600
Wan Zhang asked:

204
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,030
Baili Xi sold himself to a Qin merchant
for five sheep skins

205
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,270
to feed the cattle for the trust
of Duke Mu of Qin.

206
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,440
Question:

207
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,200
What guidance have you got
on such matters today?

208
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,200
You impudent brat.

209
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,220
(Examination Paper Seal)

210
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,300
(A)

211
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,420
(B)

212
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,090
The exam begins.

213
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,240
Test Paper A and Test Paper B

214
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,270
are among the effective ways
to prevent cheating.

215
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,670
In emergencies,
the spare Test Paper B will be used.

216
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,600
This ensures
absolute foolproof security.

217
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,910
Think carefully.

218
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
Li Qi.

219
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,560
Yes?

220
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,290
What does it mean?

221
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,080
Focus.

222
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
Qingge.

223
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,120
Qingge.

224
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,630
Go back.

225
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,330
What are you looking at?

226
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,370
What are you staring at?

227
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,910
Keep writing.

228
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,440
The exam is over.

229
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,220
Collect the papers.

230
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
Hey.

231
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,080
Lord Wang,
can the confinement be lifted now?

232
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,780
The confinement

233
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,720
for question setters lasts
until the exam ends.

234
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,510
It's the custom in my hometown.

235
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,350
Thanks, Lord Gong.

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,520
Thanks, Reviewer.

237
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,700
We have both worked hard.

238
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,880
I shall take my leave.

239
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,920
Take care.

240
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,640
May I enter this time?

241
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,600
I know you're angry.

242
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,960
But in time, you'll understand

243
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,790
that it was for your good.

244
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,000
All I know is that what you did

245
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,000
is not something a brother should do.

246
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,230
Duke.

247
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,230
This is the list of those
who passed the exam.

248
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,550
These are

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,320
the results from yesterday.

250
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,960
Apart from those whose names are read,

251
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:45,990
everyone else...

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Duke, this...

253
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,180
The rest have passed the assessment.

254
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,000
Do you know what you're doing?

255
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,150
I poured my heart
into planning this exam,

256
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,000
all because...

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
For the sake of brotherhood,
I'll spare you once.

258
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,320
But I will not tolerate you
provoking me without restraint.

259
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,780
Lord Gong, say something.

260
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,670
Lord Gong.

261
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,550
Don't you enjoy being confined?

262
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,750
Lock Wang Heng away.

263
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,630
Liu He, have you lost your mind?

264
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,040
Lord Gong.

265
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,790
Lord Gong.

266
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,750
Zhao Han, Wang Wen.

267
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,910
Li Chuang, Wu Jun.

268
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,240
Get inside.

269
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,270
Li Ye, Liu Yudong, Wei Ping.

270
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,150
Yin Xiangwen, Zhang Qian.

271
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,440
Lin Yuankai.

272
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,420
Qian Hongxin.

273
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,070
These fifty will return to Changyi.

274
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
The remaining two hundred,

275
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,200
follow me.

276
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,590
We'll set out

277
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,300
for Chang'an at once.

278
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,830
Great!

279
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,340
(Longshan Inn, Dingtao, Changyi)

280
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,460
(Jiyang)

281
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,500
(Jiyang)

282
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,660
(Jiyang)

283
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,910
Still sulking, are you?

284
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
I'm not as petty as you.

285
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,390
I don't hold grudges.

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,160
Come on, open the door.

287
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,040
Hey.

288
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,510
Heng.

289
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,210
Don't tell me you're getting used
to this prison cart.

290
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,230
Does this give you that much joy?

291
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,950
I only locked you up for a while.

292
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,390
Hardly a big deal.

293
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,600
You know exactly what I mean.

294
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,920
I lead my 200 brothers to share
wealth and glory.

295
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,510
Why wouldn't I be happy?

296
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,870
Happy?

297
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,320
Is that it?

298
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,870
There's no greater joy than this.

299
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,420
But your greater joy will bring harm
to many more lives.

300
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,280
Wang Heng.

301
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,670
You just want to drive away my men

302
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,870
so you can charge ahead alone

303
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,710
and claim the Qilin?

304
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,750
If all of your men

305
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,630
were to die in Chang'an,

306
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,180
would you still be pleased?

307
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,860
I merely saw through your scheme,

308
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,910
yet you cursed my men

309
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,440
only for the Qilin?

310
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,320
Listen.

311
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,840
This is no curse.

312
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,080
It's the Mandate of Heaven.

313
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,600
All of these men but you

314
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,600
will die

315
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,640
because of you.

316
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,790
Wang, come on.

317
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,080
(Chamberlain Gong
admonished the Duke)

318
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
(and had over 50 sent back.)

319
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,440
(The process was altered,)

320
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,010
(yet the outcome remained the same.)

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,820
