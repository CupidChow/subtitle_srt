30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,790
Insolent commoner.

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,310
This is Chang'an Envoy's turf.

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,260
(Huo)

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,120
I have urgent matters to report.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,950
- Inform them at once.
- Yes.

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,760
I'll take only six men to Chang'an.

36
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,870
Isn't six men too few?

37
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,790
Too many cause trouble.

38
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,430
They must be the finest.

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,040
I will act with utmost caution

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,240
and bid my time.

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,590
First, I plan to send men

42
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,870
to Chang'an to gauge the situation.

43
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,840
Once we are certain

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,620
nothing can go wrong,

45
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,880
we'll proceed to Chang'an.

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,310
Wang, no...

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,270
Duke.

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,230
You truly carry the bearing of an emperor.

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,280
I will personally decide the candidates.

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,600
Very well.

51
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,910
Lord Gong.

52
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,990
We're exposed.

53
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,360
Ah!

54
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,840
What are you doing?

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
You, come here.

56
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
Got you.

57
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,270
Uh?

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
We seize the rebels of Changyi by order.

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,520
The equine administration

60
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
was in your full charge.

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,240
You conspired with the Duke of Changyi.

62
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
I truly have no idea.

63
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,680
Speak.

64
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,960
Where is the Duke?

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,400
Don't you understand me?

66
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Execute.

67
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,210
Still refusing to tell the truth?

68
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,750
I swear, I really don't know.

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,200
Execute again.

70
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,000
Deceiving the Empress Dowager...

71
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,030
Who could answer such a grave matter?

72
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,600
Foolish Liu He fled on his own.

73
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,850
What's that got to do with us?

74
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,800
Continue the execution.

75
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
Wait!

76
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,630
This was planned by me alone.

77
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,630
I will bear the full responsibility.

78
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,200
As for where the Duke has gone,

79
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,520
we truly have no knowledge.

80
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,150
We acted only

81
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,740
out of desperation and fear.

82
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,120
So we had to take this desperate step.

83
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,560
Cut them all down!

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,800
I'll fight you to the end!

85
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,060
(June 11, 74 BC)

86
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,140
(June 10, 74 BC)

87
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,000
Wang?

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,310
Why is it you?

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Giddy-up!

90
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,470
Where's the Duke?

91
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,310
Duke?

92
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,560
Where's Qi Chang?

93
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,080
He said he went to find you first.

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Is he out of his mind?

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,120
Let me in.

96
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,000
Let me through.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,870
Don't push.

98
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,320
This is bad.

99
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,360
Make way.

100
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,430
Step aside.

101
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,670
- Don't push.
- Make some room.

102
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,410
- Step aside.
- Who's pushing?

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,030
Mr. Qi, hurry over!

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,330
Stop shoving, easy there.

105
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,610
Clear the way.

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,160
What's wrong with you?

107
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,130
You're bumping into me.

108
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,300
Watch the road.

109
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,010
Don't hit my face.

110
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm aiming right at you.

111
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,110
You're Qi Chang?

112
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,970
You're Liu He, yes?

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,880
You think people are playthings, huh?

114
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,800
First,

115
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,780
you're Liu He. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

116
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,630
Second, you had me compete
in your place,

117
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,470
while you escaped.

118
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,160
Aren't these enough for a beating?

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
Yes.

120
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,440
I didn't tell you who I was.

121
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,800
But have I not told you,

122
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,310
as long as you stay by my side,

123
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,430
we could journey to Chang'an.

124
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,940
You don't believe me.

125
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,080
Besides,

126
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,580
if I had revealed my true identity,

127
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,680
what if you betrayed me?

128
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,720
Betray you? Over what?

129
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,720
That's not a secret.

130
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,120
The Duke would grant titles and rewards?

131
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,720
You'd sneak me into the horse race?

132
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,430
If you just ran off, what about me?

133
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
Calm down for a moment.

134
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,240
I truly planned to run away with you.

135
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,680
How about this,

136
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
we leave right now.

137
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,950
Stand right there.

138
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,230
Hold your ground.

139
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,590
Heng,

140
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,030
what are you doing?

141
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,410
To keep an eye on you.

142
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,510
Don't think about leaving.

143
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,710
Why not?

144
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,920
The first time we met,

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,270
what did you call me?

146
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,260
Immortal.

147
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,680
I, the Immortal, will tell you,

148
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,270
the imperial decree will arrive today.

149
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,530
You can head to Chang'an openly.

150
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,670
What do you mean?

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
You…

152
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,040
will become the Emperor.

153
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,390
Me?

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Exactly.

155
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,590
You.

156
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,600
Once you're Emperor and in Chang'an,

157
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,720
surely you can reclaim the Qilin.

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,230
I've heard Duke of Guangling

159
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,770
(Advisor Wang Bingji;
Minister Liu De)

160
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,120
gave much money to Huo Guang.

161
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,920
In the end, it might all be for nothing.

162
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,620
See, you don't know this part.

163
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,640
His wife accepted the money.

164
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,000
When he got back,
he scolded her fiercely.

165
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,360
If you accept this gift,

166
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,560
it could all become

167
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,850
a disaster that costs your life.

168
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,910
Up ahead is Changyi.

169
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,190
What a lively place.

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,190
Great!

171
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,510
Qi.

172
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,480
Stop acting.

173
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,270
I already know everything.

174
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,270
You must've let it slip.

175
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,390
I'll deal with you.

176
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,430
The imperial decree has arrived!

177
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,620
(June, 74 BC;
Fourth Month, Yuanping Year 1)

178
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,680
(Ban Gu)

179
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,920
(recorded in Biography
of Huo Guang, Book of Han,)

180
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,650
(that Emperor Zhao of Han
passed away early,)

181
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
(leaving no heir.)

182
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,810
(Minister Chang and others discussed,)

183
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,860
(upon the Book of Rites,)

184
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,560
(one who inherits becomes his son.)

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,750
Liu He, receive the decree.

186
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,270
(Duke of Changyi inherits the throne.)

187
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,600
(Minister of Imperial Clan, Grand Herald,)

188
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,120
(Imperial Advisor, Imperial Envoy summons
the Duke of Changyi to handle the funeral.)

189
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,950
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,

190
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,070
- (grandson of Emperor Wu of Han and Lady Li)
- An imperial edict is issued:

191
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,290
- (once little noticed by others,)
- The acting Grand Herald Yuecheng,

192
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,010
- (now,)
- Minister Liu De,

193
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,490
- (due to the support of Great General)
- Advisor Wang,

194
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,380
- (Huo Guang)
- Imperial Guard Commander Li Han,

195
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,820
- (will rise to the throne.)
- will escort you to Chang'an.

196
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,020
(It truly took everyone by surprise.)

197
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,760
(Even Liu He himself didn't expect)

198
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,860
Liu He, receive the decree.

199
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,900
(that his fate)

200
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,750
(had changed dramatically
in just a heartbeat.)

201
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,460
(Huo Mansion)

202
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,340
(Duke of Zhou Assists Young King Cheng)

203
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,320
Great General.

204
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,410
Duke of Changyi should already be on his way.

205
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,590
(Minister of Agriculture Tian Yannian)
The imperial edict just arrived.

206
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,120
The Duke will set out tomorrow.

207
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,080
Just arrived?

208
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,990
Matters of state must not be delayed.

209
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Please be at ease.

210
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,870
I will hasten his departure at once.

211
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,510
And what of the Bronze Qilin?

212
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,750
Reporting, my lord,

213
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,270
it has been completed.

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,080
Those who once hunted the Qilin's trail

215
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,120
have all been dealt with

216
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,200
according to your will.

217
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,670
So no troubles remain.

218
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,170
With the Duke losing the Qilin,

219
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,670
he will stand weak and alone.

220
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,120
When the time comes, the realm

221
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,670
will be yours alone to command.

222
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,450
Insolence!

223
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,200
Qilin's blessing is just an illusion.

224
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,630
It's merely a rumor from the streets.

225
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,360
Retrieve it only to guard

226
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,600
against traitors with ill intent.

227
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,320
Yes.

228
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,320
Report to the Duke.

229
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,580
(Duke of Guangling's Mansion)

230
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,260
A message about Changyi.

231
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,440
It's urgent, please decide at once, Duke.

232
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,820
(Duke of Guangling, Liu Xu)

233
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,600
The assassination attempt failed,

234
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,510
and the decree from Chang'an arrived.

235
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,670
Useless lot.

236
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,460
(Qingge Tavern)

237
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,600
First, you beat up
the future Emperor of Han.

238
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,700
And now you've shut him out at the door.

239
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,700
By law, I could sentence you to death.

240
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,240
I know you're still upset.

241
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,240
Can't I at least offer an apology?

242
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,630
I come from a powerful family.

243
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,510
Most people befriended me for power.

244
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,120
The books say
there are three kinds of true friends:

245
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,870
Honest,

246
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,080
understanding,

247
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,780
and knowledgeable.

248
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,030
But I hadn't met any kind.

249
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,360
Not until I met you.

250
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,690
I met all three at once.

251
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,030
I feared that
once you learned my identity,

252
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,720
you wouldn't treat me with sincerity.

253
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,360
And I'd lose my most treasured friend.

254
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,390
Heng,

255
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,790
I've brought you a gift.

256
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,840
Whether I was Qi Chang before,

257
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,430
or Liu He now,

258
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,750
I will journey with you to Chang'an.

259
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,600
I'll come for you tomorrow.

260
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,270
I'll leave this gift here.

261
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,600
Tomorrow, I'll tell you its meaning.

262
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,030
Then I'll be on my way.

263
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,590
What are you doing?

264
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,920
Why bring me here?

265
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,780
Don't move.

266
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,910
- Qingge.
- Stay still.

267
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,750
Qing...

268
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,490
Who covered my eyes?

269
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
What are you doing?

270
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,030
You madman, let go.

271
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,270
Are you out of your mind?

272
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,920
- Don't move.
- Let me go!

273
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,200
- Alright.
- Liu He!

274
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,270
Everyone, get away.

275
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,200
Going to war requires a sacrifice.

276
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,870
And you, an insolent commoner,

277
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,120
relying on a bit of talent,

278
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,440
you struck me.

279
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,010
- Don't move.
- And struck me twice.

280
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,110
- Lunatic.
- This...

281
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,790
is what becomes of you.

282
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,670
You took advantage of me
and cast me aside.

283
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,350
Fatuous ruler, let me go right now.

284
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,750
- Insulting me?
- Hurling insults.

285
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,150
Such behavior must be punished.

286
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,080
I am the Qilin Immortal.

287
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
If you sacrifice me,

288
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,770
are you not afraid
of divine retribution?

289
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,800
Not at all.

290
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,980
Sacrificing you will only help

291
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,670
your soul returns to the heavens soon.

292
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,710
You can report to our lord,

293
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,050
so that the Great Han may flourish.

294
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,270
Xu Qingge!

295
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,000
Are you siding with them in this mess?

296
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,180
I think...

297
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,280
the Duke has a point.

298
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,570
We should burn him at once.

299
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,980
I want to go home.

300
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,620
Untie me, come on.

301
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,180
You're really setting it on fire?

302
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,080
Help me!

303
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,990
Shh.

304
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Let me go!

305
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,970
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

306
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,150
Come on, over here.

307
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,510
Release me.

308
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,970
- Help!
- Look at him.

309
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,750
Heng.

310
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,610
I prepared this Bonfire Banquet for you.

311
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,100
Surprised?

312
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,130
Not expecting this, right?

313
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,600
Are you all out of your minds?

314
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,820
Today is special.

315
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,080
I can go to Chang'an.

316
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,790
That's the first joy.

317
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Qingge took first place,

318
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,270
first horsemanship in Changyi.

319
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,750
That's the second joy.

320
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,010
Heng survived the ordeal.

321
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,050
That's the third joy.

322
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,630
As the saying goes,

323
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,480
triple blessings arrive.

324
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,750
Shall we drink to our heart's content

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,990
and keep drinking till dawn?

326
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,330
Drink!

327
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,480
Just to round things off.

328
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,690
You don't have to stage a raid.

329
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,590
Hey,

330
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,840
yes, we have to.

331
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,150
Without the depth of great sorrow,

332
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,320
how could joy strike so suddenly?

333
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,560
Wang.

334
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,180
The Duke is in a playful mood.

335
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,150
Don't take it to heart.

336
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,430
Wang.

337
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,200
Drink, drink, drink.

338
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,120
For your sake,

339
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,750
I'll let it go.

340
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,280
Then...

341
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,960
Once we drain this cup,
we are fellow travelers.

342
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,850
Fellow traveler.

343
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,370
Cheers.

344
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,800
Drink.

345
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,710
I'm not drunk.

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,870
Can't sleep, huh?

347
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,080
You either.

348
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,920
Alas.

349
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,370
Come with me.

350
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Uh.

351
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,960
Where are we going?

352
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,320
Horseback riding.

353
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,970
That's riding after drinking.

354
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
Riding after drinking.

355
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,350
That's when it's fun.

356
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,960
What are you staring at?

357
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,670
The view here in Changyi

358
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,990
is quite unique.

359
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,440
Unique?

360
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,390
It's just so-so.

361
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,600
You should be content.

362
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,390
The whole of Changyi is your home.

363
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,960
Eh,

364
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,080
what about your home?

365
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
How is it?

366
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,320
My home?

367
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,030
It's nothing special.

368
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,550
The home of an Immortal…

369
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,990
Isn't that basically a fairyland?

370
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,160
Come on, tell me.

371
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,480
My house

372
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,480
is several times taller than

373
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,550
the tallest building here.

374
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,160
When night falls,

375
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,130
the whole city is lit up like day.

376
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,490
So bright that you can't see stars.

377
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,000
Carriages don't need horses.

378
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,390
They move on their own.

379
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
We will go to Chang'an

380
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
by plane.

381
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,510
It'd only take an hour.

382
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,400
In just one hour?

383
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,530
What's a plane?

384
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,480
It's a type of transport.

385
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,110
It can carry people

386
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,240
and soar to the skies.

387
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,000
Sounds like a fairyland.

388
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,440
Then take me to see it.

389
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,680
Once we reach Chang'an

390
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,100
and I secure the Qilin,

391
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,830
only then can I return.

392
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,520
When that time comes,

393
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,070
I'll decide to take you along or not.

394
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,880
If you go back on your own,

395
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,440
how am I supposed to make my wish?

396
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,300
You're already the Emperor.

397
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,310
Is there any wish you can't fulfill?

398
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,350
Even as the Emperor,

399
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,960
I can't fulfill every wish.

400
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,480
What is it you wish for?

401
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,590
If it were possible,

402
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,590
I want to roam the land.

403
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,640
With the sky as my curtain and earth as seat,

404
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,680
graceful melodies flow,

405
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,590
kindred spirits gather,

406
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,680
wine in hand,

407
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm free,

408
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,310
