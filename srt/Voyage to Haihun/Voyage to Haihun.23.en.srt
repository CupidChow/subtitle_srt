(Huo Mansion)

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,170
(Huo Mansion)

32
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,040
Today,

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,140
our hunt outside the Palace

34
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,520
is not only to display

35
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,150
the valor of the men of Han

36
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,760
but also to safeguard the peace
and stability of the realm.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,010
You must stay vigilant at all times,

38
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,300
protect His Majesty without fail,

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,820
and ensure that nothing goes amiss

40
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,090
on this hunt.

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,430
Yes.

42
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,730
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

43
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,070
Your Majesty.

44
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,150
A minister is plotting treason.

45
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,000
Rest assured.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Xiahou.

47
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,650
I'm well aware.

48
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,380
Just stay in the Palace.

49
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,340
Wait for my triumphant return.

50
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,370
Farewell, Your Majesty.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
Set out.

52
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,520
Gentlemen.

53
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,710
Regarding recent matters
about His Majesty,

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
I trust you've all heard some of it.

55
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,420
It's been nearly a month
since His Majesty ascended the throne.

56
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
Yet,

57
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,630
his conduct has been muddled and unwise,

58
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,420
showing no regard for laws or rituals.

59
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,580
In my opinion,

60
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,570
he is not fit to shoulder the burden

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,710
of safeguarding the Han.

62
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,440
Gentlemen.

63
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,200
Do you agree with this?

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,870
His Majesty has indeed acted recklessly.

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,980
Gentlemen.

66
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,750
Since ancient times,

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,190
young Emperors,

68
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,400
without strict guidance,

69
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,430
often show improper conduct.

70
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,430
As his ministers,

71
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,560
we must risk our lives to advise him,

72
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,150
reason with him earnestly,

73
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,240
and move him with sincerity.

74
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,750
Even a child can be taught.

75
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,470
How much more so a ruler?

76
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,910
The sovereign

77
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,910
is the master of all under heaven,

78
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,360
holding the rank of supremacy,

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,460
standing above all people.

80
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,960
As his subjects,
how could we lecture him at will?

81
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,120
If someone must guide him,

82
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,320
none would be more fitting
than Great General Huo.

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
What Lord Fan says is true.

84
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,800
Great General Huo
has given his all for the Han.

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,340
Who can stand on equal ground with him?

86
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,110
Moreover, Lord Huo supported His Majesty

87
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,580
to ascend the throne.

88
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,950
His Majesty is still young,

89
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,030
and Lord Huo has the right
to guide and nurture him.

90
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,470
Now,

91
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,640
the Court

92
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,000
is clouded with chaos and discord,

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,720
and the realm stands
on the brink of ruin.

94
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,570
As descendants

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,870
receiving imperial grace,

96
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,120
we hold lofty ranks

97
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,630
to safeguard the realm
for generations to come.

98
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,800
If the Han's foundation

99
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,130
should now collapse,

100
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,370
how could we still face the late Emperor

101
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,100
in the afterlife?

102
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
Today,

103
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,890
we must make a decision.

104
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,000
Those who refuse or respond last

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,980
must not blame me

106
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,730
for showing no mercy.

107
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,590
Lord Huo,

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,160
we've all given our utmost for the Han.

109
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,680
If we wish to secure the realm,

110
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,050
we will follow your lead

111
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,070
until we die.

112
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,680
How understanding of Lord Xiahou.

113
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,270
Good.

114
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,830
If you all trust me

115
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,560
and still wish to stand with me,

116
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,930
serving the Han together,

117
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,000
then tonight,

118
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,470
you shall go with me
to the Changle Palace.

119
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,890
We swear to defend the Han to the death!

120
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,590
Let's go.

121
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,430
The Great General did

122
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,730
exactly as Lord Wang

123
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,040
predicted.

124
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,760
So, how should we respond to this?

125
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,350
Follow the old precedent.

126
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,370
We side with whoever wins in the end.

127
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,400
Let's watch and decide later.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Lord Huo.

129
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,200
As for the bandits outside the city...

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,820
Zhang Sheng has taken control
of the armory

131
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,380
and led all troops
to sweep the bandits out.

132
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,760
Wucheng Village will be taken care of.

133
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
Lord Huo,

134
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,090
how should we draft the decree
to depose the Emperor?

135
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,430
We are following proper rites.

136
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,600
Rulers abandoned
by heaven and the people

137
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
have always been those who lost virtue.

138
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,630
We'll word the decree the same way

139
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,560
as the history books portray them.

140
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,070
Besides,
His Majesty has been utterly absurd.

141
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,270
(Having just finished the discussion,)

142
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,480
(Huo Guang, Great General,)

143
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,570
(leading Yang Chang, Prime Minister,
Zhang Anshi, General of the Chariots,)

144
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,220
(Tian Yannian, Minister of Agriculture,)

145
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,760
(Han Zeng, Front General, Zhao Chongguo,
Rear General, and other ministers,)

146
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,360
(headed toward the Changle Palace)

147
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,120
(to invite the Empress Dowager
to take charge.)

148
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,680
(Wucheng Village)
(Meanwhile, the warriors here)

149
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,010
- (also began their move.)
- Warriors, listen.

150
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,330
Today's battle

151
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,850
is not for our own gain, honor, or shame

152
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,760
but to safeguard

153
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,300
the bloodline of Crown Prince Wei.

154
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,160
Despite the shadow
of the witchcraft calamity,

155
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,700
the fire of justice still burns

156
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,120
across the land.

157
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,430
As the former forces
of Crown Prince Wei,

158
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,350
we must repay his past kindness

159
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,560
by seizing this chance

160
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,320
when Liu He is to restore order
in the Court

161
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,090
and help the Crown Prince's grandson,
Liu Bingyi, restore his honor.

162
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,660
Then we can all be free from hardship.

163
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,970
No more hiding to survive.

164
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,300
This chance must not slip away.

165
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,430
- Sure.
- Sure.

166
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,020
Set out.

167
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
- Sure.
- Sure.

168
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,800
- Sure.
- Sure.

169
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,280
Everything will be fine.

170
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,390
I have made up my mind.

171
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,530
Today, Liu He will be deposed.

172
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,610
As you wish,

173
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,120
I will issue the edict
to depose the Emperor.

174
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
Good.

175
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,780
I shall take my leave.

176
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,850
You heard it all.

177
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,960
Your Majesty,

178
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,480
you gave your word...

179
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,060
There is a way to survive in the Palace.

180
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,470
Those who defy it

181
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,960
always die soon in Chang'an.

182
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,950
You and I are like sisters.

183
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,360
Go and tell His Majesty right now.

184
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,340
I won't stop you.

185
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,370
But if you're too late,

186
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,610
and His Majesty returns,

187
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,550
many matters will no longer be
in his hands.

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,840
Father.

189
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,720
Where are you going?

190
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,910
His Majesty is in danger.

191
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,330
You mustn't go anywhere today.

192
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,680
No.

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,000
I must go today.

194
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,180
Have you forgotten
what you promised me before?

195
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,220
Don't go. There's unrest in the Palace.

196
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,630
This is reckless.

197
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,720
Chang'an

198
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,390
is not as simple as you imagine.

199
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,710
Guards.

200
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,400
Escort the lady to the carriage.

201
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,160
This is a fine bow.

202
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,400
We shall return with a full harvest.

203
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,330
- Let's go.
- Sure.

204
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,160
- Wild boar!
- Where?

205
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,030
Right over there.

206
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,310
- Right there.
- Your Majesty.

207
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,870
Huo Yu, won't you join us?

208
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,270
I dare not.

209
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,800
Today, you're my guard.

210
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,740
Come on then.

211
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,200
- Let's go.
- Yes.

212
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,960
We will surely return laden with game.

213
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,990
Hyah!

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,860
Your Majesty.

215
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,840
Did it run this way?

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,220
Why can't I see the wild boar?

217
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,450
Whoa.

218
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,280
Go.

219
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,000
Go! Hurry!

220
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,510
Hey.

221
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,520
How did that wild boar run off so fast?

222
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,140
It's your fault. If you'd ridden faster,
we'd have caught up.

223
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,630
Protect His Majesty!

224
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,930
Who are you people?

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,330
How dare you cause trouble here?

226
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,640
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

227
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,070
Welcome, Your Majesty.

228
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,160
What is it, milord Xiahou?

229
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,590
The civil and military officials

230
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,210
are with Empress Dowager Shangguan.

231
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,680
The Imperial City now stands empty.

232
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,200
The soldiers under Huo Guang's command

233
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,260
have been sent out
for bandit suppression.

234
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,320
This is the perfect moment
to take down Huo Guang.

235
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,000
Go and seize them!

236
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,320
Bandit suppression?

237
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,920
Where to?

238
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,000
I heard it's Wucheng Village.

239
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,110
Wucheng Village?

240
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,360
At last, you are all here.

241
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,560
Zhang Sheng.

242
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,420
Wang Heng.

243
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,930
You plotted with the wandering heroes

244
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,850
to overthrow the Court.

245
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,970
By order of the Great General,
I've come to crush this rebellion.

246
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,360
Great General?

247
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,590
You've pledged allegiance to Huo Guang?

248
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,110
Five years ago,
I was ordered by Lord Huo

249
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
to stay hidden at His Majesty's side.

250
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,060
During that time, I helped you a lot.

251
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,030
If you had acted with righteousness,

252
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,590
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

253
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,710
As it turns out,

254
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,960
you work for Huo Guang all along.

255
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,850
Enough.

256
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,920
You've committed
enough reckless follies.

257
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Those who act so foolishly
never meet a good end.

258
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,510
Look at Chen Shan.

259
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,010
Speaking of which,

260
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,470
- Chen Shan?
- I helped you on that.

261
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,550
Chen Shan is dead?

262
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,610
That's right.

263
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,840
I killed him.

264
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,720
Nothing has changed.

265
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,360
Not a single thing has changed.

266
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,390
You even turned on one of your own.

267
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,200
He acted on his own
and ruined Lord Huo's plans.

268
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,120
He deserved it.

269
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,480
His fate will be yours as well.

270
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,630
Men!

271
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,750
Brothers!

272
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,200
Grab your weapons!

273
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,300
Go!

274
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,200
Li Qi, why is it you?

275
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,190
Zhang Sheng.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,030
Report to Lord Huo!

277
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,580
The people here have been replaced.

278
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,670
Tell Lord Huo to act now.

279
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
Today, we've set a flawless trap.

280
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,680
Victory will be mine.

281
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

282
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,480
200 men from Wucheng Village
have arrived,

283
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,740
ready to follow your command.

284
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,630
Please take care.

285
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,810
I'll lead the brothers ahead.

286
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,670
I'm still worried

287
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,840
about the 200 men of mine.

288
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,960
How about this?

289
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,090
You and De Jiu

290
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,510
escort them to Wucheng Village.

291
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,630
What?

292
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,790
De Jiu.

293
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,170
What do you think?

294
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,120
No.

295
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,240
Our victory hinges on this.

296
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,750
I must go with you.

297
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,980
Wang Heng, De Jiu, receive this decree.

298
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,150
The men from Changyi
matter to the Court.

299
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,960
As the Imperial Censor,

300
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,000
you must try your best

301
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,600
to escort them into Wucheng Village
with De Jiu.

302
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,410
I accept the decree.

303
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,080
I accept the decree.

304
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,570
- Go at once.
- Yes.

305
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,590
Your Majesty.

306
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,840
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

307
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,870
Why not seize the moment
and bring down Huo Guang?

308
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,600
We mustn't.

309
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,210
If we make a move,

310
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,090
our brothers outside the city

311
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,390
will lose their lives.

312
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,240
Your Majesty.

313
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,670
Is there anything more important
than the throne?

314
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,170
If they die for the throne

315
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,550
and the Han,

316
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,580
it will be an honorable death.

317
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,440
All who support you, including me,
have worked for this.

318
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,660
If not for yourself,

319
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,620
then at least think of us.

320
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,600
I'll go speak with Huo Guang.

321
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,680
Everyone can survive this way.

322
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,240
Your Majesty.

323
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,980
All Huo Guang wants is my throne.

324
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
I can't just stand by
and watch everyone die.

325
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,830
If it comes to it, I'll give it to him.

326
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,020
Your Majesty.

327
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,860
What's going on?

328
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,230
Your Majesty.

329
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,520
The Empress Dowager summons you.

330
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,040
Why?

331
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,190
I do not know.

332
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,170
(At this moment, Liu He)

333
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,800
(has realized the Mandate of Heaven
is about to unfold.)

334
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,630
(For the brothers in Wucheng Village,)

335
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,410
(he must go to negotiate.)

336
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,670
(The slowly closing gates)

337
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,830
(also signify)

338
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,760
(his 27-day reign as the Emperor)

339
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,600
(is about to end.)

340
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,520
