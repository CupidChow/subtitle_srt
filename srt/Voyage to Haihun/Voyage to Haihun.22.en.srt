By the Mandate of Heaven,

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,860
longevity and prosperity shall endure.

32
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,430
I am

33
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,120
the very sky above you.

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,630
Long live Your Majesty!

35
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,560
Long live Your Majesty.

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,230
Long live Your Majesty!

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,490
Long live Your Majesty.

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,680
Your Majesty.

39
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,190
Your Majesty.

40
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,020
I'll risk my life to offer counsel.

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,240
Well.

42
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm in high spirits today.

43
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,420
No one will be punished.

44
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,430
Lord Gong.

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,400
Please, take the seat.

46
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,120
Your Majesty,
I'll risk my life to offer counsel.

47
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,630
Fine pleasures and indulgences
are but worldly delights.

48
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,770
They are not matters
that cultivate virtue.

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,000
I beseech Your Majesty
to shun such fleeting splendor

50
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,800
and devote your mind the state affairs,

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,460
so the land may know peace.

52
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,430
Leave!

53
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,590
Lord Gong has spoken.

54
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,360
Leave us.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

56
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,380
Let's go.

57
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,490
Go, go, go.

58
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,430
Get up.

59
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,680
Your Majesty.

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,240
You should trust the officials

61
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,240
of Emperor Zhao.

62
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,400
If you put your trust

63
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,700
in flatterers from Changyi,

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,430
disaster will surely follow.

65
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,360
Please turn misfortune into a blessing

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,520
and drive out the flatterers

67
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,910
from Changyi.

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,470
Though I'm not a flatterer,

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,560
I am still from Changyi,

70
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,800
so I wish to leave

71
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,910
to set an example.

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,060
(Order)

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Your Majesty.

74
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,080
Lord Gong.

75
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,430
What...?

76
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,470
Lord Gong.

77
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,800
It's all to fulfill
your Mandate of Heaven's counsel.

78
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,000
Each morning at first light,

79
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,600
I summon my attendants
into the hall for amusement,

80
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,240
and in the afternoons,
I feast and enjoy music.

81
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,800
Later, I need to approve
the tribute sent by the envoys.

82
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,120
Look at this.

83
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,800
Even Lord Gong is upset.

84
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,640
Lord Gong will surely understand
my well-meaning intentions.

85
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,910
Let's hope so.

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,620
Being a muddle-headed ruler
is no easy task.

87
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,250
It's truly exhausting.

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Tsk.

89
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,660
I'd say you enjoy it.

90
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
If I could,

91
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,680
I'd take a sword
and roam across the land.

92
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,950
Life might be rough, but I'd be free.

93
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,310
Not like now,

94
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,240
acting for show,

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,750
putting on airs.

96
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,310
Being the Emperor

97
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,920
truly is a burden for you.

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Now that you're here,

99
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,720
- have a drink.
- Hey, wait.

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
I came here

101
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,480
to ask you for something.

102
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,620
(Taiji Hall)

103
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,610
Lord Wang, why summon us here?

104
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,720
I only hope you will agree
to one request of mine.

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,000
What might that be?

106
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,870
Huo Guang is monopolizing state affairs

107
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,310
and making decisions without counsel.

108
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,170
I ask you all to stand

109
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,020
with me to remove Huo Guang from power.

110
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
What?

111
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,800
You must have lost your mind.

112
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,970
These bamboo slips here

113
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,870
record all the wrongs

114
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,830
you've committed.

115
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,870
I think you know whose names

116
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,120
appear in these records.

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,760
Waving around bamboo slips

118
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,540
and expecting us to move
against Lord Huo?

119
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,600
Are you crazy?

120
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,310
You are Sun Wu, Lord Sun, right?

121
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,190
Exactly.

122
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,330
You seized land by force

123
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,830
and made 400,000 qian in one stroke.

124
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,390
When your subordinates got into trouble,

125
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,290
you immediately demanded
500 in gold from them.

126
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,210
Your rank isn't high,

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,850
but your nerve is remarkable.

128
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,070
You have no proof or witness.

129
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,950
You're slandering me!

130
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,610
I even know
where you've hidden your gold.

131
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,040
Shall I take you there right now

132
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,610
so we can catch you red-handed?

133
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Who else here

134
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,190
wants their disgraceful deeds exposed?

135
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,270
Listen:

136
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,190
I know what each of you has done

137
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,830
and what Huo Guang

138
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,870
ordered you to do.

139
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,370
Prime Minister Yang,

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,010
do you think playing it safe
will keep you clear of the storm?

141
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,040
Let me tell you this.

142
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,630
To depose the Emperor,
you'll be the first Huo Guang seeks out.

143
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,650
Tian Yannian will come to ask you

144
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,680
about your opinion
on choosing another ruler.

145
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,310
And your wife will surely urge you

146
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,980
to follow Huo Guang's arrangements

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,680
to make you one of Huo Guang's allies.

148
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,920
Everything I've done is for the realm.

149
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,590
As for the rest of you,

150
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,590
Huo Guang

151
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,270
will win you over, one by one.

152
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,340
Tian Yannian will drive
a sharp sword into the floor

153
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,180
and tell you

154
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,750
that the state comes first,

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
and your high status

156
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,990
is for the eternal stability
of the realm.

157
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,120
Finally, he'll threaten you

158
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,410
that if anyone refuses to answer
or hesitates until the end,

159
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,140
he will show no mercy.

160
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,770
Is that for real?

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,190
(Xiahou Sheng, Imperial Advisor)
What do you want us to do?

162
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,180
You need not do anything at all.

163
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,430
Why summon us here?

164
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,440
We already have a flawless plan.

165
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,780
As long as you do not side
with Huo Guang,

166
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,120
I will not trouble any of you.

167
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,640
These bamboo slips

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,100
will be delivered to your residence.

169
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,710
Let us pretend

170
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,770
this has never happened.

171
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,750
In days to come,

172
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,680
all of you need only
give your full support

173
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,980
to the new Emperor.

174
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,600
Lord Xiahou.

175
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,750
Lord Xiahou.

176
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,090
Please, wait a moment.

177
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,610
I have something to discuss with you.

178
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,110
Sure.

179
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,740
(Weiyang Palace)

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
Well.

181
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,210
Lord Huo, you're here.

182
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,240
Your Majesty summoned me.

183
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,040
Though I've long been bedridden,

184
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,750
I must still come to pay my respects.

185
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,510
I hear the hunting grounds are home
to many rare and wondrous beasts.

186
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,840
I've yearned to ride freely
since childhood,

187
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,410
chasing the thrill of the wild hunt.

188
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,050
But ever since I ascended the throne,

189
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,400
I've been trapped within these walls.

190
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,000
It has grown unbearably dull.

191
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,370
I wish to leave the city tomorrow
for a hunt.

192
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,290
Your Majesty is the Emperor.

193
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,550
If you wish to go, then go.

194
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,510
I no longer meddle
in great affairs of state,

195
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,030
let alone in such trifles.

196
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,910
If I were to leave the city,

197
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,910
wouldn't I need your approval?

198
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,630
Oh.

199
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,600
Please forgive me.

200
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,000
A drawn bow without a shot

201
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,870
will miss the right moment.

202
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,230
That is merely a humble insight from me.

203
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
Your Majesty is the Emperor.

204
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,470
Tomorrow's hunt

205
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,750
will surely display your grace.

206
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,200
So,

207
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,280
you've agreed, then?

208
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,320
I shall send my son, Huo Yu,
to accompany you.

209
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
He is skilled
in both riding and archery.

210
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,960
He will ensure your safety.

211
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,060
(Yunguang Hall)

212
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,920
Huo Yu?

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
It's okay.

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,870
Tomorrow, we will lead him
deep into the forest

215
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,960
and take care of him there.

216
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,110
At the critical place,

217
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,380
warriors from Wucheng Village
will wait there tomorrow.

218
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,280
(Hunting grounds)

219
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,320
We must not delay.

220
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,300
(Huo Mansion)

221
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,750
Father.

222
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,080
Stop hesitating.

223
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,470
The Emperor is corrupt and incompetent.

224
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,670
He's even replaced the tokens.

225
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,030
It's clear he means to oppose you.

226
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,480
We can still mend the pen

227
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
after the sheep are lost.

228
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,150
Since you once supported
the new Emperor,

229
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,160
why not report early

230
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,790
to Empress Dowager Shangguan

231
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,080
and choose a worthier ruler now?

232
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,570
His Majesty hasn't paid respects
at the ancestral temple.

233
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
Such a matter is of grave importance.

234
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,970
Since ancient times,

235
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,630
in every dynasty before,

236
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,150
the ruler has always been
the one guiding his ministers.

237
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,320
As ministers, we only assist.

238
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,120
How can we depose our sovereign?

239
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,490
That's ridiculous.

240
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,250
What if I say there is precedent
for this?

241
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,820
And they were praised
by later generations.

242
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,000
Is there indeed such a precedent?

243
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,290
To be a ruler,

244
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,590
one must be wise and capable.

245
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,700
Back in the Shang Dynasty,

246
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,800
King Tai Jia of Shang
was foolish and unprincipled.

247
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,340
The Prime Minister Yi Yin
acted decisively and exiled Tai Jia.

248
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,080
Thus, the nation was preserved.

249
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,900
Later generations praise his loyalty

250
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,080
and wisdom.

251
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,290
How could that be ridiculous?

252
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,030
If you could show such resolve,

253
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,640
your name would surely shine in history.

254
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,700
You would be the Yi Yin of the Han.

255
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,600
Great General,

256
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,390
you bear the solemn trust of Emperor Wu.

257
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,940
It is your duty to safeguard the realm.

258
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,900
If we let His Majesty
carry on like this,

259
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,260
we would fail the trust
of all the late Emperors.

260
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,080
We can hesitate no longer.

261
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,840
Milord, you can't hesitate any longer.

262
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,530
Father, there's no time to hesitate.

263
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,990
(A sudden clarity
fills Huo Guang's mind.)

264
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,150
(Since there's a precedent
from past dynasties,)

265
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,610
(he feels no more restraint.)

266
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,880
(Yi Yin)

267
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,850
(is a famed minister of the Shang.)

268
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,080
(When Emperor Tai Jia
failed to govern with virtue)

269
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,680
(and ruled with foolish cruelty,)

270
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,690
(Yi Yin deposed Tai Jia)

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,750
(and assumed regency in his stead.)

272
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,710
Late Emperor,

273
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,120
I've failed you.

274
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,630
I misjudged his true nature.

275
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,350
I have not lived up to your trust.

276
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,110
For the realm of the Han,

277
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,890
there is only one choice now

278
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,100
to make amends

279
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,200
and restore order.

280
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,960
Generals.

281
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,080
His Majesty will hunt
with the Changyi officials tomorrow.

282
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,620
This could be our chance to act.

283
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,950
In the dead of the night,

284
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,440
all is quiet and well.

285
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,440
In the dead of the night,

286
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,970
all is quiet and well.

287
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,300
(Yang Mansion)

288
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,180
(Huo)

289
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,170
Milord, milord!

290
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,630
Prime Minister.

291
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,100
I did not expect Lord Tian

292
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,580
to arrive here in the dead of night.

293
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,120
To what do I owe the honor?

294
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,670
Prime Minister.

295
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,960
Are you aware of the recent debates
in the court?

296
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,320
I have been

297
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,510
bedridden.

298
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,960
I am not well-versed

299
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,360
in matters of the court.

300
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,000
Since His Majesty ascended the throne,

301
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,920
he's acted ridiculously

302
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,270
and lived in reckless indulgence.

303
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,770
Prime Minister, are you aware of this?

304
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,280
I have heard some whispers.

305
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,480
As the sovereign,

306
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,360
he should be strict with himself.

307
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,960
When the late Emperor passed away,

308
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
General Huo

309
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,030
supported His Majesty.

310
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,720
Since His Majesty
has sunk into indulgence,

311
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,600
Lord Huo intends to make amends

312
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,820
by choosing another ruler.

313
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
Prime Minister,

314
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,510
what do you think?

315
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,200
I have recently fallen slightly ill

316
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,000
and must rest at home for a few days.

317
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,200
Once I've recovered,

318
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,000
I will certainly attend court
to look into it.

319
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,600
Then may you rest well

320
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,270
and avoid any strain or worry.

321
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,560
It's getting late.

322
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,190
I shall take my leave.

323
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,230
Please take care.

324
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,260
This must be handled
with utmost caution.

325
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,150
We'll follow
whatever the Great General decides.

326
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,600
Oh, my.

327
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,260
A charge of deceiving the Emperor

328
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,790
means your entire clan
could be executed.

329
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
It's a grave crime.

330
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,000
But now,

331
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,330
the Great General

332
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,600
has yet to come in person.

333
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,760
He merely sent Tian
to deliver a message.

334
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,280
Do you think he wanted you to decide?

335
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,240
It's just to warn you

336
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,200
to make thorough preparations

337
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,750
and choose your side early.

338
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,120
If you choose the wrong side,

339
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,670
and the Great General succeeds,

340
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,690
it will be the day your head falls.

341
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,360
Lord Huo.

342
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,510
I've looked

343
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,120
into Wucheng Village.

344
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,110
Speak.

345
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,450
Inside Wucheng Village,

346
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,000
there are many unknown wandering heroes.

347
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,480
Their numbers are considerable.

348
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,890
And their martial skills are great.

349
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,440
It's likely some wanted criminals
of the court are among them.

350
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,350
De Jiu is closely connected
with these people.

351
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,270
Uncle.

352
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,460
Much obliged to the heroes.

353
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,840
Our success hinges on this.

354
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,480
More importantly...

355
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,660
Wang Heng is also connected
to them, right?

356
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,080
Yes.

357
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
I fear...

358
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,840
We can't allow them to live anymore.

359
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,510
I'm willing to rule the bandits out.

360
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,350
Good.

361
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,510
Wait for my command.
