=Episode 21=

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,180
(Huo Mansion)

31
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,070
You've grown more timid with age.

32
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,270
Besides,

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
that young lad was your choice.

34
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,310
And now?

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,590
He's climbed over your head.

36
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,000
You hide at home all day,

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,230
not daring to utter a word.

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
I told you before.

39
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,280
You never should've chosen him.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,790
If not him, then who?

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,230
The Duke of Guangling?

42
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,470
You think it's easy to accept
the Duke of Guangling's gift?

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,430
Just for a small gain like that.

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,280
When the time comes,

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,720
the entire family
will be dragged down by you.

46
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,510
So short-sighted.

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,520
Hey.

48
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,540
Then give me a wise man's view.

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,240
Stop right there.

50
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,040
Always walking away from a fight.

51
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,260
Is that your way of solving things?

52
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,750
Besides,
you don't even believe in the Qilin.

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,380
Why keep chasing after those spells?

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm only praying for everyone's safety.

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,280
You've made me half believe it now.

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,580
If I die,

57
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,490
the Huo Clan
will surely face a reckoning.

58
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,740
Report! The four generals have arrived.

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Leave us.

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Lord Huo.

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
Generals, what brings you here?

62
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,800
Lord Huo,
the court is in utter chaos now.

63
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
We scarcely dare to breathe.

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
One wrong word, and we're scolded.

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,940
They're all granted titles.

66
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,680
In front of us,
they're insufferably smug.

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
Milord, if you don't step in soon...

68
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,080
Enough.

69
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,000
His Majesty is still young.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,650
He has only just ascended the throne.

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,240
He knows little of court etiquette.

72
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,310
Some actions are simply impulsive.

73
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,060
It is, after all, understandable.

74
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,120
We need only guide him well.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,700
As for those under your command,

76
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,630
handle them by the rules.

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
Yes.

78
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,520
Long live Your Majesty!

79
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,960
Rise.

80
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,400
Thank you.

81
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,080
Where is

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,280
the Great General?

83
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,030
Your Majesty.

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Lord Huo is unwell.

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,870
He has requested leave.

86
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,030
I believe

87
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,560
he has overworked himself.

88
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,270
From now on, he need not attend.

89
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,360
Your Majesty.

90
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,560
(Yang Chang, Prime Minister)
Lord Huo is in charge of the army.

91
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,360
Please appoint a successor soon.

92
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,950
In my view, perhaps...

93
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,750
Your Majesty.

94
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,930
When it comes to the military,

95
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,670
if the Great General is absent,

96
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,070
by long-standing custom,

97
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,950
the General of Cavalry,
the General of Chariots,

98
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,040
and other generals deliberate together.

99
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,110
We are willing

100
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,950
to share Your Majesty's burdens.

101
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,480
No need to trouble General Zhang.

102
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,560
I'll make the decision.

103
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,160
I must speak frankly.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,170
It's about military affairs.

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,830
If Your Majesty keeps appointing
new generals to oversee the army,

106
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,120
it may unsettle the troops.

107
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,160
In my opinion, it would be unwise.

108
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,190
Then the military

109
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,560
shall be placed

110
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,550
under my personal supervision.

111
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,910
Your Majesty.

112
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,360
Military affairs involve

113
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,920
defensive deployment and preparations,

114
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,260
training, and vigilance.

115
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,360
Such burdens are many.

116
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,000
Would you truly shoulder them alone?

117
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
What are you implying?

118
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,710
Your Majesty.

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,880
Well.

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,870
Generals.

121
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,120
Military affairs are no small matter.

122
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,980
I think we should wait until Lord Huo
has fully recovered

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,370
before we discuss the matter again

124
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,590
and make a final decision.

125
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,000
It won't be too late then, will it?

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,900
What?

127
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
With Lord Huo absent,

128
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,620
are you saying I can't decide
on military affairs at all?

129
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,310
This...

130
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,470
Your Majesty,

131
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,670
military matters have always been
Lord Huo's duty.

132
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,250
We only stepped in,

133
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,040
seeing how busy you are
with state affairs.

134
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,220
It has always been the custom.

135
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,040
But since you've had plans in place,

136
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,680
I see little use for us here.

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,120
I beg to resign and return home.

138
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
I request resignation.

139
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,950
I too request my resignation.

140
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,710
Generals...

141
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,570
Generals.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
Your Majesty.

143
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,630
The four generals bear the vital duty
of guarding Chang'an.

144
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,270
They are well acquainted
with troops from all quarters.

145
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,750
Assigning military affairs to them

146
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,950
would, in my view, be the safest course.

147
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,030
Generals.

148
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,070
Lord Huo is unwell.

149
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,600
If you depart so swiftly

150
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
and return to your homelands,

151
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,870
would that not betray Lord Huo's trust?

152
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,680
Then let us proceed as Lord Yan advises.

153
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,220
Yes.

154
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,340
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion, Chang'an)

155
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,530
At court this morning,

156
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,870
you were not present.

157
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,360
Those generals
joined forces to oppose me.

158
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,040
As the Emperor,

159
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,510
do I hold no say in my own decisions?

160
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,120
In the end,
all must be brought to Huo Guang.

161
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,830
He didn't even show up today.

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,640
See?

163
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,000
Everything was already decided.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
Where would I even have room to refuse?

165
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,120
I told you long ago.

166
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,430
On paper, you are the Emperor,

167
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,620
but in truth,
everyone answers to Huo Guang.

168
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,800
You'll have to endure it.

169
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,390
This is going too far.

170
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
This is going too far!

171
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,990
Your Majesty.

172
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,430
Bad news, Your Majesty.

173
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,360
What happened?

174
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,900
Our men from Changyi
were struck by Huo Yu.

175
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,740
What?

176
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,600
Why?

177
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,400
Today, General Huo Yu
suddenly formed the troops in ranks.

178
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,090
Our men's formation was poor.

179
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,720
He decided to punish
the leading colonel,

180
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,950
so he beat him.

181
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,560
Why don't they train regularly?

182
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,150
Those soldiers only take orders
from the Huo Clan.

183
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,560
Our own men can't control them at all.

184
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,960
When it comes to drills,

185
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,100
they mess around on purpose.

186
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,760
Fine then.

187
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,190
I'll strip Huo Yu of his rank right now.

188
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,400
Hold on.

189
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,950
He has a legitimate reason.

190
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,040
If you go and dismiss him now,

191
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
what will people say?

192
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
Heng,

193
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,640
they're clearly just bullying us.

194
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,240
Today, it's punishing our men.

195
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
What about tomorrow?

196
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,390
What if he executes them?

197
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,980
Leave tomorrow to the future.

198
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's keep waiting.

199
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,360
What?

200
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,920
Waiting again?

201
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,680
We have a plan and allies in place.

202
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,770
Why?

203
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,000
We should act now.

204
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,160
If we fail,

205
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,480
it will only prove
the Mandate of Heaven.

206
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,430
If we do nothing,

207
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,070
our brothers will be punished.

208
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,910
It's risky.

209
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,020
Didn't you say all I've done aligns
with the Mandate of Heaven?

210
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,890
That means Huo Guang
has set his sights on us.

211
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,560
Then, whether we act or not,

212
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,710
our men from Changyi will still die.

213
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,910
And so will you.

214
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,280
So, why not risk it all?

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
Are you certain?

216
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,990
Of course.

217
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,500
It's been 27 days
since receiving the imperial seal.

218
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,630
Envoys have been busy

219
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,180
with summoning every office
to requisition resources,

220
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,540
totaling 1,127 matters

221
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,360
that imperil the state.

222
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,220
(Imperil the state)

223
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,200
Impressive that you remember
such a long verse.

224
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,750
I used to tutor others on their studies

225
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,630
and had to recite it.

226
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,220
Let's go with what you said.

227
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,900
We'll take a gamble on this.

228
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,980
We'll set the plan in line with fate.

229
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,730
So, you agreed?

230
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,410
Huo Guang will inevitably depose
the Emperor.

231
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
So, let's strike first.

232
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,850
In that case, we'll charge him

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,550
with disloyalty in the name

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,080
of impeaching the deposed Emperor.

235
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,580
For now,

236
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,510
all you need to do is carry

237
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,870
these tasks out.

238
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,200
It's not over 1,000 items here.

239
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,630
Close enough.

240
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Who could commit 40 misdeeds

241
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,390
in one day

242
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,920
without food or sleep?

243
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,200
When there's intent to accuse,

244
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,830
there will always be a charge to fit.

245
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,050
These were all done by you alone?

246
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
This looks

247
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,090
like something I'd do.

248
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,250
No wonder
we can't let Lord Gong find out.

249
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,090
That's not the same thing.

250
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,620
Once these are done,

251
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,010
on the 27th day
after you ascend the throne,

252
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,000
you will surely ride out for the hunt.

253
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,230
By then,

254
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,710
we can switch the men.

255
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,260
(Hall of Four Seas as One)

256
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,390
I shall speak,

257
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,370
you shall write,

258
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,490
and you shall announce it.

259
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,360
Yes.

260
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,150
The first imperial decree.

261
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,080
Following Heaven's mandate,

262
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,680
I call upon the scholar-officials.

263
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,090
Anyone willing to serve the realm

264
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,680
shall be honored and elevated.

265
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,240
The second imperial decree.

266
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,280
Following Heaven's mandate,
I welcome talent from all walks of life,

267
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,300
while dismissing redundant posts
to cleanse the administration.

268
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,030
The third imperial decree.

269
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,070
Following Heaven's mandate,
I shall minimize levies and taxes

270
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,400
to ease the burdens of the people.

271
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,370
A full pardon shall be granted,
giving all a fresh beginning.

272
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,840
The fourth imperial decree.

273
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,410
Following Heaven's mandate,

274
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,330
I posthumously confer honor
upon my mother

275
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,710
by making her the Empress Dowager

276
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,080
as a sign of filial reverence.

277
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,250
The fifth imperial decree.

278
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,540
Following Heaven's mandate,

279
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,330
my grandmother's clan, the Li Clan,

280
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,810
once suffered injustice,
and now is fully vindicated

281
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,120
and granted a fief.

282
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,360
The sixth imperial decree.

283
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,410
Following Heaven's mandate,

284
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,880
to honor my father, Liu Bo's virtue,

285
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,990
I hereby decree that his spirit tablet

286
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,630
shall be placed

287
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,860
within the ancestral temple

288
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,760
to share in the rites
with our forefathers.

289
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,530
The seventh imperial decree:
Following Heaven's mandate,

290
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,920
I wish to reform the system
of official tokens.

291
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,670
Military officials shall be commissioned

292
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,040
as a symbol of the new order.

293
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,870
(In one day,)

294
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,130
(Liu He issued over 50 decrees.)

295
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,970
- (Seeing the herald)
- Who's there?

296
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,120
- (relaying his decrees without pause)
- Who's there?

297
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,120
(The officials' murmurs
grew louder and louder.)

298
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,370
- Step aside.
- Who's there?

299
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,960
(Yet Liu He paid them no heed.)

300
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,840
(He simply carried on with the tasks
set out in the Mandate of Heaven,)

301
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,600
(as if everything
were converging toward it.)

302
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,500
Never before have I seen this.

303
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,950
Everyone,

304
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,690
you followed me to Chang'an.

305
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,640
I always keep my word.

306
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,420
We shall share glory and wealth.

307
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,800
Your Majesty.

308
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,150
Now, we truly have

309
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,100
endless wealth and honor.

310
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,680
Now, Your Majesty

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,070
has become the sovereign.

312
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,080
All affairs of state

313
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,000
are in the hands of Lord Huo,
Great General.

314
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,960
If Your Majesty wishes
to achieve great ambitions

315
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,000
and make a lasting legacy,

316
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,420
Lord Huo must be removed from power.

317
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,050
Lord Huo is a veteran of three reigns,

318
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,820
with unparalleled service and merit.

319
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,940
Be careful with your words.

320
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,970
Your Majesty.

321
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,080
Hesitate now, and trouble will follow.

322
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,320
I have my own plan.

323
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,470
(Weiyang Palace)

324
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,310
Cheers! Cheers!

325
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,270
Come on, drink together.

326
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,140
Drink! Drink!

327
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,250
Cheers! Cheers!

328
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,040
What fine wine.

329
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,040
Zhang Sheng.

330
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,110
Li Qi.

331
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,350
Lord Zhang.

332
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,840
Lord Li.

333
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,560
Do the beauties

334
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,640
please you?

335
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,080
Thanks, Your Majesty.

336
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,860
If you're not pleased,
the imperial seal is right there.

337
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
And if it truly won't do,

338
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,600
you can take the imperial seal with you.

339
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,740
How about being Emperor
for a couple of days?

340
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,190
Ha ha ha.

341
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,120
Come.

342
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,650
Just drink.

343
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,010
Drink.

344
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
Your Majesty.

345
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,300
You haven't reviewed the memorials

346
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,490
Lord Gong submitted.

347
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,720
I'll approve it.

348
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,510
Come on, let's drink.

349
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,240
Come.

350
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,360
Good.

351
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,960
Good.

352
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,680
That's all.

353
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,750
No more imperial decrees need my seal.

354
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,380
Ha ha ha, indeed.

355
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,130
Then this final decree

356
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,200
shall be for you.

357
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,230
Come.

358
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,890
Your Majesty.

359
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,750
This...

360
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
By the Mandate of Heaven,

361
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,550
longevity and prosperity shall endure.

362
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,030
I am

363
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,790
