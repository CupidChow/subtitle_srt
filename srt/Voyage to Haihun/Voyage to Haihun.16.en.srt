30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,420
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

31
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,920
Qingge,

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,800
based on the censor records you gave me,

33
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,150
I've put together a list.

34
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,570
Here, take a look.

35
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,310
Qingge?

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Duke.

37
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,470
Mm.

38
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,280
Come on.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,240
Let's go out.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,690
Take a look.

41
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,680
Fine items.

42
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,550
Duke, if I may.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,740
(Yan Mansion)
You don't seem like

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,120
you're here to find someone.

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Then what do I look like?

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,470
Walking into a trap on my own?

47
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,430
Or trying to curry favor with gifts?

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,080
Neither of those.

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,310
You look like

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,840
you've come to propose marriage.

51
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,000
Lord Yan has

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,150
quite the peculiar temper.

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,630
And he's an Imperial Censor.

54
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,110
I can't afford to be discourteous.

55
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,260
(Yan Mansion)

56
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,000
I was about to see you.

57
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,950
Where is my daughter?

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,080
Didn't she return home?

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,530
I had told her to leave Chang'an.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
Yesterday...

61
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,790
You're the last man she met.

62
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,590
Now she's missing.

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,960
What did you say to her?

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,570
I didn't say much to her.

65
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,970
Why did you send her away?

66
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,470
No matter where you've hidden her, Duke,

67
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,720
or what intentions you have,

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,280
please understand the heart of a father.

69
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,560
I ask you to return my daughter to me.

70
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,110
I didn't know she's missing

71
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,400
until I came to see you.

72
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,400
You let her leave Chang'an.

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,560
What's your intention?

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,710
If you hadn't let her leave,

75
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,750
she wouldn't have vanished.

76
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,080
It must be your strictness

77
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,190
that made her upset.

78
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,100
I never came to take her from you,

79
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,720
yet you accuse me of wrongdoing.

80
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,560
She promised

81
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
she'll hand those things over to you

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,880
and then stay away from this mire.

83
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,950
Those things?

84
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,240
What is this?

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,800
I asked my father
for the records of officials.

86
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,000
To secure the throne,

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,870
you'll need them.

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,390
Why are you telling me all this,

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
as if you're saying farewell?

90
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,870
You fool.

91
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,740
Li Qi, go find her.

92
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,630
Mm.

93
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,780
(Yan Mansion)

94
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,000
Quickly, all of you.

95
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,000
The Empress Dowager is coming.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,370
If she spots any speck of dust,

97
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,470
you'll lose a hand.

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,920
In the Palace, rules must be observed.

99
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,120
Keep your head down.

100
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,430
And don't speak out of turn.

101
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,830
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

102
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,580
Watch your tongue.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,190
Or you might lose it.

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,080
Move it.

105
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,790
You,

106
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
go sweep over there.

107
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Oh.

108
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,280
What are you doing? Stop dawdling.

109
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Hurry up.

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,560
Miss.

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,960
Miss.

112
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,630
Why are you just sitting here?

113
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,670
Go get to work.

114
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,710
Or you'll get scolded.

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,280
My cat has gone missing.

116
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,850
A cat? When did it go missing?

117
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,350
Many years ago.

118
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,730
I've been here waiting for it to return.

119
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,520
Miss, once enough years have passed,

120
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,190
those we've lost will never come back.

121
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,520
All the more so when it's a cat.

122
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,670
That one

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,510
was once my only friend here.

124
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,210
How could any other ever replace it?

125
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,900
(Auspicious Signs)

126
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,070
There's no use dwelling on the past,

127
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,680
no matter how much you regret.

128
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,180
Do you wish to regret the present
in the future?

129
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,920
Tell me what that cat looked like.

130
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,250
I'll get you an even cuter one.

131
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,430
You're new here, aren't you?

132
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,270
Mm.

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
That's why you dare speak to me.

134
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,110
Uh?

135
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,140
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

136
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,040
Have you found her?

137
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,880
Not yet.

138
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
Go search quickly.

139
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,200
Western Market, Dongsheng.

140
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,140
South Gate, North Gate.

141
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,000
Go find her, everyone.

142
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,870
- Yes.
- Go.

143
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,720
You must find her

144
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,040
no matter what.

145
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,670
- Lord Gong.
- Duke.

146
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,360
What's going on?

147
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,650
People are coming and going.

148
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,020
It's an important day.

149
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,270
How's your preparation?

150
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,720
You must not grow careless.

151
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,960
What is the matter?

152
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,510
Have you forgotten?

153
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,850
You'll meet Empress Dowager Shangguan.

154
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,630
She'll enthrone you as Crown Prince.

155
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,260
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

156
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,270
Tell the Empress Dowager,

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm not going today.

158
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,430
This matter is of great importance.

159
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,670
How can you not show up?

160
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,360
Qingge has gone missing.

161
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,760
No.

162
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,630
If I can't find her,

163
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,920
I won't see anyone.

164
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,890
This…

165
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,600
Go.

166
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
Lord Gong.

167
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,630
Quickly gather a team of guards.

168
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,680
Escort me and the Duke into the Palace.

169
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,000
Lord Gong.

170
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,510
Duke, don't worry.

171
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,070
Take my badge.

172
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,850
Rally everyone left in the residence,

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,830
including the servants.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,210
Have the artist
paint portraits of Lady Qingge.

175
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,570
Go to where Lady Qingge went missing.

176
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,380
Search along the streets from there.

177
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,290
Remember, this is Chang'an.

178
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,310
We must keep this quiet.

179
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,430
Make inquiries with caution.

180
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,910
Understood.

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Go on.

182
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,070
You two, come with me.

183
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,560
Yes.

184
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,630
Duke.

185
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,750
I know of your bond with Lady Qingge.

186
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,720
But the most urgent matter is this.

187
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,870
You must go to Changle Palace at once.

188
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,160
Only after meeting the Empress Dowager

189
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,120
will you be enthroned as Crown Prince.

190
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,830
Only then will your position be rightful.

191
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,950
If we delay the appointed time,

192
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,450
it could lead to grave trouble.

193
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,110
The gifts are all prepared.

194
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
I'll go get changed.

195
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,900
Duke, you're wise.

196
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,700
Attend to the Duke, help him change.

197
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:31,260
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

198
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,360
I pay my respects, Empress Mother.

199
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,750
I hope you're well.

200
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,280
Rise.

201
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,900
I've brought you

202
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,370
gold, pearls, and fine silks as a token

203
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,850
of my filial respect.

204
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,480
You are thoughtful indeed.

205
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,630
I too have a gift for you.

206
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,790
I heard you have a fine horse,

207
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,840
so I prepared this gift.

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,790
When you ride one day, wear it at your waist,

209
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,150
and you will look gallant.

210
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,360
Thank you, Mother.

211
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,870
The Duke of Changyi
bows with ceremony.

212
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,750
Truly a model of filial devotion.

213
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,240
I'm deeply impressed.

214
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,750
I hope Your Highness and the Empress Dowager

215
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,150
will honor and support each other

216
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,410
and together ensure the realm prospers.

217
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,810
From this day forth,

218
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,270
the people of the State of Changyi

219
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,550
may enter the Palace
to learn its etiquette

220
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,630
and prepare

221
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,620
for your future paths.

222
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,990
I heard we're moving into the Palace.

223
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,800
By then,

224
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,440
all delicacies will be at our fingertips.

225
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,380
All thanks to the Duke.

226
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,500
Remember this, everyone,

227
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,130
you must follow the decrees of the court.

228
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,410
Once you're in the Palace,

229
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,720
you won't be free to come and go.

230
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,790
Mingyou, Han Zeng, cross.

231
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,630
Hey, Lord Wang,

232
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,640
what's this about?

233
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,940
Mingyou, Han Zeng, cross.

234
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,620
Zhang Chongguo, Zhang Anshi, cross.

235
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,870
Lu Wenshu, Li Guang, circle.

236
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,870
Duke, eat well

237
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,710
and take care.

238
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,670
If I'm gone,
who else could protect you,

239
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,410
Duke?

240
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,370
No need for protection.

241
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,940
- Mingyou, Han Zeng, Chongguo,
- Heng.

242
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,350
- Anshi, Su Chang.
- You're back.

243
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,240
- Lu Wenshu.
- Heng.

244
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,480
- Li Guang, Huang Ba.
- What?

245
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Why do you seem so distracted?

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,080
I still have so much I want to tell you.

247
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,390
Fan Mingyou, Han Zeng,
Zhao Chongguo, cross.

248
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
Zhang Anshi, Su Chang, cross.

249
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,030
Lu Wenshu, Li Guang, circle;
Huang Ba, tick.

250
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,350
Heng.

251
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,410
How did you know I drafted this list?

252
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,250
Shh.

253
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,960
Keep saying your farewells.

254
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,030
I won't intrude.

255
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,030
Heng.

256
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,610
Heng.

257
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,550
What's wrong, Heng?

258
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,480
- Duke.
- It's nothing, really.

259
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Stay here, be good.

260
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,320
I'll come find you later.

261
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,080
Duke, if I'm not here,

262
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,150
who else can keep you safe?

263
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,200
By Lord Huo's command,

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,830
Wang Heng is to be executed on the spot.

265
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,270
Ah!

266
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,130
Heng!

267
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,180
(June 28, 74 BC)

268
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,700
(June 25, 74 BC)

269
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,840
Everyone, rest early tonight.

270
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,390
Ah.

271
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,960
Now listen to what I'm about to say.

272
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,150
First, I have urgent matters tomorrow.

273
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,240
So I can't go to Chang'an.

274
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,360
When you enter the city, cry.

275
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,820
If you can't, stare into the sun.

276
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,030
Second,

277
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,540
do not get angry with Yan Yannian.

278
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,390
Yan Yannian?

279
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,870
Who's that?

280
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,910
That's my father.

281
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,890
I know, let me finish.

282
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,060
Third, meet the Empress Dowager on time.

283
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,080
Fourth,

284
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,790
all of you will be summoned to the Palace.

285
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,000
Just go.

286
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,920
I'll come find you

287
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,390
in your mansion. Remember that?

288
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
- Uh?
- What?

289
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,990
Keep that in mind.

290
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,750
Got it.

291
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,960
Go over everything I told you.

292
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,840
I'll come find you.

293
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,280
I have matters, bye.

294
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,460
Yan Yannian is your father.

295
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,240
Yan Yannian is your father.

296
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,340
I can remember everything.

297
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,910
Yan Yannian is your father.

298
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,130
Yan Yannian is your father.

299
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,360
Such refined taste for someone so young.

300
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,630
I'm Wang Heng.

301
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,290
I've been expecting you.

302
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,670
Lord Wang, Lord Huo wants to see you.

303
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,000
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

304
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,080
It never hurts to arrive early.

305
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,590
The next meeting will be in ten days.

306
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,440
Lord Wang, please remember the date

307
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,390
and attend on time.

308
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,600
(It will be the best chance
to rein in him.)

309
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,870
I'll remember, milord.

310
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,830
After you, Lord Huo.

311
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,210
- Morning.
- (Their connections)

312
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,560
- Morning.
- (run far too deep.)

313
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,170
- (One wrong step would kill me.)
- Lord Wang is talented.

314
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,670
- (Luckily, I can be reborn.)
- He will make it big.

315
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,200
- (I must use this to map out)
- He will discuss state affairs

316
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,280
- (the factions.)
- with us.

317
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,670
We should send trusted scouts to check

318
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,470
- (Five, four,)
- for hidden dangers.

319
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,410
(three,)

320
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,260
(two,)

321
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,120
(one.)

322
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
(Now.)

323
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,480
Gentlemen, please continue.

324
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,870
I'll be right back.

325
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,210
(Even his restroom breaks are timed.)

326
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,960
Generals,

327
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,830
I have a request.

328
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,990
I hold an order
from the Duke of Changyi.

329
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,790
Once he ascends the throne,

330
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,600
I hope you'll aid him
in quelling the traitors.

331
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,810
Does the Great General know of this?

332
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,120
This is from the Duke of Changyi.

333
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,200
You bear the duty
of protecting the Duke.

334
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,190
Please lend your support to the Duke.

335
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,390
Better wait until Great General returns.

336
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,090
(They listen to him on everything.)

337
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,050
(Blind followers.)

338
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,960
If the Duke shows
signs of imperial scheming,

339
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,080
what's your view on it?

340
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,950
Even the most cunning imperial schemes

341
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,220
is just child's play before Lord Huo.

342
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,130
If the New Emperor clashed
with Lord Huo,

343
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,600
how would you choose, milord?

344
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,020
Lord Huo would surely persuade him.

345
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,470
Lord Wang, what brings you here

346
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,330
at this late hour?

347
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,550
Huo Guang acts against order,

348
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,510
usurping power.

349
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,350
The Crown Prince intends to unseat him.

350
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,680
Lord Li, will you side
with the Crown Prince?

351
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,320
Oh, Lord Wang, say no more.

352
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,000
General Huo has given his all
for the Han Empire.

353
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,300
This must be a misunderstanding.

354
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,120
Lord Li,

355
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,440
will you support the Crown Prince?

356
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,440
Are you out of your mind?

357
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,820
As Capital Commandant,

358
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,140
you should protect Chang'an.

359
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,910
Who exactly do you side with?

360
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,360
Lord Wang, why press me so?

361
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
What protection of Chang'an?

362
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,990
It's just following orders.

363
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,670
I have no choice but to obey.

364
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,600
How would I have the right to fight, milord?

365
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,870
Milord, if you must kill,

366
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,760
then take my life first.

367
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,160
That way, I'll no longer live in fear.

368
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,960
Go on, do it.

369
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,390
Well, you are straightforward.

370
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,030
I won't press you.

371
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,590
Forget it.

(He's choosing to protect himself.)

373
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,240
Crown Prince will unseat Huo Guang.

374
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,080
What is your counsel, Lord Xu?

375
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,940
It's my duty

376
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,040
to support the Crown Prince.

377
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,360
I only wish to remind you,

378
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,750
there's no secret in Chang'an,

379
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,660
because there's always a turncoat.

380
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,600
We had best think it over again.

381
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,670
Seize the traitor Wang Heng.

382
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,960
How would I have the right to fight?

383
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,830
- Take him away.
- Game of thrones.

384
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,540
Fence-sitters are indeed everywhere.

385
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,540
Take him away.

386
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,680
You just spat wine on me.
