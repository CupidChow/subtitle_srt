=Episode 8=

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,710
Don't move! Release the Duke!

31
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,550
Hold still.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,760
San.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,990
Even if you're not San,

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,920
don't act rashly.

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,000
We'll do our best to meet your demands.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,840
Who is San?

37
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,790
He's got the wrong person.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,710
Lady De Jiu.

39
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,660
Why are you doing this?

40
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,150
Yeah, Senior.

41
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,590
- Quiet.
- Watch yourself.

42
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,790
We take him down first.

43
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,760
Then we fight our way out.

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Don't be rash.

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
Our life comes first.

46
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,510
We need a few fast horses.

47
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,840
You must let us leave without harm.

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,690
Alright, fine.

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,560
We have many horses.

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,070
I'll pick you the fastest ones.

51
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,560
But we need some time

52
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
to choose the horses.

53
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,120
Miss, don't act on impulse.

54
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
Senior.

55
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,440
Silence.

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,400
Everyone.

57
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,120
We came here only to find a way to live.

58
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,910
We're not here to take lives.

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,430
But if forced into a corner,

60
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,750
we'll fight to the bitter end.

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,310
It's no good for anyone.

62
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Alright, alright. Hurry up.

63
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,800
Bring out our finest horses.

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,910
Move quickly, also,

65
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,680
no one is to act without orders.

66
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,710
Yes.

67
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,750
Hyah!

68
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,310
Hyah!

69
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,910
Hyah, hyah!

70
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,890
Hyah!

71
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,270
Hyah, hyah!

72
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,800
Hyah!

73
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,360
Lady De Jiu,

74
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,240
spare your hand.

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
Hyah!

76
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,750
Get off.

77
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,710
Uh?

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
Duke.

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,360
Duke, are you alright?

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,200
Duke.

81
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,870
I'm fine.

82
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,430
What brings you here?

83
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,710
You were in danger.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
But I can't let you take the risk.

85
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,430
This can't happen again.

86
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,870
Again?

87
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,590
As if such a thing should happen twice.

88
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,470
Come on.

89
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,400
Hyah!

90
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,310
Hyah!

91
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,750
Whoa.

92
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,870
Are you alright?

93
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,680
Lady Qingge.

94
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,680
You mustn't act so recklessly again.

95
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,130
You vanished in a second.

96
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,990
What if something happened to you?

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,870
I only thought I'd be faster on a horse.

98
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,350
From now on, treat your Qingge well.

99
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
Understood?

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,900
Lord Wang.

101
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,590
Protect the Duke;
I'll keep chasing. Hyah!

102
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,840
Go on, quickly!

103
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
Do you need a hand?

104
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,310
Hyah!

105
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
Hyah!

106
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,550
Leave it to me.

107
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,030
You go first.

108
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,280
I'll hold them off.

109
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Go!

110
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,470
Hyah!

111
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,840
Hyah!

112
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,620
(Huo)

113
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,140
(Li Han, Imperial Guard Commander)

114
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,270
We both serve the Imperial Court.

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
My mission is secret.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,310
The Duke must not be alarmed.

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Nor may I tell you, Lord Li.

118
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
I ask that you keep this confidential.

119
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,440
Understood.

120
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,760
Let's go.

121
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Hyah!

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
Yun Qing.

123
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,270
Looks like our feud

124
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
should end here today.

125
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,000
Just you alone?

126
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,320
Hmph.

127
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,270
Master.

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
De Jiu.

129
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,510
Jiu, be careful.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,270
I'll count to three.

131
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,730
Then we rush out together.

132
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,120
One.

133
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,240
Two.

134
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,560
Three!

135
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,680
Master!

136
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Go!

137
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,630
Go!

138
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,670
Go!

139
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,430
Hyah!

140
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Hyah!

141
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,550
Giddy-up!

142
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
In that direction.

143
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,350
Whoa.

144
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
De Jiu.

145
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,880
Save her.

146
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
De Jiu slipped into the Duke's mansion,

147
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
harboring ill intent.

148
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,410
And this time,

149
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,920
she even seized the Duke.

150
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,160
Such a crime deserves execution.

151
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,240
Duke, don't let judgment be clouded.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,750
If I take advantage of her now,

153
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,920
wouldn't word of it bring me shame?

154
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,430
Wait until she recovers

155
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,510
before passing judgment.

156
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,630
Nonsense.

157
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,360
How is she?

158
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
It's only superficial wounds.

159
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,360
But the cuts are quite deep.

160
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,510
She's lost consciousness.

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Duke.

162
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,390
Found the physician?

163
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,870
I sent someone, but no word yet.

164
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
We can't wait.

165
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,510
Stop the bleeding, disinfect,

166
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,630
stitch it up, bandage, that should work.

167
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,470
Let me do it.

168
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,120
Heng, this is no small matter.

169
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,200
Can't worry about that now.

170
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,870
Send someone to gather some supplies.

171
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,600
I need garlic,

172
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
- Atractylodes, linen cloth,
- Linen cloth.

173
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
and also…

174
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,080
a still for brewing wine.

175
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,360
The brewing still…

176
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,410
Still?

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,720
Add more firewood.

178
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,830
Sterilize it with high heat.

179
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,680
Alright.

180
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,910
Fan it slower.

181
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,180
Keep it at this temperature.

182
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,160
Don't worry.

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,040
Bushi can do it.

184
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,280
Trust me.

185
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,200
I'll leave it to you.

186
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,320
Heng, everything is ready.

187
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,510
I've even peeled garlic for you.

188
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,370
But we're treating wounds,

189
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,270
not cooking a meal.

190
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,560
What is garlic for?

191
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
Garlic produces allicin.

192
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,270
Before antibiotics were invented,

193
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,680
it was the best anti-inflammatory.

194
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,380
What are you talking about?

195
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,630
It's...

196
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,600
wound medicine.

197
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,200
Now that makes sense, doesn't it?

198
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
Lord Shi,

199
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,670
regarding reducing personnel,

200
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
we'll report it to the Duke right away.

201
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,080
Then I'll trouble you two, my lords.

202
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Reducing personnel?

203
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,910
Time is running short.

204
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,750
This matter

205
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,750
can't be put off for too long.

206
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Mm.

207
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,270
Duke, Lord Gong is here to see you.

208
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,230
What's this about?

209
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,690
I don't know.

210
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,350
Go on then.

211
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,360
Mm, let's go.

212
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,080
Qingge.

213
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,670
When you examined Lady De Jiu's wound,

214
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,630
did you see three red moles
on her left shoulder?

215
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,750
No.

216
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,150
Think carefully.

217
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,110
Are you sure?

218
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,910
Mm, I'm sure.

219
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,930
What is it, Wang?

220
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,790
It's nothing.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,960
(She's not San.)

222
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,080
(Can two people look exactly the same?)

223
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,350
Lady De Jiu,

224
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,440
I know you have your reasons.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
Just stay here.

226
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,800
We won't harm you.

227
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,750
It's not your concern.

228
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,040
Lady De Jiu,

229
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,790
if you leave that wound untreated,

230
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,510
your clothes will fuse with the flesh.

231
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,320
And by then,

232
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,960
you'll never be able to take them off.

233
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,480
That's right, Lady De Jiu.

234
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,550
Wang prepared some medicine for you.

235
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
He's about to stitch up your injury.

236
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
But don't worry,

237
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,960
I'll be right here with you

238
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
and keep you covered.

239
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
- You...
- Yes?

240
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,870
move along, no peeking.

241
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,030
Relax, I won't.

242
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,230
Come here.

243
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,390
There's no anesthetic.

244
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,190
I'll be as gentle as I can.

245
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,130
Guys, we've traveled for so long.

246
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,790
Who would truly want to return?

247
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,290
Duke.

248
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,360
Order is kept through propriety.

249
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Now you are about to enter the capital.

250
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,960
I fear we have no choice but to

251
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,870
obey this imperial edict from Chang'an.

252
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,390
You decide.

253
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,800
Lord Gong.

254
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,350
Very well.

255
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,470
Lord Gong.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,720
Please look at these ministers.

257
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,400
Their years are advanced.

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,390
Why not let them
spend their years in Changyi?

259
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,780
The House of Wang has served
two generations of Dukes.

260
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,150
Their merits are great.

261
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,630
If we send them back to Changyi,

262
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,030
it will chill everyone's hearts.

263
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,120
Better to pick a few with lower ranks,

264
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,750
so no one will have objections.

265
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,680
Their titles may be small,

266
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,760
but they handle all daily affairs.

267
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,920
No, that won't do.

268
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,150
In my view,

269
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,660
(List of attendants: Li Qi, Du Ruofeng,
Chen Bushi, Zhang Sheng)

270
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,440
Let's settle on these few.

271
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,990
Alright.

272
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,630
They hardly learned any craft

273
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,630
and not fit for major duties.

274
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,960
So we send them back.

275
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,480
Lord Gong's words make sense.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
No, absolutely not.

277
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,480
These are brothers I've grown up with.

278
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,030
How could I leave them behind?

279
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,270
I ask you, my lord, to decide.

280
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,670
Chancellor, don't be anxious.

281
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,910
Choosing the right people
affects many parties.

282
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,240
We should plan carefully.

283
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Plan for what?

284
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,550
Everyone goes. That's it.

285
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,720
Wait, wait, wait...

286
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,390
Wang.

287
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,130
Lady De Jiu's fever has gone down.

288
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,320
Two hundred.

289
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,200
Alright.

290
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,440
Wang.

291
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,720
What is this unusual martial arts move?

292
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,520
This place is far too dangerous.

293
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,440
I need to enhance my physical training

294
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,750
to stay alive.

295
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,390
Lord Wang.

296
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,550
I have something

297
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,320
to discuss with you.

298
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,180
Ah?

299
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,080
We haven't arrived yet

300
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,550
and they're limiting our numbers.

301
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,440
This talk of ritual

302
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,790
might just be an excuse.

303
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,430
Right now, the biggest headache is

304
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,550
how we decide on the personnel.

305
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,000
I truly can't bring myself to say it.

306
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,630
Lord Gong, are you implying

307
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,320
we must abide by the Imperial Edict,

308
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,870
yet still win everyone's acceptance?

309
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,440
Most importantly, the Duke must approve.

310
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,360
Please, Lord Wang, share your guidance

311
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
and help light the way.

312
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,910
Let us work together to choose wisely.

313
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,200
That's easy.

314
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,300
(I recall that 200 officials
died in Chang'an.)

315
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,030
(If more names can be cut,)

316
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,110
(we can save them)

317
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
(and perhaps even change the history.)

318
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,560
Lord Wang.

319
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,110
Oh.

320
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,160
Let me think.

321
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,440
I have a plan.

322
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,840
We set an exam to select them

323
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,390
with questions scored by points.

324
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,390
Papers graded anonymously.

325
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,450
Whoever gets certain scores

326
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,550
will head to Chang'an.

327
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,960
That's an excellent idea.

328
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,030
I didn't come up with it alone.

329
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Back in my hometown,

330
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,440
this is how the state selects talent.

331
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,560
Eh?

332
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,480
Come to think of it,

333
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,270
this tradition began in this land.

334
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,350
Oh?

335
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,000
Why have I never heard of it?

336
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,360
The time hasn't come yet.

337
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,720
Lord Gong, let me remind you,

338
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,790
once we truly enter Chang'an,

339
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
things will be tangled and complex.

340
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,360
We'll need capable allies to assist us.

341
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,080
Lord Wang, you speak the absolute truth.

342
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,890
To select the best for the court,

343
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,080
the examination topic

344
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,200
must be ingenious

345
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,150
and truly unique.

346
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,390
No room for carelessness.

347
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,390
Not the slightest.

348
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,230
Exactly.

349
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,120
I'll head to bed first.

350
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,360
Alright, I won't disturb you.

351
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,080
Rest early, I won't intrude.

352
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,900
(Longshan Inn)

353
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,790
Leaving so soon?

354
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,340
If it weren't for my morning exercise,

355
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,480
you would've run away.

356
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,150
Do you even know who took the Qilin?

357
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,030
In the end, it's all about the Qilin.

358
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,990
That's right.

359
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,270
I want the Qilin.

360
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,280
It helps you to find your master's killer.

361
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,720
I suppose

362
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,360
you want to avenge your master.

363
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,880
But how will you do that?

364
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,830
Why not stay and heal first?

365
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
Then plan carefully.

366
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,950
We have given

367
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,640
your master a proper burial.

368
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,680
Want to visit his grave?

369
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,960
They serve the Court.

370
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,350
You can't do much.

371
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,400
I may not be able to help much,

372
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,350
but we'll go to Chang'an.

373
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,910
I bet that's where you're headed too.

374
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,120
We can at least share meals

375
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,080
on the way.

376
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,760
What do you say?

377
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,680
Think it over.

378
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,480
I appreciate your kindness.

379
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,720
I'll repay your help another day.

380
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,960
I shouldn't trouble you.

381
