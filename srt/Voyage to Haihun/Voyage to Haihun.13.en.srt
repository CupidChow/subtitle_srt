=Episode 13=

30
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,730
Why does your blade look

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,120
exactly the same as mine?

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,330
They were forged as a pair.

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,410
Weapons passed down from my sect.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,360
Your name is De Jiu?

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,210
And your master is Yun Qing,
the Swift Blade?

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
Though we are wandering heroes,

37
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
our skills often go unused.

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,610
At most, we smooth over disputes

39
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,520
just to make a living.

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,700
Your master was a man of burning passion

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,860
and determined to clear the name
of wandering heroes.

42
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,310
So, he took on tasks for the court.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,400
Over time,
he stopped returning to the village.

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,060
Though Master raised me from childhood,

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,420
I never truly understood him.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,000
But his letters and his heart

47
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,880
were mostly filled with you.

48
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,270
Then, in your eyes,

49
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,960
what kind of man was he?

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,850
Stern and seldom smiling,

51
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,910
unusually strict.

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,200
Every word he spoke carried reason.

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,910
When I slacked off,

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,960
he never scolded me.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
But no matter how well I did,

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
he never once praised me.

57
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,030
You were always in his heart.

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,910
In his view,

59
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,340
you were not his disciple anymore.

60
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,460
You were his daughter.

61
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,040
He was a close friend
of your birth father.

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,940
That day, he heard your family
was in danger.

63
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,530
But by the time he arrived,
it was too late.

64
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,590
Just as the villains
were about to harm you,

65
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,330
he fought with all he had
to keep you safe.

66
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,630
Though badly wounded,

67
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,560
seeing you unharmed

68
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,000
and crying in his arms,

69
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,570
he felt it was all worth it.

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,430
From that day on,

71
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,950
he took any job that could earn money.

72
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,530
No matter how dangerous,

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,630
all he wanted was to give you
a better life.

74
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
So, he became a spy for the court,

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
even if it meant danger, toil,

76
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,600
and disdain.

77
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,540
Firstly,
it was to atone for your parents.

78
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,890
Secondly, for you, he had no regrets.

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,720
Master once said

80
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,920
that once a person holds onto a wish,

81
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,930
the blade will lose its sharpness.

82
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,670
You are

83
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,950
what he's been holding onto.

84
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,360
Uncle, your blade's aura

85
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,880
made me feel the warmth
of someone I once knew.

86
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,660
But I will never

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
see him again.

88
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,740
(Wucheng Village)

89
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,870
- Duke.
- Can you two vanish?

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,070
Lord Li Han has ordered

91
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,220
that we ensure your safety.

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,220
Duke,

93
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,710
the closer we get to Chang'an,
the more cautious we must be.

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,430
Can you two lend a hand?

95
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,430
Carry those things back.

96
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,940
Quickly, quickly.

97
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,920
Careful now.

98
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,680
Put some strength into it.

99
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,120
Mr. and Mrs. Kang have arrived.

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Please serve the tea.

101
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,760
Mr. Kang.

102
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,430
My apologies.

103
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,660
The venue is booked for today.

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,120
Don't stop them.

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,060
Let them come through.

106
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,490
The more people, the livelier.

107
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,720
I am Kang Ning.

108
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
Nice to meet you.

109
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,920
I am Qi Chang.

110
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,580
- Please.
- Please.

111
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,430
Your lady's grace feels familiar.

112
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,690
Have we met in Changyi?

113
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,000
You're from Changyi as well?

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,960
Yes.

115
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,830
Last time,
I returned to visit my family.

116
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,000
I saw the equine administration
thriving in Changyi.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,670
So, I joined in.

118
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,480
So, you are Xu Pingjun,

119
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,510
who broke the wood?

120
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
Xu Pingjun,

121
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,080
the Geng contestant.

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,490
Meeting an old friend
in a foreign land is truly a blessing.

123
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,680
I never expected Qi

124
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,260
to have the chance to meet my lady.

125
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,190
That is quite the fated bond.

126
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,710
- Come.
- Come.

127
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,480
Your attire tells me

128
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,950
you must be a wandering hero.

129
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,720
Has this sword

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
ever tasted blood?

131
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,960
A wandering hero
may break the law by force,

132
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,680
but he would never take a life lightly.

133
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,270
To abstain is to endure,

134
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,910
but that does not mean never to kill.

135
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,870
There are times when one has no choice.

136
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,430
Seems you also hold the heart
of a wandering hero.

137
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,270
Of course.

138
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,660
With the sky as my canopy,

139
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,870
the earth as my seat,

140
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,870
elegant melodies all around...

141
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,750
Kindred spirits by our side...

142
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,770
We drink and share our joy.

143
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,710
Unbound by the ways of the world.

144
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,120
How carefree and at ease it feels.

145
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,510
Ha ha ha.

146
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,790
- Come.
- Come.

147
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Yet,

148
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,870
fate toys with us.

149
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,440
True chivalry lies not in appearance,

150
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,360
but in the heart.

151
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,160
Chivalry of the court

152
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,580
lies in the affairs of the realm.

153
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,560
To bring the people a good life

154
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,580
is the path of chivalry.

155
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,220
Chivalry of the common folks

156
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,830
lies in the care for right and wrong.

157
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,920
Welding the swords

158
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,750
is for the sake

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,910
of justice.

160
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,990
Mr. Kang.

161
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,800
A wise insight.

162
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,510
You're dressed so elegantly.

163
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,100
You must be a noble
headed for Chang'an.

164
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,240
I only hope you'll bring blessings
to the people.

165
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
Then the wandering heroes like us

166
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,720
can retire from the martial world.

167
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
You jest.

168
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,630
Whether in the court
or among the people,

169
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,320
our hearts are always
with the people's well-being.

170
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,240
To bring peace to a land,

171
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,630
or to save just one or a few lives,

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,480
is all part of the path of chivalry.

173
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,750
Today,

174
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,050
meeting you feels like reuniting
with an old friend.

175
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,120
I will offer tea in place of wine.

176
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,510
An honor to meet you, Qi.

177
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,010
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

178
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,150
Who said you could peek?

179
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,840
Don't flatter yourself.

180
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,080
I was merely passing by.

181
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,270
But back in Hongnong,

182
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,970
you risked your life for me,

183
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,150
helping me clear my name.

184
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,460
I should thank you properly.

185
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,350
Thanks.

186
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Don't get the wrong idea.

187
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,440
It just seemed suspicious,

188
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,570
so I happened to dig
into Li Wei's affair.

189
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,070
Your blade technique is impressive.

190
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,040
Can you teach me a few moves
for self-defense?

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Sure.

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,270
Let's see what you can do first.

193
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,160
Are you a monkey? All you do is run.

194
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,550
I can't beat you,

195
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,080
so I have to run.

196
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,740
Still, you've got some good moves.

197
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,630
Want to learn? I can teach you.

198
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,630
This is called parkour.

199
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,900
If you follow my method

200
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,750
and build up
your core strength training,

201
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,690
you can pick up parkour quickly.

202
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,840
What is it?

203
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,390

I heard from my master

207
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,440
that once a person harbors a thought,

208
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,390
feelings soon follow.

of parkour as you eat.

216
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,230
Parkour

217
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,910
is not just about the burst
of strength when climbing,

218
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,910
but the release of force on landing.

219
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,870
That's how you protect yourself.

220
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,840
Just look at you.

221
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,160
Moving stiffly up and down.

222
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,840
Your body rides on sheer momentum.

223
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,440

I could never be like you.

230
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,010
When I was little,
my parents didn't care for me.

231
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,250
It was my grandmother who raised me.

232
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,860
She kept a close watch on me.

233
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,070
And I kept wanting to run away.

234
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,080
But every time, she dragged me back.

235
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,410
Scolding and punishment
always followed.

236
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,240
So I told myself:

237
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,020
I must grow up quickly

238
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,520
and leave her.

239
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,870
Later on,

240
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,050
Grandmother passed away.

241
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,400
It was then that I realized

242
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,910
just how much I couldn't bear
to part with her.

243
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,320
Someone told me

244
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,120
that I mustn't cry.

245
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,770
If I shed tears,

246
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,290
Grandmother wouldn't leave in peace.

247
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,670
So, I held it in,

248
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,200
refusing to cry.

249
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,080
One day, I couldn't hold it back anymore

250
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,930

I suppose

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,790
this must be the Wang Heng you spoke of.

278
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,670
I am Wang Heng.

279
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,240
Isn't this the young lady
who broke the wood?

I was hoping to have a chat with Qi,

285
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
but I have matters to discuss
with the Village Chief.

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,870
Listen.

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,830
If a young lady doesn't like you,

why would she risk her own safety
for you?

Back in Hongnong,
when you were falsely accused,

301
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,540
my senior
helped you investigate at once.

302
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,200
Could it be there's some spark
between you two?

303
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,840
No, absolutely not.

304
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,600

305
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
She is my senior.

Any matters of her feelings
go through me first.

307
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,460

308
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,560
show some stance?

309
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,720
Aren't you short on money?

310
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,840
If your senior and I end up together,

311
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,320
shouldn't you show some courtesy
to your future brother-in-law?

312
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,200
Let's keep our affairs separate.

313

Don't stir up trouble again.

326
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,600
Rest assured, Lord Gong.

327
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,060

332
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,900
There's a lord who wishes to meet you.

333
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,350
Who might that be?

334
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,970
You'll know when you get there.

335
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,390

It's late.

339
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,270
I didn't expect you
to still have such refined taste.

349
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,200
you must be Lord Wang Heng.

350
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,380
You know me?

351
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,570
Lord Wang assists the Duke of Changyi

352
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,000
and has achieved much.

353
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,920

now coming to the capital,

356
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,970
you must be aiming
to achieve grand ambitions.

357

If things continue this way,

358
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,610
one day you may be appointed
