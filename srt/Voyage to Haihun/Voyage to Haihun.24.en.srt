=Episode 24=

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,710
(On the 14th day
of the 8th month, 74 BC,)

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,600
(28th day of the 6th month,
Yuanping Year 1,)

32
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,550
(the 27th day
since Liu He ascended the throne,)

33
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,610
(summoned by the Empress Dowager,)

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,700
(Liu He knew his fate
could no longer be changed,)

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,200
(but there was nothing he could do.)

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,120
(As he stepped into the hall,)

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,760
(he saw the Empress Dowager
sitting under the armored curtains,)

38
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,760
(and all officials
had long been waiting there.)

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,370
(It felt like a judgment
that had awaited for ages.)

40
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,630
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,360
All officials have gathered in the hall.

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,200
Lord Huo.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,030
Do you mean to depose me?

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,150
- I...
- As the Great General,

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,840
you've mobilized troops
to slaughter commoners.

46
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,810
How should such a crime be judged?

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,710
Your Majesty,
you mustn't make such false accusations.

48
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,710
False accusations?

49
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,710
Right now, are your troops

50
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,000
outside Wucheng Village?

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,640
Wucheng Village is full
of suspicious wandering heroes,

52
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,730
plotting rebellion.

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,310
I sent soldiers to suppress them

54
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,630
for the peace of the Han.

55
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,100
I summoned those heroes

56
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,090
in Wucheng Village.

57
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,240
Withdraw your troops now.

58
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,740
Since you ascended the throne,

59
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,310
you've abandoned
benevolence and filial piety.

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Your continuous reckless acts

61
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,370
have already endangered the realm.

62
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,980
And now,
you ask me to spare those traitors.

63
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,820
This is utterly absurd.

64
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,190
They hold the realm close to heart,

65
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,190
wishing to serve the Court.

66
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,250
Yet you, as the Great General,

67
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,630
block them at every turn.

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,470
It must be because you feel guilty.

69
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,400
The city is filled with troops.

70
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,840
Why would you employ men
of unknown origin?

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
Who do the troops in the city obey,

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,440
me or you?

73
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,390
The soldiers naturally answer to you.

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
Good.

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,190
Then, I command them to withdraw.

76
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,250
Your Majesty,

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,040
if you so readily trust
these treacherous men,

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,160
do you know the consequences?

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,640
I'm risking my life to urge you
not to repeat your mistakes.

80
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,570
As I expected,

81
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,960
the soldiers

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,320
still

83
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,150
heed only your command.

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,520
You leave me with no choice.

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,240
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,790
Please don't.

87
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,990
- Your Majesty.
- Don't!

88
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,910
Withdraw the troops.

89
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,930
Your Majesty.

90
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,360
You want me to relinquish the throne.

91
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Very well.

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,980
I shall grant you that.

93
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,030
The throne is not something

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,210
to be treated as a game.

95
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,570
Isn't this exactly
what you loyalists wished for?

96
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,950
Fine.

97
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,160
I can step down.

98
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,060
But I have two conditions.

99
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,910
First,

100
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,260
withdraw your troops
from Wucheng Village at once.

101
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,160
Second,

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,190
the men from Changyi in the Palace

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,160
must not be harmed in the slightest.

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,430
Your Majesty, please behave yourself.

105
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,850
Stop making mistakes.

106
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,600
If my blood stains here today,

107
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,190
how will later generations speak of it?

108
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,100
The Great General, Huo Guang,

109
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,040
failed to force Liu He to abdicate

110
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,760
and was blinded by greed and ambition,

111
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,450
forcing Liu He to his death

112
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,880
right there in the hall.

113
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,800
Aren't you known

114
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,580
for putting the Han above all?

115
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,870
If the history books

116
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,000
were to record this incident,

117
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,240
what would they say?

118
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Your Majesty.

119
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,980
Withdraw the troops.

120
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,420
Alright.

121
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Guards.

122
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,330
Pass down the order to retreat.

123
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,600
- Great General, bad news.
- Speak.

124
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
A sudden battle broke out
in Wucheng Village.

125
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,640
Flames rose high into the sky.

126
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,390
It's now nothing but scorched earth.

127
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,240
What?

128
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,900
No one in the village survived.

129
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,630
Your Majesty.

130
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,920
I believe...

131
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,760
Huo Guang.

132
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,240
You slaughtered the innocent.

133
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,970
I sentence you to death.

134
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,580
You are no longer the Emperor.

135
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,700
You've lost that right.

136
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,160
Your Majesty.

137
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,750
I believe

138
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,990
Liu He cannot bear
the Mandate of Heaven.

139
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,310
He cannot serve

140
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,000
the ancestors

141
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,360
or treat the common folk with kindness.

142
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,600
It is only right

143
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,040
to depose him.

144
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,170
I, as the Prime Minister,
have a memorial to present.

145
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,350
Since His Majesty ascended the throne,

146
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,800
during the morning period,

147
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,480
he refused to have a vegetarian diet

148
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
and indulged in wine and revelry,

149
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,140
so that all rites were abandoned.

150
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,950
By the 27th day,

151
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,100
the offices have been requisitioned

152
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,760
for 1,127 items with tokens.

153
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,010
On the way to Chang'an,
he once seized common women.

154
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,350
(They're all dead.)

155
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120
We repeatedly remonstrated with him,

156
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,430
(They're all dead.)

157
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,820
but he turned a deaf ear,

158
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,430
acting with unchecked arrogance,

159
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,630
and growing worse by the day.

160
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,190
He indulges in immoral conduct.

161
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,680
(They're all dead.)

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,430
His self-discipline has collapsed.

163
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,870
I fear the realm
will soon fall into chaos.

164
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,750
Thus, I risk my life today to speak up.

165
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,810
Your Majesty, please decide.

166
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Your Majesty.

167
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,750
I second this petition.

168
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,670
Approved.

169
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,020
It is said that the Emperor,
with seven loyal advisors,

170
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,810
though unworthy,

171
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
will not lose the realm.

172
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,300
Now, not one able minister remains.

173
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,360
All are fickle and follow the wind.

174
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,450
The officials of Changyi

175
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,990
have served without ability

176
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,800
and given false service to the state.

177
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,710
General Han.

178
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
Yes.

179
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,510
Arrest and imprison them all at once.

180
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,480
Execute them today.

181
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,870
Surround them all.

182
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,480
Seize all

183
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,740
the remaining traitors.

184
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,320
His Majesty has abdicated,

185
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
yet the realm outweighs the ruler.

186
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,020
Therefore,

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,040
I would rather forsake His Majesty

188
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,270
than betray the realm.

189
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,550
I can no longer remain by your side.

190
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,880
Your Majesty,

191
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
please take care.

192
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,990
(On the 27th day)

193
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,750
(of Liu He's reign in 74 BC,)

194
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,660
(he was deposed
by Great General Huo Guang.)

195
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,000
(When Huo Guang looked
at Liu He trembling in fear)

196
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,160
(and saw his anxious back,)

197
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,520
(he suddenly felt a pang of compassion.)

198
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,870
(He understood)

199
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,130
(Liu He simply lacked the ability
to bear the weight of the realm,)

200
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,960
(yet he was not a man
of great treachery.)

201
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,950
(As long as Liu He remained alive,)

202
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,170
(Huo Guang could answer
to Emperor Wu's dying wish)

203
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,430
(and preserve his name
as a loyal minister.)

204
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,640
Indecision

205
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,750
leads to chaos.

206
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,180
Indecision

207
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,500
leads to chaos.

208
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,720
Indecision

209
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,220
leads to chaos.

210
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,480
Indecision

211
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,810
leads to chaos.

212
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,580
Indecision

213
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,010
leads to chaos.

214
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,590
Indecision

215
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,270
leads to chaos.

216
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,020
Indecision

217
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,730
leads to chaos.

218
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,180
Indecision

219
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,790
leads to chaos.

220
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,100
Indecision

221
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,600
leads to chaos.

222
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
Indecision

223
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,050
leads to chaos.

224
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,480
Indecision

225
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,370
leads to chaos.

226
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,070
Indecision

227
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,770
leads to chaos.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,350
Indecision

229
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,910
leads to chaos.

230
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,880
Indecision

231
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,280
leads to chaos.

232
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,880
Indecision

233
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,440
leads to chaos.

234
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,230
Indecision

235
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,800
leads to chaos.

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
Indecision

237
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,410
leads to chaos.

238
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,590
Head to Wucheng Village.

239
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,240
Hyah!

240
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,010
Hyah!

241
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,090
Hurry, run!

242
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,000
You're sent by Huo Guang, right?

243
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,790
He deposed me just to make it easier
to kill me, right?

244
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,010
Come on!

245
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,610
I have never known fear.

246
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,680
Hyah!

247
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,550
(If I hadn't told Liu He the end
written in history,)

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,940
(he might not have rushed into action,)

249
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,670
(and history might've taken
a different turn.)

250
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,710
(I thought
I could alter the course of fate,)

251
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,950
(but I only made the ending
far more tragic.)

252
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,240
Liu He,

253
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,600
I'll save you

254
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,000
once more.
