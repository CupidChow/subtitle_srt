Lord Wang.

31
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,050
Lord Wang.

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,600
Milord, Lord Huo wants to

33
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,640
see you now.

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,460
Alright, let's go.

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
(History records say,)

36
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,710
(his strides are all the same.)

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,920
(Is that true or not?)

38
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,150
One.

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,050
Two.

40
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,910
Three.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,880
One.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,890
Two.

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
Three.

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
One.

45
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,030
Two.

46
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,990
Three.

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,120
(He even steps right into puddles.)

48
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,240
(He truly has OCD.)

49
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,470
Ninety-six.

50
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,470
Ninety-seven.

51
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,590
Ninety-eight.

52
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,710
Ninety-nine.

53
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,750
One hundred.

54
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,030
Lord Wang, you've been waiting long.

55
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,470
It's my duty.

56
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,870
Morning, Lord Huo.

57
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,360
From now on, every ten days,

58
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,990
you'll discuss state affairs
with the generals.

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,870
Lord Wang, be sure to be there on time.

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,710
Mm.

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,010
We're to discuss the defense arrangements

62
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,530
for the entry
of the Duke of Changyi's into the city.

63
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,460
I shall keep that in mind, milord.

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,040
Come with me.

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,620
Lord Huo, after you.

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,010
One, two.

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,600
Move.

68
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,720
One, two, three.

69
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,560
Good morning, milords.

70
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,260
Good morning, Lord Huo.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,870
Come, come.

72
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,390
Allow me to introduce everyone.

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,800
This is Lord Wang Heng.

74
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,910
And this is

75
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,040
General of the Chariots Zhang Anshi.

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,560
(Zhang Anshi, General of the Chariots)

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,210
General of the Frontier Fan Mingyou.

78
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,710
(Fan Mingyou, General of the Frontier)

79
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,910
Front General Han Zeng.

80
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,940
(Han Zeng, Front General)

81
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,800
Rear General Zhao Chongguo.

82
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,540
(Zhao Chongguo, Rear General)

83
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,520
I'm recently appointed.

84
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,280
I ask for your guidance, Generals.

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,590
Please bear with me.

86
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,960
Generals, please be seated.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,910
Generals.

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,000
The Late Emperor's funeral is imminent.

89
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,960
The New Emperor will soon ascend the throne.

90
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,900
We must tighten security around the Palace.

91
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,840
The foremost agenda

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,990
of today's meeting

93
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,310
is the defense arrangements of the entry

94
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,240
of the Duke of Changyi into the city.

95
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,940
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

96
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,240
This mansion in Chang'an...

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,680
I never came here as a child.

98
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,720
It's quite grand.

99
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,540
Qingge, where are you going?

100
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,920
Slow down.

101
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,390
(Strange and peculiar,)

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,720
(and even ignoring me.)

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,950
Duke, you've had a long journey.

104
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,600
You should rest early.

105
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,830
Where are you going?

106
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,240
I've settled things with Huo Guang.

107
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,540
He gave me an honorary title.

108
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,680
Wait for my word.

109
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,050
Wang just arrived and already got a post.

110
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,070
Could he be one of Huo Guang's men?

111
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,130
That's impossible.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
I believe in Heng.

113
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
He's highly capable,

114
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,570
so it's natural.

115
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,600
He must have his reasons for doing this.

116
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,720
We just need to trust him.

117
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,750
What worries me most right now

118
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,680
is not Wang Heng.

119
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,800
Then who?

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
You.

121
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,400
Me?

122
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,060
I am Imperial Censor Yan Yannian.

123
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,510
(Yan Yannian)
Greetings, Duke.

124
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,530
It's quite late for a visit to me.

125
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,000
What brings you here?

126
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,270
A family matter.

127
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,390
Please, Duke of Changyi, step aside.

128
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,700
I'm here to discipline my daughter.

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,150
Your daughter?

130
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,060
You just said your surname is Yan.

131
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,120
But her surname is Xu.

132
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,320
Her given name is Yan Luozhu.

133
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,590
Father.

134
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,400
Say no more.

135
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
Qingge.

136
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,560
I'll be right back.

137
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,870
What's happened?

138
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,550
I've been away for many years

139
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,800
and haven't seen my father for long.

140
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,600
I'll return home first.

141
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
I'll come back in a few days.

142
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,250
Alright.

143
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,380
Let me walk you out.

144
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
- Mm.
- Let's go.

145
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,310
So your name is Yan Luozhu.

146
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,040
After all this time, I just found out.

147
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,160
My given name is Yan Luozhu.

148
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,510
My father sent me away when I was young.

149
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,630
So you feel sadder
the closer we get to Chang'an.

150
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,410
It's because of that.

151
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,220
Mm.

152
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,660
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

153
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,550
Duke, you just arrived in Chang'an.

154
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,070
Be careful with your words and actions.

155
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,270
As an Imperial Censor,

156
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,700
it is my duty

157
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,070
to watch over your every word and deed.

158
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,460
Father.

159
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Could you please say less?

160
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,430
I'll go back with you now.

161
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,660
Have a proper talk with Lord Yan.

162
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,720
I'll come find you later.

163
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,390
Just stay in the mansion, okay?

164
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,230
Giddy-up!

165
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,470
Lord Yan.

166
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,270
So you've met

167
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,360
Wang Heng before?

168
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,080
I have not.

169
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,090
My lord, Lady Luofu's belongings are ready.

170
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,480
Bring Yanfu out.

171
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,530
- Yes, my lord.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,430
Why are you sending her away?

173
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,770
We're caught in the chaos of Chang'an.

174
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,390
Crown Prince has plotted rebellion.

175
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,660
But we haven't been involved.

176
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,500
The realm is in chaos

177
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,920
and there's the witchcraft affair.

178
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,820
Sending her away is the only way
to keep her safe.

179
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
I don't want to leave Chang'an.

180
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,910
Why must you send me away?

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,840
My lady.

182
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,750
Get her in.

183
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,960
I don't want to go.

184
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,080
I don't want to go.

185
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,880
I don't want to leave Chang'an.

186
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,830
I'm not leaving.

187
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,510
What are you staring at?

188
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
Get inside already.

189
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,130
Has anything changed at home?

190
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,090
Nothing much since Mother passed away.

191
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,360
But all the servants are replaced.

192
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,320
All men are born with eyes and ears.

193
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,320
Eyes and ears breed secrets.

194
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,000
Where there are secrets,
there is a hidden world.

195
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,320
This world is vast.

196
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,030
Isn't that normal?

197
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,760
But the one I'm talking about is different.

198
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,480
This is the Imperial Court.

199
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,890
The tides of officialdom

200
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,500
rise and fall with the court.

201
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,750
Born into this vast world,

202
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,550
one ought to see the world.

203
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,960
If one's life is spent as a caged bird,

204
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,240
how pitiful that'd be?

205
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,240
How long do you plan to keep messing around?

206
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,220
The Duke will ascend the throne soon.

207
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,990
I trust you have records of the matters

208
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,920
of misconduct among the officials.

209
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,320
What has that to do with you or me?

210
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,380
Father.

211
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,220
You have always been upright,

212
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,660
serving the realm, so why would you…

213
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,030
Chang'an has never truly known peace.

214
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,460
The court is no place

215
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,310
for games.

216
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,320
No matter the wealth or glory one holds,

217
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,540
one careless move,

218
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,860
and the whole game is lost.

219
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,920
In an instant, it all turns to the past.

220
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,080
Everything is ruined.

221
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,050
Such glory and wealth
are meant for the officials.

222
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,590
It has nothing to do with the commoners.

223
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,620
Yet some officials insist

224
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,620
on claiming everything,

225
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,840
getting caught in it deeper.

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,120
Once you're forced out,
the price is heavy.

227
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,730
If you lack the resolve
to fight til the end,

228
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,890
then don't step into this mire.

229
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,880
Do not interfere with me.

230
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,000
I have my own plan.

231
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,230
Father.

232
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,130
Is there someone
you'd risk your life to protect?

233
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't care about others.

234
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,670
But I have one.

235
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Is it truly worth it?

236
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,920
It is worth it.

237
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,280
Father.

238
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
I beg you.

239
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,910
Just this once.

240
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,200
But

241
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,150
you must promise me one thing.

242
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,060
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

243
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,920
Qingge.

244
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,290
Come here.

245
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,920
Take a look.

246
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,470
What is this?

247
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,170
I asked my father
for the records of officials.

248
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,520
To secure your throne,

249
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,360
you'll need them.

250
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,260
Thank you so much.

251
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,360
Mm.

252
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,080
Also, Duke,

253
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,000
after you ascend the throne,

254
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,340
you must rein in your willfulness.

255
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,360
Chang'an is nothing like Changyi.

256
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,550
So many eyes are on you.

257
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,080
Do not misuse your status
to act recklessly.

258
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,770
Be open to all counsel.

259
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,720
Do not insist on your willful ways.

260
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,520
In all matters, think ahead

261
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,080
and plan carefully.

262
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,920
And also,

263
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,000
steer clear of

264
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,570
excessive drinking and indulgence.

265
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,560
They'd cloud your judgment.

266
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,970
Mind your rest and meals,

267
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,020
so your health stays sound.

268
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,860
Ah,

269
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,790
why are you reminding me like this,

270
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,390
as if saying farewell?

271
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,360
I am but a common folk.

272
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,510
When you ascend the imperial throne,

273
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,320
the difference between us would be vast.

274
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,800
By then,

275
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,960
you might not heed my words,

276
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,260
nor could I always remain by your side.

277
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,350
That's simple.

278
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,270
Once I ascend the throne,

279
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,600
I'll grant you a post.

280
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,770
You choose.

281
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,670
A woman like me could not

282
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,200
serve as an official.

283
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,720
Why not?

284
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,270
You care so much about my daily life.

285
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,790
Why not

286
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,320
make you the Empress?

287
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,480
Then you can watch over me every day

288
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,320
and take care of me.

289
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,940
Truly?

290
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,870
Truly.

291
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
You've been my dearest buddy
since childhood.

292
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,960
We share blessings together,

293
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,120
so why not?

294
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Buddy?

295
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,150
Heng says the closest friends

296
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,330
should be called "buddy".

297
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,240
My lady, it's getting late.

298
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,230
Oh...

299
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,040
Are you headed out?

300
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,790
Will you be back?

301
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,860
I haven't been back long.
My father plans to

302
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,120
take me to visit some relatives.

303
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,920
I'll take my leave now.

304
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,350
Mm.

305
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,390
Duke.

306
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,630
Mind your meals and rest.

307
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Stay in good health.

308
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,390
And also...

309
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,550
Oh, you already said that just now.

310
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,850
I've remembered everything.

311
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,790
Go on now, come back early.

312
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll be waiting for you.

313
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,770
My lady.

314
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,440
A carriage is waiting outside the city.

315
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,580
It's getting late.

316
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,550
We should set off now.

317
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,390
Let's go.

318
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,590
And also...

319
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,480
Duke, don't forget me.

320
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
Steamed bun for sale.

321
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,550
Meat-filled steamed bun.

322
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,790
Fresh meat-filled steamed bun.

323
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,750
Sir, care to try one?

324
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,870
Sir, take a look over here.

325
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,180
Fresh from the steamer.

326
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,470
I don't want to leave Father and Mother.

327
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,340
Have they decided to abandon me?

328
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,320
I can be good and obedient.

329
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,360
As long as they can stay by my side.

330
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,440
They don't want me anymore.

331
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
That's not true, my lady.

332
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
We will return again.

333
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,510
- Be good.
- I don't want...

334
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,670
I don't want to.

335
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,560
Be good, my lady.

336
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,940
We will return again.

337
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Wait a moment, my lady.

338
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,320
It's an inspection.

339
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Next.

340
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,020
The Imperial Palace has its own rules.

341
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,010
Once you're in it, better follow them.

342
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,860
It's done, my lady.

343
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,360
We can leave now.

344
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,510
My lady.

345
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,270
My lady? She's run off.

346
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,600
She's gone. Quickly, find her.

347
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,440
My lady.

348
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,980
Hey, where are you going?

349
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,980
We're setting off already.

350
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,510
- Where are you going?
- I...

351
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,350
Get in the carriage.

352
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,710
Don't cause me trouble.

353
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,740
Hurry and get on.

354
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,310
Alright, everyone inside.

355
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,840
Come on, move quickly.

356
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,850
Keep up at the back.

357
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,280
Hurry, hurry.

358
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,400
All lined up.

359
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,270
Listen carefully, everyone.

360
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,830
When you meet Empress Dowager, be smart.

361
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,810
If you provoke her displeasure,

362
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,150
you might just lose your head.

363
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,400
