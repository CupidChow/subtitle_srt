30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,460
(Duke of Changyi's Manor)
Beautiful lanterns!

31
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,960
Duke, what are you doing?

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,790
Oh? Wearing a mask for the match?

33
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,560
If the riders knew
I was competing in person,

34
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,980
how would they give their all?

35
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,990
Well.

36
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,760
I shall first ride masked

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,350
and reveal my identity

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,760
after the race is done.

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,180
Wouldn't that be quite the tale
for all to speak of?

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,580
I haven't agreed to let you
leave the city for the race yet.

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,560
Isn't it bound to happen?

42
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,070
I heard if you're in the top three,

43
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,740
you can compete
with a mysterious figure.

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,960
Who is this mysterious figure?

45
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,030
Well...

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,920
It's said to be someone
respected in Changyi.

47
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,050
It could even be the Duke.

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,620
Get back to your work.

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,720
Two strings of five-zhu coins.

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,380
One silver ingot.

51
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,790
Lord Wang.

52
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,080
The voting results are out.

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,280
Xu Qingge ranks first among the riders.

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,120
Xu Pingjun takes second place.

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
Is the list completely tallied?

56
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,430
Yeah.

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,910
I don't think so.

58
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,270
Here.

59
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,680
Lord Wang, what's this about?

60
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,430
Since everyone's so fired up,

61
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,080
as the event organizer,

62
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,980
we can't just stand by and watch, right?

63
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,340
I'll have to join the race myself.

64
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,400
Oh, I see.

65
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,710
Lord Wang, ten votes.

66
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,840
Yes, Lord Wang.

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
Now, that's enough to qualify.

68
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,910
Good.

69
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,870
Lord Wang.

70
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,960
Here's our roster. Please have a look.

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,640
Hold it higher.

72
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,750
Be smart.

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,030
Who put it like this?

74
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,970
Who can see from here?

75
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,030
Well.

76
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,910
This, this, this.

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,020
And this one.

78
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,690
It lacks

79
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,150
some feelings.

80
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,200
Do you get me?

81
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,570
Can you make the title bigger
yet somehow a bit smaller?

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,150
Go, find me the best artist you can.

83
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,240
I have another meeting.

84
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,270
When I'm back,

85
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,770
I want to see eight versions.

86
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,890
Eight versions?

87
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,190
What to do?

88
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,030
I heard that Li from the street corner

89
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,430
booked the entire racetrack.

90
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,910
By the time I tried to book it,
it was too late.

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,750
Not too late.

92
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,630
Really?

93
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,840
I actually want

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,280
the prime ad spot on the horse today.

95
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,240
After all, the space is fixed.

96
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,710
But the horse is alive and moving.

97
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,590
Still not here yet?

98
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,540
- Where's he?
- Yeah.

99
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,240
- Right?
- Everyone.

100
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
Please, calm down.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,880
Lord Wang will be here any moment.

102
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,720
Thank you for waiting.

103
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

104
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,080
At last, you're here.

105
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,870
The previous meeting ran long.

106
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,870
Shall we begin?

107
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,960
Come, come.

108
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
May I speak now?

109
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Go ahead.

110
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,800
Everyone,

111
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,310
this is

112
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,000
the ad space I've prepared

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,470
for our esteemed patrons.

114
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,680
All prime spots for display.

115
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,080
Take a look here.

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,910
The horse's neck,

117
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,220
the horse's belly,

118
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,390
and the most expensive spot here,

119
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,200
which is called

120
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,720
the Flattery Seat.

121
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
The Flattery Seat?

122
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,920
Advertising on a horse's rear?

123
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,800
Isn't that a bad omen?

124
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,070
Exactly.

125
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,800
Oh, dear.

126
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,890
Don't underestimate that spot.

127
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,240
It is

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
a profound art.

129
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,160
Profound? How?

130
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,270
Care to enlighten us?

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,750
It's profound

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
because it's big.

133
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,360
Alright, alright.

134
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,520
Any generous patron here

135
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,160
wants to take the Flattery Seat?

136
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,400
I'll offer 200 qian.

137
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
200!

138
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
- 500!
- 500.

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,840
- 600!
- 600!

140
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,240
- 800!
- 900! 900!

141
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Oh.

142
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,000
Gentlemen there.

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,560
Anyone offering more than 1000?

144
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,430
1100!

145
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,310
1200!

146
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,390
Everyone, don't rush.

147
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,360
Calm yourselves.

148
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480
Lord Wang will be here any moment.

149
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,590
Where is he?

150
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,950
Listen to me.

151
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,430
Here he comes!

152
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,270
Why the urgency?

153
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,590
They can't get the VVIP tickets.

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,800
So, they're making a ruckus.

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Why not release more VVIP tickets?

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
Exactly.

157
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,580
That's right.

158
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,190
We have money.

159
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,130
Why can't we buy them?

160
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,260
Yes, why can't we buy them?

161
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,360
Exactly.

162
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Everyone, quiet down.

163
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,040
Hear me out.

164
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,060
What is a VIP?

165
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,240
An honored guest.

166
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,190
And what is a VVIP?

167
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,420
A guest of unmatched honor.

168
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,070
If I just add more tickets,

169
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,800
I'd be offending these VVIP guests.

170
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,070
I cannot afford that.

171
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,390
We all pay for our tickets.

172
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,190
It has nothing to do with offense.

173
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,670
- Exactly.
- Right.

174
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Friends, listen up.

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,270
Let me be frank with you.

176
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,190
Every single VVIP ticket

177
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,750
was bought up by the Duke.

178
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,040
And they decided the number.

179
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,750
I truly can't add more.

180
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,190
Why should they get to buy them all?

181
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,270
However,

182
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,120
I never expected you
to be so enthusiastic.

183
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,800
As the organizer, I'm truly heartened.

184
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,920
Today,

185
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,560
even if it means taking a great risk,

186
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,720
I'll make sure
to bring the ticket prices down.

187
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,430
If you can't get VVIP tickets,

188
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,760
I'll give VIP tickets at half price.

189
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,880
Great!

190
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,560
Oh, my goodness.

191
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,120
Milord.

192
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,160
You mustn't do this!

193
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,510
Please, rise.

194
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,160
Milord.

195
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,430
These ticket prices

196
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,480
were set by the Duke.

197
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,410
If you change it without permission,

198
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,540
you'll be deceiving the Duke!

199
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,500
Even so,

200
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,350
I must secure
some benefits for my family.

201
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,660
Great, great.

202
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,510
In that case,

203
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,600
I'd be your accomplice.

204
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,960
That's punishable by beheading.

205
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,600
They are all my family.

206
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,560
If they don't speak up,

207
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
how would the Duke ever know?

208
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,920
Exactly.

209
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,830
Do you not trust my family?

210
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,870
Yes, yes, of course.

211
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,970
Milord, please think twice.

212
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
In that case,

213
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,920
I'll cover the cost for the benefits

214
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,190
for my family.

215
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,400
Oh, my.

216
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,430
My dear family.

217
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,120
Place your orders right now,

218
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,390
and enjoy the best deal I can offer.

219
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,360
Three, two, one.

220
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,670
On sale.

221
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,440
(Fifty tickets left for today)
On sale!

222
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,420
I'll take one.

223
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,800
Give me one.

224
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
I want five.

225
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,080
Got it!

226
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,070
Got it!

227
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,600
Pass me the biscuit.

228
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,440
Oh.

229
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,750
The gold biscuit.

230
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,600
The gold biscuit.

231
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,550
Oh.

232
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Heng.

233
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,600
What brings you here?

234
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,900
Something important to discuss.

235
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,150
Another meeting?

236
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,070
I've been in meetings since the morning.

237
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,510
Another meeting without lunch?

238
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,480
No.

239
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,080
Go to the Duke's mansion.

240
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,760
The officials want to see me?

241
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,220
You've achieved
remarkable results lately.

242
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,630
I didn't expect you
to possess such extraordinary talent

243
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,380
at such a young age.

244
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,000
Truly a blessing for our people.

245
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,370
I used to think that I had made

246
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,900
- Let me.
- a mistake.

247
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,470
Lord Gong, you...

248
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,950
You flatter me.

249
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,650
This is but my duty.

250
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,220
It's hardly worth mentioning.

251
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,740
Earlier, the Duke discussed with me

252
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,480
holding the finals of the horse race
outside the city.

253
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,890
I've made all the arrangements.

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,980
(At last, it's settled.)

255
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,630
Thanks to the Duke.

256
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,080
Thanks for your kindness, Lord Gong.

257
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,080
I am truly delighted.

258
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,440
I am truly delighted.

259
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
Ha ha ha.

260
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,560
Lord Wang, since you're busy,

261
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,510
I won't keep you here any longer.

262
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,120
Then I'll just

263
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,440
take my leave.

264
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,710
Alright.

265
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,630
I'll visit you another day.

266
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,630
You'll be most welcome.

267
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,390
(Wang Heng is no ordinary man.)

268
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,550
Hey, Heng, he agreed?

269
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,430
Yes.

270
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,150
We can have a horse race
outside the city?

271
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

272
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,930
Hey.

273
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,180
Why didn't you come with me?

274
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,640
I was so nervous on my own.

275
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,920
It's such an important matter.

276
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,630
How could I discuss it with Lord Gong?

277
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,960
But you can meet the Duke.

278
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,320
Why not

279
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,120
introduce me to him?

280
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,960
Well?

281
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,670
The Duke is still locked away.

282
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,870
None of us can see him.

283
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,320
I'll practice horse riding now.

284
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,220
Hey.

285
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,630
Lord Gong has agreed.

286
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,460
Let them handle the rest from here.

287
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
As for us,

288
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,790
we need a solid plan.

289
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,630
Why not drink

290
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,870
while we talk?

291
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,710
No way.

292
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
Practice comes first.

293
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,510
We can talk later.

294
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,270
If the plan's ready,
what's the point of a race?

295
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,220
It's just an extra fuss.

296
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,040
Regardless,

297
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,910
let's fuss first.

298
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,270
Oh, my.

299
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Wang.

300
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,960
Training so hard, are you?

301
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,170
Hey.

302
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,880
Don't even bring it up.

303
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,070
How could anyone eat this?

304
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,630
This is already not bad.

305
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,150
(If only I could hear a little tune)

306
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,420
(and sip some wine)

307
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,080
(with a bit of fried chicken.)

308
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,620
(Qingge Tavern)

309
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,390
Brothers.

310
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,030
Our grand plan is about to succeed.

311
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,510
Everything is ready.

312
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,270
Tonight,

313
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,790
we drink till dawn without stopping.

314
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,950
No one goes home sober.

315
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,270
No one goes home sober!

316
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,440
Big...

317
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,480
Big? Big what?

318
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,330
Big what?

319
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,510
I already told you.

320
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,230
When we're outside,

321
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,030
you should call me...

322
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,880
Qi.

323
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,790
Right.

324
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,960
Call me Qi.

325
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,590
You were wrong.

326
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,870
Drink.

327
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,870
Come on.

328
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,510
What's wrong?

329
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,590
Careful.

330
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,110
Oh.

331
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,890
Great.

332
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,790
I can't hold it.

333
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Zhang.

334
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
I'm going to the privy.

335
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,900
Go quickly.

336
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,000
Hurry back.

337
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,730
Where's Li Qi?

338
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,040
I'll go back to practice.

339
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
Wang.

340
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,690
Is this really necessary?

341
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,630
I'll race with the Duke.

342
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,430
I have to be able to keep up.

343
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,120
The Duke? A race?

344
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,160
That's right.

345
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,200
That's not right.

346
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,540
The Duke isn't joining the race.

347
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,310
Aren't we supposed

348
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,850
to use the race to make our escape?

349
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,920
Where's Qi Chang?

350
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,040
Huh?

351
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,360
Go, go, go!

352
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,320
Hurry, hurry!

353
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,480
Take the Duke with us!

354
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,320
No, no, wait.

355
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,550
Qi, let's go!

356
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,280
Go!

357
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
No, no, take the back door!

358
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,030
Back door! Back door!

359
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,710
Hey.

360
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,200
Stop grabbing the wine!

361
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,670
Go.

362
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,080
This carriage is going way too fast.

363
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
Slow down.

364
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,240
You've had fun, huh?

365
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,080
You sure run fast.

366
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,600
This young lady...

367
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,240
She's quite the beauty.

368
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,820
Anyone who came to support tonight

369
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,390
will be rewarded.

370
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,120
- I...
- Come on.

371
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,080
- Qi Chang.
- We...

372
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,620
I can't see the Duke at the race.

373
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,040
Why have you put me in it?

374
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,160
And why did you try to escape
during the race?

375
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,110
Well.

376
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Come on.

377
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,440
Come on!

378
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
Let me tell you something.

379
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,830
You've come at just the right time.

380
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,840
Now that you're here,

381
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,600
I can get on the carriage.

382
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,260
- Get on!
- I...

383
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
Stop it!

384
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,200
Hey.

385
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,150
Stop it!

386
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,030
Move aside!

387
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,870
Stop!

388
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you really leaving on your own?

389
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,830
Do you have money?

390
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,890
Do you even know the way?

391
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,780
Can you leave the city?

392
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,040
Yes.

393
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,480
I lied to you.

394
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,120
The Duke will not join the race.

395
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
Well now.

396
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,760
No more pretending.

397
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,080
The truth is out.

398
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,590
But there's a reason for it.

399
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,840
Lord Gong assigned a task to the Duke.

400
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,890
If he wishes to leave the city
for the race,

401
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,780
he must handle the horse affairs.

402
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,880
None of that

403
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,070
has anything

404
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,470
to do with me.

405
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,000
You deceived me.

406
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,080
That's what truly matters.

407
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,110
That's right.

408
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,240
If I were you, I'd be even angrier.

409
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,830
It's my fault
for oversimplifying things.

410
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,080
All I wanted was to escape with you.

411
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,880
I had it all planned out.

412
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,480
We'd use the horse race

413
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,750
to leave the city.

414
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,160
You couldn't ride, right?

415
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,460
Meeting the Duke was just a pretext,

416
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,290
so you could train your riding

417
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,750
and keep up with me.

418
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
Heng,

419
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,480
please understand my position.

420
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,670
I couldn't tell you the whole truth.

421
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,550
But you simply can't see the Duke.

422
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,240
And I betrayed the Duke
to leave with you.

423
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,750
I'm sincere.

424
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,920
Believe it or not.

425
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,390
Oh.

426
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,650
I just can't figure it out.

427
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,240
What's so special about seeing the Duke?

428
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,550
Doesn't he just show up

429
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,410
to present an award?

430
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,840
You care about things like that?

431
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,510
(You don't know a thing.)

432
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,270
Are you saying

433
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,270
the Duke will present the prize

434
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,550
on the day of the race?

435
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,390
That's right.

436
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,590
Good.

437
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,110
That's exactly what I care about.

438
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,510
Once I meet the Duke,

439
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,080
I can get things done.

440
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,180
What things?

441
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,410
It has nothing to do with you.

442
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,920
Go on.

443
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,320
What's the plan?

444
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,030
So,

445
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,080
you agreed?

446
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,110
Of course.

447
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,670
I've had it all planned.

448
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,230
You are

449
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,390
the son of the Qilin,

450
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,910
and I'm the Chosen One.

451
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,640
Once the horse affairs are settled,

452
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,120
we'll slip away from Changyi,

453
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,200
ride together to Chang'an,

454
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,910
reclaim the Qilin,

455
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,970
and see our wish fulfilled.

456
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,070
Wouldn't that be thrilling?

457
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,510
(Huh.)

458
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,510
(Once I meet Liu He,)

459
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,710
(I'll abandon you.)

460
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,600
(Fool.)

461
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Mm, well.

462
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,160
Not bad.

463
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
Mm.

464
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,740
(Chang'an, Yuanping Year 1)

465
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,140
(Emperor Zhao of Han)
(On the 5th of the 6th month, 74 BC,)

466
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,260
- (in the flourishing age,)
- I believe the Duke of Guangling,

467
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,580
- (a major event arose.)
- the fourth son of Emperor Wu,

468
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,200
- (The current ruler)
- the late Emperor's only full brother,

469
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,410
- (suddenly passed away.)
- should inherit the throne.

470
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,740
(Emperor Zhao of Han, Liu Fuling)

471
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,860
- (reigned for 13 years,)
- The Duke of Guangling is

472
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,790
- (and passed away at 21.)
- good at governance.

473
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,440
- (He left no heirs)
- The late Emperor favored him.

474
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,170
- (or an imperial decree,)
- The Duke of Guangling is most fitting.

475
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,050
(except for the 15-year-old
Empress Shangguan.)

476
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,030
Seconded.

477
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,800
(Empress Shangguan)
Seconded.

478
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,770
(Thus,)

479
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,810
- (who should ascend the throne)
- Seconded.

480
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,500
- (became the greatest dilemma.)
- Seconded.

481
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,910
The Duke of Guangling acts
without any regard for rules.

482
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,790
There are also rumors,

483
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,120
saying he's been mingling
in secret with a witch.

484
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,340
Such a man may not be a wise choice.

485
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,750
The Duke of Guangling
is that sort of man?

486
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,610
I did hear whispers about this
in years past.

487
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,670
Who should we choose then?

488
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Well...

489
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,910
(Huo Guang, Great General)

490
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,080
Empress Dowager,

491
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,670
I have received a memorial here.

492
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,250
Please grant it your reading.

493
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,590
Everyone,

494
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,750
Duke Tai of Zhou

495
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,200
and Duke Wen of Zhou

496
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,270
set aside the eldest son

497
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,070
and chose the most virtuous
for the sake of the realm.

498
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,030
Now that we gather here to decide

499
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,480
the heir to inherit the throne,

500
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,240
we must first weigh character
and ability.

501
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,030
How can we be bound
by rigid rites and laws?

502
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,880
Besides,

503
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,680
when Emperor Wu was still alive,

504
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,790
he didn't name

505
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,550
the Duke of Guangling as Crown Prince.

506
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
If you act like this,

507
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,680
are you going
against Emperor Wu's final wish?

508
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,590
Lord Huo,

509
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,880
as for the choice of successor,

510
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,280
I believe

511
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,740
you must have

512
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,560
given it careful thought.

513
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,970
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,

514
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,750
is the grandson of Emperor Wu,

515
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,510
born in the hometown
of Confucius and Mencius

516
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,640
and raised in the way of Confucianism.

517
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,160
If he were to inherit the throne,

518
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,380

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,780
