It hurts!

00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,620
Why have you stopped? Keep torturing her!

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,190
Oh, dear.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,060
What are we going to do?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,030
Gosh, how wicked.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,770
I am asking you a question! Is this grotesque object yours?

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,410
It is not!

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,280
I do not know.

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,610
You... you insolent wench. Are you saying it is not yours?

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,620
I do not know. I really do not know!

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,850
Then you do not care what happens to it?

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,960
You cannot do that. What a waste.

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,330
My goodness, it looks like a man's member.

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,060
That precious thing. How could they do that?

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,670
It is moving. Hey, it is moving!

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,270
- It is vibrating! - Is this thing possessed?

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,540
I shall use this on your body, this way and that.

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,340
I will test it out myself...

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,980
The Secret Royal Inspector is here!

26
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,890
My goodness! It is a Horse Pass. A Horse Pass?

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,190
A Horse Pass. A Horse Pass. A Horse Pass.

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,260
A Horse Pass.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,760
It was not me. No, oh my.

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,240
- What is going on? - That hurts.

31
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,370
Hit him harder!

32
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,770
How dare you strike a nobleman?

33
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,010
Hit him harder, harder!

34
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,610
Hit him harder, harder!

35
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,210
Gosh.

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,220
Darn it!

37
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,240
What the...

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,200
Make way for the Secret Royal Inspector!

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,410
The Secret Royal Inspector is handsome.

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,339
He reminds me of my younger self.

41
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,480
A real flower boy.

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,680
Young Lady. Now that I am here,

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
you have nothing to worry about.

44
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,820
My, he is so handsome.

45
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,190
"Ready? Just trust me now."

46
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,830
What is that sound?

47
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,530
- What is that strange sound? - Young Lady, what is this wicked...

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,000
- I think it is from over here. - My Lord.

49
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,060
"Should we go a little harder?"

50
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,240
- My Lord, that sound was not me. - Gosh.

51
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Pretty sure it is.

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,810
"Hot Guys Moaning" mode will play next.

53
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,870
It's coming from you.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,380
- I am dying of shame... - See? The sound is coming from her.

55
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,210
Rather than die of humiliation...

56
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,490
Just kill me!

57
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,749

(Episode 9: Dropping the Course)

59
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,390
Seriously? What was that?

60
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,900
Total humiliation. If that were me, I'd have checked the Han River temp.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,330
- What? Are they talking about me? - So then what happens?

62
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,910
The hero falls off a cliff. It's awesome.

63
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,080
- A cliff? You love when heroes die. - But only you think it's fun.

64
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,040
- Not true. Everyone loves that. - They're not talking about me.

65
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,080
- You saw the Everytime thing? - You mean Dildo Girl?

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,590
A CompSci major in my gen-ed class told me it's totally real.

67
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,460
If you blur her face, do it right. What even is that?

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,120
The half-assed job just makes her look more pathetic.

69
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,090
That video was hilarious, though.

70
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,960
Typical beta male, loving to see a girl humiliated.

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,270
Hey! No, it's not that. The video is just objectively funny.

72
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,300
- Campus Dildo Princess. - That dildo is huge.

73
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,640
- Reporting her. She broke a rule. - Dildo Girl, and Kang Min Hak?

74
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,510
- A sex toy at school is too much. - Her trying to explain is a joke.

75
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,009
She should've left. Why explain?

76
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,340
For your information, she's the top CompSci student.

77
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,310
What is this... What is all this?

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,730
Excuse me. This must be tough for you.

79
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Pardon?

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,540
I'm one of Min Hak's juniors.

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,940
This whole situation is pretty messed up.

82
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,640
Oh. Right.

83
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,680
Of all people to get mixed up with, it had to be a celebrity.

84
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
That must make it even tougher on you.

85
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,250
So, did he really have no idea what was inside?

86
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,850
You're saying Kang Min Hak knew?

87
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,420
No.

88
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,460
I'm heading to an event right now.

89
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,160
Today I started off with Jayjun's New Salmon Ampoule again...

90
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,130
to get my skin back in shape. And thanks to the PDRN in it,

91
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,170
it soothes damaged skin right away.

92
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,810
(You were great in the video)

93
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,140
(His biceps catching Dildo Girl were insane)

94
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,510
(That girl is totally getting cancelled)

95
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
(What's that got to do with Min Hak?)

96
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,450
I have to get going now, so I'm ending the stream here.

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Bye everyone!

98
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,860
Hey, people are saying San is done for.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,130
She's the Quiz King, not a celeb. It's embarrassing, but it'll pass.

100
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,170
If anything, you're the one who should be pissed off.

101
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,970
You're getting dragged into this whole "Dildo Girl" thing,

102
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,540
and they're leaving nasty comments. You have a great reputation.

103
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
That's why you get the benefit of the doubt.

104
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,020
Come on, man, don't you start talking like that.

105
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,620
There's nothing going on between you and the Quiz King, right?

106
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,420
It's not like that.

107
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,560
Right? I didn't think so.

108
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,660
A video of a woman in her twenties throwing a sex toy...

109
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,460
in a lecture hall went viral. If that were you, would you be okay?

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,700
Human social conventions are so exhausting.

111
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,640
- Trivial reason to drop class. - Trivial?

112
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,480
Are you familiar with the term "self-fulfilling prophecy?"

113
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,550
So, the idea that one's expectations cause them to act in ways...

114
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,990
that makes them come true? A psychology term, right?

115
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,220
Or in many myths, when someone hears the prophecy he'll kill his father.

116
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,330
And every extraordinary action they take to avoid it...

117
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,100
is what ironically leads them to actually killing their father.

118
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,930
Sometimes, the harder you try to avoid someone,

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,740
the closer you can ironically become.

120
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,200
Like a dildo hidden in a Banana Pouch.

121
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,440
But what does any of that have to do with my situation?

122
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,139
Human creativity takes a bad situation...

123
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,910
and makes it truly messed up.

124
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,250
Have you seen the view count?

125
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,690
Looking at the data alone,

126
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,420
some people would pay good money for that kind of attention.

127
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
How ironic!

128
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,360
I'm not an attention seeker. It's not a form of buzz marketing.

129
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,030
That phrase is so stale.

130
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,030
Buzz marketing.

131
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,770
That vibrations in a medium influence consumer desire...

132
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,510
is just common sense. It's like saying water is wet.

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,309
What's more interesting is destructive wave interference.

134
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,709
When one wave...

135
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,450
meets a perfectly opposing wave, they cancel each other out.

136
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,590
Destructive interference. Offset interference.

137
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,789
- These waves... - Are you trying to comfort me?

138
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,390
Or is this some new form of secondary victimization?

139
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,830
I don't subscribe to such extreme value judgments.

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,900
Value isn't a fixed definition. It isn't.

141
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,400
It's fluid. It's constantly changing.

142
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,599
Of course,

143
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,739
I'm not denying the pressure that comes from societal perception.

144
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,239
It's just that Korean society is one where a young woman...

145
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,540
expressing her own sexual desires...

146
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,940
is considered taboo. That's the kind of society it is.

147
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,009
Unless you declare you're done for,

148
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,280
you are not done for.

149
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,019
If you go and declare it,

150
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,490
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then you're really done for.

151
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,660
If you want to adopt that narrative and truly be screwed,

152
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,460
then that's just your own choice...

153
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,330
Can you please stop saying all the curse words?

154
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,570
Okay. That abdominal breathing, that was good.

155
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,800
When stressed, using this breathing to pass air over the vocal cords...

156
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,840
is good for your parasympathetic nerve.

157
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,840
A more dynamically-sound solution than dropping the class, right?

158
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,410
If you're done.

159
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,190
Some psycho actually did it.

160
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,160
This school is getting more and more grotesque.

161
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,230
Gosh, who put this up?

162
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,340
San's long-winded explanation just provoked everyone more.

163
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,770
Hey, you're here.

164
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,080
- Are you okay? Are you okay? - I hear the food's good today.

165
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
Let's go to the cafeteria. Come on.

166
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,010
They used superglue on this. Gosh.

167
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,050
- It's the meat special today. - Meat special. A meat...

168
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,460
Good grief. Look, your bag's wide open. Take it off.

169
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,690
What? Your hoodie is on inside out, too.

170
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,360
Take it off. You're so spaced out, Joo Yeon San.

171
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,830
- Joo Yeon San, pull up your pants. - My pants?

172
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,200
Look at this. You're wearing mismatched socks again.

173
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,910
Put this on. You really haven't been yourself since that day.

174
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,380
Can't blame you, though.

175
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,910
A dildo flew across the middle of the classroom, after all.

176
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,380
Hey, don't talk about the dildo in front of her.

177
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,450
You're the one who brought it up.

178
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
No, I didn't.

179
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,090
You haven't eaten yet, have you? Come on, let's go get some food.

180
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,050
- You must be starving. Let's go. - You were so cool in the lecture.

181
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,760
- Min Hak, hey! - Hi!

182
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Hey.

183
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,890
- Hey, Joo Yeon San. - Where are you going?

184
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,600
- What? - Hey, I said let's go eat!

185
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Hey!

186
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,070
- Hey, San! - Hey, Yeon San, are you okay?

187
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,140
San!

188
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,210
- Hey, leave her alone! - Help me.

189
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,770
Move, move, move!

190
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,780
- You okay? - I'm okay. Thank you.

191
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Unbelievable.

192
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,850
- Joo Yeon San? - Joo Yeon San!

193
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,450
Hey, isn't that Dildo Girl? Right, Dildo Princess.

194
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,260
- She's always mixed up with dildos. - That must be so humiliating.

195
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,170
Joo Yeon San.

196
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,870
I wonder if she's okay.

197
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Feeling guilty?

198
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,880
If only I hadn't tried to give it back to her during class.

199
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,150
It's not like you did it on purpose.

200
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,580
If only I hadn't grabbed her from behind like that.

201
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,950
It's not your fault. You only tried to keep her from falling.

202
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,390
If only I hadn't held on to her for so long.

203
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,120
Enough. Min Hak!

204
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,660
This is a small, dinky school in the boonies outside of Seoul.

205
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,930
Unless the school tries to pull off some ridiculous merger,

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,260
nothing exciting ever happens here.

207
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,230
Everyone's desperate for some drama.

208
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,170
But her getting involved with you, the biggest celebrity on campus...

209
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,600
- it's just really bad luck. - True.

210
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Right.

211
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,480
What if I show this to San?

212
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,810
Don't you think it might make her feel better?

213
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,780
What? Let me see. How is this supposed to...

214
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,090
Make her feel better by looking at your face?

215
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,020
No, the next page.

216
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,560
(Healthy, Honest, and Bold!)

217
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,130
Female Masturbation Special.

218
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,900
I actually learned a lot reading this.

219
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,500
Apparently, 97.1 percent of women have experience with masturbation,

220
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,970
and a good number of them use toys.

221
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,380
What if we show her it's not her, but those mocking her for her toy.

222
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,650
That they're the weird ones?

223
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,750
I figured San would be convinced by the numbers.

224
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,890
Min Hak.

225
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
Why do you think a magazine would run a special feature on this?

226
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,730
That they'd use so much page space to change perceptions means...

227
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,730
It means that most people still consider this issue...

228
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,440
something to be embarrassed about, don't you think?

229
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,610
- I see. - Being open about it's great.

230
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,110
In this case, the situation is a bit...

231
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,610
more complicated.

232
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,650
I tend to overreact, don't I?

233
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,650
Whenever you're around,

234
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,090
people's first instinct is to pull out their phones.

235
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,130
Look, midterms are next week. This'll blow over once exams start.

236
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,130
Quiet down, my foot.

237
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,170
(Did you guys see Dildo Girl?)

238
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,310
(So freaking gross!)

239
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,440
(Such a perv. Makes me wanna puke.)

240
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,310
(- Look at Professor Eum's face! - I'd expel a student for that.)

241
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,920
Find the average settlement amount for suing over malicious comments.

242
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,290
And the legal fees, too.

243
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,350
(For malicious comments lawsuits, )

244
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
(here are the costs.)

245
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,260
(From thousands to over ten thousand dollars)

246
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,330
Ten thousand dollars?

247
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,870
Best countries for a Korean woman in her 20s whose life is ruined,

248
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,570
and calculate the cost and time it would take to relocate.

249
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,840
(That would depend on your criteria for "a good country to live in.")

250
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,910
Gosh, forget about some grand plan.

251
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,240
Just tell me how to clear my head.

252
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,210
Preferably for free.

253
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,180
(Here are a few free ways to clear your head.)

254
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,350
(Four. Meditation and breathing. Five. Go outside.)

255
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,320
(Even simple activities can help.)

256
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,330
So, you mean manual labour?

257
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,470
So you're taking a break from school?

258
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,470
- Yes. - No experience at an internet cafe?

259
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,270
Think you can handle it your first time?

260
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,170
Yes. Troubleshooting boot issues, network failures,

261
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,580
or reinstalling Windows is a piece of cake for me.

262
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,710
- I'm great at cable management. - I'm afraid you'll steal my GPUs.

263
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,620
- Pardon? - Never mind! Can you cook at all?

264
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,450
What?

265
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,530
Payment complete.

266
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
(Order Delivered)

267
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,310
Hey, boss! Delivery's here!

268
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,250
The fresh catch has arrived.

269
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,220
- It's a fish. - Yeon San, can you prepare sashimi?

270
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,650
Sashimi?

271
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,690
You're kidding, right?

272
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,320
I'm serious. It's on our menu.

273
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,630
- A new menu item. - A new item?

274
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,330
Yeon San, life is the real deal. And a gaming cafe is a battlefield!

275
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,740
(These are just sound and visual effects)

276
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,410
(The flounder was safely released into the waters off Incheon)

277
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,710
(A few days later)

278
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,250
(Moby Dick)

279
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,590
- So, where is it? - For ten bucks, it's a steal.

280
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,100
Seriously? You put the test bank in a binder?

281
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,730
You could've just shared them on a drive.

282
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,830
It means this test bank is legendary.

283
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,240
What? But where's Professor Eum Nan Sae's test bank?

284
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,370
- It's not here. - Her class has no test bank.

285
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,080
- Why not? Is it too old? - No, her class never had one.

286
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,880
Are you trying to rip me off? That's the most important one!

287
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,620
You clearly don't know. A test bank for her class is no use.

288
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,600
Her exam questions are, well, they're basically random numbers.

289
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,730
Random?

290
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,130
But even random numbers are values pulled from a predetermined range.

291
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,770
- Gosh, you scared us! - What are you doing here?

292
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,870
Is this really how you guys operate?

293
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,870
I'm so close to reporting you for sharing old exams.

294
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,570
Hey, chill out.

295
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,680
So what are Professor Eum's exams like?

296
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,480
With her, you can't gauge the scope. Her tests are impossible to predict.

297
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,850
Back then, I had no idea either. I really didn't.

298
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,090
When everyone, myself included, let their guard down,

299
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,960
that's when Eum Nan Sae's "Exam Chaos" began.

300
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,790
What's with this sudden true-crime doc vibe?

301
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,700
The year was ten years ago, during midterms.

302
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,330
So, Professor Eum starts handing out Post-it notes to the students.

303
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,370
Write down a single number.

304
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,809
The closer your number is to two-thirds...

305
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,940
of the average of all your numbers,

306
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,710
the higher your score will be.

307
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,750
But there was a deeper meaning behind her question.

308
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,789
She hoped they'd team up, write zero,

309
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,050
and create a win-win situation.

310
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,890
But not a single person figured it out.

311
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,430
And then there was the "open book" case.

312
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,930
She said it was open-book, so we brought tons of material...

313
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
"How?"

314
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,970
That single word was the entire test.

315
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,740
They say someone just wrote "Wow" and got a perfect score, but...

316
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,280
Given Professor Eum Nan Sae's vibe, you can totally believe that, right?

317
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,380
Gosh, seriously?

318
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,780
And then, the year I started, right before the pandemic hit,

319
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,920
she finally gave a question that was related to our major.

320
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,090
Write a science fiction short story about humans and AI interacting.

321
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,730
Is this a creative writing class? That actually sounds awesome.

322
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,700
That means she can grade it however she wants.

323
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,770
Turns out she did briefly mention it in class at some point.

324
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,440
I never imagined that the professor, who became a legend, would return.

325
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,150
(Jinny and Timothy Confirm Relationship)

326
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,680
(Agency: They have mutual feelings and are getting to know each other.)

327
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,430
Min Hak?

328
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,030
Ji No. Hey.

329
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,900
I wondered why I hadn't seen you. It's because you're all covered up.

330
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,270
I guess you're in a tight spot about the Joo Yeon San incident?

331
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,910
- What? - Are you busy? Can we talk?

332
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,780
I still can't wrap my head around why you chose Joo Yeon San over me.

333
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,220
But I bet you're regretting it by now.

334
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,060
So I'm giving you one more chance. A chance to join my team.

335
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,120
What are you...

336
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,600
I happen to be planning an app that's perfect for you.

337
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,960
A tailored service for influencers called Very Berry.

338
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,540
Very Berry's main function is to analyse public sentiment.

339
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,670
From online communities and social media,

340
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,670
it categorizes sentiment in words used to describe a specific target,

341
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,680
giving you the Strawberry Index. The "Berry Index," for short.

342
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,110
- So if I... - It's a Rotten Tomatoes knock-off.

343
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,680
It's different. We analyse sentiment in detail, positive, negative...

344
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,820
into a whopping 30 different categories.

345
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,990
Min Hak, check this out.

346
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,690
Only the top one percent can earn a Golden Strawberry.

347
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,700
Let's run your name on Very Berry on the biggest Moms' Cafe?

348
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,830
(Kang Min Hak)

349
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,070
(Overwhelmingly Positive Response. Sexy 44 percent, Friendly 35...)

350
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,970
No way, a Golden Strawberry. I've never actually seen one.

351
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,110
You really are a major celebrity.

352
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,880
The nickname sounds weird, but it's short for Golden Strawberry.

353
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,020
In that case, could you maybe search for Joo Yeon San?

354
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,520
Of course. For her, I should search the school forums. Hold on.

355
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,860
(Joo Yeon San)

356
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Nothing's coming up?

357
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,970
You're right.

358
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,540
Most people don't use her real name. Let me try a different keyword.

359
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,170
The term they usually use to refer to her is...

360
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,340
Dildo Girl.

361
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,610
(Dildo Girl)

362
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,410
Whoa, a Rotten Strawberry.

363
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,920
I never thought I'd see one of these in person.

364
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,390
Is it that serious?

365
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,820
This is just a Rotten Strawberry, one that's completely inedible.

366
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,060
Beyond saving. A complete write-off.

367
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,590
The problem is, if you get tied up with Joo Yeon San on the forums,

368
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,600
your Strawberry Index could drop too.

369
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,500
What if we Golden Strawberries unite and try to do something big?

370
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,440
I know, but I'm prepping to transfer to Seoul National University.

371
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,480
A Golden Strawberry in the making, you could say?

372
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,450
(Hangang University)

373
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,450
- Na Rae, did you see these posts? - What?

374
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,650
Doesn't this jerk ever quit?

375
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,590
You've seen them too.

376
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,220
I keep reporting him, but his account is never suspended.

377
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,190
Should I try contacting the site admins?

378
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,330
Or what if we sue for defamation?

379
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,400
Hey, Min Hak.

380
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,230
- It's been a while. - Hey, Dong Won.

381
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,440
You texted Joo Yeon San about the midterms, right?

382
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,140
She hasn't read it. You don't think she's really dropping out, right?

383
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,340
When was the last time we saw Joo Yeon San?

384
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
The day with the dildo on the ceiling?

385
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,180
So she hasn't been to school for a week now?

386
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,390
Should we file a missing person report?

387
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,420
- What? You don't think so? - No, that's not it.

388
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,990
She just read it. Just now.

389
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,390
She reads them. She just doesn't reply.

390
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,900
Let's send her something she has to reply to.

391
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,470
Not stuff like, "Where are you?" or "Are you okay?"

392
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,070
Like what?

393
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,970
Joo Yeon San.

394
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,510
Is it okay if we delete our GitHub repo?

395
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,670
(GitHub: Code hosting, Repo: Repository)

396
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,480
That'll get a call right away.

397
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,880
It's no big deal. It just means resetting the repo.

398
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,550
That sounds like a huge deal.

399
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,550
Or...

400
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,220
San, sending a link with some vital info.

401
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,690
"17 Proofs the Earth Is Flat."

402
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,060
She'll never be able to let that go.

403
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,330
San, want to hear about my crush on the guy who lives next door?

404
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,370
The sad part is, he can never love me back.

405
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,900
That's nothing new for you.

406
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,810
Min Hak, you should send one too. You really know how to piss her off.

407
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,410
- Me? - Yes.

408
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,250
That thing you do, that bright-eyed innocence?

409
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Something absurd enough to make her rush back to school to confront you?

410
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,220
What you do best. Sorry.

411
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,750
I don't know...

412
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,260
All that head-in-the-clouds stuff you always say so casually.

413
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,530
Sorry.

414
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,430
I can't just think of something on the spot like that.

415
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,500
That crazy bastard posted again.

416
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,780
With all this drama still going on, Joo Yeon San would never show up.

417
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,750
And what's even more infuriating is his awful spelling.

418
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,780
Send me the link. I'll report it too.

419
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,390
I think I'm going to have to look into getting a lawyer.

420
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:40,120
Wait a second. What's Joo Yeon San's other class?

421
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,760
Basic Spanish?

422
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,200
But she said the only other person from CS in that class is San.

423
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,430
The first post went up during Professor Eum's class,

424
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,930
so Professor Eum's class and the Database class...

425
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,300
the culprit must be in both classes, right?

426
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,510
Hey, Ban Ji No!

427
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,080
I knew you were lame, but not this vicious.

428
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,980
What are you talking about?

429
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,950
It's you who keeps posting about "Dildo Girl" on the school site.

430
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,720
Besides Professor Eum's class today, she only has one other major class,

431
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,820
Database.

432
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,160
And yet, the culprit knew she skipped class today.

433
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,990
Come on, plenty of people are in both of those classes.

434
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,130
Hey, that's you too, isn't it?

435
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,200
Yes, I'm in both of those classes with her too.

436
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,940
Exactly.

437
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,310
Nine students, both male and female, have both classes,

438
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,680
Five of them are in the background of the photo.

439
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,140
Which means they couldn't have taken the picture themselves.

440
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,250
Two others were off campus today for military reserve training.

441
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,950
That leaves just two people. But the culprit missed one thing.

442
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,920
- The culprit? - The Coke you're drinking now.

443
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,190
Look at the "Dildo Princess" photo. There's a Coke on the desk, see?

444
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,470
Yuseon has type one diabetes.

445
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,870
Even at parties back in our freshman year,

446
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,640
she was known for only drinking water.

447
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,970
Most importantly, you have a motive. A very clear motive.

448
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,169
You're still salty about losing at Quiz King,

449
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,009
and you lost Kang Min Hak from the group.

450
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,140
Just come clean and say you're sorry.

451
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,580
This is all just your speculation.

452
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,810
Do you have any hard evidence?

453
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,250
Of course we do.

454
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,150
If I comment on your Everytime post like this...

455
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,190
What?

456
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,830
- A comment notification? - See? He's getting notifications.

457
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,360
- This is... - Enough. Before I sue for libel,

458
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,870
take down every single post.

459
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,400
Wait...

460
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
Hey.

461
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,810
Looks like another post about San just went up.

462
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,340
Judging by the typos, it's the same person.

463
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,510
What, did you set up a bot to post them automatically?

464
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,250
I didn't do it. If you're so sure, just check my Everytime account.

465
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,020
How can you accuse me like that just from a single notification?

466
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,230
This spelling here. Guess it wasn't him.

467
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,690
Then why did you get a notification when I commented?

468
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,530
Because I'm following all the posts about Joo Yeon San.

469
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,930
I was just collecting data I need for Very Berry,

470
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,940
and checking to make sure everything was working right.

471
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,410
I can't believe you used San to develop your app.

472
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,840
Whatever. My conscience is clear.

473
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,440
I won't forget this humiliation. Just you wait.

474
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,250
And Kang Min Hak, I'm really disappointed in you.

475
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,780
Guys, let's go.

476
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,220
(Hangang University)

477
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,090
Isn't improv class kind of hard?

478
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,820
I think it's better than that "write about a wall" assignment.

479
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,260
So absurd...

480
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,430
that she'd come running back to campus.

481
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,300
Was what I said that unbelievable? What else is just as absurd?

482
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,640
Words that...

483
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Hey, you okay?

484
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,770
Things are blowing up on Everytime.

485
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,840
When you get famous, all the weirdos come crawling out.

486
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,480
The CS kids always seemed creepy. And she's the valedictorian, right?

487
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,080
- Queen of the Creeps. - She's my friend.

488
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,390
Watch what you say.

489
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,120
Right, what I meant was, the people linking you to Dildo Girl...

490
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,060
and posting weird comments, they're the jerks, right?

491
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
Look,

492
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,800
That dildo isn't Dildo Girl's... Gosh.

493
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,670
My friend...

494
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,770
It's not my friend's. It's just, for a part-time job...

495
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,380
It's...

496
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,950
Anyway, it's just a thing. Unlike us, engineering students...

497
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,150
do part-time jobs with electronics and stuff.

498
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,020
It's weirder for a student's job to involve that kind of thing.

499
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,290
Regardless, she's not hurting anyone.

500
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,390
So let's stop ganging up on her and harassing her like this.

501
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,460
Right, let's stop talking about her. He must be tired of all this.

502
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:45,370
- It's not like he's not involved... - Something absurd...

503
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,010
Hey, did you hear? Timothy and Jinny are dating.

504
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,580
No way. He's way out of her league.

505
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,310
Are you blind? She's way out of his league.

506
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,480
- No. Timothy's the one trending. - Hello? Jinny is world-class.

507
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,520
PC use by minors is prohibited after 10pm.

508
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,590
Can I see your IDs, please?

509
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,160
- Ma'am, hold on. - I'm in my promos!

510
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,730
- I'm a slave to my promos! - It's my promotion match!

511
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,730
- I can't let you. - Ma'am, come on. Just a bit longer.

512
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
It's no big deal.

513
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,200
No. If I get shut down, will you take responsibility?

514
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,730
- Shut down? - Will you?

515
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Just a little longer...

516
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,470
- Time to go. - Gosh.

517
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,870
That girl is such a robot.

518
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,540
(Agency: They have mutual feelings and are getting to know each other.)

519
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,780
(Please send your support and wishes to the new couple.)

520
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,190
(Jinny and Timothy have confirmed it.)

521
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,360
People are so obsessed with other people's lives.

522
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
(Min Hak: I have something to tell you)

523
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,970
I have something to tell you.

524
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,570
I haven't seen you around school lately.

525
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,370
You doing okay, Joo Yeon San?

526
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,780
I wonder if Kang Min Hak is doing okay.

527
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,590
In modern society, what is one's most important asset?

528
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,260
Reputation. Whether it's good or bad,

529
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,290
we live in a world where how others see you matters most.

530
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,130
Our influencer-tailored service, Very Berry,

531
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,330
shows you what your reputation is on social media...

532
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,440
through our Strawberry Index. The highest is Golden Strawberry,

533
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,640
down to the lowest level, the Rotten Strawberry.

534
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,580
A few days ago, during the commotion in the Computer Engineering class,

535
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,650
we all saw our school's first-ever Rotten Strawberry, didn't we?

536
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,010
You all remember that, right?

537
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,920
Gosh, that son of a gun.

538
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,520
But even this Rotten Strawberry, if you manage and monitor it,

539
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,190
can be levelled up. But if Dildo Girl can pull it off...

540
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,630
Has he lost his mind? Ban Ji No! Hey, shut up!

541
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,659
However, I'm confident.

542
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,170
- With Very Berry... - You there, shut your mouth!

543
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,299
I can tell what kind of strawberry you are...

544
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,040
without Very Berry, Ban Ji No.

545
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,340
You. You're always telling stories that no one will remember...

546
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,750
and dragging them on for as long as possible.

547
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,120
I bet 99 percent of the students here think you're a total jerk.

548
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,420
What, are you dissing my app just because your rep took a hit?

549
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,960
Besides, your opinion is irrelevant.

550
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,960
But isn't what Very Berry shows just other people's opinions?

551
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,800
If that's the case, my opinion is just another data point.

552
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,940
You yourself don't actually care about other people's opinions,

553
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,510
yet you send your users on a rollercoaster of fickle opinions.

554
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,140
How's that for a contradiction?

555
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,480
And that is my personal assessment of Very Berry and its creator.

556
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,050
- San! - Why didn't you answer our calls?

557
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,860
Why didn't you pick up?

558
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,790
- I was busy. - But you really told him off.

559
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,030
- Right? - He was pissing me off.

560
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
San.

561
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,370
What did you want to talk about?

562
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
What?

563
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,080
You texted me, remember? You said you had something to say.

564
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,380
It's nothing.

565
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
But...

566
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,060
it's good to see you.

567
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,160
A self-fulfilling prophecy.

568
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,130
When trying hard to not get involved is what creates a special bond.
