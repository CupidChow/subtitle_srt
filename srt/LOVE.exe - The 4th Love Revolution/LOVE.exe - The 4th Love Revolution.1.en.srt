10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,670
How did we end up in this mess?

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,350
I thought it was just a GitHub push, like a single commit message.

12

(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,020
But the errors piled up without any alerts,

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,430
and between the conflicts I just glossed over,

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,030
what were you and I missing?

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,600
What if we were already infected?

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,840
- This is a sophisticated virus. - Hey, emergency!

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,140
Emergency!

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,479
It puts us both at risk,

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,850
but strangely, it keeps the system on.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,190
Anyway, what we need to do now is debug.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,790
All the way back to that moment we thought was our safe zone,

23

Find the first log entry of this disaster.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,900
Let's start with your stereotypical image of an engineering student.

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,700
Black backpack with a water bottle, a three-fold umbrella on the left,

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,970
unstyled hair,

28
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,040
and cheap horn-rimmed glasses.

29
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,680
And on top of that, pants with a questionable fit.

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,950
And a plaid shirt you can draw graphs on in a pinch.

31
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,190
But what's missing is a subtitle for the year.

32
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,519
Visit a Korean engineering school now,

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,890
and you'll quickly realize...

34
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,390
how distorted your information and narrow-minded your views are.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,129
Ten-dollar horn-rimmed glasses?

36
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,130
These are Gentle Monster, those are Moscot,

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,200
and these are Projekt Produkt. Unstyled hair? Give me a break!

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,940
They use conditioner, treatments, and even get Brazilian waxes.

39
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,810
Don't get me started on the fantasy of the "Belle of Engineering."

40
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,219
She's pretty, has a great body,

41
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,780
and is a pro at soldering and gaming.

42
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,790
She helps price parts at Yongsan. She's cool with the returnees.

43

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,030
Who is it?

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,360
Who the heck is spreading this crap about us?

46
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,730
And another thing.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,029
Since we're not a Seoul university,

48
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,270
campus dramas don't film at our school.

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,270
Stuck on the outskirts of the city, where it blizzards on the first day.

50
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,770
It is a little embarrassing.

And in the middle of this bizarre weather,

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,250
that Tinder Guy asked you to come all the way out to Seoul, right?

54
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,550
Yes.

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,350
He asked me to come to his place and fix his desktop?

56
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,920
Said no one was going to be home for a few days.

57
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,020

Says the guy who met his girlfriend on an app?

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,170

I was explaining a system restore, and then he said he already knew.

65
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,610

68

He got defensive and put down my school.

69
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,990
He bragged about his school in Seoul.

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,820
How tiresome. So?

71
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,960
I couldn't let it slide, so I dissed my own school right back at him,

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,330
and told him the new name of our department.

73
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,860
He told me to stop making it up. He asked, "What department is that?"

74

- Oppose the Engineering merger! - Oppose!

99

When we enrolled, they kept talking about becoming the "next KAIST."

100
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,350
They promised full scholarships. But look at us and KAIST now.

101

Even that's different.

103
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,420
KAIST has a full-body statue of him. Ours is, well, as you can see.

104
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,770
So that's what it is. They were prepping this for the merger.

105
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,000
It looks so sloppy and rushed. The art styles are so different.

You're right, Dong Won.

107
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,680
The art styles really are completely different.

Which one is the CompSci major and which one is the Modeling major?

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,890
It's so obvious which is which...

110
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,130
that "convergence" hardly seems like the right word.

111
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,800
But having these prickly pretty boys around,

112
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,540
I guess that kind of diversity isn't so bad after all.

113

Of course, of course.

I'm all about relating to Gen MZ, you know?

You have every right to ask.

156
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,810
You absolutely should ask. This has nothing to do with you...

It's not about you guys personally. Not at all.

158

Exactly. It's not about individuals. Everyone's special in their own way.

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,660
She's a huge fan of his, so we all tagged along.

176
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,200
- Pipe down! We'll get kicked out. - Ahem.

177
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,300
Hey, the security guard's here. We'll sign this.

178
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,370
It's okay if we sign this, right?

179
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,040
This is actually just for university members.

180
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,040
Come on. We're part of the local community.

181
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,840
Hey, why are you using my name?

182
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,380
Her name's hilarious, isn't it? Ahn In Dae.

183
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,180
- Gosh, TMI. - That's not TMI.

184
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,720
But you guys really aren't supposed to be signing this.

185
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,360
- Please, not you too. - She's actually kind of funny.

186
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,730
Hilarious.

187
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,200
That's Kang Dong Won for you. Living up to his handsome namesake.

188
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,700
Yeah. "Converged Physical" definitely suits you.

189
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,000
Hey, you two should be the ones joining in.

190
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,210
I don't know if this will help, but...

191
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,280
Converged Technology, or whatever.

192
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,580
If you don't sign, that's what will be printed on your diploma.

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,220
But does our department name matter? For developers, experience is key.

194
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,420
You sound like you're in favor of the merger.

195
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,520
Why do you have to put it like that?

196
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,660
- Hey, write neatly in the box. - Okay, okay.

197
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,980
Excuse me, do you know which building C103 is in?

198
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,390
My map app says it's this way, but...

199
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,150
I can show you the way. I happen to be heading there myself.

200
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,760
Really? Thank you.

201
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,160
No, thank you.

202
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,900
Shall we?

203
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,960
See you again!

204
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Take care.

205
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,940
So much for solidarity in our major.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,880
They chose us over the other majors. They knew we were pushovers.

207
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,950
Wow, this lounge is huge.

208
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,980
Sa Ni, you seem kinda excited about this yourself.

209
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,320
Don't tell me you're for the merger, too.

210
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,960
Does the department name matter? Not for a developer.

211
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,760
Not you too!

212
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,360
For a developer, it's all about the gear.

213
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,560
And I just got a new setup.

214
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,410
Intel Core Ultra 200HX and a GeForce RTX 5070.

215
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,410
Data storage is a Super RAID 5.

216
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,040
Okay. Congratulations, I guess.

217
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,380
Excuse me, could you sign this?

218
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,950
Bet you're wondering where I suddenly got all this cash.

219
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,320
Not really.

220
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,590
Here.

221
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,050
I consulted on a TV script for some clueless liberal arts majors.

222
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
A TV show?

223
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,190
It was a freelance gig. A client set me up over winter break,

224
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,100
and I met a writer, director, and producer who are big shots.

225
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,830
"We're making a campus drama set in the Computer Engineering Dept."

226
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,800
"A genius coder uninterested in love falls for a cold startup guy."

227
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
Sounds boring already, but... what can you do? It's work.

228
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,579
The problem is, the writers are all liberal arts majors...

229
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,640
who know nothing.

230
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,850
Like what the professors are saying in the background...

231
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,050
or what today's engineers or IT professionals in 2025...

232
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,990
how they talk, what they care about. They were completely clueless.

233
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,560
So, with a script full of hundreds, even thousands, of errors,

234
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,529
I started my nitpicky edits,

235
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,500
and they suddenly started complaining.

236
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,839
"We want to focus on the love story..."

237
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,879
"And, you know, a real love story..."

238
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,810
"doesn't unfold before a laptop or behind a lectern."

239
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,220
"Are you an extreme 'T' on the MBTI or something?"

240
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,650
"No. I don't like being defined by MBTI."

241
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,960
So I just took my advance and we terminated the contract.

242
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,830
Which was a total win for me, anyway.

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,700
Congratulations again.

244
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,999
Thanks to that, I upgraded to a laptop...

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
that's about 3.7 times more powerful,

246
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,800
so my compile time will be 2.5 times faster,

247
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,740
and if I use that time to take on 0.8 more freelance gigs a month,

248
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,980
I can get out of this place at least six months sooner.

249
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,810
The reason I'm sharing my stats with you in such detail is...

250
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,710
I know. You're trying to rope me into your project.

251
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,380
I'm being serious.

252
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,620
We're running out of time.

253
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,190
Time?

254
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,030
Seoul's average temp rose last year. Just look outside.

255
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,160
It's March, and we got hit with a sudden cold snap.

256
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,330
I know, right? It even snowed on the first day of the semester.

257
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,600
The college merger is the least of our problems right now.

258
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,399
You know me. If the world were ending,

259
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,470
I'm the type to plant an apple tree.

260
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,239
But we must control what's immediate.

261
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
For you, that's the Student Council,

262
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,310
and for me...

263
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,879
Hey, the scholarship results are up!

264
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,950
Hey, they're posted, they're posted!

265
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,079
Sweet!

266
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,150
Are you checking it? Is it posted?

267
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,719
A full ride!

268
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,320
Guys, I got it! Oh my gosh!

269
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,360
Wait, what is this?

270
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,830
Where the heck is this place supposed to be?

271
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
What?

272
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
What?

273
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,770
This way? Gosh, darn it.

274
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Not interested.

275
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,510
- It's freezing, freezing, freezing. - Excuse me.

276
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,710
Excuse me. Ex-excuse me. Hey, excuse me.

277
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,150
Hey!

278
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,780
What's with this guy?

279
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,990
Sorry, would you happen to know where the Dean's Office is?

280
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,560
Which college's dean? And from what department?

281
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
One sec.

282
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,200
Converged Physical Technology...

283
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,130
- Glo... - Dept. of Global Content Dev?

284
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,230
Yes, that's the one.

285
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,340
For the former Comp. Eng. Dean's Office,

286
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
head to Jang Yeong Sil Hall.

287
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,440
Jang Yeong Sil... Isn't Jang Yeong Sil Hall this way?

288
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,050
Nope! Most go through the main gate and the College of Human Ecology,

289
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,810
and cross the Cloud Bridge. But if you need the Dean's Office,

290
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,080
it's faster via the Central Library. Got it?

291
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,960
- Right. So I should... - So he didn't get any of that.

292
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,430
In terms of sheer distance, the Human Ecology route is faster,

293
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,930
but that calculation doesn't account for the elevator algorithm.

294
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,129
Elevators were replaced last year,

295
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,500
and now the two are dumb and in sync.

296
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,270
And why do you suppose that is?

297
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,910
Beats me.

298
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,210
Like I said, they must've changed the algorithm.

299
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,850
It used to check each car's distance to the user's selected floor...

300
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,750
and send whichever one was closer.

301
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,990
- So that way... - I'll assume you've got it, then.

302
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,960
So cool. That's the engineering student vibe.

303
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,030
Can I get your Instagram handle?

304
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,400
No, it's just, you look so familiar.

305
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,400
If you're not comfortable, you really don't have to. It's fine.

306
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,770
Give it here.

307
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,310
You have a cute name.

308
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Yang Na Rae.

309
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,679
Na Rae, Na Rae, Yang Na Rae

310
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,780
That's how I'll remember it.

311
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,280
Stop.

312
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,290
No way. 20,000 followers?

313
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,260
So you must be the top dog in the Modeling Major, then.

314
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,090
20,000 followers is nothing.

315
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,930
A classmate has a million followers. See?

316
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,990
A million followers?

317
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,860
For just one of his Reels,

318
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,370
he makes, what, like five grand?

319
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,870
You don't know him? Kang Min Hak.

320
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
- For me, that's a lot of money. - It is for everyone.

321
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,260
I understand the scholarship review can be subjective,

322
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,960
and there was some negative wording in my letter of recommendation,

323
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,360
"While not lacking the talent required for academic success..."

324
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,500
"she only seeks her own glory." Is that the part you mean?

325
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,440
This is from Dean Gi Myo Han, I see.

326
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,880
I didn't realize our evaluations would have our names attached,

327
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:22,580
I may have slipped up last semester, but did you see my GPA is a 4.28?

328
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,350
- Computer Science and Engineering? - Yes.

329
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,779
Major in CompSci and Engineering,

330
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,150
School of Converged Tech and Content.

331
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,090
But you applied as a CompSci Major. That's your old department name.

332
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,100
It's from a duplicate registration, and we can't resubmit it for you,

333
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,030
we've been trying to contact you to correct and resubmit it.

334
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,640
But I never received anything.

335
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,670
Yes, you never picked up. Not our calls or our texts.

336
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,140
We even contacted you yesterday.

337
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,280
That's impossible. If I check my call log...

338
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,810
It is in my call log.

339
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,850
I implemented an SVM model and ran a simple test on my phone,

340
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,990
It's projected to stop 81% of spam. With more data from Jan and Feb...

341
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,060
Okay, okay, guys. Sorry to interrupt your game.

342
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,930
I can't believe my spam beta app made this mistake.

343
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,599
So if I change the name...

344
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
to Converged Physical and Global Content...

345
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,430
and apply again, that should fix it right? It's a simple fix?

346
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,840
It was, until yesterday.

347
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,510
It's now a special exception, so you have to start over.

348
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,440
And get the dean's signature.

349
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,510
The dean?

350
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,050
The Peculiar Dean.

351
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,550
We have distinguished guests today, but this spring weather is amazing.

352
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
Anyway, this climate crisis these days...

353
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,460
We'd appreciate it if you could be flexible with his classes.

354
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,190
Besides, it's all practical training for his major.

355
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,160
Attendance? That's not a problem.

356
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,000
Just be discreet about it.

357
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,000
- Excuse me. - Yes? Was there something?

358
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,400
I was looking into it,

359
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,240
and CompSci has many classes that could be useful for models.

360
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,770
- Is that so? - Yes, look here.

361
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,940
There's something called Cap Design?

362
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,380
- For making hats or something? - Hats?

363
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,020
- Caps? - Cap...

364
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,450
Oh!

365
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,320
Oh, that. That's, that's called "Capstone Design."

366
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,790
It's a senior class for solving engineering problems, basically.

367
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,230
- Right. I saw one for "running." - Running?

368
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,730
Oh, we models only learn how to walk.

369
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,340
Hey, they teach running in the College of Engineering.

370
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,870
That's probably "Machine Learning." But anyway.

371
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Machine?

372
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,250
Anyway, I'd like to try taking classes like that.

373
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,250
Machine Learning.

374
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,150
Cool Running.

375
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,090
That would be a perfect name for a running crew.

376
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Wow.

377
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,230
Capstone...

378
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Stone?

379
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,170
Thank you again for your time.

380
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,800
Then it's settled. You'll observe my class that day.

381
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,710
- It's great for the school's promo. - Yes, that would be...

382
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,280
- Right. Goodness, thank you. - Yes, of course.

383
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,350
Take care.

384
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,480
- I'm all about that recycling life. - Min Hak! Awesome morning!

385
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,550
Hey.

386
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,290
Right.

387
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,060
Hey!

388
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,330
My follower count suddenly shot up.

389
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,360
I'm at, like, 998,000 now.

390
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,130
Really?

391
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,330
That's great. You were stuck there for a while.

392
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,840
Yeah, and some of my new fans have really funny usernames.

393
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,140
Check this out.

394
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,570
Chun Nyeon Hak, Jong Yi Hak. And get this, Ahn In Dae.

395
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
What?

396
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,250
No, if someone's name is Ahn In Dae...

397
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,450
say they come to a fan signing. And I ask, "What's your name?"

398
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,749
and they say, "I'm Ahn In Dae."

399
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,420
I couldn't tell if they aren't a fan,

400
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,319
or if their name is really Ahn In Dae.

401
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,160
It'd be so confusing, right?

402
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,060
This is no time for jokes.

403
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah, like that. I'm pretty good at riffing on stuff.

404
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,040
- Hey, I was wondering... - The lounge is nice. Want to go?

405
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,670
What?

406
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,340
What? I thought you were into that whole engineering student vibe.

407
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,250
We should scout out the engineering building beforehand.

408
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,550
But just a minute ago...

409
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,720
you gave me a look for even bringing up the class.

410
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,220
My bad. I wasn't thinking.

411
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,520
With the merger, that engineering student look could help your career.

412
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,530
That's how we landed that laptop commercial.

413
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,790
That I landed for you.

414
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,430
I know. That's why I suggested wearing my bangs down.

415
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,330
Good call. Forewarned is forearmed.

416
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,630
What does that mean?

417
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,640
(Study Plan)

418
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,840
"By leveraging the IT and tech from the Yeong Sil Scholarship,"

419
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,710
"not for my own personal success,"

420
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,350
"but to help advance humanity?" You? Seriously?

421
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,880
Don't talk to me. The deadline's in ten minutes.

422
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,349
How did you miss that?

423
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,520
They sent so many notices to reapply.

424
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,830
Stop nagging and contribute a line. I'm all out of fancy words.

425
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,160
Guys! You're not going to believe this!

426
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,529
This is huge. Huge!

427
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,200
A student here has one million followers.

428
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,330
- One million followers? - Yep.

429
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
That can't be a million students at Hangang University.

430
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,240
So, one of a million followers just happens to be a student here?

431
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,140
Those aren't very surprising odds.

432
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,810
No! Someone with a million followers is in our Modeling Major!

433
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,750
A person with one million followers. Here, on this remote campus.

434
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,620
A celebrity like that has graced us with their presence.

435
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,220
I doubt that empty online popularity matters at Hangang University.

436
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,690
It's not entirely meaningless.

437
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,560
With that kind of following, for every post they upload...

438
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,160
They supposedly get around 5,000.

439
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,960
Wow.

440
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,270
- To even make minimum wage... - What?

441
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,640
They'd have to upload almost 20 posts an hour.

442
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,770
Guess being famous isn't so easy.

443
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,580
What are you talking about? Not 50 cents, 5 thousand dollars.

444
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,650
- What? - That's a whole semester's tuition.

445
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,750
Exactly.

446
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,790
They get to live life that easily?

447
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
Who?

448
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,090
- It's Kang Min Hak! - Where?

449
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,760
There he is! Kang Min Hak! Wow, he's so handsome!

450
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,030
He's so freaking hot. So handsome.

451
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,600
Wow, he's seriously good-looking.

452
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,740
Wow, he's unreal!

453
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,790
I have a feeling he's the one. The one with a million followers.

454
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,660
The Modeling Major we were just talking about.

455
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,599
You're handsome, even to other guys.

456
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,730
Loved you on "Match on Wheels!"

457
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,570
- Can I get your autograph? - You're so handsome!

458
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,630
Please sign this for me!

459
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,510
Why does it feel like time is moving in slow motion over there?

460
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,880
That's theoretically possible if the gravity is strong enough.

461
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,250
You can't experience that on Earth. So Na Rae, it's an optical illusion.

462
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,890
Exactly. I mean, time isn't a proven concept.

463
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,660
Oh, come on!

464
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,390
Just look, will you?

465
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,030
When you see beauty, enjoy it. So just enjoy the view!

466
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,430
- But I was here first. - I'm sorry.

467
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,139
I knew it. They're all taking photos.

468
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,210
These nobodies with nothing to share...

469
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,210
are happily doing our marketing for us.

470
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180
- Min Hak! - Whoa, hey!

471
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,550
We're here to see you!

472
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,380
- Hey, you can't rush him like that! - Hey, you!

473
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,320
- Let go of me! Don't touch me! - What's with all these fangirls?

474
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,420
We're just here to see him!

475
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,360
Teenagers from the suburbs who rarely get to see a celebrity?

476
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,760
An influencer on his level is as popular as a pop idol.

477
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Tell me about it.

478
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,530
What's his deal, anyway?

479
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,299
He gets five grand for a single post.

480
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,770
Why are people so crazy about him?

481
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,270
So cute. Way too cute.

482
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,080
Zoom out, cute. Zoom in, cute.

483
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,510
From this angle or that one? Pure cuteness overload.

484
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,420
Why am I here and not there with them?

485
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,520
I don't think there's anyone as perfect as he is.

486
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,620
He is so handsome, and he is so talented.

487
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,290
I think he's literally the most perfect boy...

488
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I've ever seen.

489
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,030
Professor Eum,

490
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,900
when did you get here?

491
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,470
So you're a K-pop fan too?

492
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,700
Is that guy from BTS?

493
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,650
- Sorry. - No, he is not a K-pop idol.

494
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,210
He is actually from this dating show...

495
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,380
called "Match on Wheels."

496
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
On this show,

497
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,090
he won people over with his own special kind of charm.

498
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,390
At first,

499
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,820
no one noticed him among flashier contestants.

500
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,360
Doesn't he look really young?

501
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,460
- He looks like a kid. - I think he's a college student.

502
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,460
- He looks like a college student. - He seems down-to-earth.

503
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,270
He didn't try to stand out,

504
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,500
just quietly cared.

505
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,069
Also fans noticed one of his sexiest traits.

506
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,370
His serious recycling habits.

507
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,470
Cleaning up after everyone isn't easy.

508
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,410
He's just like me, isn't he?

509
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,580
While the other male cast members...

510
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,980
were gossiping behind backs...

511
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,909
and showing their unfiltered macho sides,

512
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,980
he didn't get caught up in it.

513
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,720
No wonder the female cast members...

514
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,650
couldn't help but be drawn to him.

515
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,920
- Back in high school... - Jinny, is Min Hak your type?

516
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,230
I think he's pretty cute.

517
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,329
Midway through the show,

518
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,430
when the girls were all fighting for his attention,

519
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,030
I honestly felt the same.

520
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,630
Maybe it's because the show...

521
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,030
has no script or direction,

522
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,200
just real emotions...

523
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,270
that Min Hak stood out even more.

524
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,109
It's interesting.

525
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,610
That someone like you, an elite, with advanced intellect,

526
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,450
would display such an inexplicable emotional response.

527
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,010
I'm sorry, professor.

528
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,510
What do you mean by that?

529
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,480
Okay, look at this, Nisha.

530
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,450
If there were no crews around,

531
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,020
it'd be kind of hard...

532
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,160
to get a close-up shot like this...

533
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,590
from this angle in this frame.

534
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,230
I'm sorry, what?

535
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,500
Well, unless there was a drone...

536
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,400
the size of a fruit fly...

537
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,170
with a wide lens bigger than itself flying around the cast.

538
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,310
It would make sense. However,

539
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:21,710
given the physical and mechanical limits of current lens technology,

540
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,910
that's impossible.

541
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,550
And one more thing.

542
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,850
Please forgive me...

543
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,950
for pointing out such an obvious error.

544
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,020
For a rational engineer,

545
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,060
this setup just doesn't fly.

546
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,830
No, this is truly a bare match. No room for tricks or interference.

547
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,500
Right. It's not like the director or writers set this up, right?

548
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,200
He seemed sweet, but he's a beast. He's full of surprises.

549
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,800
- Wait a minute. - What?

550
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,010
- Isn't this game a bit one-sided? - How so?

551
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,450
One look, it's obviously set up for your boy.

552
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,650
The angle opposite that kid is 160 degrees,

553
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,150
and his opponent's angle is, what, about 100 degrees?

554
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,620
Then, according to the law of sines,

555
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,120
for that string to be in equilibrium...

556
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,730
The opponent's force is the kid's times the ratio of sines.

557
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,399
That's 0.9848 over 0.3420, which equals...

558
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,760
- 2.878. - 2.878.

559
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,669
So the other guy has to exert...

560
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,470
2.878 times more force than the boy...

561
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,970
just to maintain equilibrium and not get pulled back.

562
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,240
(Seconds until the game ends)

563
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,110
The "unexpected charm" you mentioned was meticulously engineered.

564
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,410
Gosh, I get it, Joo Yeon San.

565
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,410
I know what you're trying to say,

566
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,490
but actually, I have no clue. How do you calculate all this stuff?

567
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,920
What? It's obvious just by looking at it.

568
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,720
Hey, didn't you say you only had ten minutes left?

569
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,960
Darn it! I need The Peculiar Dean's signature.

570
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,590
Oh, my!

571
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,830
Hey, make sure you have everything. Shouldn't you look more presentable?

572
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,100
Considering The Peculiar Dean's crankiness,

573
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
you have a point.

574
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,110
Here, give me your jacket.

575
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
You're very high-maintenance, Joo Yeon San.

576
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Go on.

577
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,149
Come on, my friend's a huge fan.

578
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,780
What? Yeah, I'm a fan too.

579
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,120
Not happening. Move along.

580
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,870
Hey...

581
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,800
Hey...

582
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Hey!

583
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,610
Hey!

584
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,510
Wait! Hold on!

585
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,580
Hey!

586
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,680
- Gosh! - What?

587
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,880
What?

588
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,770
- Hey. - What?

589
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,070
Are you okay?

590
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,970
I guess.

591
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,520
Haven't we met somewhere before?

592
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,390
I don't think so.

593
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,860
By conventional standards, I suppose he's handsome.

594
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,200
But what I'm experiencing now is just a personal optical illusion.

595
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,340
The visible light that the human eye can perceive...

596
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,240
is a tiny part of the EM spectrum. Because of this limited range,

597
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,310
we are incapable of fully perceiving the external reality of our subject.

598
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,190
To a more advanced life-form, their appearance might be hideous.

599
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,520
No, it must be hideous.

600
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,000
And your name is?

601
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,600
What? He must think I'm a fan.

602
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,530
No.

603
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,570
I'm Ahn In Dae.

604
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
Ahn In Dae?

605
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,710
Ahn In Dae?

606
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,980
So you're her!

607
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,620
I can't believe I'm actually meeting you here today.

608
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Ahn In Dae.

609
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,130
- Do they know each other? - No idea.

610
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,760
What the heck is with this guy?

611
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Ahn In Dae...

612
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,400
(Three minutes later)

613
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,270
Someone's in high spirits all of a sudden.

614
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,140
To be honest, I was a little suspicious of you.

615
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,170
What?

616
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,910
I thought maybe you'd bought all those new followers again.

617
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,220
What? You said it felt like a scam. I wouldn't do that again.

618
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,950
Right? You're not the type to do that twice.

619
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,520
But Ahn In Dae, Chun Nyeon Hak...

620
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,560
I figured fans with weird names like that were fake.

621
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,230
But I just met one of them in person.

622
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,330
Man. My bad. I'm sorry.

623
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,769
- Gosh. - Seriously.

624
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,600
Don't worry about it. You're getting surprisingly sharp.

625
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,440
But, kid, once we get a million, ad rates go into a new bracket.

626
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,980
How could I not buy accounts?

627
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,250
We don't need pricey Korean accounts when there are foreign ones.

628
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,990
Anyway, forget about it. Just know I always have your back.

629
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,490
I know.

630
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,260
If you have any issues with me, just let it all out.

631
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,560
Dude, I've got nothing like that.

632
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,500
It's just... I was bothered you went to the dean without me.

633
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,540
I was helping you get your diploma without having to commute out here.

634
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,480
Then you suddenly say you'll take engineering, putting me in a bind.

635
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,650
I can see that.

636
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,580
Sorry. I'll do better.

637
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
All right.

638
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,150
I get it. It's about your first love at KAIST.

639
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,290
That's why you have this thing for the "engineering student vibe."

640
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,890
What are you talking about? She wasn't my first love.

641
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,330
We just crossed paths that one time. For 5, maybe 10 minutes?

642
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,230
Was your first love someone else? That quiz kid from grade school?

643
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,540
What are you talking about? Come on! What first love?

644
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,810
Excuse me, is the dean in? I have a scheduled meeting.

645
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,280
You're three minutes late. He waited and then left.

646
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,520
- But I'm only three minutes late. - That's right.

647
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,090
My scholarship is on the line. Could you please just call him?

648
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,690
The dean really hates getting work calls.

649
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,090
You should have come earlier.

650
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,860
- Come back tomorrow. - Today's the application deadline.

651
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,060
That's too bad.

652
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,230
These celebrity autographs...

653
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,470
If you hadn't stopped to get this, you might have been on time.

654
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,980
So I guess he actually came to school.

655
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,510
What a pain.

656
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,680
(To: Ahn In Dae Thanks for everything. Kang Min Hak)

657
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,820
Don't tell me...

658
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,490
this is actually happening!

659
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,520
Back to Heinrich's Law.

660
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,889
For every major disaster,

661
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,030
there are always small warning signs.

662
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,700
How a series of small, absurd moments...

663
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,870
can lead to one monumentally absurd one.

664
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,100
The start of that error code...

665
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,240
Was it the moment our campus became an unwilling runway?

666
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,550
Wow, he's so handsome. Is he a new actor?

667
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,610
No, a part-timer.

668
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,880
I just asked him to be a stand-in. We're good. Thanks!

669
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,290
Okay. Thank you.

670
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,090
Or maybe, at some point in the past that seemed safe,

671
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,119
the disaster had already begun.

672
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,930
New vehicle entered. Redirecting.

673
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,900
Excuse me. Hold on. Sir, you can't park here.

674
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,670
What? There's a spot right here. Why are you telling me I can't park?

675
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,000
As you can see,

676
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,210
it's a handicapped spot. I'm sorry.

677
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,710
- Come on, on a day like today... - I've got to record this jerk.

678
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,540
- You need to be a little flexible. - Gosh, it died.

679
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,510
- It's a handicapped parking spot... - So... Half air, half sound.

680
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,520
What the? What was that noise?

681
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,520
Hey! Were you filming me?

682
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,390
What if I'm still filming? Whose manager are you, anyway?

683
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,490
Hey, Seung Gon, what's going on?

684
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,460
Hey. It's nothing. We're all good.

685
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,860
Look, don't cause a scene. Just move the car, all right?

686
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Excuse me.

687
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,240
- Thanks for your help. - You don't work here, do you?

688
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,680
- Why are you even here? - I work the outdoor section,

689
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,480
but I was coming back from the restroom. So, yes, my bad.

690
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,850
Don't apologize. The real problem is rude people thinking it's a one-off.

691
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,790
Next time, just give them the same attitude.

692
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,720
A battery error.

693
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,460
Wait, so earlier...

694
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,500
- Are you in college? - I'm starting this year. Still 19.

695
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,830
Oh? Me too.

696
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,640
I mean, me too.

697
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,600
Eager to be friends, are you?

698
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,110
No, it's not like that.

699
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,010
All right, then. What's your major?

700
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,310
I'm a modeling major.

701
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,150
Cool. I'm in CompSci.

702
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,150
- I'm off. - Okay.

703
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,650
What?

704
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,020
KAIST? Wow, that's a top-tier school.

705
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,790
Wow, you must be a genius.

706
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,860
This? It was a gift from a senior in high school.

707
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,400
Hold on. Just one second.

708
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
What?

709
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Yes, I'm coming. I'm on my way now. Okay.

710
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,500
I don't go to KAIST, though.

711
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,710
I'm starting at Hangang University.

712
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,740
Not that you needed to know that.

713
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,560
Come on, Joo Yeon San. For now, just focus on moving ahead.

714
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,629
Then again, should I look back?

715
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,590
No, "moving forward" is the right idea.

716
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,030
Not the cliche "look forward" way just because he's in front of me.

717
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,940
Back when I didn't know who he was and his smile gave me butterflies,

718
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,410
that might've been the moment the real trouble started.
