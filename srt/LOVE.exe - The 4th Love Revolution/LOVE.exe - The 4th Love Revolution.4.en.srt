00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,240
(This is a work of fiction. All names, characters, )

00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,410

(All child actors were accompanied by a guardian, )

00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,910
(and filmed in accordance with labour laws.)

7
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,150
It's beautiful.

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,320
To think that with just black and white cells,

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,920
they're essentially having a rich conversation.

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,930
In a way, it's going from 3D to 2D.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,130
Wait, is that Professor Eum Nan Sae?

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,170
- The Eum Nan Sae? - About the QR code...

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,670
Is she a big deal? Isn't she just Winterbottom's sub?

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,169
If Winterbottom is twine,

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,640
Eum Nan Sae is a climbing rope.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,449
A legend in Korean computer science.

17
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,780
The youngest professor at POSTECH.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,520
And that same Professor Eum Nan Sae...

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,120
turned down tenure from, like, Melon University,

20
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,820
to come back here. Can you guess why?

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,599
Sorry for being late, Professor.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,569
I had a school station interview...

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,900
about the awards for the Embedded Software Contest.

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,740
- So I'm late. - Honey bees are disappearing.

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,540
I'm sorry?

26
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,340
Humanity has less than...

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,910
100 years left.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,980
Professor, what are you talking about?

29
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,120
Now, I'm not here to preach some...

30
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,720
YOLO-esque optimism about living it up while we can.

31
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,530
Everyone in this class...

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,360
is part of what you might call an Extinction Community.

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,700
You're all sharing this era of extinction.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,100
That certainly makes for a special bond, doesn't it?

35
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,140
Now, I want you to form those communities.

36
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,740
When you say "community,"

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,210
do you mean you want us to get into groups?

38
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,850
Yes.

39
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,390
Professor, you need to make this announcement before you wrap up.

40
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,890
Right.

41
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,160
Professor Eum Nan Sae's Creative Integrated Design class...

42
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,699
has been named the signature course...

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,430
for our Converged Physical Tech Department...

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,499
and Global Content Development.

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,900
Therefore, your work will be entered...

46
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,440
into the Hangang University President's Cup App Contest...

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,340
- will be automatically entered... - This all sounds...

48
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,650
a bit complicated, doesn't it?

49
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,380
They say the longer the explanation, the bigger the lie.

50
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,520
In any case, you must form teams of four.

51
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,920
Why do the teams have to be made of four people?

52
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,600
To debunk an East Asian superstition that the number four is unlucky.

53
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,900
Pardon?

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,060
I'm kidding.

55
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,870
Right, anyway.

56
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,739
With this class size,

57
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,380
teams of four are just easier for me to grade.

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
All right then.

59
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,750
And let me give you one word of caution.

60
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,520
I will not be accepting proposals based on...

61
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,930
unrealistic concepts, such as manipulating human dreams...

62
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,060
to enable coding during sleep.

63
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,860
Ideas that exist only as hollow shells designed...

64
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,170
to fool users without feasibility will be rejected.

65
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
That is all.

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,770
(Hangang University, Department of Computer Engineering)

67
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,770
That's it?

68
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,410
That's all?

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,980
Does she know about our idea? How could she be so specific?

70
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,749
I don't know what that was all about,

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,950
but I guess our project is on hold?

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,250
Emergency meeting. Right here.

73
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,320
In exactly 15 minutes.

74
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,820
(15 Minutes Later)

75
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,559
Sorry. My bad.

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,259
I skipped a step in my routine this morning...

77
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,530
and just hit with the runs.

78
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,210
What's his deal?

79
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,540
This is for breaking your laptop yesterday.

80
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,780
We decided to drop the formalities.

81
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,650
You just did, too.

82
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,150
- I did? - Accept it, San. We need to work.

83
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,290
So I asked around...

84
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,030
and for the line of laptops you use,

85
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,130
they said this one is the absolute best.

86
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,630
Gosh, that's amazing. This one folds all the way back.

87
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,540
I was rather hoping you'd just wire me the money.

88
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,540
Hey, even the used price for this is higher than what you asked for.

89
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,340
Since data recovery will be so hard, I guess this will have to do.

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,980
You should at least appreciate the gesture.

91
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,320
Fine. Thanks for keeping your word.

92
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,520
Based on the lowest online price, minus my old one's depreciation,

93
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,860
I'll pay you back the difference.

94
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,890
Anyway, we have to get on with our scheduled plans.

95
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,400
What if Min Hak joins us for that?

96
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,040
- No way. - I already got approval to sit in.

97
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,310
This is for computer engineering majors...

98
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,539
Not exclusively.

99
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,750
According to the requirements, you must partner with a non-major.

100
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,820
Plus, that makes a four-person team, just like our professor wanted.

101
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,120
A celebrity just fell into our laps. How great is that?

102
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,189
I get that he's a "celebrity,"

103
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,430
who'd spray mist on a laptop, but...

104
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,030
Joo Yeon San from Cheongnyong Elementary School.

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
That's you, right?

106
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,710
Don't tell me they're long-lost childhood friends.

107
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,750
If they are, that's a pretty tired trope.

108
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,180
I'm sure he's about to explain.

109
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,230
He's having a flashback.

110
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,400
When he should be explaining, he's having a flashback instead.

111
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,470
It only just hit me last night.

112
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,970
Do you even remember the laptop you broke today?

113
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,609
You bent it, poured soda over it,

114
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,679
and tried drying it with a hairdryer!

115
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,549
I need it for my job, my schoolwork, and a competition,

116
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,319
- which is why I came... - It's not like the spaceship...

117
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,450
would just stop in mid-air.

118
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,620
As you explained, an EMP is an electromagnetic shockwave.

119
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,720
So the spacecraft's computer systems would shut down...

120
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,190
That's her, always meticulously arguing every single point.

121
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,330
The number two appears p-minus-two times.

122
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,929
That's right! This year's champion of the Science Genius Quiz is...

123
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,130
Cheongnyong Elementary's 3rd-grader,

124
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,030
- Joo Yeon San! - Joo Yeon San!

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
What's your deal?

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's the tone.

127
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,609
With that exact attitude,

128
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,340
I saw you on the live broadcast winning first place weekly, monthly,

129
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,909
and season-long.

130
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,510
I even subscribed to your workbooks.

131
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,480
- Hey! Stop! - Stop!

132
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,550
Jinx! Min Hak, you said nothing, and San I, you didn't hear a thing!

133
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,120
You just pushed her berserk button.

134
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,820
Whatever. What's your deal?

135
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,060
What do you want from us?

136
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,630
(LOVE.exe)

137
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,960
(Episode 4: Forming Teams)

138
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,030
(Nine hours earlier, Somewhere in Seoul)

139
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,100
- Hey, I can't see anything. - Sorry.

140
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,270
All right, this is the photo in question.

141
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,340
They'll leak it in one month, which means we have 29 days left.

142
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,210
Gosh, anyone can tell that's our Min Hak and Jinny.

143
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,750
Jinny, you can see this, right?

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,250
Yes, I see it.

145
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,050
Reporters will ask for confirmation, so here's the official story.

146
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,260
Our line is, "We met casually on 'Match on Wheels.'"

147
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,530
This is in front of a hotel. That's hardly a "casual" setting.

148
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,960
That's precisely why I called this meeting.

149
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,670
The story is that you two just met by chance at the hotel bar.

150
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,529
People aren't idiots.

151
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,570
If we put out a clumsy denial...

152
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,340
and then it comes out that they've met before...

153
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,440
What you're saying is that we should admit it publicly?

154
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,850
- Excuse me? - He's asking if we should admit it.

155
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,310
I'm just saying it's one of our options.

156
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,420
What do they want?

157
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,480
Didn't say anything yet. Just to reveal it a month later.

158
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,890
We can't trust scumbags like them. They could leak it tomorrow.

159
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,530
Coming through.

160
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,530
They could spread it, so we should just be honest...

161
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Can you turn the screen, please? Toward Min Hak.

162
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,010
Didn't you say you knew her?

163
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,350
Her, I mean. The owner of the laptop you broke.

164
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,220
What?

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
- The Quiz King. - "Quiz King?"

166
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,790
Yes, the Quiz King I told you about.

167
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,190
Turns out she goes to my university.

168
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,730
The laptop owner is Quiz King, and Quiz King owns the laptop.

169
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,789
Okay, none of that matters.

170
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,470
Anyway, you'll say you met that girl in front of the hotel that day,

171
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,099
and I was coincidentally in the shot.

172
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,200
- Got it? - Nice.

173
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,370
Sir, if you spin this the right way,

174
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,970
it looks like he's seeing her. Right?

175
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Right!

176
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,750
Excuse me. I need a word with Jinny.

177
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,350
I can't go along with this. It's not right.

178
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,050
Joo Yeon San has nothing to do with us.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,690
It's not like this will hurt her.

180
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,390
Honestly, Min Hak, you're not even a full-fledged celebrity yet.

181
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,030
And she's just a regular person.

182
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,599
I mean, they're just two students hanging out.

183
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
How will that become a dating scandal?

184
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,730
Min Hak, we must think about our next level.

185
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,240
Look, once Min Hak starts going to school,

186
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,570
students will post pictures anyway.

187
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,110
He just has to go to his classes.

188
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,010
And be seen being friendly with this girl.

189
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,980
And then people naturally come up with their own stories about them.

190
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,550
Okay.

191
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,180
Say Min Hak focuses on his classes.

192
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,119
How about the lost income during this time?

193
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
How will you cover that loss?

194
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:44,590
Well, what do you propose?

195
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,290
He's asking what you want in return.

196
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,329
I heard Jinny got a streaming original film gig.

197
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,490
How about getting Min Hak in there as well?

198
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,100
I just met with Director Cha Nook, and I'm sure of it.

199
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,099
I'll be in his next project.

200
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,970
It'll be released globally on an OTT.

201
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,840
This is such a crucial moment for my career.

202
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,910
What? You mean acting?

203
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,879
Yes, someone like Bong or Chan.

204
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,380
Or even the director of "Squid Game."

205
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,880
Why would directors of that calibre cast Min Hak?

206
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,020
What's wrong with Min Hak?

207
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,460
Excuse me. We're not blood-related, but he's like my little brother.

208
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,120
Hey, you can't just talk about him like that...

209
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,300
Okay. Deal. Bong, Chan, Eun Sook, "Squid Game?"

210
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,870
Sure. I'll get them to contact you directly very soon.

211
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,900
Could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him.

212
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,569
What is he saying?

213
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,340
Whatever OTT service it is, it doesn't matter.

214
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,180
What's the point of putting him through these auditions?

215
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,850
What's the point of even giving him an audition?

216
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,320
- We've already seen what he can do. - We've already sized him up.

217
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,020
And his acting is...

218
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,890
- uninspirational. - His acting is wooden, right?

219
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,360
He's also a triple threat, isn't he?

220
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,930
He's tone-deaf, can't dance, and has no rhythm.

221
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,270
He's basically a tree up there. Anything for a client like this?

222
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,039
There was that XX Brand season opening party Jinny couldn't make,

223
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,509
and there's that new beauty show our subsidiary launched...

224
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,240
And maybe a couple of viral ads?

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,650
What do you say?

226
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,010
Deal?

227
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Deal.

228
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,750
Let's get some jjajangmyeon.

229
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,430
Even if we have to grow apart for a while,

230
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,530
we'll become more valuable...

231
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,670
Later, we'll be more "together?"

232
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,910
No. "Value." As in, V-A-L-U-E.

233
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,609
- "Value." - Let's meet once...

234
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,840
we're more valuable.

235
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,880
Min Hak, you can help me with this, can't you?

236
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,850
Yes.

237
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,550
Jinny.

238
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Wait...

239
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,990
Min Hak, let's go.

240
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,930
He said he was your fan, San. Sounds like a first crush, right?

241
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,969
Plus, the whole smart and nerdy image is...

242
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,400
trending these days,

243
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,600
so I guess they're trying to brand him as that kind of icon.

244
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,410
Sorry. Was that too blunt?

245
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,640
So you figured it out.

246
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,880
I'm already committing to the role.

247
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,650
I even got bangs to look the part.

248
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,620
Whose bright idea was it to come here?

249
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,190
Mine. All the classrooms are in use. The modelling majors took our lounge.

250
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,860
Anyone have a better idea?

251
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,730
By the way,

252
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,330
is something still wrong?

253
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,070
This is usually a blind spot. If you're pulling an all-nighter,

254
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,670
it's the kind of spot where the guard turns off the lights.

255
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,469
But right now, all eyes are on you.

256
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,040
This'll be on Everytime any minute.

257
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,940
With our faces in the photos too.

258
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,309
I guess so.

259
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,050
I've never been photographed so openly like this.

260
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,990
Excuse me.

261
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,130
If you're going to post this, please blur their faces.

262
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,590
I'd really appreciate it.

263
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,670
Sorry, I didn't mean to make you guys uncomfortable.

264
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,370
They shouldn't be posting it in the first place, should they?

265
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,439
I feel like a celebrity's friend,

266
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,410
and this special feeling I get...

267
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,710
isn't half bad.

268
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,380
You two can continue your fan meet-and-greet here.

269
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,110
Hang on, sit down.

270
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,650
I'm actually curious too.

271
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,020
Min Hak, you don't actually have to take this class.

272
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,960
It's required for Computer Science, not Modelling.

273
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,190
That's true.

274
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,600
Why are you so gung-ho about this competition?

275
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,500
It's kind of hard to explain.

276
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,540
Try me. I'm listening.

277
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,910
Where do I even begin?

278
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,940
Was I 11 at the time?

279
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,910
No, wait. I was in third grade, so...

280
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,420
Third grade...

281
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,920
- Ten. - Right, ten.

282
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,760
Anyway, my grandfather was sick and had been hospitalized.

283
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,860
- Okay. - It was a hospital in Eungam-dong.

284
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,799
No, wait.

285
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,499
Before I get to that, I should probably start from...

286
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,800
when my grandpa was raising my dad.

287
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,800
Hey, can you just get to the point?

288
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,500
Oh, okay, so...

289
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,810
The age gap between my dad and me... I was ten, so my dad was...

290
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,710
- He can't have been 20, the gap... - Right.

291
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,249
So when you were ten,

292
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,650
your grandpa, who raised your dad, was hospitalized...

293
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,119
and something happened...

294
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,520
that made you want to participate in this competition?

295
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,890
Yes, exactly.

296
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,159
But what's most important is...

297
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,590
that we'd watch "Quiz King" weekly.

298
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,400
I guess you want to be in an event like a competition for yourself.

299
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,300
But if you only want to team up because I was a kid on quiz shows,

300
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,670
what about him?

301
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,809
So I have to vote for you? Thanks.

302
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,880
Why him?

303
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,350
When San became the monthly champ, that's the kid who cried behind her.

304
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,349
His name's Ban Ji No. He's in our department, too.

305
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,379
(Ban Ji No, Changnam Elementary)

306
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,820
(Trait: Even the teacher finds him exhausting)

307
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,760
What a strange combination...

308
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,889
He says Hangang University is a stepping-stone...

309
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,160
for transferring to Seoul National.

310
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,760
And he won't shut up about it.

311
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,030
There are so many smart people here.

312
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,630
But I don't want to team up with anyone else.

313
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,700
I want to do this with you, San.

314
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,380
Na Rae, why are you getting secondhand embarrassment?

315
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,180
- Java. - What?

316
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,150
Java.

317
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,320
(Java: A popular programming language)

318
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,590
A pop quiz out of nowhere?

319
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,990
Like this?

320
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,460
So you don't know it.

321
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Can you let go?

322
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
How about Swift?

323
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,470
(Swift: A programming language for developing iOS-based apps)

324
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Taylor?

325
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,840
Taylor Swift.

326
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,840
That's such a dad joke.

327
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,650
- Python. - Python?

328
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,819
Is that like "red sun" or something?

329
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,020
Py...

330
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,390
thon.

331
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,619
I'm not sure...

332
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,100
San, it feels like you're taking an unfair shot at other majors.

333
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,600
Kang Dong Won. Weren't you leading the opposition?

334
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,100
This is a completely different issue.

335
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,869
Right. We don't all need to be coders.

336
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,910
That was a cheap shot, Joo Yeon San.

337
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,170
That's not like you. You're always so reasonable.

338
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,610
And don't even start with the whole, "What's so 'me' about me?" routine.

339
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,150
Look, I promise I'll work really hard.

340
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,250
I'll study all the terms you asked about today,

341
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,319
and I'm well aware that in many ways I'm not exactly an ideal member...

342
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,860
You're not a member yet.

343
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,560
We all have classes to get to, and we could use a change of scene.

344
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,999
Let's just take a break for now.

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,300
Min Hak, you're good with that?

346
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,829
Yes, I kept my whole day free for this.

347
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,570
- Okay. - I'm heading out.

348
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,510
Okay.

349
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,340
See you later.

350
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,690
Just read the room and take it easy.

351
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,060
You've taken enough pictures. Just make up some excuse...

352
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,830
and tell them you can't make it starting next week.

353
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,470
Here, try this.

354
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Sponsored.

355
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,040
What's with the look, Min Hak? I like it.

356
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,480
I have to come up with a reason why this team needs me.

357
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,480
- Come back with a solid argument. - An argument?

358
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,489
Nothing vague like "making memories."

359
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,890
A real reason why you should join.

360
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,830
Like what you want to do with us, or what you can bring to the table.

361
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,400
I admire your academic passion,

362
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,430
but you don't have to overdo it.

363
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,370
This is all part of the act, you know?

364
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,640
If I want them to believe me, I have to be convincing.

365
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,610
Right. You're really committed to the method.

366
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,239
By the way, Min Hak, didn't you set a reminder...

367
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,750
for the feed update yesterday?

368
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,050
The manager over there called and said you missed the post time.

369
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,080
"Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

370
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,450
It's a famous saying.

371
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,960
Let's not be as irresponsible as some.

372
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,260
The days when only tall, thin people could be models are over.

373
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,400
In that sense, the merger of our two very different majors...

374
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,570
is perhaps just a natural sign of the times.

375
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,370
The CompSci students?

376
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,810
It's okay. I can tell who's who without any help.

377
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,640
I have very high hopes for our CompSci students.

378
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,480
All right, shall we have you come up one by one and walk for us?

379
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,880
Be free, be edgy!

380
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,930
Mind your stride, long and smooth.

381
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,790
Watch your foot placement.

382
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,100
Excellent.

383
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,730
Head up, like a string is pulling it from the top. That's it!

384
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,600
Your eyeline.

385
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,340
Excellent.

386
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,040
You're an absolute charm bomb. I love it.

387
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,780
Okay, let's get our CompSci students up here, one by one.

388
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,650
Yes, lovely!

389
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,620
That's it! With confidence.

390
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,180
And the final pose!

391
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
A king!

392
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,250
All right, next.

393
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,030
Okay, let's not smile.

394
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,600
Be serious. Now, wipe that smile off your face.

395
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Right.

396
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,140
Work that stride a little bit...

397
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,080
Gosh. That was good, though.

398
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,380
All right, be confident. That's it, a confident power walk!

399
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,250
Hey, you did great. You really did.

400
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,420
- I love this class! Right? - Kill the music.

401
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,820
Kill it!

402
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,360
Music off!

403
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,660
You, in the polka-dot skirt.

404
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,930
Why did you sign up for this class?

405
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,040
- Who, me? - Yes.

406
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,110
It looked like fun.

407
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,640
So you think you're a bit different, a little special?

408
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,410
- What? - That's fine.

409
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,120
But let's let the audience call you special.

410
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,950
If only you think you're special, you're not connecting with anyone.

411
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,059
- Right. - I know it's just an elective,

412
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,560
but I don't know how can I teach you at this level.

413
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,930
I'm going to run this class with an open mind.

414
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,260
But if any of you signed up for this class just for fun,

415
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,200
you might want to consider dropping.

416
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,040
I'm not pointing anyone out, so don't take it personally.

417
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,339
All right, I'll give you some time.

418
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,780
The Modelling majors, pair up and give pointers.

419
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,879
I'll see you at the end of class.

420
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,550
Now, pair up.

421
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,720
Be free, be edgy.

422
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,420
Is there a female CompSci major who wants to pair up?

423
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,590
Okay, chest out.

424
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,420
Keep your feet parallel.

425
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,730
Okay, that's good. Look forward.

426
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,960
And just hold that tension...

427
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
You leaving?

428
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,810
Ever heard of that guy?

429
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,040
Professor Bi Gwang? No.

430
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,550
If you try looking that guy up online...

431
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,650
Gosh.

432
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,850
You're getting push around by him.

433
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,190
He's not even in the industry. He knows nothing about walking.

434
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,930
- It's a nepotism hire. - Nepotism?

435
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,560
- He's the Chairman's nephew. - The Chairman's nephew?

436
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,400
I heard they brought him in as some "Communications Expert,"

437
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,370
Communication, empathy, and walking? He's a total con artist. A fraud.

438
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,770
You'll pass as long as you show up, so don't let him intimidate you.

439
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,780
Forget all that. Just remember one thing.

440
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
Confidence.

441
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Confidence?

442
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,180
All right, let's do this. Okay, feet parallel.

443
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,690
- Parallel? - Yep. All right, go!

444
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,750
Go!

445
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,760
You can swing your arms a bit. Tuck your chin in slightly.

446
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,760
- Tucked in. - Right. Eyes forward.

447
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,029
- Like this? - Hey, don't be so self-conscious.

448
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,630
Say, "I'm a gift from the skies."

449
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,200
- Walk. - "I'm a gift from the skies."

450
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,070
All right, "I parachuted my way in."

451
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,370
"I parachuted my way in."

452
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,780
(Department of Modelling, Class in progress)

453
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,620
I didn't feel a draft a second ago.

454
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,019
You said it'd be cool, spacious, with no people.

455
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,190
Is this the best you could do?

456
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,890
- It's all due to climate change. - No, it's because of the merger.

457
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,520
You're coming to the meeting, right?

458
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,060
We're electing an emergency chair, so you have to come.

459
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,530
We can't let the Modelling Majors walk all over us.

460
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,970
- Na Rae, this is for you. - What?

461
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,000
Kang Min Hak, you really...

462
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,539
You're handsome and sweet, too?

463
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,810
Are you the only one?

464
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,310
That was my way of saying thanks, you know?

465
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,280
(28 Minutes Later)

466
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,650
Okay, our next idea. Sweet Home.

467
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,220
Honestly, this is an idea I've been keeping up my sleeve.

468
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,760
If you have a spare room, you take pictures of it beforehand.

469
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,099
You post them on a popular site,

470
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,870
and when foreign tourists see them,

471
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,040
they'll book your room over a hotel and they pay you.

472
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,770
And the homeowner gets to rent out their room...

473
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,010
Airbnb...

474
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,940
Okay, let's stop there.

475
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
What?

476
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,610
Look.

477
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,819
Min Hak, it's not a personal attack.

478
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,390
But what we need right now is...

479
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,259
someone to help manage future risks...

480
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,230
while developing our contest app.

481
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,130
Someone with actual solutions.

482
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,930
But in the less than half a day we've spent with you,

483
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,069
we're already background characters...

484
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,640
in your social media posts.

485
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,240
And now our looks are getting rated.

486
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,770
You're becoming a liability.

487
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,039
Rating our looks? Who are those jerks? Darn it.

488
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm not going to let them get away with this.

489
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,510
Sorry, but can I see it? That post on Everytime.

490
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,700
I'll take care of it.

491
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,300
And... I'm sorry.

492
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,140
I apologise.

493
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,739
That "Engineering student vibe?"

494
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,210
I have no idea what that is,

495
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,980
but you needed that look for your pics, and if...

496
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,509
No, if we were okay with being props,

497
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,350
you've already got what you came for.

498
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,050
I don't have any more time to waste on your little performance.

499
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,750
No, scratch that. I don't want to waste any more time.

500
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,520
Hey!

501
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,530
You're being way too harsh today.

502
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,360
Hey, Min Hak! Let's take five, okay?

503
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
- Sure. - Yes.

504
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,300
Just a second. Come on.

505
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
That's it.

506
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,340
I think we need a moment to discuss our governance policy.

507
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,870
Maybe I should go get some fresh air.

508
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,180
Did you really have to go that far?

509
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,009
Even if his head is in the clouds,

510
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,250
you can't humiliate him like that.

511
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,879
So what if he wanted that nerdy look...

512
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,590
to post pics with us?

513
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,359
Even if he is a clueless guy and has used us,

514
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,490
he still has feelings, right?

515
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,430
Na Rae, are you taking Min Hak's side right now?

516
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,560
Why does there have to be sides in this?

517
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,200
- Gosh, you scared me. - Want to know what I really think?

518
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,139
- What the... - Yeon San, I totally get why...

519
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,910
you keep pushing Min Hak away.

520
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,439
He’s got a full-blown celebrity complex...

521
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,410
and offers to sigh his autograph, blabbering "Ahn In Dae."

522
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,209
He brags about you being the Quiz King.

523
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,579
He broke your laptop,

524
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,749
made you lose out on the scholarship,

525
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,450
and forces you into the limelight when you hate attention.

526
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,750
I admit, he's been a complete walking disaster.

527
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,060
But it's not like Min Hak meant to do any of that, right?

528
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,760
The guy's a total blank slate.

529
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,630
There's nothing going on inside that pretty little head.

530
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,570
You know it's better to write code from scratch than fix a buggy mess?

531
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,140
So let's be the ones to fill his blank slate...

532
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,510
with a beautiful programming language.

533
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,640
You're worse than she is, you know that?

534
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,480
It seems to me you're pretending to have Min Hak's back,

535
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,380
but you're getting all your jabs in anyway.

536
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,090
Hang in there.

537
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,589
On the other hand,

538
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,760
don't you think our world-view is a little limited?

539
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,329
What do the three of us do all day?

540
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,559
We wake up and get on the computer.

541
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Eat and then get on the computer.

542
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Come to school and get the computer.

543
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:09,230
We even get on the computer before we go to bed.

544
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,200
Speak for yourself. I actually have relationships in the real world.

545
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,599
Min Hak lives in another world.

546
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,440
He's on another operating system.

547
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,610
An operating system?

548
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,610
But it's compatible with a lot of different operating systems.

549
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,780
Like us? Even though we're different?

550
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,420
In that case, Min Hak's experience and perspective could help us grow.

551
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,590
Plus, we can finally even out our gender ratio.

552
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,020
- There are other guys in class... - You could say that,

553
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,790
but who's actually asked to join our team?

554
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,860
Excuse me.

555
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,930
Don't fight because of me.

556
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,640
I'll just leave.

557
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,509
I wasn't seeking a reason to join.

558
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,140
I was trying to see why you'd want me on the team,

559
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,510
but thinking about it, I can't find one either.

560
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,350
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused, even if it was unintentional.

561
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,950
But it was nice meeting you all.

562
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,890
I've always really wanted to meet Joo Yeon San.

563
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,330
I even imagined what it would be like...

564
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,100
to be on the same team as a genius like you.

565
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,130
I guess I just got carried away.

566
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,990
Hey. Yeon San.

567
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,530
If I were really a genius,

568
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,600
I probably wouldn't be here arguing with you.

569
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,780
San, it's one thing not to work with him,

570
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,480
but are you really just going to let him leave?

571
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,950
Kang Min Hak, wait!

572
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,299
And just like that, I crashed.

573
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,340
Joo Yeon San.

574
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,680
I should've seen the signs, starting with that bizarre dream.

575
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,750
My firewall must have been compromised.

576
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,350
Over-processing inputs repeatedly created an overblown output.

577
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,119
The Quiz King bit is a sore spot,

578
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,590
but I thought I was over it.

579
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,630
But that's just an excuse.

580
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,530
I am the error now.

581
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,470
To use a PC analogy, it's like my cooling fan is broken.

582
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,110
The fact that I keep overheating is proof that he's getting to me.

583
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,680
To think that my past few weeks, like a cheesy rom-com I worked on,

584
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,880
were all a build-up to me ending up in this la-la land.

585
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,480
It's so unfair. It's infuriating. This isn't rational.

586
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,359
So, to fixate on a meaningless dream...

587
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,790
and push him away like this...

588
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,860
might actually be the more irrational choice.

589
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,130
Admit the error and correct course.

590
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
San.

591
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,130
Oh, right.

592
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,029
First, I should apologise too.

593
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,070
The heat, humidity, media environment,

594
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,269
and the school's arbitrary rules...

595
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,640
I think all of these variables affected our communication...

596
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,009
and made things worse.

597
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,740
How about we find an empty classroom and try again tomorrow...

598
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,910
Sorry.

599
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,350
It's okay. An alarm can go off.

600
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,580
(Next: Stay Green Live Ad at 3:00pm)

601
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,820
Speaking of which...

602
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,850
- I have a scheduled ad time. - What?

603
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,460
This won't take long. Just give me a minute.

604
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,200
Why the breath spray?

605
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,270
Hey, everyone! You're with me on StayGreen, right?

606
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,800
From the eco-friendly golf course, Stay Green CC,

607
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,639
- An eco-friendly golf course? - we're raffling off tickets...

608
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,240
at our eco-friendly flea market.

609
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,350
What a relief. My cooling fan is running again.

610
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,580
I put the link in my bio, so make sure you all sign up.

611
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,719
On the course, let's get some eagles and albatrosses together.

612
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,850
Bye!

613
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,400
(How it feels to be an engineering student)

614
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,710
Influencer, engineering major, boyfriend material pics.

615
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,910
(Hello)

616
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,039
What?

617
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,010
(Hello)

618
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,150
Hello. This is movie director Bong Joon...

619
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,780
The reason I'm writing is that I'd like to meet Kang Min Hak...

620
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,990
Bong!

621
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,790
A burner account?

622
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,659
Darn it, who are they kidding?

623
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,060
(Up yours!)

624
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,340
What? You're done already?

625
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,710
I'm not doing this anymore.

626
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,480
What? What about your promise to Jinny?

627
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,810
This whole thing was ridiculous from the start.

628
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,350
Let's just find another way.

629
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,490
(12 Years Earlier)

630
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,460
(Kang Min Hak, 10, 3rd Grade, Myeongin Elementary)

631
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,730
(Hobbies: Magnetic tops, quiz shows)

632
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,060
- Min Hak. - And once again,

633
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,200
young Joo Yeon San was the quickest on the buzzer.

634
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,800
- Min Hak. - Yes, Grandpa?

635
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,140
The men in our family line have had handsome features,

636
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,969
tall frames, and gentle natures.

637
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,380
But not a single one of our ancestors...

638
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,040
ever managed to hold public office.

639
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,909
I know.

640
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,510
You said we were a line of blockheads.

641
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,420
Your father could barely even read, yet he got lucky with the times...

642
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,350
and now struts around like a big shot.

643
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,660
But how long do you think getting by on a pretty face will last?

644
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,030
In today's harsh society, for men like me and your father,

645
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,600
just having a handsome face and a tall frame...

646
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,370
is completely worthless.

647
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,269
Yes. I'm always mindful of that.

648
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,340
The correct answer is EMP, which means electromagnetic pulse.

649
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,269
You'll start balding around 40.

650
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,670
From that point on,

651
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,979
for men like us, who get by on our looks,

652
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,710
our value will just plummet.

653
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,580
(Joo Yeon San, Ban Ji No)

654
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Grandpa!

655
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,290
Grandpa!

656
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,259
Just like how the fool Ondal met Princess Pyeonggang,

657
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,260
you need to marry a smart woman.

658
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,729
Our family isn't blessed with brains,

659
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,930
so improving our gene pool...

660
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,730
is the only way we'll survive in the 21st century!

661
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,900
A smart woman like Princess Pyeonggang?

662
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,140
Like that kid, Joo Yeon San, the Quiz King?

663
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,110
Dream on! She's the monthly quiz show champ.

664
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,050
Why would a girl that brilliant give you the time of day?

665
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,310
That's what I was thinking!

666
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,180
Of course, if the stars align...

667
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,190
and a talent like her were to actually give you a chance...

668
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,950
Joo Yeon San.

669
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,490
If you get this right, you will win the title.

670
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,330
The number two appears p-minus-two times.

671
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,900
That's right! This year's champion of the Science Genius Quiz is...

672
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,770
Cheongnyong Elementary's 3rd-grader, Joo Yeon San!

673
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,640
Cheongnyong Elementary School, Joo Yeon San...

674
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,064
