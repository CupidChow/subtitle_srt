33
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,170
A male student snuck in here recently to see a female student.

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,210
I caught him doing some weird stuff.

35

It's a good thing I found them when I did.

We really are, but... No, it's not like that.

You see, we're taking conversational data...

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,590
and labeling it based on emotion. It's all done manually, so...

39
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,620
it takes a really long time. That's why we're still here so late.

- We're sorry, - We're doing this labeling...

- because... - We'll leave right away. Sorry.

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960

We didn't do anything.

Was it a simple random seed collision,

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,770
or a coincidental convergence?

I got stuck with a broken-up couple.

78
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,220
Why is it always group projects and presentations in CompSci?

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,830
- Why don't we get a proper lecture? - This whole situation...

80
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,930
This feels like that campus drama you were a script consultant for?

81
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,370
- What? - The one on liberal arts writers.

82
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,940
You said when they wrote a show set in our department, it felt clunky?

83
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,040
You're right. That's so true.

84
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,440
That's when they should've called on a genius like me.

85
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,740
I could have made that script flow so much better.

86
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,980
First thing I'd do is make them kiss in Jang Yeong Sil Hall.

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,020

88
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,420
Let's go.

89
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,030
Tell them Mon and Fri nights I'm busy with my work.

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,330
Tell them I have tutoring Tues and Thurs and PT on Wednesday.

91
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,200
You all heard that, right? Why don't we just do this online?

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,510
Online for us, too?

93
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,410
Forget it. I'll do the project. Na Rae, just put your name on it.

94
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,550
Normally, I'd jump at that offer, but coming from you, it's sketchy.

95
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,450
I'll have better quality control and get a higher grade on my own.

96
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,290
It's a purely rational suggestion.

97
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,160
This project isn't about feasibility.

98
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,460
It's about how bold and imaginative you can be.

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,960
And that, as a matter of fact, is my specialty.

100
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,430
Fine.

101
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,430
So, when should we work on our project?

102
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,110
Sorry, but would it be too late to do it next week?

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,340
But the presentation is next week.

104
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,140
The thing is...

105
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,450
I have things scheduled all afternoon,

106
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,650
and tomorrow I fly abroad for a shoot.

107
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,790
But if we don't have to meet,

108
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
- I can do it this week. - He's flying out tomorrow?

109
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,830
There's not much time difference.

110
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,500
I guess we don't necessarily have to meet in person.

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,570
Or how about Monday? We have to meet for the Competition.

112
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,070
Right.

113
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,170
Since we'll all be together, let's work on this project then.

114
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,670
All of us together?

115
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,210
Yes, that could work.

116
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,410
Min Hak.

117
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,610
- Let me know your thoughts on that. - Got it.

118
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,590
For someone so busy, you're here a lot.

119
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,890
- Not really. - Hey, Na Rae.

120
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,220
Hey, what are you up to?

121
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,390
What the heck? That's it? Just a "hey?"

122
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,210
Dong Won.

123
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,010
You're into girls, right?

124
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,380
- But what if you kissed a guy? - What?

125
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,920
You're the kind of person who would never, ever kiss a guy,

126
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,250
but you ended up kissing him. Why would that happen?

127
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
A bet?

128
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,190
- A bet? - Yes, like for a drinking game.

129
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,300
I'm not saying I would do it.

130
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,670
Or maybe...

131
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,400
To get an inheritance? They have to act straight for money?

132
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,770
I can't relate to that, since I have no inheritance.

133
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,140
Keep going.

134
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,310
To make someone jealous. As in, "I'm desirable to guys, too."

135
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,320
"So you better get it together." No, wait. It's more of a threat.

136
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,790
"I'm just gonna go with a guy, and I don't care if you're jealous."

137
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,320
Wow, you've got a lot of these.

138
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,060
- You really know your stuff. - It's what Lee Soo Min did to me.

139
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,460
Anyway, what's this really about?

140
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,660
Don't beat around the bush. Just tell me.

141
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,500
Tell you what?

142
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,030
It's the plot of a BL I'm watching.

143
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,570
Liar. The guy who kissed then ghosted you.

144
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,910
Who is he? Who the heck is he?

145
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,140
So, why kiss someone and then just say nothing?

146
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,440
What's he thinking?

147
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,910
No way. The guy across your house? Is it?

148
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,480
That guy from earlier?

149
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,220
Cheers!

150
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,160
You want me to teach you how to pick up guys?

151
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,100
Turns out, there's no one in my life who can teach me that.

152
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,470
For starters, most guys like being complimented.

153
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,740
Give them a little attention and they'll think you're into them.

154
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,080
That's seriously unhelpful advice.

155
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,610
Because I've always been the one...

156
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,210
to give guys attention and compliments.

157
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,350
I've thrown myself at even the slightest possibility.

158
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,290
But it never works!

159
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,790
And I can't just suddenly get super slim and pretty.

160
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,530
That's why I need a tip that goes beyond the physical.

161
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,470
The ultimate secret.

162
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,570
What? Why would you want to go beyond that?

163
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,440
- You're cute. - What? Are you blind?

164
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,110
- Who are you trying to win over? - What?

165
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,280
Who's the person you like?

166
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,350
Then I can come up with a strategy tailored to them.

167
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,220
He's someone who can never like me back.

168
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
What?

169
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Why not?

170
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,230
Don't tell me it's a character from a book.

171
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,870
- A 2D character? - You're not wrong, but...

172
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,170
A married man is off-limits, Na Rae. I'm surprisingly old-fashioned.

173
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,910
- I can't help you with that. - What are you talking about?

174
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,340
- What? - What?

175
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,410
Is he really married?

176
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,280
He's gay. Gay.

177
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,550
Gay...

178
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,050
Since it won't work out anyway, I figured I'd ask him for advice.

179
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,520
He seems good at charming both men and women.

180
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,090
Wait a minute. Are you talking about me?

181
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,860
For real?

182
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,460
You like me?

183
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,430
Yes.

184
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,040
At least you're not running away now that I've confessed.

185
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,780
You've never had a boyfriend?

186
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,450
Not even a fling?

187
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,120
There was this one guy I talked to for about a month,

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,250
but it turned out to be an AI account.

189
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,590
What about a kiss?

190
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,130
- That's a relief. - What?

191
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,330
A first kiss is best...

192
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,060
when it's with someone you actually like.

193
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
What?

194
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,250
And then?

195
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
What?

196
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,520
What happened next?

197
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,630
Gosh, this is way too personal.

198
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,060
I can't believe "privacy" was even a thing between us.

199
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,500
I'm shocked.

200
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,440
- We made out for three hours. - What?

201
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,870
But I drank so much beer...

202
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,380
and I had to pee, so we stopped. And then it just ended awkwardly.

203
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,380
- He went home, - And he hasn't mentioned it since?

204
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,750
No.

205
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,820
Wait, are you really listening to me for once?

206
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,420
Hanging on our every word.

207
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,630
I always thought I was just an NPC in your world.

208
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,930
No way. You've got it all wrong.

209
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,930
I don't know what to make of the situation.

210
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,930
Why did he even kiss me?

211
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,900
Was it out of pity? Or did I look so desperate...

212
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,100
that he just tossed me a kiss, "Here you go?"

213
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,610
Friends can kiss.

214
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,940
I've done it plenty of times. And sometimes, we stayed friends.

215
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,210
What? How does that even work?

216
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,810
If you dated everyone you kissed, it would be a disaster.

217
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,950
He's across your house, right? Go knock on his door and ask him.

218
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,290
It'll be a pain if it's awkward when you keep running into him.

219
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,820
Plus, he might be bi, not gay. So he might actually like you.

220
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,690
- What should I do? - What do you mean, "what?"

221
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,130
You kiss him again, of course.

222
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,360
What if he says it was a mistake and just wants to be friends?

223
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,230
And then?

224
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,230
Well, there's your answer.

225
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,900
Friends forever.

226
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,870
Or back to being strangers who don't even say hi?

227
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,040
That's how I got with Lee Soo Min, after all.

228
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,680
San, any chance you're coming to Seoul?

229
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,020
It's about our assignment.

230
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,760
My shoot I mentioned earlier is going to end early.

231
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,060
So I'll be on my own for the rest of today.

232
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,360
- Hey, don't you have class? - So...

233
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,760
- Is she not paying attention? - I don't know.

234
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,240
- Here, eat. - Sorry for making you travel alone.

235
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,070
Yes, the car's in for maintenance, but will you be okay on the subway?

236
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,710
You could just take a cab, or I could come and get you.

237
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,310
What? Me?

238
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,020
Me? I'm taking public transit today. The subway's pretty empty now.

239
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,590
People may spot you and take a photo while you're getting around,

240
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
so just be mindful.

241
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,060
Are you sure you'll be okay without me?

242
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,660
All right. Okay.

243
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,700
Yes.

244
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,980
(Hello)

245
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,750
(I'm writing because...)

246
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,280
(we'd like to set up a meeting with Kang Min Hak)

247
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,220
Jeez. These people always use DMs...

248
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,929
Seriously, Director Bong

249
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,330
Give me a call

250
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,070
I told you it couldn't be recovered. But you insisted on coming to pay.

251
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,970
- Why would you do that? - I had an errand nearby anyway.

252
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,980
Joo Yeon San.

253
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,580
- Kim Min Ji. - I'm sorry you had to come so far.

254
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,320
No, it's fine. I had an errand in Yongsan anyway.

255
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,490
- The group project is the priority. - This one's done.

256
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,190
- Joo Yeon San. - Ma'am, are you throwing this away?

257
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,560
Yes. Found it!

258
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,830
Hangang University?

259
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,930
This is our school's property. And it's in perfect condition.

260
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,570
What a waste of the budget.

261
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,940
Is it greedy to ask you to pay even if I don't recover anything?

262
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,870
It's because I take pride in my work.

263
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,710
I'll be shooting until 9pm Is that okay?

264
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,250
Yes, I can work on my assignment while I wait.

265
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,550
I've worked as a female repair technician.

266
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,650
A service fee is a service fee.

267
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,120
- To the computer eng. kids... - So this is who I am.

268
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,160
Yes, I'm home. What's up?

269
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,030
"The Guy Next Door Keeps Sleeping in My Bed."

270
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,330
What?

271
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,030
Is this Challenge League story yours? The username's the same.

272
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,770
What are you talking about? No, it's not.

273
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,740
Your view count is really low.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,170
- What are we going to do? - What do you mean, "what do we do?"

275
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,180
Mom, why would you even read that?

276
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,250
Because your writing hasn't improved at all since high school.

277
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,820
I'm worried too. When it comes to "A Passionate Romance Between Men,"

278
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,320
you don't know anything about it. Your descriptions aren't improving.

279
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,020
That's why the comments say you should focus on their romance,

280
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,260
and they're asking why the female friend keeps interfering.

281
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,800
What's wrong with the friend's role? It's his fault for leading her on.

282
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,670
Whatever. Just don't read it! I'm deleting the whole thing.

283
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,870
I'm quitting completely!

284
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,410
This jerk isn't even coming home.

285
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
(Seongsu)

286
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,490
Me, all the way out here this late.

287
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,430
Might as well catch up on my coding.

288
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,780
But...

289
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,750
Why did Kang Min Hak kiss me?

290
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,520
Could he be interested in me, too? Forget it.

291
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,050
Instead of wasting time wondering...

292
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,690
Def...

293
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,990
Why did you kiss me?

294
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,990
Sorry. It was a mistake. Let's just forget it happened.

295
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,330
If he says that, I'll kick his ass!

296
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,070
Then again, Kang Min Hak's memory isn't great.

297
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,570
We did? I was so tired that night, I don't remember a thing.

298
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,070
May 1st, 11:05pm, at YTC Lounge in Hangang Uni's Jang Yeong Sil Hall,

299
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,480
it went on for about 37 seconds.

300
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,080
So, starting to ring a bell, you fool?

301
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,380
I kiss my friends all the time.

302
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,490
I see. I'm so happy we're friends.

303
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,620
- So, tongue instead of a high-five? - You're the one who wanted to.

304
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,090
Right, I know, but!

305
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,630
You're an adult! You should think for yourself!

306
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,030
So? You didn't like it?

307
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,940
No, I liked it.

308
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,150
So I'm stuck typing this nonsense instead of actual code.

309
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,360
Sorry, the shoot's delayed. Some of the equipment broke.

310
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,960
What the...

311
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,430
Excuse me, Miss. We're closing now.

312
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,240
Okay.

313
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,480
What am I even doing? At least Python gives you an error.

314
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,840
I hate trying to figure out people's feelings.

315
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,510
If today's not good, I'll just go. We can do it another time.

316
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,020
Yeon San, don't go... Can you come over here?

317
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,450
What?

318
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,070
Wow, the owner is so lazy. It's May but the background is snow?

319
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Tell me about it.

320
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,080
Season Three of The Shadow Chef is out. Want to watch it later?

321
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,550
My place again?

322
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,810
What? You don't want to?

323
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,750
It's not that.

324
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,390
I have a big interview tomorrow and I have to prep all night.

325
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,990
I won't be a bother. For real.

326
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,190
You say that, but when I use my PC, you'll threaten to microwave it.

327
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,460
Hey, hearing just that makes me sound like a psycho.

328
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,430
But you actually did.

329
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,000
That was when we were kids. Ages ago.

330
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,040
Also, my place is a complete mess right now.

331
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,140
I'll clean up for you. Laundry and all.

332
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,810
I'm the one who messed it up anyway.

333
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,880
And then you'll forget to check the pockets...

334
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,640
and end up washing a lighter again.

335
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,650
You still love me, though, right?

336
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
You're unbelievable.

337
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,320
Stop complaining about the rent and go sleep in your own bed.

338
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,160
What, am I not comfortable to be around?

339
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,960
That's not what I meant.

340
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,810
Is your interview tomorrow for the Student Council too?

341
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,710
- Yes. - You should just quit the council.

342
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,310
It's not like you doing all this changes anything,

343
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,980
and who even appreciates all the hard work you do?

344
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,850
While you're busy with that, others are figuring out their own careers.

345
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,530
- Okay, I get it. - If you get it, get off your phone.

346
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,430
What the? You changed your passcode.

347
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,360
I thought I told you to tell me when you change it.

348
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Give it to me.

349
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,400
(Commercial Shoot in Progress, Dolmiyeok Yugidan, right here)

350
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,340
- Is the gear coming? - Yes, on my way.

351
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,480
Excuse me, you dropped this.

352
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,350
- Can you give me a hand with this? - What?

353
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Here, take this too.

354
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,490
Hey, grab this too!

355
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,390
Come on, this way.

356
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,230
What?

357
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Quiz King?

358
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,910
- Oh, hello. - What are you doing here? Working?

359
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,550
Kang Min Hak told me to meet him here.

360
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
Min Hak? Why?

361
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
For a project.

362
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,520
He said he's late with camera gear and told me to wait here.

363
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,020
Just put that down for now and follow me.

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,700
Actor coming through.

365
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,120
- How have you been? - I've been well.

366
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,190
Don't worry about the laptop. Okay? Let's take it easier this time.

367
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,530
- Wow, you two look great together. - Okay, let's start the rehearsal.

368
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,589
This summer, right here,

369
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,930
- how about a staycation? - How about a staycation?

370
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
Okay, Min Hak, that's good. Hae Na, get a little closer.

371
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,330
- Okay. - Min Hak, try putting your arm up?

372
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,270
- My arm? - Yes.

373
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,840
You two look great. Okay, now look at each other.

374
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,980
You two are so into it.

375
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,950
- All right, focus. Focus. - Focus.

376
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,450
Okay, I love this shot. All right, let's roll with this.

377
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,230
Here, take this. You're still here.

378
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,230
What kind of project is this...

379
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,530
Must we meet in person so late? Is it that urgent?

380
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,800
It's not exactly urgent, but...

381
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,640
It'd help if you could be flexible and just handle things on your end.

382
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,910
You know Min Hak has an early flight to Bangkok tomorrow for work, right?

383
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,350
I doubt he'll even have time for some shut-eye when this is over.

384
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,150
And about that competition... It's going to be tough for Min Hak.

385
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,850
I was hoping he'd drop out around now.

386
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,390
Is that what Kang Min Hak wants?

387
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,190
No. He's determined to finish it even if he skips meals or sleep,

388
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,660
or even if he collapses. He'll keep his promise at all costs.

389
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,230
As you can see, Min Hak isn't just some regular person.

390
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,240
He's already squeezing his schedule just to attend school.

391
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,340
And it's the same with the competition.

392
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,810
I know assignments like this are important to you,

393
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,410
but you're both on different paths anyway, right?

394
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,480
- Min Hak is... - This summer, right here...

395
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,350
He's at a very critical point in his career right now.

396
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,190
He needs to prioritize and focus. Min Hak and I feel the same, but...

397
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,020
But the kid's too nice to say anything harsh,

398
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,860
I'm telling you for him.

399
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,290
Right. Okay.

400
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,060
If you could just... amicably...

401
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,030
just wrap up with your team.

402
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,230
I'll ask Min Hak about it myself.

403
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,830
But if you do that, Min Hak will just...

404
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,040
"Don't worry. I'm fine. I'll keep doing it."

405
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,200
That's what he'll say.

406
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,640
He's like a brother, and too nice for his own good.

407
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,710
Look at last time with you...

408
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,440
and the Joker Dildo Incident, he offered to take the fall.

409
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,950
You're asking me to tell him to quit the Competition for you?

410
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,790
Wouldn't it be less awkward for us? Let's just call it being tactful.

411
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,630
Hello? Yes, no. It's fine.

412
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,569
Gosh, I told you to just wait a minute.

413
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,699
This summer, right here,

414
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,100
- how about a staycation? - How about a staycation?

415
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,940
- Hae Na, hand on Min Hak's waist. - Oh, my!

416
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,810
Goodness.

417
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,780
Seeing you two like this, you really look like you're in love.

418
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,210
Why is it so hot in here?

419
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,150
Cut! Who turned on that fan? Are you kidding? A fan during this?

420
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,290
- Yes, sir. - Isn't this how that laptop broke?

421
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Yes, I'll handle it.

422
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,660
- I said we were recording sound! - I'm sorry.

423
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,260
- Do you know how behind we are? - Sorry sir!

424
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,400
- Why do we keep making errors? - Let's be more careful, please.

425
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,670
- Let's focus... - Director.

426
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,370
I could put my arm on her shoulder. Or wrap my arm around like this?

427
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,400
Min Hak, you're so focused today. All right, go on, give it a try.

428
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,210
That's perfect.

429
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,950
Wow, you two look so good together. It's like you're a real couple.

430
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,120
- Director, come on. - What's the big deal?

431
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,120
All right, ready, and action!

432
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,820
Ten o'clock already.

433
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,460
This strand of hair on her cheek. Should I just move it back?

434
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,930
- Yes. - Okay.

435
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,330
That shot of Min Hak touching her looks good too.

436
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,140
Okay, let's get a take of this too.

437
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,170
Wow, Min Hak is so sweet.

438
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,840
Is something going on with you two? Why is this so natural?

439
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,910
There.

440
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,950
Should I go home?

441
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Manseon by the back gate is open. Free beer for its 10th anniversary.

442
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,959
Is this spam or what?

443
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,930
It's an emergency committee meeting.

444
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,700
Vice-Chair, you can't make it?

445
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,630
(Emergency Committee Chairman, Yoo Ri)

446
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,210
Hey, you'll never guess who I just ran into.

447
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,510
- Who'd you run into? - My ex from freshman year.

448
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,120
He was holding a girl's bag, waiting for her by the restroom.

449
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,690
He's probably preying on some clueless freshman again.

450
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,990
That used to be me.

451
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,530
Meeting you is what turned me into a lesbian.

452
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,800
So, did you say hi?

453
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,430
Say hi? Are you kidding? How could I?

454
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,870
But seriously, that guy's a total pervert.

455
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,610
That girl has no idea, does she? What?

456
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,980
- Great work, everyone. - Great work, everyone.

457
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,080
Don't you think we're less awkward than on "Rideshare Romance?"

458
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,950
What? I was comfortable last time too.

459
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,290
Whatever. You were totally shy back then.

460
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,160
He's ridiculous, right?

461
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,560
Hae Na, change into this for the interview.

462
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,030
- Okay. - Just a second.

463
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,970
San.

464
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,070
Have you been here this whole time?

465
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,070
You should've waited in the car.

466
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,240
I was...

467
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,580
Hey, Min Hak!

468
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,040
We need to film some separate Reels. Come this way.

469
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,380
- Right now? - Yes!

470
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,450
Okay.

471
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,220
Just a second.

472
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,720
There's nothing between us. We're just friends. Friends.

473
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,290
- Friends? But she came this far? - She's just here for a project.

474
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,500
Don't give me that. It's an excuse. It's obvious she's here to see you.

475
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,240
Be careful. If she were a celebrity, at least she would be discreet.

476
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,539
If a normal girl gets the wrong idea,

477
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,570
things get messy, fast.

478
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,240
I thought we agreed to be careful starting today.

479
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,910
Gosh, enough.

480
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,720
- You can't be here, ma'am. - Okay.

481
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,720
- I'll have to ask you to leave. - Nice guys aren't charming,

482
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,650
but don't you think Min Hak is so cute?

483
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,790
Hae Na, you jumped the gun on "Rideshare Romance" too,

484
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,360
and you ended up not getting picked.

485
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,400
But earlier, I kind of held his hand. And he didn't let go.

486
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,370
Judging by the way he kept fixing your hair,

487
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,840
- he's definitely interested. - Right? Should I DM him first?

488
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,310
- Or should I wait? - Tag him in a Story first.

489
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,980
What is this? Next thing you know, you'll be a real couple in a year.

490
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,610
Then what would they call us?

491
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,680
The Min Na Couple? The Hae Hak Couple?

492
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,350
- "Min Na" works. They shine. - Min Na?

493
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
Okay, okay.

494
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,900
Director, thanks for all your hard work.

495
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,730
Min Hak, great work today.

496
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,040
Was there something you wanted to say?

497
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,470
No. I just came to say great work. Thank you for everything today.

498
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,940
Great work.

499
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,850
The last bus is already gone. What did I get so wrong this time?

500
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,390
Joo Yeon San!

501
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,330
Joo Yeon San.

502
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
San.

503
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,800
Hey... You can't just leave without a word.

504
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,469
I feel like I shouldn't have come in the first place.

505
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,540
What?
