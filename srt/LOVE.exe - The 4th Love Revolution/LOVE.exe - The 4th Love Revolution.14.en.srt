(Special Lecture:
Deep Learning for a Big Tech Career)

8
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,650
After graduating from KAIST,

9
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,459
I joined a big tech company that
I'm sure you all know,

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,520
where I was a software engineer
for about two years.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,290
But I found a field in deep learning
I was passionate about researching.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,800
So the next semester,
I joined a research lab at CMU.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,170
It might sound impressive,
but it's really nothing special.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,610
- Any of you can do the same.
- I got to use the restroom.

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,620
It all started with games and apps
I made back in high school.

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,920
The little things, you know?

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,420
- That's when I got hooked on...
- I wonder what their story is.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,790
Is what ultimately led me
to deep learning.

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,129
Did you see Yeon San's look at him?

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,829
And the way he looks at her...

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,400
tells me there's totally
a story there.

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,630
So today, I'd like to talk about
the research I'm passionate about...

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,700
I heard they just went to
high school together.

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,440
That's just something people say.

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,240
It's sort of like when celebs say
they're just close friends...

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,180
or just know each other from school.

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,239
- Hello everyone.
- Right.

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,409
- Exactly.
- Welcome to deep learning.

29
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,080
Right. You were away,
so you might not know.

30
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,950
Get this, San asked me
to set her up with someone.

31
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,050
What is deep learning?

32
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,160
Really?

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,890
Don't you think this is,
like, a sign?

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,960
The day a man enters her life
is finally here.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,100
It's advantageous to learn.

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,970
We learn from experience.

37
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,230
- But...
- Yes?

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,840
So, what you're saying...

39
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,710
is someone like Park Chang Yi...

40
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,380
A real catch who's well-spoken,
smart, sharp, and good-looking.

41
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,080
Voice assistance like Siri...

42
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,050
- All right.
- ChatGPT.

43
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,320
Is a guy like that
really San's type?

44
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,050
- He's my type.
- What?

45
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,520
But I bet San would like him too.

46
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,990
I doubt it.

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,530
- You don't really know San.
- Exactly.

48
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,929
Hey, Na Rae, you...

49
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,700
said the same thing
when we first did our group project.

50
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,870
Right. I did, but...

51
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,040
Didn't you say you had plans?
So why are you at a CompSci lecture?

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,580
I just thought it might be
helpful for me too.

53
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,750
Knowledge is power, right?

54
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,950
I feel powerful.

calling to join us.

57
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,330

Anyway, it's such an honor

59
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,340
But didn't you say
you had something to do?

60
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,139
Shouldn't you get going?

61
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,940
- You said you pushed it back once.
- Oh...

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,140
I pushed it to tomorrow.

63
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,680
Besides, this is kind of
a team dinner,

64
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,180
so it wouldn't be right
if I skipped out.

65
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,120
This isn't a team dinner.

66
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,220
- What?
- I just came for the chicken.

67
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,720
I was just thirsty.

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,430
Whatever, I'm thirsty too.

69
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,030
Of course, I'm also here to find out
what the deal is with you two,

70
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,200
exchanging such soulful looks.

71
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,600
And maybe get a little dopamine rush
from the drama?

72
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,470
What are you talking about?
It's not like that.

73
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,510
So, Min Hak, is your major
in this field?

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,719
No, I'm in
the Department of Modeling.

75
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,049
- I see.
- Yes.

76
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,220
He's actually super famous.

77
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,420
Please...

78
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,860
Because of a ridiculous
department merger,

79
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,330
we all ended up on one team
for the competition.

80
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,300
You mean the Hangang University
President's Cup App Contest?

81
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,830
Yes.

82
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,230
So you're in it too.

83
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,710
Right. I was going to mention this
while we were all together,

84
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,940
but I can't be there
for the competition's final pitch.

85
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,380
What are you talking about?

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,410
The committee-school fight blew up.

87
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,320
You all saw the posts on Everytime.

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,390
"Why is the girl objecting to
the merger in a school contest?"

89
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,050
But still,

90
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,089
you can't just drop out like this.

91
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,890
No way. We're not letting you.

92
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,029
I'm not dropping out.

93
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,030
I'll just keep my name on the roster
for the rule.

94
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,700
I just need to avoid
being in the spotlight.

95
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
I don't know
your individual situations,

96
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,710
but if winning the prize money
is your main objective,

97
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,310
there are other ways to do business
without entering the competition.

98
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,679
The prize money might seem
like a lot to you,

99
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,150
but it's nothing to a large company.

100
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,150
If the idea has mass appeal,
it'll be an easy sell.

101
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,490
In that case, would you take a look
at our app, Split Alarm?

102
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,420
We're in the final stages
of development.

103
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,360
Did you guys talk
about this already?

104
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,270
I'd be honored.
But I'm supposed to be a judge.

105
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,600
Nothing's set, but if you're serious
about business, not competing,

106
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,770
then of course, I'll help.

107
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,110
I can even introduce you to people
in my network.

108
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,840
- Really?
- Of course. Anything for San.

109
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,550
Excuse me!

110
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,530
Can we get five more beers?

111
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,710
I don't remember asking you
for a favor...

112
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,310
We'd be incredibly grateful.

113
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,350
I can't believe we're treating you
to just chicken and beer on campus.

114
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,650
What are you talking about?
This is on me.

115
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,850
Just getting to see San again
is more than enough for me.

116
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,620
Gosh, excuse me!

117
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,060
Can we get some more chicken, too?

118
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,900
I'm just really hungry.

119
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,640
And of course,

120
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm paying for it.

121
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,639
Goodness.

122
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,850
Next time,
just press the call button.

123
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,950
Okay.

(Youth Pub)

125
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,920
Really? You two must be
so happy to see each other.

126
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,590
Wait a minute.
So you two went to school together?

127
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,700
San and I didn't actually
go to school at the same time.

128
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,460
I graduated early,
after my sophomore year.

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
KAIST. That figures.

130
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,670
When I returned for homecoming,
San was just a freshman.

131
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,400
So how did you two get close?

132
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,840
- At camp.
- At camp. Gosh.

133
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,380
It was just a regular science camp
run by the school.

134
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,739
That, and there was...

135
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,010
also a mentoring program
with alumni...

136
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,880
called
the Career Exploration Program.

137
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,420
And San was brilliant in it.

138
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,589
Remember how your team used...

139
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,250
Kinematic AI
for the Deep Learning project?

140
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,920
That was such a grind.

141
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,030
We had to take
a 500-megabyte raw data CSV file...

142
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,000
and manually sift through it all
to create the training data.

143
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,800
You were really incredible.

144
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,630
Wait, so are you two...

145
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,570
Are you sure you're okay with
not entering the competition?

146
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,770
Well, for me,

147
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,110
I'll be happy as long as
all your hard work pays off somehow.

148
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
Right.

149
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,579
- Split Alarm.
- What are you working on now?

150
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,980
Should we really consider
talking to him about it?

151
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,980
He seems like a good guy.

152
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,220
Then I guess it all worked out.

153
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,690
But it's because you were so sharp
that you finished in time.

154
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,689
If it hadn't been for you,
your team probably would've...

155
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,600
spent the entire camp
just clicking at their computers.

156
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,769
The one where instead
of image training,

157
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,030
we tracked
the movement of the boxes...

158
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,900
and trained that as
time-series data, right?

159
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,210
If I'd known what a beast
working with raw data was,

160
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,810
I would've picked a different topic.

161
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,040
What are they even talking about?

162
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,580
How would I know?
It's Science High School talk.

163
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,050
- Their past?
- No, Science High.

164
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,650
They are Science High prodigies.

165
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,220
This is the first time I've heard
San talk about that time.

166
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,990
She's practically glowing.

167
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,270
This is so inspiring.

168
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,210
I have a web novel idea I shelved
because I was totally stuck.

169
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,839
It’s about a senior and a junior
who happen to meet again...

170
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,150
by chance after graduation.

171
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,050
- You write web novels?
- Yes.

172
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,279
These guys are total techies,

173
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,420
but I only got into CompSci because
I heard getting a job was easy.

174
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,660
But that's ancient history now,

175
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,760
and besides,
it wasn't a good fit for me.

176
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,659
So I figured I might as well
use my CompSci background...

177
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,990
and try my hand at writing.

178
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,100
Do you happen to know
a company called Yes Lab?

179
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,630
Yes, they're a huge company,
famous for their webtoons.

180
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,230
I don't know much about web novels,

181
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,570
but I know the CEO of Yes Lab.

182
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,770
They're working on a new platform,

183
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,669
and they need writers for the app.

184
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,310
They're looking for new talent.

185
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,939
- Really?
- Yes.

186
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,480
Send me your story, and I'll see
if I can get it to the CEO.

187
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,650
To the CEO?

188
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,450
For real?

189
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,280
This is wild.
I'm so glad I made that connection.

190
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,719
- How did this fall in your lap?
- What do I do? Wait, which one...

191
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,889
- This one.
- This one?

192
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,390
- I think this one's best.
- What about this one?

193
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,790
No. This one.

194
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,490
Thanks for dinner.

195
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,030
Thank you for dinner.

196
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,230
I'll be in touch, everyone.

197
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,330
I have some friends drinking nearby,
so I'll take off first.

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,240
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

199
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,700
- Bye.
- See you later.

200
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,770
See you later.

201
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,980
- Then...
- San, where are you going?

202
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,610
I can give you a ride.
I have to call a driver anyway.

203
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,450
It's right nearby,
so I can just walk.

204
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,690
- Oh, well...
- Min Hak, which way are you headed?

205
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,360
I'm...

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,230
going that way...

207
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,460
My manager said
he was picking me up at the school.

208
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,160
Then walk with me.

209
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,670
It's faster this way.

210
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
- But...
- Yes?

211
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,440
I think I drank a little too much.

212
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,670
So I want to walk around a bit.
You know, walk it off.

213
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,210
Then I know the perfect place
for a walk.

214
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,910
This way. There's a park that won
a top landscape architecture prize.

215
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
It's huge.
It takes an hour to walk it all.

216
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,450
Really?

217
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,490
- Let's go!
- No, hold on.

218
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,090
Goodbye!
And thank you so much again.

219
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
See you at school.

220
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,430
Yes, okay.

221
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
- Let's go.
- Get home safe.

222
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,670
- Na Rae.
- Yes, let's go.

223
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,070
How'd you know about that award?

224
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,470
What? How could you not?

225
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,470
Now, where did I park?

226
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,480
No, it's fine.
I can just walk. It's really close.

227
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,610
Oh, then, let's walk for a bit.

228
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,580
It's been a while. We can catch up.

229
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,490
Min Hak, you're a really nice guy,
but you can't read a room, can you?

230
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
What?

231
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,060
I tried to leave Yeon San
and Chang Yi alone together,

232
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,630
and I kept sending you signals
to make yourself scarce.

233
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,170
Na Rae, I don't think
you're one to talk.

234
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
What's that supposed to mean?

235
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Never mind.

236
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,180
So, which way was that park again?

237
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,350
- That way.
- That way.

238
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,410
Let's get going.

239
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,850
So how'd you end up
at this university?

240
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,690
Pardon?

241
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,650
A full four-year scholarship?

242
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Yes.

243
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,959
Actually, this school's foundation
is on my mom's side.

244
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,130
That's why I gave the lecture, too.

245
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,030
My point is...

246
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,500
I know what Hangang University
is all about.

247
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,240
I'm not trying to put it down
or anything.

248
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,940
It's not the kind of school
you belong in.

249
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,740
It's not like it's very competitive
or has a great reputation,

250
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,350
and the location is kind of awkward.

251
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,350
I heard you quit Science High
your sophomore year without a word.

252
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,390
So I just figured
you had some other plan.

253
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,690
I'm sure you had your reasons,
though.

254
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,590
This is me.

255
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,700
What?

256
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,770
It's nearby.
I have to make a quick stop.

257
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,400
- It's late. I'll walk you home...
- I have to go.

258
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,310
San.

259
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,440
I've looked you up
from time to time.

260
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,850
I was curious how you were doing
and what you were up to.

261
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,380
We had some really good times,
you know?

262
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,050
Did we?

263
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,460
Did I do something to upset you?

264
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,460
No, nothing like that.

265
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,590
I should get going.

266
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,190
By making a compound
from the remaining element symbols?

267
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,760
Let's kill it! Are we ready?

268
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,200
Five, four, three, two, one!

269
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,170
Team Acetylene and Team Ozone,
you both are the winners!

270
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,680
- Can I get your phone?
- Sorry?

271
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,350
This is my phone number.

272
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,860
Text me when the camp's over.
Let's grab a bite to eat.

Hey.

276
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,880
Na Rae roped me into
an hour-long walk,

277
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,650
and thankfully,
it suddenly started to rain.

278
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,460
Come in.

281
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,210
I don't think I have anything
you can change into,

282
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,840
- At least dry your hair.
- Thanks.

283
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,420
Remember when
I didn't know what Python was...

284
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,180
and called it "Red Sun?"

285
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,450
And to be honest,
I still don't really get it.

286
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,960
What was Python again?

287
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,890
Was it you who explained it to me?

288
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm not sure.

289
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,570
I feel like I should know
for when we talk.

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,440
I doubt we'll ever need to
chit-chat about it.

291
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Still...

292
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,570
Tell me the simple version.

293
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,949
Well,

294
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,880
it's more concise and dynamic
than other languages,

295
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,820
and it's a programming language
that's easy to read.

296
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Is it easy to learn?

297
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,320
Concise doesn't necessarily
mean easy.

298
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,190
It's compatible with a lot
of different operating systems.

299
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,590
Even if they're different?

300
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Like us?

301
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,230
- That's not the right analogy.
- An extensive library...

302
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,069
Which is why it's highly scalable...

303
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,230
And intuitive...

304
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
What?

305
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,650
What, hold on.

306
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,120
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard
with everything lately?

307
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,720
You feel a little warm.

308
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm a little tired,
but my temperature's normal.

309
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,430
- Then why's your face so red?
- It's just my mood.

310
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,930
"My mood?"

311
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,440
Maybe I'm wrong. Hold on.

312
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
So?

313
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,700
Who is it?

314
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,940
Can I help you?

315
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,240
There's a water leak
in the apartment below us.

316
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,740
May I take a look at the bathroom?

317
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,940
Do you really need to check
right now?

318
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,649
Your downstairs neighbor
keeps calling me nonstop,

319
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,980
and frankly, I'm at my wits' end.

320
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,480
Please, just let us check.
It won't take long anyway.

321
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,250
You're older than me, right?

322
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Just a second.

323
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,730
Hey, do I know you from somewhere?

324
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,600
You look so familiar.

325
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,030
I don't think so.

326
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,610
Her name's hilarious, isn't it?
Ahn In Dae.

327
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,610
- He's mine!
- Kang Min Hak is mine!

328
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,179
Hangang University, right?

329
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,190
You're the girl
whose laptop Min Hak broke?

330
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,490
No way!

331
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,090
You live here?

332
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Hold on.

333
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,840
What's wrong?

334
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,240
What's the matter?

335
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,840
There's a water leak downstairs,
and you can't be here right now.

336
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,240
- There's someone at the door.
- At this hour?

337
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,379
Yes.

338
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,810
But if it's just the repairman...

339
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,850
shouldn't a strong guy like me
stick around to protect you?

340
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Go and have a look!

341
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,850
Gosh.

342
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,430
Ahn In Dae?

343
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,430
Just a minute!

344
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,610
- Hey, get under the sofa.
- Under the sofa...

345
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,510
- Hey, there's stuff under here.
- Right. Then, here.

346
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,950
San.

347
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,220
What if I just put on a hat
and a mask?

348
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,990
- No, that won't work.
- Why not? I just need to cover up.

349
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,690
No, with her, things are very likely
to go wrong.

350
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,360
The fridge? No, it's too cold.

351
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,160
- The balcony!
- The balcony.

352
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,940
Come on in.

353
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,240
I'll just check the bathroom.

354
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,150
If you go to Hangang University,

355
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,190
- what's your major?
- I'm CompSci.

356
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,490
- Then you must see Min Hak often!
- What?

357
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,230
Isn't he a model?

358
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,459
Right, exactly!

359
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,630
The Modeling
and CompSci departments...

360
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,169
were merged
into the Converged Physical...

361
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,900
Technology and Global Contents.

362
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,070
My gosh, she's a real fan.

363
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Do you see him often?

364
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,970
No, not that often.

365
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,380
That makes sense.
He's always so busy.

366
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,720
Do you have any classes
with Min Hak?

367
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,550
Yes, sometimes.

368
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,690
But since that friend
is in the Department of Modeling...

369
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,759
"Friend?" You're friends with him?

370
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,020
No! We're not close.

371
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,890
Too bad. I was just asking because
on Min Hak's Instagram,

372
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,000
I saw he does group projects
with people from school.

373
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,599
Really?

374
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,270
Maybe I should go to
Hangang University since it's close.

375
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,070
I'm so jealous of those people.

376
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,370
But then again,

377
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,140
I worry there are too many girls
around Min Hak.

378
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,980
It's bad for his image.

379
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,510
Wait, are you the building manager
or something?

380
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Please.

381
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
I'm the landlord's daughter.

382
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,990
- Did you tinker with the toilet?
- Yes.

383
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,960
My dad tinkered with it a little.

384
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,930
I see. I think that's the problem.
Let me check the balcony, too.

385
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,259
The balcony?

386
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,560
The balcony...

387
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,700
I'm not really sure if now is
a good time to check the balcony.

388
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,040
- I'll help clear it if it's a mess.
- No.

389
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,410
Just stay here for a second.

390
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,710
Sir, in the corner of the bathroom,

391
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,110
there's something you should see.

392
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,880
The daughter will take a look, too.

393
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,490
He's not my dad, though.

394
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,519
Doesn't that look really weird?

395
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,560
What part?

396
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,560
I think she means over there.

397
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,060
Go and hide!

398
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,500
- Get out quickly.
- Where?

399
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Right over there.

400
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Let me see.

401
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,340
Okay, so the valve is supposed to be
on this side.

402
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,050
I don't see anything
particularly wrong.

403
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,020
I wonder what she thinks is strange.

404
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,820
There's been a leak in the corner
ever since I moved in.

405
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,860
And I think we need to be clear
about who's responsible.

406
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,730
This isn't a leak.
It's just standing water.

407
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,100
I see. I guess I was mistaken.

408
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,970
Right?
So there's no real issue, sir?

409
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,370
Should we check the balcony?

410
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,610
This way.

Yeon San.

414
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,110
Let's make sure we end up
at the same school.

415
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,720
- Their past?
- No, Science High.

416
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,080
They are Science High prodigies.

417
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,950
This is the first time I've heard
San talk about that time.

(2021 Korea Science High School

419
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,790
I'll be back with some breakfast.

420
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
No way.

421
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,500
I heard there's this place
with a really good vibe.

422
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,200
I'll work around your schedule.

423
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
What?

424
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,640
Hey, Na Rae.

425
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,010
I'm free tomorrow.

426
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,750
No, that was my friend.

427
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,350
- Go on.
- I said I was free.

428
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,050
Hey, I'll call you back in a bit.

429
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,260
You're free?

430
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,720
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

431
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,630
Then go to that yakitori place
with me.

432
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,760
Why all of a sudden?

433
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,830
You wrote this, didn't you?

434
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Yes.

435
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,110
Wait, you didn't actually think
I just up and left you, did you?

436
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Na Rae is sleeping so soundly.

437
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,100
(I'll be back with some breakfast.)

438
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,250
Whatever. I'll chalk it up
to bad luck and just forget it.

439
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,810
It's not like he's so great.

440
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,250
I want to cry too.

441
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,450
I can't believe my first time
ended like this.

442
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,490
That jerk is the absolute worst.

443
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,890
The absolute worst.

444
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,830
How could you find a yakitori place
and invite someone else?

445
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,670
You didn't even get a meal with me
after we slept together.

446
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,640
I thought you didn't want
to get a meal with me.

447
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,640
I was racking my brain,
wondering what I did wrong.

448
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,650
- At 7pm.
- What?

449
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,450
So, let's go to
the yakitori tomorrow at 7pm.

450
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,550
Okay.

451
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,390
I'll come get you, despite you being
right across from me.

452
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,890
They're at it again.

453
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,800
Way to go! Bye, pal!

454
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,939
I saw on Instagram
that Min Hak's older brother...

455
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,240
liked omakase.

456
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,040
So, what about Min Hak?
What does he like?

457
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,880
Excuse me, I need to get this.

458
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,250
Hey, Dad.

459
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,660
For that, if you open
the back of the kiosk...

460
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,830
Yes, just press that button again.

461
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,630
I did that already.

462
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,400
Oh, there's another button here.

463
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,100
All right, let me see.

464
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,070
Okay, got it.
I'll call if I get stuck again.

465
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,650
Hey, it's okay.

466
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,390
- What?
- Sorry. I'm so tactless.

467
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,630
The people here aren't conservative,
you know.

468
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,930
I'm not sure what you mean.

469
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,869
You've got two phones,
men's shoes by the door,

470
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,030
and men's clothes lying around...

471
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,840
Those are my clothes.

472
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,840
Come on. I'm almost 20.
I know what's up.

473
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,940
No, really, it's just me here.

474
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,650
Excuse me. Could you go downstairs
and check how it is?

475
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,760
Min Hak, come on out.

476
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,230
Okay, come on out.

477
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,370
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

478
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,110
Are you okay?

479
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,910
Thanks for your hard work.

480
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,150
Bye.

481
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,580
Darn it.

482
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,390
- My phone...
- Right.

483
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,850
I'll call you.

484
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,990
- What?
- Right.

485
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,190
What is it?

486
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,360
- What?
- Just let me borrow this. Okay?

487
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
All right.

488
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,100
Goodness. Are you okay?

489
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,070
- I'll call you!
- Okay!

490
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,850
- Oh my. Hello.
- Oh gosh...

491
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,820
Are you all right?

492
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,290
Come out and see this!
Your boyfriend fell on the steps!

493
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,270
Did you really fall?

494
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,070
Oh, gosh...

495
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,940
I'm fine. That was a close one.

496
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,279
I know. We have to be more careful.

497
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,440
Tell me about it.

498
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,150
Since I'll be coming over often,
right?

499
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,250
That's not what I meant.

500
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,050
By the way, I saw something
while I was in the closet.

501
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,660
What?

502
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,260
The magazine you were
the cover model for.

503
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,960
I studied with this one too,
you know.

504
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,530
- Let me have this.
- I should've burned them.

505
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,770
Why? That'd be a waste.
Let me have it.

506
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,100
Why would I give this to you?
I can't exactly burn you instead.

507
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,110
All right! Goodness.

508
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,110
- Cute, right?
- Why you...

509
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,110
Give it to me.

510
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,280
What's with you?

511
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,800
(Hangang University)

512
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,150
Hey, I actually landed a meeting
with the rep from Yes Lab.

513
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,650
- Through Chang Yi?
- Yes. Amazing, right?

514
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,760
- Did you look them up online?
- What?

515
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,160
To see if the company is legit
and if he actually works there.

516
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,630
What's that supposed to mean?
You doubt my writing is good enough?

517
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,370
No, that's not it.

518
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,699
You were almost scammed by that AI.

519
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,900
That's why she's worried, right?

520
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,509
- Still, it's better to be sure.
- Chang Yi introduced me.

521
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,610
What's there to worry about?

522
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,550
What do they even know
about Park Chang Yi?

523
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,680
Hey, did Chang Yi ever get in touch
with you about Split Alarm?

524
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,020
What? About what?

525
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,690
We talked about turning Split Alarm
into a business.

526
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,760
Yes.
I thought it was a good idea, too.

527
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,390
And we're not guaranteed to win
first place in the competition.

528
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,370
I did hear from him.

529
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,770
But before we prepare
for the competition,

530
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,240
if a rumor gets out that we sold
our project with an insider's help,

531
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,380
it would be bad for either of us,
so he said to talk later.

532
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,480
Let's just handle it ourselves.

533
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
Really?

534
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,250
That's a shame.

535
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,250
Hey, forget it.
All we have to do is win.

536
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,560
What are you up to
after class today?

537
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,540
(Min Hak: What are you up to
after class today?)

538
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,770
I need data for Split Alarm,

539
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,610
- so I'm meeting a senior I know...
- Joo Yeon San.
