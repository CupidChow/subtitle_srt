00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,970
To think I woke up on time even after that whole ordeal...

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,670
means any drama with a guy doesn't affect me anymore.

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,110
After going through enough trial and error,

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,680
I have a simple, efficient system for any romantic entanglements.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,620
All these past embarrassments are now just useful data.

I'm surprised they have an automated motel out here.

Hey, that's Kang Min Hak.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,220
He's a really nice guy.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Gosh, darn it!

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,290
- Maybe it's not automated. - Should we go somewhere else?

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,559
I'll get out of your way.

23

- Oh, we can just go. - Just a minute!

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,760
Just because it's an automated motel doesn't mean no one's here.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,200
What if a toilet gets clogged? I have to be here to unclog it.

27
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,070
And guests at your age go through 4 or 5 condoms a night, you know?

28

We're on call for things like that, watching you on the cameras.

30
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,939
- Cameras? - What?

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,940
- Let's go. - Let's go.

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,710
Hold on. Wait a second!

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,480
Good grief, what are you saying?

34
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,550
No, not hidden cameras. He means the ones here in the lobby.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,219
Gosh, we'd never use hidden cameras.

36
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,360
I have a kid your age.

37
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,530
We're actually the cleanest motel in the area.

38
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,130
- We're even Clean Tag certified. - We did.

39
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,560
I bet we're the only place around that disinfects it all with alcohol.

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,670
This is creepy.

41
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,130
Creepy? What's so creepy about it?

42
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,099
The security camera is over there.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,139
See? Right there.

44
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,439

They looked to be San's age.

49
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,619
I wonder if our daughter will start using automated motels.

50
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,189
Why would a motel owner's daughter do that?

51
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,060
She even went to high school with a dormitory to escape motels.

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,330
Maybe we should get a kiosk.

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,059
They say it does one person's job.

54
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,630
Where would we get the money?

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,830
They're three thousand dollars, even used!

56
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,700
We spent all our extra cash getting a top ad spot on this booking app.

57
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,410
The model on our booking app has a lovely smile, don't you think?

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,440
I like him smiling.

59
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,250
What's so great about it?

60
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,550

65

Same here. This is the most exciting project!

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,230
So what made you change your mind?

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,130
Was it really because San asked you to join?

68
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,570
Well...

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,810
Ji No was a bit much for me.

70
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,380
He was live-posting how many times I used the bathroom on social media.

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,110
And...

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,950
- a teammate confessed she liked me. - A teammate? Who?

73
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,320
Them two? The ex-Treasurer's girlfriend?

74
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,660
So you made a couple break up.

75
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,730
They started fighting and crying, and it was awkward in the middle.

76
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,170
Anyway, the whole thing was a mess.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,170
But you all seemed completely uninterested in me.

78
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,400
- What? - Like, whether I'm handsome or not,

79
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,910
popular or not,

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,839
none of that seemed to matter.

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,180
You seemed to only want to focus on the work.

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,050
Anyway, I'm a lot more comfortable with you guys.

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,149
If so, you made a great choice.

84
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,619
- Right, Na Rae? - Sure.

85
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,319
No one's going to confess to Min Hak...

86
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,960
and make things hard for him, right?

87
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,090
- Not me, at least. - Never?

88
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,100
I wouldn't say never.

89
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,660
- What? - What?

90
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,940
Maybe three percent?

91
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,400
What?

92
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,209
That's the probability of one of us...

93
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,940
falling for you, Kang Min Hak.

94
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,010
- That's what my stats say. - Three percent?

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,349
Is that high?

96
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,880
Wait, what data are you using?

97
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,920
If the Apocalypse hits, you must help preserve the species.

98
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,490
Are you working on the premise of human extinction or something?

99
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,030
I'm surprised you feel responsible for future generations, San.

100
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,270
So when it's not the end of the world,

101
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,370
would I have zero chance of being a couple with Min Hak?

102
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,640
Wait, can you guys just do that math in your head on the fly?

103
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,040
You guys are really something else.

104
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,310
I know I'm not quite on your level,

105
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,050
but I promise I'll do my absolute best.

106
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,150
Let's do this!

107
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,690
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

108
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,360
He just drew a line, right? "Don't you dare fall for me."

109
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,530
Yes.

110
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,800
Kang Min Hak's a real pro. Doesn't he know that's attractive?

111
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,800
- Lucky! - Nice.

112
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,400
Lucky.

113
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,600
- Hello? - Joo Yeon San, where are you now?

114
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,540
- At school. - What floor are we on?

115
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,810
- Why? What's up? - First floor?

116
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,880
- Dad has a quick trip to Seoul. - For example,

117
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,849
- I told you about this before. - when you’re told not to think...

118
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,850
- about an elephant, - Remember?

119
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:43,310
- that’s all you can think about. - Hello?

120
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Did the call drop?

121
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,820
Conversely, what if Min Hak says, "I hope you fall for me?"

122
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,990
She'd probably just go, "Okay, I will."

123
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,530
Na Rae, we need to get paid.

124
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,960
Let's not scare Kang Min Hak off, all right?

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,170
I should add Min Hak to our group chat, right?

126
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,239
- Min Hak, welcome to the team. - Howdy.

127
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,509
Howdy to you too.

128
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,510
I have a group meeting in 2 days at 3.

129
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,180
What?

130
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,179
Hey, I told you to just freeload.

131
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,420
Why waste gas money coming here?

132
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,589
What if they only want to hit on you?

133
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,890
Be careful.

134
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,420
No way. With them, there's absolutely no...

135
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,230
Well, I wouldn't say never.

136
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,430
The probability is just extremely low.

137
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,560
Maybe a three percent chance?

138
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,130
That's according to my data.

139
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,040
Three percent? Get real.

140
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,269
We don't have time for that.

141
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,739
There was an article saying...

142
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,370
Jinny's soju commercial contract was up.

143
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,610
Apparently, Amy is the next model. That's how this industry is.

144
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,650
One is pushed out, another comes in. Min Hak, you must be the next one.

145
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,020
- Wait, this is 60 dollars? - Yes.

146
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,149
The department jacket is 60 dollars?

147
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,290
They should be cheap to wear out.

148
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,660
Lots of pockets, comfy as a pillow, and stain-resistant. That’s all.

149
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,990
Right, because CompSci's design was a pillow with a fishing vest.

150
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,100
That was a great idea for storing your essentials in separate pockets.

151
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,030
Except that option got almost no votes.

152
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,270
That includes the logo design fee, and the Tatami embroidery is pricey.

153
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,210
But it's black-on-black embroidery. You can't even see it.

154
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,179
No one will see this as a department jacket.

155
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,740
That's the whole point.

156
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,350
If we don't hit the minimum order, the price goes up even more.

157
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,150
Come on. You think we won't?

158
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,950
Hey, everyone, wait up! Come here and try this on.

159
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Is that the jacket?

160
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,360
- Hold on. - Is that the jacket?

161
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,560
- Hold on. - This is way too big.

162
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,669
Hold on. Hey, stop pushing.

163
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,930
Excuse me! I need to get out.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,470
Excuse me! We're packed in too tight.

165
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,140
One idea from each of you by the day after tomorrow.

166
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,640
(One idea from each of you by the day after tomorrow)

167
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,380
Of course, this isn't a competition for the best proposal or anything.

168
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,810
Got it!

169
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,150
(Kang Min Hak: Got it!)

170
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,420
- You're here. - Goodness!

171
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,920
Dad!

172
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Some dried anchovies and shredded squid.

173
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,960
And this is seasoned deodeok root, your favourite.

174
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,460
I didn't know you were coming.

175
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,060
Would tomorrow be any different?

176
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,869
And a hydrating, nourishing ampoule.

177
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,100
Kills two birds with one stone.

178
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,000
Mom sent this for your dry skin.

179
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,240
Here, use it.

180
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,880
Hey, what's this?

181
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,009
This is a classic from my day.

182
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,410
Is this the Gen Z vibe now?

183
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,349
Gosh, do you even cook for yourself?

184
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,480
What's all this? Clean this up.

185
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,190
You just let it pile up. When is recycling day?

186
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,390
Don't throw that away. I'm saving it to sell.

187
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,960
I get more money for a full box.

188
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,530
Gosh, the dildo!

189
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,000
Dad! I'll clean this up.

190
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,759
- No, I'll do it. - Really, I've got it.

191
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,800
Since I'm here, I'll just clean the whole place.

192
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, actually,

193
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,240
the caulking under the toilet needs to be redone.

194
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,340
- The caulking? - Yes.

195
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,470
I'll work on it after this.

196
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,410
- No, don't. - Why are you pushing me?

197
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,710
- Please go check on it now. - Why are you pushing me?

198
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,520
It looks perfectly fine to me.

199
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,250
It doesn't even wobble when I sit on it.

200
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,860
There's nothing wrong with it.

201
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,030
No, it's a huge problem.

202
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,330
Did you actually sit down?

203
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm telling you, it rattles and shakes when you sit down.

204
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,770
- Really? - Just caulk it anyway.

205
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,840
The real problem is the mold.

206
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,670
Are you cleaning out the cabinets now?

207
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,080
Leave it. I'll take care of all that for you tomorrow.

208
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,180
No, it's okay. You don't have to do this part.

209
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,180
There's some personal girl stuff in there.

210
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,979
- Is that right? - Yes.

211
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,020
So you keep that kind of stuff in the kitchen?

212
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,150
So, Dad, why did you say you were in town again?

213
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,460
Oh, right. I have a wedding to go to this weekend.

214
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,390
So you're staying here until then?

215
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,400
Yes. It's not for business.

216
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,700
I wanted a change of scenery and to meet up with some friends.

217
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,670
I don't need you to co-sign anything!

218
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
All right.

219
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,810
Then I'll just stay out of your hair.

220
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,840
But just this one thing.

221
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,210
Why is he popping up there?

222
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,010
This model guy.

223
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,980
Doesn't he go to your school?

224
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,680
Could you get me his autograph?

225
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
You're not asking me to get it, are you?

226
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,319
Yes, and tell him I'm a huge fan.

227
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,719
When I'm down, seeing him smile...

228
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,659
just makes me smile too.

229
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,530
And tell him to keep looking good.

230
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,060
What are you even talking about?

231
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,860
Why not? If our motel has a star's autograph,

232
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,199
think how great that would be.

233
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
It builds credibility.

234
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,740
Here.

235
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,810
(Number one in Customer Satisfaction)

236
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,140
(Today, right now...)

237

(penguintan0129)

238
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,050
Should I follow him first?

239
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,750
(penguintan0129 started following you)

240
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,589
Na Rae, are you home?

241
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,650
(Gil Tan: Na Rae, are you home?)

242
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,860
Yes. What's up?

243
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,990
Perfect. I just need a roll of toilet paper.

244
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,630
I'll give you two back tomorrow.

245
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,360
Just toss it out the window.

246
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
What the?

247
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,770
Okay.

248
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
Catch.

249
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,560
Throw it.

250
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
Thank you.

251
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,890
Seriously? He followed me just to ask for toilet paper?

252
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,110
(SUPER LIKE! Swipe to find out who)

253
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,380
(Memory Motel)

254
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,960
Did Dad go out?

255
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
(Hangang University)

256
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,840
We're set for the hotel staycation vlog tomorrow.

257
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,510
- Where? - Right across the street.

258
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,210
Don't tell me it's one of those motels over there.

259
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,880
It's a franchise,

260
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,480
and I didn't see the point in going far to film.

261
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,490
I asked the branch near the school to make it easy for you.

262
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,119
I don't mind travelling.

263
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,790
I do. It's a pain for me.

264
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
You can just walk there and back.

265
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,100
I'm kidding. They remodelled anyway, so it looks good.

266
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,940
Where could Dad have gone so early?

267
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,710
Is that Kang Min Hak?

268
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,940
What was that? Did I just wave at Kang Min Hak?

269
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,150
- It was the client's request. - Let me out here.

270
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Why? What's wrong?

271
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,690
Why? Hey...

272
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,450
See you later.

273
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,790
What's going on?

274
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,160
Close the door!

275
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,430
San! Joo Yeon San!

276
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,340
- Hi. - Hi.

277
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,440
How did you know it was me?

278
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,110
It's hard to see inside.

279
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,670
I'd know that mint car anywhere.

280
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,340
I have a favour to ask. It's fine if you won't do it.

281
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
From me?

282
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,850
- Right. - What is it?

283
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,820
Well, my dad runs a motel.

284
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,220
And it turns out you're the model for the booking app he uses.

285
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,260
He's a big fan and asked if I could get your autograph.

286
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
An autograph?

287
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,530
This brings back memories of when we first met.

288
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,170
- If you're making a dumb joke... - What's his name?

289
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,130
- Sorry? - Your father's name.

290
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Right.

291
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,140
Joo Jong Hwan.

292
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,370
- Jong Hwan? - Yes.

293
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,710
- San. - Yes?

294
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,320
Can you turn around for a second?

295
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,879
- I need to use your back. - My back?

296
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,180
- Just for this. Yes. - Okay.

297
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Hold on.

298
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,600
(Right Here)

299
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,430
By the way,

300
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,040
did you come all the way to campus just for this?

301
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,870
Of course not. I had no idea when you'd be here.

302
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,440
Right.

303
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,180
There we go.

304
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,020
Thanks. I didn't misspell it this time.

305
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,920
Right, though that wasn't why you misspelled it last time.

306
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Hey, you.

307
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,290
Is this how you act in meetings, too?

308
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,890
Hey.

309
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,260
You can't keep coming on to him.

310
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,770
Don't misuse his kindness.

311
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,270
I wanted to do it, so I asked her for it.

312
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,370
How is this crossing a line? This is just being nice to a fan.

313
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,980
- You waste time on useless stuff... - If it wasn't for my dad...

314
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,109
You grant every trivial favour asked.

315
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,410
Do you know how frustrating that is?

316
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,050
That's right. My dad's a lot, so I asked a favour.

317
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,050
I won't bother you again, so you should watch your words too.

318
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,420
So I don't waste more of your time, I'll be on my way.

319
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,590
Hey...

320
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,430
Why didn't you just keep driving if you were just going to clam up?

321
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,670
Come on.

322
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,770
She's really something else.

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,270
(To Joo Jong Hwan, Thank you, Kang Min Hak)

324
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,140
At least this will keep Dad off my back.

325
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,680
Okay, I'm leaving. Right away.

326
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,180
What?

327
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Oh, dear.

328
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,800
- What's going on? - You can just take that one, then.

329
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,130
- Does this one go there? - Yes.

330
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Okay. Perfect.

331
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,340
You've gone to so much trouble for me today.

332
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,480
Why is Dad at a motel with another woman?

333
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,750
Of all potential family problems, an affair was...

334
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,780
something I thought had less than a three percent chance of happening.

335
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,820
You said it was a little loose, so I fixed it.

336
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,790
I'm almost done.

337
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,930
Just be careful not to get it wet for about three days.

338
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,260
So, where were you today?

339
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,630
Me? I went to Seoul to meet up with a friend.

340
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,270
Since the crack of dawn?

341
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,340
Getting older makes time precious.

342
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,220
I'm just going to step out for a bit.

343
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,690
Where'd my socks go?

344
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,430
Am I jumping to conclusions? Or am I just slow to see the truth?

345
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,660
Something feels off.

346
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,370
- "Want to meet up later?" - Hey, why are you reading that?

347
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,799
Your Tinder match? Hey, let me see his picture.

348
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,440
Let's see if he's a good one this time.

349
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:18,580
"This time?" I've barely used it. You're being so extra.

350
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,550
- You said he was a hot guy. - When did I say "hot guy?"

351
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,820
I was just doing market research, checking out the dating app scene.

352
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,820
How can you trust someone enough to meet them from an app?

353
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,850
Seriously? We're developing an app right now.

354
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,020
Let's not hate on apps.

355
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,960
If there are problems with these kinds of apps,

356
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,590
we need to think about what solutions we can provide.

357
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,690
Minimize the risks,

358
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,030
and have an eye for enhancing the positive functions and benefits.

359
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,229
Having an eye for those things...

360
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,600
is how you come up with good ideas.

361
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,570
So, did you come up with a good idea?

362
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,740
Of course I did.

363
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,840
I've been thinking,

364
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,140
since it's people our age voting on this anyway,

365
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,180
we definitely have to do something related to dating.

366
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,339
"Does he like me?"

367
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,550
"Or who does she like?"

368
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,679
"Who gives me the biggest hit of dopamine?"

369
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,580
That's all that matters for those in their 20s.

370
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,050
Not for me.

371
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,630
Sure, some people are like you, but we want mass appeal, right?

372
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,299
Why else would a show set in some shabby-looking guesthouse...

373
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,860
with a regular guys and girls, like on "I Am Solo,"

374
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,530
be more popular than a huge drama with A-list stars?

375
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,770
So you're saying we should launch something kind of like Tinder?

376
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,240
No way. We have to approach it differently.

377
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,680
Something cute that only we can pull off.

378
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,920
For example, an alarm that goes off if someone you like is within 10m,

379
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,820
something like the "Love Alarm."

380
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,620
The fact that it's been adapted into a webtoon and a drama...

381
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,290
shows what the public desires.

382
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,330
But is it even possible to actually make that?

383
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,530
It's appeared on TV shows, but commercializing it will be hard.

384
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,230
Even if it's not the "Love Alarm,"

385
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,500
we can make an app to help with love.

386
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,710
Recommending nice places for anniversaries,

387
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,380
showing available discounts, and suggesting places like hotels.

388
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,910
How often do students really go to hotels?

389
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,850
Maybe not hotels, but trust me, they go to motels all the time.

390
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,390
For example, going on a hotel staycation with friends?

391
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,390
Should we do that sometime?

392
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,190
Right. A "Right Here" hotel opened up front.

393
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,930
The hotel that opened up out front?

394
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,730
Where? In the middle of all these motels?

395
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,670
Yes. I'm here to film a vlog today.

396
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,970
I heard it was newly renovated.

397
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,540
Should I send some gift certificates for the chain?

398
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,910
Gift certificates? Yes, please.

399
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,840
It's just that I'm an ambassador for this app.

400
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,280
Please. They just renovated a motel and slapped "hotel" on the sign.

401
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,080
Seriously? Right in front of the ambassador?

402
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,120
That word always cracks me up.

403
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,050
Why does everyone call commercial models...

404
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,150
"ambassadors" these days?

405
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,359
Hey, there must be some difference.

406
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,389
Anyway, that's great, Min Hak.

407
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,760
Let us know how it is once you've been.

408
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,190
I don't get why people go to motels when they have their own homes.

409
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,830
A house isn't always the most private place.

410
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,770
Motels are so bad for the environment.

411
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,140
What's with the friendly fire? Your family runs a motel, you know.

412
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,610
That's how I know.

413
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,740
The amount of disposables is insane.

414
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,210
Toothbrushes, toothpaste, cotton swabs,

415
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
and even used condoms.

416
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,209
You know what the trash looks like?

417
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,780
It's like the building took a dump.

418
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,850
Not to mention...

419
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,830
They're also breeding grounds for affairs.

420
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,400
Yeon San.

421
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,169
Why would you call your family's business a dump?

422
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,270
Right.

423
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,139
San, I get your concern,

424
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,010
but motels partnered with "Right Here..."

425
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,910
are supposedly run in a very eco-friendly way.

426
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,380
They use bamboo toothbrushes,

427
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,380
and you can even opt out of receiving amenities.

428
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,450
I wasn't talking about you.

429
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,090
I know. But still, I'm their ambassador.

430
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,920
The "ambassador."

431
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,790
You know I care for the environment.

432
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,490
So when I sign an endorsement deal,

433
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,460
I always make sure the company is eco-friendly.

434
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,200
And I recently...

435
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,170
became a golf course ambassador.

436
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,569
- A golf course? - And they're even partnered...

437
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,170
with a recycled apparel company.

438
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,480
How is a golf course eco-friendly?

439
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,810
San, you've never been to one, have you?

440
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,720
They're incredibly eco-friendly.

441
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,190
- Okay, let's get back on topic. - Right.

442
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,519
Especially the golf club I promote, the "Stay Green Golf Course,"

443
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,290
has such beautiful natural surroundings.

444
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,889
Birds are chirping all over,

445
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,790
and you can see fish swimming in the lake.

446
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,900
I'll give you some guest passes, so you should come sometime...

447
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,600
They build golf courses by literally carving up mountains.

448
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,830
Carving up mountains?

449
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,470
But there are tons of trees there.

450
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,170
The trees were moved from elsewhere, and the fish were just put there.

451
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,150
The grass is perfectly manicured. It's so lush and green.

452
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,909
Do you know how much pesticide they use to keep that grass green?

453
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,250
What about the major water shortages that municipalities face every year?

454
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,050
And yet they waste tons of water on golf courses to keep them green?

455
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,120
What does that have to do with anything?

456
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,860
He can learn now. He's all heart, not brains. Right?

457
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,060
"Not brains?"

458
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,530
- "Brains." - Kang Min Hak,

459
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,130
I see environment care is...

460
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,800
- just an accessory for you. - An accessory?

461
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,540
Why would you call it an accessory?

462
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,570
I'm being serious.

463
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Okay.

464
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,210
If you're being genuine,

465
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,910
then you're a perfect case study...

466
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,520
of how people unintentionally ruin the world.

467
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,490
So you're saying I'm destroying the world?

468
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,590
When you're that ignorant, instead of trying to be responsible,

469
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,489
it's better to just stay quiet.

470
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,929
Especially for someone like you, who clearly influences others,

471
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,230
being ignorant is being irresponsible!

472
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
San.

473
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Hey!

474
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,820
(I'm an alum. Can I still buy a department jacket?)

475
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
(Dong Won, I'm one of Jae Seon's seniors.)

476
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,490
(I heard the department jackets are sold out.)

477
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,950
Dong Won, planning another round of department jacket orders?

478
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,430
(Department Jacket World)

479
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,260
What is going on?

480
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,400
Hey, Hold on!

481
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,100
I keep getting calls for department jackets,

482
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,940
even from the alumni.

483
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,210
Look at this.

484
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,110
We got so many requests to buy one, so we made an Outsider Edition.

485
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,150
Just from this morning's pre-orders, we've already sold over 300.

486
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,790
What? Who'd buy other school's jacket?

487
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,860
- We just passed 400. - What?

488
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,889
The Outsider Edition is profitable.

489
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,090
I marked up the price a little.

490
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,800
- Which means... - We've hit the jackpot.

491
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,910
We got that sponsored skincare, so put some on after you wash up.

492
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,679
It has the eco ingredients you like.

493
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,349
So give it a shout-out on camera.

494
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,419
(Eco-friendly golf course)

495
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,650
This is just a simple product placement.

496
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,650
Hey, are you even listening to me?

497
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,820
This is a field I might know more about than you.

498
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,830
Skincare?

499
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,830
Right. Of course you'd know more.

500
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,940
But still, for the business side, you promised you'd trust me on this.

501
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,839
I just went with a brand that was easy to negotiate with.

502

(Eco-friendly golf course)

503
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,340
Not much is coming up on Naver.

504
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,940
Okay, I'll get your opinion first from now on.

505
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,150
Golf course.

506
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,580

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,820
- A golf course? - Eco...

511
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,960
So you're itching to get out on the green?

512
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,460
Okay, I'll book a tee time right now.

513
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,660
(So you're itching to get out...)

514
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,470
But for today's vlog, at least, we must plug this Schwanengarten.

515
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,540
Hey!

516
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,010
Sorry, just be quiet for a minute.

517
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,870
Please.

518
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,940
(But for today's vlog, at least, we must plug this Schwanengarten.)

519
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,950
The search isn't working.

520
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,160
Eco-friendly golf course.

521
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,700
I got way too worked up because of my dad.

522
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,600
I ended up projecting my issues onto an innocent Kang Min Hak.

523
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,510
I need to reflect on how I was being logical, yet illogical.

524
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,850
Same thing here.

525
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,180
Ignoring a problem you know exists only makes it worse.

526
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,790
Instead of nectar from flowers, bees are intoxicated by pesticides.

527
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,160
They were wiped out in massive numbers.

528
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,130
The cause is a neighbouring golf course.

529
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,160
They had drenched the greens in pesticides the day before.

530
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,660
Mother bees, father bees, baby bees...

531
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,440
So she was right all along.

532
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,810
She was right about everything.

533
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,610
There's no such thing as an "eco-friendly" golf course.

534
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,050
I'm so sorry, little bees.

535
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,390
And the rabbits,

536
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,460
the deer too.

537
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,430
I'm sorry to all of you.

538
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,630
For a stupid ball game, I...

539
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,570
No, not me, but...

540
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,710
We destroyed all your homes.

541
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,940
We humans are sorry.

542
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,650
Mom.

543
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,120
Mom.

544
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,320
(Ward A)

545
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,290
Thank you for always calling me Mom so freely.

546
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,760
But you are my mom.

547
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,160
No matter what, you'll always be my mom.

548
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,199
Min Hak, you take after your father.

549
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,700
With that handsome face of yours,

550
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,740
it'll be very easy for you to win people's hearts.

551
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,770
But what's important...

552
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,510
isn't that brief moment when you win someone's heart,

553
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,450
it's holding onto that heart responsibly for the long haul.

554
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,350
When you make a mistake or do something wrong,

555
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,280
you have to own up to it and apologise right away.

556
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,190
That's what a good person does.

557
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,560
Your father and I couldn't do that,

558
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,130
but you should be a good person, Min Hak.

559
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,200
Make sure you listen to your grandfather, okay?

560
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,270
Ma'am, when you go to Australia, be wary of the Korean community.

561
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,870
The people who prey on Koreans overseas the most...

562
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,470
are other Koreans.

563
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,310
All right. Thank you for looking out for me.

564
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,840
Take care, Jae Hak.

565
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,010
(Ward A)

566
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,650
Mom. Don't go.

567
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,850
Mom.

568
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,220
This is all because your father lived like a playboy.

569
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,319
I should know.

570
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,330
I once lived off these dashing good looks myself.

571
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,660
But it's just a fleeting shortcut to total ruin.

572
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,300
It takes more than a pretty face to be a real man.

573
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,140
Min Hak.

574
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,940
Mark my words.

575
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,009
You heard what that woman said?

576
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,080
Just because the ladies like you, don't let it go to your head...

577
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,110
and blame the world for everything.

578
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,220
If you keep blaming everyone else, you'll end up just like your father.

579
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,890
A pretty flower that's quick to wilt.

580
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,690
A playboy.

581
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,390
That's exactly who I was.

582
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,130
Irresponsible,

583
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,600
a pretty boy who was nothing more than a flower.

584
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,030
Just like an eco-friendly golf course.

585
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,960
They say, "The first flower to bloom is the first to wilt."

586
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,130
Because of global warming, cherry blossoms are blooming early.

587
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,660
Maybe my hair loss, too.

588
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,670
Schwanengarten sent me some of their cosmetics to try,

589
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,940
so I've been using them, and I absolutely love them.

590
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,840
(So handsome in the ad! Going to watch it again)

591
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,640
I think this is going to be my new go-to.

592
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,810
(Your skin is perfect.)

593
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,380
I love that it keeps my skin hydrated all day long,

594
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,990
and everything from the ingredients to the packaging is eco-friendly.

595
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,090
(That face is magic. Did Hogwarts send an owl?)

596
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,720
(Seriously, don't you dare work out. You're already too perfect.)

597
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,260
(Is something wrong? Your expression suddenly changed.)

598
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,560
(You seem down today. Are you okay?)

599
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,960
(You're not sick, are you? I'm worried)

600
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,160
(What's wrong?)

601
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,760
(I'm worried. You don't seem like yourself.)

602
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,400
(I missed the start of the stream. Did something happen?)

603
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,070
(Just got here. What's with the vibe?)

604
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,670
(Who gets depressed while putting on lotion?)

605
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,140
Eco-friendly...

606
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,740
(Safety first)

607
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,270
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

608
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,510
(No.1 Soju, made with spring water)

609
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,440
Jinny.

610
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,120
When will I finally be a responsible adult?

611
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,050
Someone who pulls their own weight?

612
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,389
Man, I'm so horny today.

613
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,419
- Let's go. - I really need to get laid.

614
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,160
- Let's do it. I'll make a call. - I want to do it.

615
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,360
- No way. - Seriously.

616
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,990
Look, Jinny's passed out.

617
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,900
I should help our girl Jinny up.

618
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,999
Hey, knock her over, you idiot.

619
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,899
When else do we get her on her back?

620
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,940
Hey.

621
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,270
Who says you have to do it lying down, you punk?

622
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,210
- You can do it standing up too. - This punk's an animal when drunk.

623
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,679
That fool.

624
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,180
- Hey, stop it. - Why can't anyone just grow up?

625
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,680
- Stop it, that's disgusting. - Dude, you're going too far.

626
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,720
Hey, people are watching! I said stop!

627
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,490
- Hey, you're acting crazy. - Here, let me try.

628
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,890
Stop it, there are people around.

629
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,460
- Just stop it! - Hey!

630
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,910
What do you want?

631
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,410
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

632
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,780
Darn it.

633
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Come on.

634
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,220
- What the... - Is that guy a pervert or what?

635
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,590
- Sir, that guy took it! - That pervert, that's him!

636
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,330
- Get him! He's a pervert. - Stop, thief!

637
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,730
I should just get out of here.

638
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,300
I need to pull my own weight.

639
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,170
I will pull my weight right now.

640
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,470
It's time to be an adult.

641
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,050
I'm so sorry.

642
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,710
Kang Min Hak?

643
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,820
San? What are you doing here?

644
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,120
Miss! Stop that guy. He's a pervert!

645
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,280
- What's going on? - Get back here, you pervert!
