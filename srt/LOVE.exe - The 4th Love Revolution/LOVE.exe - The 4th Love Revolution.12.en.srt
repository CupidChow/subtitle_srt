He gets caught in a NASA conspiracy and sent to space, then abducted.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,290
While they run their experiments, he finds out he's a vampire.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,270
So the twist is, the aliens are actually us humans.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,670
And through this ironic journey, he finds his true identity.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,770
Director, it sounds really exciting already.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,210
So, is this Min Hak's first role?

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,049
He was in a promotional web drama...

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,180
for the Culture and Tourism Ministry.

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,650
It was about a tiger at Gwanghwamun, and gatekeepers tried to catch it.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,890
So he played one of the gatekeepers?

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,050
No, I was the...

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,090
thing the tiger was eating before it ran away.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,990
The Mugwort Spirit from "Garlic and Mugwort."

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,630
We'll have Min Hak fully prepared by the time you're back in Korea.

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,270
Mugwort. Right. Mugwort's good.

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,870
Yes. I...

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,200
I'll do my best.

24
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,310
And I'm really sorry for flipping you the bird.

25
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,710
- It's okay. Everyone does it to me. - Really? Okay.

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,440
I'll be in touch soon.

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,620
- I think I'm going to puke. - It's okay. No need to be nervous.

28
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,260
But I didn't quite get it. What exactly is the movie about,

29
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,390
and what did he say my role was?

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,600
Who cares what the role is? A small part in a Bong movie...

31
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,800
is better than doing ten of those run-of-the-mill dramas.

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,370
Min Hak, our day has finally come.

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,340
Let's pull ourselves together and focus.

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,570
You know what I had to do to make this happen, right?

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,140
- You've worked so hard. - Exactly. So stay out of trouble.

36
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,850
That whole mess with your friend, the Quiz King, and flying dildos?

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,680
If that happens again, we're finished.

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,390
Big projects can't afford a scandal. You get it?

39
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,490
- You parked, right? - No.

40
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,860
You didn't? You asked for parking validation.

41
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,390
Parking?

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,470
- Is the car back from the shop? - Wow. Faster than expected.

43
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,240
We just dropped it off yesterday.

San!

47
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,210
- Drink some water. Here. - I'm fine.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
You sure? Okay.

49
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,180
Thank you.

50
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,990
Hey, San hasn't eaten yet, so can you grab a lunch box for her?

51
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,760
A lunch box? I doubt any are left. We had lobster, so they went fast.

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,090
I saw a bunch left over earlier.

53
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,690
Alright, I'll take care of it. You just focus on the shoot.

54
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,430
Just a second.

55
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,260
Okay.

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,070
Alright, let's go again from Cut 13. Ready?

57
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,210
- Yes. - Can someone check my hair first?

58
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,310
- Why? Hae Na, your hair looks fine. - No, it's not.

59
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,280
This one strand is driving me crazy. This one right here.

60
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,220
What's bothering you? It looks so pretty.

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,550
- No, I hate it. - I know that's the whole point!

62
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,690
- Okay, look into each other's eyes. - Right.

63
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,090
Focus.

64
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,729
This summer, right here,

65
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,060
- how about a staycation? - How about a staycation?

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,600
Hae Na, try putting your arm around Min Hak's waist.

67
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,800
Perfect.

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,700
- You look like a real couple. - They'll think we're a real couple.

69
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,170
Would they now?

70
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,970
Okay, let's try the line again just like that.

71
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,210
One, two, three! This summer, right here,

72
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,410
- how about a staycation? - How about a staycation?

73
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,180
Who was that? Cut!

74
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,480
Come on, people, focus! Any idea how far behind we are?

75
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,790
If you don't belong here, get out!

76
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,660
Director, I just had another idea. I could put my arm on her shoulder.

77
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,220
Or wrap my arm around like this?

78
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,660
Min Hak, you're so focused today. Okay, hold on.

79
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,800
Let's get a touch-up on Hae Na's hair first.

80
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,500
Hey, Hae Na's hair!

81
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,570
Hair stylist!

82
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,630
Is there no one on hair?

83
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,800
Hair stylist!

84
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,010
This strand of hair on her cheek. Should I just move it back?

85
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,620
- There we go. - What?

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,120
- That's perfect now. Are you good? - To the side?

87
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,060
No, it's fine. Okay, Director, we're ready!

88
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,930
- This outfit's a problem, you know? - You're right.

89
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,700
If you wear this, we'll get calls about you wearing a rival brand.

90
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,800
And the behind-the-scenes camera is going to be on me all day.

91
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,500
Do we have a change of clothes in the car?

92
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,000
The thing is... You said you were taking the subway,

93
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,840
- so I brought the other car. - What car? We have another one?

94
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,940
It's just a little something I use as a backup when I'm rushed.

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,210
For the clothes, I'll borrow tape and try to cover the logo.

96
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,120
So is that why San is still waiting around here?

97
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,650
It's so crowded and dusty. I told you she should be in the car.

98
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,520
The car is tiny, so it's actually more uncomfortable.

99
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,190
Besides, she needs to see and experience this stuff.

100
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,130
Why are you so hung up on the "Quiz King" anyway?

101
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,100
It's not that, it's just...

102
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,940
Be honest with me. What's going on?

103
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,880
There's nothing between us. We're just friends. Friends.

104
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,480
- Friends? But she came this far? - She's just here for a project.

105
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,750
Don't give me that. It's an excuse. It's obvious she's here to see you.

106
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,320
Be careful. If she were a celebrity, at least she would be discreet.

107
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,590
If a normal girl gets the wrong idea,

108
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
things get messy fast.

109
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,760
I thought we agreed to be careful starting today.

110
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,230
- Hey. - You can't be in here, ma'am.

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,970
- Okay. - I'll have to ask you to leave.

112
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,770
So she's really "just a friend." I'll believe you for now.

113
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Yes.

114
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,440
Okay, here's the plan.

115
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,880
Since she's here for a project, we'll shoot you studying on break.

116
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,720
Yes. That sounds good.

117
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,780
Times like this,

118
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,590
- he reminds me of Dad. - I'll try to carve out...

119
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,090
Dad's on Papatrot's Team Handsome. I've still got it.

120
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,760
You want to know my secret?

121
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,159
It's this new salmon ampoule with collagen, PDRN, all that stuff.

122
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,670
People say it works wonders.

123
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,900
Look at my skin. For a man,

124
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,840
it's all about the skin and the hair.

125
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,810
The reason Dad came to see me for the first time in ten years...

126
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,750
was so he could be on an audition show.

127
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,680
It's been a while, sir.

128
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,450
- Jae Hak! - Jae Hak.

129
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,120
Did you get your hair fibres all over his clothes?

130
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,760
It seems you were rubbing your head all over him.

131
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,760
It looks like some got on you. My bad.

132
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,760
You've been well, Jae Hak? Seeing you take care of Min Hak,

133
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,830
you two are like real brothers. It puts my mind at ease.

134
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,740
I never heard a peep from you, so I was curious how you were doing,

135
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,170
and I see you haven't changed a bit.

136
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,940
You're right. I've been neglectful.

137
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
How's your mom doing?

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,780
I lost touch after she remarried and moved to the States.

139
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,850
Sir, I really enjoyed you in "Hot-Blooded Youth."

140
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,250
That? It was just a cameo I did as a favour for Guk Jin.

141
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,850
You were pretending to be a bachelor back then,

142
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,620
and now you've become a "Papa" for this show.

143
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,960
This old guy...

144
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,500
Should I give you a hug too, Jae Hak?

145
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,930
Gosh, careful. You'll get hair fibres everywhere.

146
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,900
Ji Hoon, let's film your mission performance first.

147
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,500
We'll film the family chat later, separately, at a nearby cafe,

148
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,710
we'll aim for a cosy, warm vibe for that scene.

149
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,580
Wow, your son is really handsome.

150
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,680
I know, right? He takes after his old man.

151
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,980
- All right, the mission song first. - Yes, shall we?

152
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,750
Wait, where did I put that calming pill?

153
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,030
Excuse me, he got his clothes dirty, so do you have any spare...

154
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,130
Yes, do you have any extra clothes?

155
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,830
I was in the middle of talking, gosh.

156
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,400
Did you know it was going to be like this?

157
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,600
Not really. But it was a good opportunity.

(Papatrot: Shake Up the World)

159
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,080
For the Papatrot surprise fan meet, he's the one you've waited for.

160
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,250
Singing "Rosa," it's Kang Ji Hoon! Give him a huge round of applause!

161
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,450
(Kang Ji Hoon for number 1! Kang Ji Hoon Is The One!)

162
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,590
Thank you, everyone!

163
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,390
I love you all! Thank you!

164
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,630
Son! I'm going to give it my all.

165
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,600
So I can put our family back together!

166
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,670
Do you know the heart of a man?

167
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,540
How about a glass of whiskey?

168
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,310
The moment our glasses clink

169
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,380
Look me right in the eyes

170
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,420
Because I can already see

171
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,260
the hesitation in your gaze

172
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,000
Your dad's really something else. He has fans from the prelims.

173
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,740
- All together now! - Rosa! Rosa!

174
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
- I'm your one and only rose - Well, Dad is handsome.

175
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,770
Touch me carelessly and you'll be pricked by my thorns

176
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,180
If it's a passionate love you want

177
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Then don't hesitate to hold me tight

178
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,220
- You're the best! We love you! - I love you! I love you all!

179
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,320
Son, keep watching me!

180
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,520
Who's that kid? A child actor?

181
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,730
Kang Ji Hoon's secret son.

182
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,730
He's been coasting on his looks, pretending to be single,

183
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,929
but that's starting to wear off.

184
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,130
He's had a son as cute as a button?

185
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,270
What I want to know about that guy, Kang Ji Hoon,

186
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,400
is what he was supposedly doing in the 90s.

187
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,570
What exactly is his claim to fame?

188
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,670
He was on that reenactment show, "Love and War."

189
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,080
All those memes of his bad acting from that show went viral.

190
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,480
Right. He never shuts up about that one story.

191
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,350
That he faced So Ji Sub and Won Bin in a jeans model audition's finals.

192
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,090
And if he hadn't had a stomachache, Song Seung Heon wouldn't've made it.

193
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,830
If you ask me, his son is the one with real star quality.

194
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,630
You think so? Once he gets used to the cameras?

195
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,370
No, but with looks like that, he's probably already a trainee.

196
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,970
You should learn to sing like that. You never know. You could be one.

197
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
Come on, you know I'm tone-deaf.

198
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,610
Come on, your dad was even worse. He made Papatrot's top 24, right?

199
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,710
- You can learn. You need to try. - Even my teachers gave up on me.

200
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,220
- They said I have two left feet. - Wait, you went to an academy?

201
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,150
Then maybe you should try acting.

202
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,820
I take after my dad. My acting is totally wooden.

203
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Sports, then?

204
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,430
My PE teacher told me I'd never make a living in sports.

205
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,800
Thank you.

206
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,030
- Ji Hoon! - Thank you.

207
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,540
Thank you.

208
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,310
- Thank you so much. - Let's go.

209
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,210
Excuse me, could I get a picture? I lent you the clothes, after all.

210
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,580
I have an online shop as a side hustle.

211
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,690
Of course! I'll get to everyone. Just a moment, hold on, one second.

212
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,490
Okay, one at a time. I'll get to all of you.

213
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,030
Wasn't that the day your career as a model was sealed?

214
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,440
Your friend the Quiz King can say, "Min Hak is a dedicated student."

215
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,740
"No, he's actually very smart." If he just drops lines like that...

216
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,780
Seriously, what are you even talking about?

217
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,780
I won't ask San for that favour. I'm going to work on my assignment.

218
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,250
Exactly! We'll film you working. That's the idea.

219
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,390
What?

220
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,290
My clothes.

221
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,530
I should avoid the behind-the-scenes shoot.

222
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,130
Director, thanks for all your hard work.

223
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,670
Min Hak, great work today.

224
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,730
Not at all. Today went smoothly, right?

225
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,770
Was there something you wanted to talk about?

226
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,210
- You made it. - Have you been waiting long?

227
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Jae Hak!

228
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,150
- Yes? What's up, Min Hak? - Well...

229
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,860
Have you seen San?

230
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,960
She disappeared suddenly and isn't answering her phone.

231
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,590
- She said she had to go, it's late. - Without even telling me?

232
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,870
She figured she'd be a third wheel if she stuck around.

233
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,630
She just came up to me quietly and told me she was heading out.

234
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,140
Anyway, your flight is at 7am, so go home and pack your stuff.

235
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,910
I've still got some work to do. Want me to call you a cab?

236
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,510
- One of the deluxe ones. - San likely missed her train.

237
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
By the way, what's with this car?

238
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,690
What?

239
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,720
Wow, what is this? This is sick. Is this yours?

240
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,190
- What? No. I can't afford this. - No, but this car...

241
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,770
- Gosh... - So this is your car?

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
What are you talking about? You called out, so when I stopped,

243
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,870
this is just where I happened to be.

244
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,870
Is this supposed to be a nice car?

245
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,970
I just don't really know about this kind of stuff.

246
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,480
Oh my. So Kang Min Hak's your brother.

247
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,610
I totally thought you were kidding.

248
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,350
And you are?

249
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,890
What? Jae Hak, what's your deal right now?

250
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,620
Oh? Hyun Joo.

251
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,020
Right, Hyun Joo.

252
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,190
- What? - Is this a hidden camera thing?

253
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,660
Are you trying to pull a prank on me or something?

254
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,270
Ta-da! Just a little gag.

255
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,610
Min Hak, say hi. This is Hyun Joo.

256
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,110
I'm trying to land a deal with them, and she's their head of marketing.

257
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,010
- Why are you so dressed up? - What are you talking about?

258
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,180
Hey, Hyun Joo, living it up? Wow, this thing.

259
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,220
Jae Hak! The lobster lunch was great, and then...

260
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,790
- I spilled sauce in the car. - What?

261
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,730
Eating in a fancy car or not... It's up to the owner, Hyun Joo.

262
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,100
Scrubbing it like that with a napkin will just make the stain spread.

263
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,170
Jae Hak.

264
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,870
Knock it off.

265
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,570
Okay, fine, Min Hak.

266
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,910
But, it's a lease. I got a really good deal on it.

267
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,350
Wait. Right. Here.

268
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,050
Don't you go anywhere.

269
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,650
What?

270
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,320
Where on earth did she go? She's not answering her phone.

271
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,030
Joo Yeon San!

272
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,530
San, you can't just leave without a word.

273
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,340
I feel like I shouldn't have come in the first place.

274
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
What?

275
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,340
Sorry, I was in a rush.

276
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,890
- Hold on. - What?

277
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,330
- Min Hak, what's up? Need a ride? - Get out.

278
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,430
- What? - I said, hurry up and get out.

279
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,240
What is it? What's going on?

280
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,380
- You have your wallet? - Of course. Need money for a cab?

281
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
You're the one who's going to need it.

282
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
Hey.

283
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Min Hak.

284
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,820
- Sorry, but could you get out? - Excuse me? Why?

285
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,990
But it's cold out.

286
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,660
And it looks like it's about to rain.

287
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,860
Min Hak seems really different from how he was on the show.

288
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,900
I can explain what's going on. Let me explain everything, okay?

289
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,100
Hey! No, you can't do this. I just got this car.

290
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,940
Hey, besides, you haven't driven in ages.

291
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,770
Hey, just let me drive, okay?

292
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,310
See you at the airport tomorrow.

293
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,440
Min Hak. Hey, just get out first.

294
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,450
- I'll give you a ride. - Buckle up.

295
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,250
You'll get in so much trouble! Hey!

296
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,680
Min Hak, I'm sorry. Okay?

297
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,930
Oh great, and now it's starting to rain.

298
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,040
This extreme weather is something else.

299
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880
It was just pouring a minute ago.

300
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,260
I can get an express bus from here, so you can just drop me off.

301
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
No, it's fine. I'll take you home.

302
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,930
You came all this way here for me, after all.

303
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,630
I had other things to take care of here anyway.

304
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,440
I feel like I've been such a bother today.

305
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Asking you to work on the project out of the blue,

306
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,180
and showing up at the film set...

307
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,210
And you're leaving the country tomorrow,

308
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
but you're still going out of your way.

309
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
Don't worry about it.

310
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,620
You know, about the other day...

311
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,820
I'm just bringing this up in case you were worried.

312
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,430
Even though that happened between us,

313
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,830
I'm not getting the wrong idea about our relationship or anything.

314
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,030
And if you're regretting it, you don't need to.

315
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,200
I mean, it was consensual.

316
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,270
We could just roll everything back to the way it was before.

317
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,040
Hey, San...

318
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,949
- Yes? - This is the first time...

319
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,250
I've driven in the entire year since I got my license.

320
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,390
So, I literally can't process a word you're saying right now.

321
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,930
Then why did you insist on driving me?

322
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,159
- Hey, I have to take this exit! - Now?

323
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,359
- Yes, now! - How?

324
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,560
- What? - What?

325
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,699
Wait, do you have a license?

326
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,370
- Yes. - But we can't switch seats now.

327
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,840
What? What are you talking about?

328
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,069
- First, put on the hazards. - You do it.

329
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,110
What?

330
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,480
- Right there. - Which one? This?

331
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,580
There.

332
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,510
- Let me in, just let me in. - Please.

333
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,420
Come on, please, just let me in.

334
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Please.

335
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,550
Okay!

336
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,970
Just focus on the guys' romance. Why is the boring friend butting in?

337
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,340
What's the big deal about her screen time?

338
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,170
He shouldn't have led her on in the first place.

339
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,970
What have you been up to all day?

340
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,580
Hey, why didn't you show up?

341
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
You should've come. It was epic.

342
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,820
There were so many cute guys and it was a blast.

343
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,589
Totally.

344
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,890
Yes.

345
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,370
Hey.

346
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,620
You must be exhausted.

347
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,650
- Thanks for the ride. - Are you kidding? You had it worse.

348
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,190
Yes.

349
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,590
Bye then.

350
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:19,260
You head on up. I think I'll get a driver from here.

351
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,700
Yes, that's probably for the best.

352
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,140
- All right, then. - Okay, bye.

353
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,120
- The standee. - What?

354
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,150
I still have your standee at my place.

355
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,160
Oh, right. It's still at your place. I totally forgot about it.

356
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,300
Want to take it with you now?

357
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,970
What is your deal?

358
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,230
Being all nice to someone you don't even like,

359
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,740
flirting with them, and then kissing them.

360
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,510
- Me? - Yes! You kissed me.

361
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,640
Na Rae, keep it down. The whole neighbourhood can hear you.

362
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,710
Yes, the whole neighbourhood can hear you.

363
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,780
Do you know what time it is? The walls are paper-thin, you know?

364
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,350
Actually, this is entertaining. Make a livestream about it.

365
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,420
Keep it down!

366
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,920
Sorry for the noise this late. But I'd like to clear something up.

367
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,220
Explanation? Are you a politician? What is "an explanation?"

368
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,860
I'm not like that with just anyone. I did it because I like you.

369
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,290
- He says he likes her. - This plot twist is insane.

370
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,500
If you're going to do that, talk about it in person!

371
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,730
Are you seriously going to keep messing with me?

372
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,140
I'm not messing with you. I'm serious. I like men,

373
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
and, well, I like women too.

374
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,210
Quiet down. A lot of our schoolmates live here.

375
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,080
What are you going to do if this ends up on Everytime?

376
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,910
So what? I was open about it back home,

377
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,809
and I never hid my orientation, not even when I played sports.

378
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,880
That's just who I am.

379
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,350
- It's already on Everytime. - So what's the ratio?

380
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,220
How much do you like women versus men?

381
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,790
If we're going by experience, men make up about...

382
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,799
- 90? - Too much detail.

383
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,070
The odds are against her.

384
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,270
- You have no chance. - I guess not.

385
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Even if I'm an engineering major in name only,

386
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,710
but I know bad odds when I see them.

387
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,910
- What? It's over? - That ended faster than I thought.

388
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,310
- Let's get some sleep. - I just ordered chicken.

389
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,750
The fire's gone out between them.

390
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,320
I must have been crazy. That's it. I'm swearing off men.

391
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,330
Please go. It's over now, and we'll be really quiet.

392
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,370
I'm coming. I said I was sorry...

393
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,870
You have to let me finish.

394
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,410
It's 90 percent men.

395
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
But...

396
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,310
Yang Na Rae is the ten percent that beats the 90.

397
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,320
The lower the odds,

398
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,390
the better it feels when it pays off, you know?

399
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,230
Thanks. I asked a lot of you, didn't I?

400
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,680
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

401
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,250
Can I ask you something?

402
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Yes.

403
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,630
About us kissing.

404
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,700
Was it definitely a mistake?

405
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,400
Do you regret it?

406
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
No...

407
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,370
What do you mean by that?

408
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,250
Seeing you on set today, you seemed like a different person.

409
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,150
I'm just a normal college student,

410
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,090
but you're surrounded by all these cool people.

411
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,630
So I get why you'd want to keep your distance from me around others.

412
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,030
And that got me thinking...

413
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,170
that maybe you're just a nice guy who can't say no,

414
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,300
and I was just reading too much into things.

415
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,310
Misreading your insistence on taking me home so late,

416
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,080
even though you can't drive.

417
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,820
You think I wanted to keep my distance from you?

418
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,490
Yes, like on set today.

419
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Right, the set.

420
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,630
To be honest, Jae Hak keeps suspecting something's up with us.

421
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,030
About us?

422
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,030
Right. I mean, it's not like there's an "us" yet.

423
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,440
Anyway, if he thought that, I was afraid he would say...

424
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,410
something weird or hassle you, so I couldn't bring myself to talk.

425
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
But...

426
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,620
I wanted to talk to you the whole time.

427
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,420
And this outfit...

428
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,190
It's from a rival brand of the clothing line I endorse,

429
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,200
so it would be bad if I got photographed wearing it.

430
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,170
But the behind-the-scenes camera was always right next to you, so...

431
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,440
And, San...

432
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,040
out of everyone I know,

433
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,550
you're the least ordinary person.

434
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,580
But even at school today...

435
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,720
Honestly, when I saw you at school, I just didn't know how to act.

436
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,330
We can't have bad rumours starting about you again because of me.

437
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,330
Why are you smiling?

438
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,000
I don't know. I just can't help but smile.

439
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
No, it's just...

440
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,470
I'm surprised that you'd worry about something like that.

441
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,110
You don't seem like the type at all.

442
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,920
You know what computer engineering majors are like?

443
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
What?

444
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,590
When it comes to important things,

445
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,530
we plan for every single what-if scenario.

446
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,970
What if we pull an all-nighter and the power goes out while compiling?

447
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,110
What if all our code gets wiped?

448
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,040
What if we all use the same branch and mess up the commit history?

449
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,880
What if the server crashes right before submission?

450
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,579
What if I missed a requirement on a group project?

451
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,050
Or someone uses another language?

452
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,690
It ran fine on my machine, but what if it fails for the TA?

453
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,160
- That must be exhausting. - And those...

454
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,560
are the kinds of "what ifs" I'm thinking about right now.

455
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,570
Like what?

456
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
What if you...

457
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,940
say that our kiss was a mistake?

458
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,380
What if you say you were tired and don't remember?

459
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,550
Or just...

460
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,720
that it didn't mean anything?

461
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,480
Most of all,

462
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,090
what if all these worries...

463
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,760
are just proof that this is all in my head?

464
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,890
What if we can't even be friends after this?

465
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,930
But what if we end up just as friends?

466
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,270
So if I do something rash...

467
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,500
and just make things awkward for our group...

468
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,650
What if you're just some player who goes around kissing any girl?

469
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,090
Okay, stop.

470
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,080
- What? - My hair. It's caught.

471
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,750
Wait. I'll get it. Hold on, let me get it.

472
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,050
- Gosh, it hurts. - I know. I think I have to cut it.

473
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,150
- I'll go get scissors and cut it. - Okay. Cut it. Just cut it.

474
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Gosh.

475
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
Scissors.

476
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,640
So get this, the guy got off right there.

477
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,210
No, I mean, that's why the smell was gone.

478
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,350
See? So it had to be him. That guy.

479
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,820
Isn't that hilarious?

480
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Kang Dong Won.

481
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,590
What? Right. Hilarious. So what did you say then?

482
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,130
Hey, you were totally zoned out.

483
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,700
No, I was listening.

484
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,000
Liar.

485
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,300
I'm not.

486
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,340
Are you really going to drink more?

487
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
Just tell me.

488
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,310
What were you thinking about?

489
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,590
You were judging me, right? "Lee Soo Min is overdoing it again."

490
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,320
- No, I wasn't. - Then...

491
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,690
were you thinking I'm just rambling about myself again?

492
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,300
I said no!

493
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,660
Then what was it?

494
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,610
Someone else.

495
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,150
I was thinking about someone else.

496
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
Another woman.

497
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Hey!

498
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Let's break up.

499
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,030
It came out on its own.

500
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,040
San, the thing is...

501
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,970
Look, I'm sorry, but I really have to go now.

502
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,970
I've got an early start tomorrow.

503
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,410
Right. Okay.

504
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,650
I'll call you later.

505
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Okay.

506
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,650
(One week later)

507
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,490
- This is beyond ridiculous. Right? - What?

508
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,990
Do I have to watch this garbage? What is this?

509
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,200
You're saying, to create an ideal quantum computer,

510
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,840
you must cool it to absolute zero, negative 273 degrees?

511
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,640
That's right. We need to reduce heat fluctuations.

512
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,670
The reason Hangang Group, a refrigerator company...

513
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,310
can partner with top universities like Carnegie Mellon...

514
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,710
It is because they have that kind of cooling technology.

515
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,910
You're a very quick study.

516
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,120
Is that maybe why a genius like you, instead of going to SNU or KAIST,

517
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,390
deliberately chose to come to Hangang University?

518
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,990
I was betting on this new school's potential,

519
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,160
but now I'm considering a transfer, so I guess I'm in a superposition.

520
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,960
Just like your heart right now, Sae Byeok.

521
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,030
I'm sorry. I'm still not over Hun Gyu.

522
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,240
Hun Gyu may be tall and handsome,

523
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,010
but he was just a loser who left hate comments everywhere.

524
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,580
Processing data in superposition, where zero and one coexist,

525
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,180
is a concept I'm very familiar with.

526
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,390
That way you talk, like a science YouTuber...

527
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,090
It's really sexy, right?

528
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,960
A Modelling Major who brings up Quantum Mechanics...

529
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,390
Talk about sexy, Sae Byeok.

530
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,570
Ban Ji No, I always thought he'd end up on a dating show...

531
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,170
and become the guy the entire country loves to hate.

532
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,240
You have your heads in the clouds, ignoring what's going on at school.

533
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,240
- Set up a group blind date for us. - A group blind date? Seriously?

534
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,640
Are we just going to take this? Should I set you up with a guy...

535
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,710
or a girl?

536
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,850
The local queer scene is tiny. A blind date?

537
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,950
The moment Lee Soo Min hears about this,

538
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,220
it'll be a disaster all over again. She'd be here in a heartbeat.

539
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,490
I'm done with the backend.

540
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,790
- Link it to the frontend. - Already? You finished the backend?

541
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,600
Yes, check GitHub.

542
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,230
But why have you been going so hard lately?

543
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,070
It's a little weird.

544
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,040
- What? What's weird? - She can be like this sometimes.

545
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,310
But this feels different, like she's weirdly overexcited.

546
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,280
Earlier at the diner, you were eating...

547
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,350
and going way over the top like, "Wow, this is so delicious!"

548
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,750
You suddenly start humming while you code?

549
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,360
That part creeped me out a little too.

550
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,730
What? I was just having fun. Coding is a blast.

551
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,930
See? Right there. She's totally forcing it.

552
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,600
Now that Kang Dong Won mentions it, her vibe is a bit extra.

553
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,130
You know when she started acting like this?

554
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,270
It was about ten days ago?

555
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,010
The day Kang Min Hak came and apologised to us.

556
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,540
Saying that for some reason, he couldn't attend meetings anymore.

557
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Wait, you don't think?

558
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,050
San, was Kang Min Hak really bugging you that much?

559
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,720
That's why you're in a good mood now that he's gone?

560
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,150
No, it's not necessarily that.

561
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,119
After the dildo Issue,

562
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,020
I thought what doesn't kill me makes me strong,

563
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,560
but I guess you two had some serious conflict behind our backs?

564
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,200
- No, that's not it. - What?

565
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,870
Maybe it's the opposite.

566
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,370
The opposite?

567
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,570
Don't tell me you and Kang Min Hak...

568
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,770
What? What are you trying to say?

569
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Never mind.

570
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,710
Come on, what is it?

571
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,510
Did you have a crush on Kang Min Hak?

572
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,480
That's hilarious, Na Rae.

573
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,650
This minute might be the funniest of my entire college life.

574
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,790
Having Kang Min Hak on the team is a win for us, right?

575
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,630
That's why you recruited him in the first place, San.

576
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,430
He showed up and worked hard on the project,

577
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,300
even after he said he was too busy to make the meetings for a while,

578
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,570
he's been sending us gift cards to make up for it.

579
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,440
But you keep changing the subject whenever we talk about Kang Min Hak.

580
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,270
And you keep ignoring his messages in the group chat.

581
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,140
It's nothing to get upset about, so if you are that upset...

582
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,510
What? You're denying it so hard, it must be true.

583
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
You've got to be kidding me.

584
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,850
Just be honest with us.

585
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,560
Like him? We'll be your wing women. So, should we set something up?

586
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,930
What's so great about Kang Min Hak anyway?

587
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,160
You know, you're really pretty. I had a girl crush on you at first.

588
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,260
What am I even saying?

589
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,530
Get real. It's not like that.

590
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,040
- Really? - Yes.

591
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,440
- Really? - Yes.

592
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,840
Then if we have a group blind date, will you come?

593
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,510
- Sure. - What?

594
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,080
Group blind dates are a bit much,

595
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,680
I'd be fine with a one-on-one, though.

596
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,450
- Seriously? - Seriously?
