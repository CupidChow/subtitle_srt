I've had enough. I'll make sure to scold them.

Hello. My name is Im Yoo Ri.

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,140
I'm the former student president for Modelling.

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,610
I'm Kang Dong Won. CompSci's former student president.

17
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,780
We've seen each other around a few times, right?

18
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,450
Well, we do go to the same school.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,490
Okay, let's review the agenda for today's emergency meeting.

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,990
First off, until the re-election for the Integrated Studies' Council,

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,690
per the bylaws, the Student Council will act as an Emergency Committee.

22
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,070
We'll be handling academic matters, especially freshman events.

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,330
Our CompSci Emergency Committee...

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,539
How about we just call it the Mo-Comp Committee?

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,770
We have a re-election soon anyway.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,610
But the administration might think we're in favour of the merger.

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,850
But if we're divided, we'll confuse the freshmen and hurt operations.

28
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,020
Doubling staff per department seems like a bit much.

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,550
Okay.

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,690
First, let's elect the joint Mo-Comp Emergency Committee.

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,830
(Modelling and CompSci Election!)

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,740
Then it's settled. This committee will lead the school through March.

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,840
Well, for starters, the CompSci and Modelling departments...

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,439
have already made numerous complaints...

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,809
- about the shared space. - It's supposed to be...

36
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,480
the Mo-Comp Student Council Room now,

37
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,320
but it seems the CompSci students still treat it as their own space.

38
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,590
I've heard they make our students feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,030
But you can't really blame them. It used to be their own space...

40
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,029
But we're an integrated school now.

41
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,830
It's a shared Mo-Comp space, right?

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,070
Fine. I get it.

43
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,569
We need a smart way...

44
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,510
to divide the Comp-Mo space to avoid conflicts...

45
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,110
So the Mo-Comp Emergency Committee we elect today will decide, right?

46
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,110
I wonder who'll be the Comp-Mo Emergency Committee Chairman.

47
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,609
The Mo-Comp Committee Chairman.

48
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,020
Does the order really matter?

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,550
Let's just go with Mo-Comp, then. It's alphabetical in Korean.

50
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,920
Well, in the English alphabet, C comes before M.

51
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,020
- But we're in Korea. - English is the global standard.

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,290
Oh my, look at Ms. Global Standard.

53
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,060
For the first item on the agenda, the Comp-Mo...

54
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,030
Mo-Comp?

55
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,800
We will begin the election for the joint Comp-Mo-Comp Committee.

(LOVE.exe, Episode 5: Semester Kick-off Meeting)

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
One.

58
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,870
- This connection we finally made... - Two.

59
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,080
I feel like I've completely ruined it.

60
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,010
Hey, don't stress out too much.

61
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,350
You'll lose your gains.

62
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,780
Alright, pack your shoulders.

63
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,020
Girls are so hard to figure out.

64
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,490
I just don't get it anymore.

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,160
Dude, if even you're saying that, what hope do the rest of us have?

66
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,960
Still, I think she went too far.

67
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,500
It's not like I could've known everything she was going through.

68
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Come on, focus on your workout.

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,930
But I was sincere about wanting to do the group project with her.

70
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,330
Alright, enough.

71
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
But, hey...

72
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,040
Do you think a guy like me...

73
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,140
can ever be someone worthwhile, someone people will remember?

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,249
Someday?

75
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,380
Seriously, stop. That's ridiculous.

76
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,880
- What? - You're already...

77
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,289
so popular, getting all this attention,

78
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,520
and everyone adores you.

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Right?

80
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
You wouldn't get it.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,460
Times like this make me think of my grandpa.

82
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,830
Hey there, handsome. Have a piece of candy.

83
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,970
You're so handsome.

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,540
- Min Hak. - Yes?

85
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,610
Give me that candy.

86
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Now.

87
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,349
Why? You got it for free anyway.

88
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,550

89
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,620
Here, take it.

90
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,530
Min Hak, your face is just like that piece of candy.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,040
You were given your looks for free, but nothing in life is free.

No bee ever looks for a wilted flower.

93

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,589
You wanted that side for the window.

182
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,990
You and the ex-Treasurer whispered to make sure you got it.

183
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,160
Come on, isn't the sunny side better for you?

184
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,500
You're always busy shooting videos and taking photos.

185
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,200
The lighting's better for you over here.

186
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,099
When you're filming and taking photos,

187
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,839
and constantly checking your likes, your battery drains really fast.

188
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,100
So outlets are important.

189
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
But...

190
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,039
do you really need them?

191
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,240
Do you want to switch?

192
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,039
- Yes. - Then...

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,680
ask me nicely.

194
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,149
- What was that? - Go on.

195
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,880
"Please let us switch, Madam Chair."

196
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,120
This is an abuse of power.

197
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,150
You'd better watch it before I have you impeached.

198
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,090
Fine. You have one hour to clear out all the CompSci stuff.

199
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,860
Speak for yourself. When your welcome assembly is over,

200
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,130
you'd better clean up without leaving a single trace.

201
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,160
This is why we should've just done it together.

202
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,729
We're people who value a noble cause...

203
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,900
over fleeting pleasures.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's go, guys.

205
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,440
And by the way, even though we split the official titles,

206
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,839
this whole "Madam Chair" and "Vice-Chair" thing...

207
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,910
is childish and a bit cringey.

208
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,010
Can we just use our names from now on?

209
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,920
No. I quite like it this way.

210
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,250
It's authoritative. The hierarchy is clear.

211
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,890
- Groups of four. - We're running out of time!

212
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,730
(Hangang University)

213
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,600
What about her?

214
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,399
Pyongyang Sci and Tech, CompSci grad.

215
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,500
She placed in a hacking competition.

216
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,340
They say she banned the accounts using macros for class registration.

217
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,610
If we do a cybersecurity project, it would look great on our resumes.

218
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,110
We'll split any prize money evenly, of course.

219
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,649
We'll divide the work equally...

220
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,250
- so you're not stuck doing it all. - Equally?

221
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,050
You mean, communist-style?

222
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,620
What? Is that because I'm from Pyongyang?

223
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,159
Anyway, sorry.

224
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,260
I've already teamed up with Ban Ji No.

225
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,130
He said he was all about a performance-based split.

226
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,470
As a business double major, you know what's marketable.

227
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,670
That's crucial. The business plan is worth a lot.

228
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,169
We'll provide solid tech support...

229
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,610
if you can write the business plan.

230
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,780
- Wouldn't that be the perfect team? - The three of you?

231
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,180
Okay, I'm in.

232
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,649
But on Yong Seok's team,

233
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,979
they said if the project went commercial,

234
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,520
the equity split would be 4-2-2-2.

235
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,620
They're giving me the 40 percent. What about you?

236
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,950
What's your offer?

237
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,320
This sounds fun. Who cares if we don't win?

238
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,930
I get something for my resume, too. It's a win-win.

239
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,260
Really? It'd be great to work with...

240
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,000
Should we start with the logo design?

241
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,460
Maybe for today, we could just grab a bite...

242
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,000
When it comes to logo design, on freelance sites like Kmong,

243
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,969
I usually get paid 200 dollar per design.

244
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,000
Photoshop edits start at 50 dollars.

245
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,480
But since we go to the same school, I won't charge you the full amount.

246
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,480
Hey! You're a double major too, right?

247
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,520
Sorry. I'm teaming up with my girlfriend.

248
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,950
- He's not even listening. - A girlfriend?

249
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,850
You have a girlfriend?

250
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,430
When did that happen?

251
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,170
Getting serious sponsored-item vibes from your outfit today.

252
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,100
Here. Check it out.

253
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,270
Okay. A 45-degree angle.

254
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
Perfect.

255
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
Hey, is it super obvious there are no lenses in these?

256
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,109
You just need to post it on Instagram.

257
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,350
You don't actually have to wear them.

258
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,320
It's completely empty.

259
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Just like me.

260
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,950
What's that supposed to mean?

261
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,920
Anyway, what about that Quiz King girl?

262
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,660
Did you ask her again?

263
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,860
She said she didn't want to team up.

264
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,060
- Why? - I don't know.

265
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,730
So I just decided to team up with someone else.

266
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,130
A guy named Ban Ji No.

267
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,740
Are we done for? Is this for real?

268
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,870
Yes.

269
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,840
Yes, my buddy, Min Hak.

270
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,950
Your schedule is pretty packed.

271
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,610
Since when are they such good friends?

272
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,849
It's fine.

273
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,850
You're a huge celebrity, after all.

274
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,190
We'll handle everything behind the scenes.

275
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,760
Because we're a team.

276
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,160
Hey, what's going on? Are they a team now?

277
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,230
Let's do this, guys!

278
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,259
Most of you have formed your teams.

279
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,060
If there is anyone who still needs a team,

280
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,230
they need to email the TA by tonight.

281
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,100
Otherwise, we'll assign you randomly. All right.

282
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,310
And I have one more announcement.

283
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
Our class...

284
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,850
for the Converged Physical whatever-it-is department...

285
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,650
has been selected as its representative course.

286
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,490
I believe I covered its connection to the competition last class.

287
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,360
And it seems there's a commendation from the Ministry of Education.

288
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,330
Basically, a way to quiet students and avoid a Ministry audit.

289
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,170
A one-off, face-saving competition.

290
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,000
For better or for worse, right?

291
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,740
You can take it from here.

292
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,569
We've received external funding,

293
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,910
so the prize is up by 10,000 dollars.

294
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,510
For a total prize of 30,000 dollars.

295
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,910
Thirty thousand dollars?

296
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,650
In exchange, judging now includes global communication...

297
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
and proactive engagement.

298
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,749
What do we mean by that?

299
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,960
Well, the prospective end users,

300
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,090
the public, their opinions matter.

301
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,400
They want something with broad appeal outside the campus.

302
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,660
What? So it's basically just a popularity contest?

303
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,899
Questions go on the forum.

304
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,170
Suggestions go to the department.

305
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,640
Do not come see me or contact me personally.

306
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,970
If first place gets 30,000 dollars,

307
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,140
what about second place?

308
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,410
A flash drive. Featuring the university's logo.

309
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,080
A one-terabyte flash drive.

310
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,720
Seriously? Can the gap between first and second place be that huge?

311
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,150
- Kang Min Hak! - Sub him out!

312
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,759
Hey, Kang Min Hak.

313
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,560
He's surprisingly diligent at school.

314
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,160
I know, right? I thought he'd be too busy for classes.

315
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,600
He'll probably stand by the goal, use face mist, and go live.

316
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,170
Yeon San, you're really taking this grudge way too far.

317
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,500
So what's the plan?

318
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,010
Should we ask Kang Min Hak now?

319
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,670
We can change teams until tonight.

320
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,410
Joo Yeon San has her pride, you know.

321
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,140
Who cares about pride right now?

322
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,550
If Ban Ji No gets Kang Min Hak, we don't stand a chance.

323
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,950
There's a flaw in your logic.

324
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,020
Kang Min Hak has a million followers.

325
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,490
The current population of South Korea is 51,751,065.

326
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,690
If we limit the population pool to just the citizens of South Korea,

327
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,060
that means about two percent of them follow Kang Min Hak.

328
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,259
The Comp Sci Dept has 120 students.

329
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,670
If two percent of them follow him,

330
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,400
that's barely 2.4 students.

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,239
In other words,

332
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,040
in the user vote, he isn't as valuable as you think.

333
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,540
Let's just find someone else.

334
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,110
Something seems off about your math.

335
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,350
How sharp of you.

336
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,550
And yes, many are international,

337
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,750
I just took that population completely out of the denominator.

338
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,190
If anything, I overestimated his worth.

339
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,690
Still, he's not much of a catch.

340
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,830
That's Joo Yeon San for you.

341
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,059
Enough talk.

342
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's just go ask a random Hangang University student.

343
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,870
Excuse me!

344
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,140
Quick, name the first student who comes to mind.

345
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Kang Min Hak?

346
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,850
All right, let's go.

347
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,910
Hey, defence!

348
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,020
- Cover your man! - Pass!

349
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,550
- Defence! - Hold on.

350
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,120
Nice shot!

351
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,220
Why is humanity so drawn to such superficial flashiness?

352
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,290
Get the board!

353
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,729
In sexual selection,

354
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,729
a doe prefers a stag with big, impressive antlers,

355
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,300
and a peahen is drawn to a peacock with magnificent tail feathers.

356
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,670
That's just how they pick a mate.

357
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,840
That's exactly my point. How inefficient is that?

358
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,640
What good are big, beautiful antlers when it comes to survival?

359
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,039
They get in the way and are cumbersome.

360
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,440
I mean, look at peacocks.

361
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,879
Despite their magnificent feathers,

362
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,710
to predators like leopards and eagles,

363
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,809
they just make them stand out.

364
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,610
So why do humans, advanced primates,

365
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,579
make the same irrational choices...

366
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,350
you'd expect from a deer or a peacock?

367
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,789
She has no clue what she's saying.

368
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,290
Should I really school her?

369
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,890
While they may look magnificent to human eyes,

370
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,459
to a predator like a leopard,

371
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,100
a peacock's feathers look like this.

372
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,070
A peacock's primary habitat is the dense, overgrown jungle.

373
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,769
So their colours aren't a handicap.

374
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,110
They're actually camouflage.

375
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,009
It's not that a peahen chooses a male...

376
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,680
with a magnificent pattern...

377
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,950
simply because she finds it beautiful.

378
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,380
The colours that the peacock flaunts to its predators...

379
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,120
just appear dull and drab.

380
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,050
Right.

381
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,790
I guess that makes Joo Yeon San a predator, then?

382
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
One more thing.

383
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:09,659
You called them "tail feathers."

384
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,460
But that expression is incorrect.

385
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,259
They're not tail feathers, and not wing feathers either.

386
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,430
To be precise,

387
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,730
they're feathers that grow from its lower back.

388
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,940
And you are...

389
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,569
Just a life sciences student.

390
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,640
Seeing such ignorance of biology...

391
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,110
especially engineering students like you,

392
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,109
I couldn't help but step in.

393
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,010
Sorry, I'm just rambling.

394
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Well, then.

395
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,450
Nice!

396
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,990
- One more basket to go. - If we make one more.

397
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,090
Play defence! It's game point!

398
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,560
Just block them!

399
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,890
Hun Gyu!

400
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Hey!

401
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,140
Even if I'm the one who scores,

402
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,000
who's really going to care?

403
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,340
But I don't want to lose.

404
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,980
I've been training each night.

405
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
Here I go.

406
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,479
After using my vet moves to shake off...

407
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,980
Kang Min Hak, the alpha male,

408
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,520
the moment I sink a beautiful clutch shot,

409
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,290
my classmates will finally notice me.

410
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,359
Maybe that one moment of impact...

411
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,890
could be my first shot at romance.

412
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,500
That's right. I've trained so hard for this.

413
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,500
Right now.

414
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
Oh my.

415
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,900
Nice.

416
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,630
Unreal.

417
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,800
He's better than I expected.

418
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,670
It's amazing. He scores, and the dark clouds part.

419
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,410
Even the dark clouds are parting.

420
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Joo Yeon San.

421
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,010
You have to be the one to do it.

422
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,220
If you want to get technical, you're his first love, aren't you?

423
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,349
The girl from his childhood?

424
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,620
For a guy, that's a huge deal.

425
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,920
All right, let's just vote on it. Majority rules.

426
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,120
Majority rule is a form of tyranny.

427
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,360
Democracy has always been built on that kind of violence, sweetie.

428
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,229
All in favour of Kang Min Hak joining,

429
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,259
raise your hand.

430
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
Me.

431
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,570
Sorry, So Yeon's calling.

432
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,440
Sorry, it looks more fun over there. I'm out.

433
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
What?

434
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,810
(Men's restroom)

435
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Kang Min Hak.

436
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,150
Got a minute?

437
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,990
- We'll go on ahead. - Yes, go on.

438
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Sure.

439
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,430
I'll get straight to the point. I want you on our team.

440
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,700
But I already promised Ji No I'd be on his team.

441
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,440
Why all of a sudden?

442
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,870
I want to apologise. I was out of line.

443
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,640
So I've been trying to figure out how to fix things.

444
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,410
And I realised you don't need anything.

445
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,150
I had nothing to offer you.

446
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,180
All I can offer are meal vouchers and printing credits,

447
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,389
but you've got...

448
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,290
plenty of money, and people will buy you food anyway.

449
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,520
But I did notice you're very busy.

450
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,920
Which means...

451
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,030
the most important thing to you is your time.

452
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,670
So here's my offer.

453
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,529
Join us, and you won't have to work.

454
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,640
The three of us will do everything,

455
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,640
and you just help promote it later.

456
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,040
Of course, if we do end up winning,

457
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,239
we'll split the prize money evenly.

458
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,349
And even if we don't win, don't worry about your grade.

459
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,320
I have an A plus in all my majors.

460
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,180
Also, Yang Na Rae...

461
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,149
did offer up her studio apartment...

462
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,320
as our meeting space,

463
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,960
but I guess that's not really a selling point.

464
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,699
Let me know if you need anything else.

465
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,130
I'll talk it over with my friends,

466
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,030
and we'll do our best to meet your terms.

467
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,270
So this time,

468
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,900
you just need me for window dressing.

469
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
What?

470
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,170
I appreciate the offer.

471
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,010
But I'll stick with Ban Ji No's team.

472
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,009
Why? What did Ji No say?

473
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,110
Did he offer a stake in his company?

474
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,849
Or his uncle at a big tech company?

475
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,150
Did he say he'd pull some strings?

476
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,650
No, Ban Ji No didn't say anything like that.

477
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,049
Then what?

478
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,120
He said the team really needed me.

479
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,330
I have to get to my next class.

480
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,500
I've got to go.

481
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,470
Hey.

482
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,439
- You can head on in this way. - Dong Won.

483
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,710
What do we do? No one's here.

484
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,740
What else is new?

485
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,440
I sent out the notice, but...

486
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,010
Dong Won, should we push it back 30 minutes?

487
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,150
Let's just start. We're starting now.

488
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,690
All right, let's get the semester's first general meeting started.

489
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,889
First, the department space issue.

490
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,090
For heaven's sake.

491
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,699
It's wonderful to see our students...

492
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,560
gathered here like this.

493
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,039
I know your time is precious,

494
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,510
so I'll get straight to the point.

495
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,239
The Hangang University President's Cup...

496
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,640
Software Convergence Tech Contest.

497
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,010
We already know that the prize is now 30,000 dollars.

498
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,290
It's their way of using chump change to shut the students up...

499
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,019
and avoid a Ministry of Education audit...

500
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,960
with a face-saving competition.

501
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,530
So you've heard.

502
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,060
Actually, there's one more thing.

503
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,359
True to our name, Convergence Studies,

504
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,430
each team needs a modelling student.

505
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,770
At least one, to be exact.

506
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,840
In return, the winning team...

507
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,510
will receive an internship at a leading U.S. tech company.

508
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,609
And that's not all.

509
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,210
We'll also cover round-trip flights...

510
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,920
and accommodations.

511
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,220
We really should've gotten Kang Min Hak.

512
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,350
But why do we have to team up with a Modelling Major?

513
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,219
First, they said anyone could join.

514
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,129
It's just another school deception.

515
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,829
Dean, please elaborate on the issue...

516
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,960
of allocating more space for our department,

517
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,199
how the merger budget savings were used,

518
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,199
and the increase scholarships.

519
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,230
We would like to know more.

520
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,510
I knew it was just a stepping stone.

521
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,710
I shouldn't expect anything from it.

522
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,880
All right, mind the spacing of your steps.

523
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,710
Heads up high. That's it.

524
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,850
A class for Modelling Majors?

525
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,050
Your eyeline. That last pose was great.

526
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,750
Watch your stride.

527
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,120
(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

528
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,360
- They seem to be working hard. - Keep coming, straight on.

529
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,690
- But how can... - Great eyeline.

530
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,030
Walking on two feet be a college class?

531
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,359
Drop your left shoulder.

532
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,199
- And pose. - Why do we have to learn...

533
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,240
- once again the universal traits... - Two, three.

534
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,500
That distinguish humans from other primates?

535
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,910
And yet...

536
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,280
What is beauty?

537
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,290
(Department of Modelling, Class in progress)

538
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,260
Okay.

539
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,730
So elegant.

540
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,859
To some,

541
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,360
just by merely existing, they can absorb nutrients,

542
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,470
achieve professional value,

543
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,840
and even to procreate.

544
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,649
An absurdly powerful advantage that takes care of everything,

545
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,620
from survival to self-fulfilment, even reproduction.

546
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,690
Maybe that’s the ideal humans have been chasing...

547
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,089
ever since we left hunting and gathering behind...

548
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,660
and entered the fourth industrial age?

549
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,400
Can you believe this weather? It's only week two.

550
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,130
Welcome to Gyeonggi Province.

551
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,970
The biting wind on the outskirts of the capital region.

552
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,740
Why isn't Joo Yeon San picking up? The shuttle line is getting long.

553
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,210
I'm at the Converged Tech lounge.

554
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,480
What's Joo Yeon San doing there?

555
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,680
But isn't the Department of Modelling having their kick-off party today?

556
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,190
They turned the Comp-Eng hallway into a club in just half a day?

557
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,020
Make some noise!

558
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,760
(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

559
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,130
(Congratulations on the New Department)

560
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,800
Min Hak, just focus on the ideas. I'll handle making them a reality.

561
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,270
Ideas?

562
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,610
So, what's been on your mind lately?

563
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,610
The best ideas are the ones that solve real-life problems.

564
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,480
I guess, fine dust.

565
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,190
- Fine dust. - It's a problem every spring,

566
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,090
It'd be great if an app could...

567
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,690
auto-purify the air around you.

568
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,530
And one more thing. UV rays are also a concern.

569
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,530
So you wouldn't have to bother putting on sunscreen,

570
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,730
what if there was an app that could just block UV rays?

571
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
I see.

572
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,700
Sharing our thoughts like this, I feel like we've gotten closer.

573
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,540
- Hey, Min Hak bro, what's up? - Hey!

574
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,850
Excuse me, but would you mind removing your hand?

575
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,190
(Hangang University)

576
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,430
This way?

577
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,870
I'm going dark tomorrow.

578
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,429
- Kang Dong Won. - Dong Won?

579
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,570
As in Kang Dong Won?

580
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,600
Quick, hide!

581
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,570
Stop the department merger!

582
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,079
- Stop it! - Stop it!

583
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,740
Some Semester Kick-off this is.

584
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,410
- Some Semester Kick-off this is. - Some Semester Kick-off this is.

585
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,350
- Stop it! - Stop it!

586
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,150
Dong Won?

587
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,350
Fancy seeing you here. What brings you here?

588
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,390
We just couldn't stand by and let this happen.

589
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,530
I see. Right.

590
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,000
- This is a Chaotic General Meeting! - It's a Chaotic General Meeting!

591
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,770
- This is a Chaotic General Meeting! - This is a Chaotic General Meeting.

592
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,169
- Do we have another chant? - Well...

593
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,840
- Fellow students! - Wait. Why me?

594
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,340
- Come on, just go with it. - Fellow students...

595
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,580
Dong Hwan, do you have a new chant?

596
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,010
Actually, you guys,

597
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,380
instead of us just shouting into the void out here,

598
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,020
shouldn't we go inside...

599
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,790
- Go inside? - Inside?

600
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,049
And try to get people on our side?

601
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,420
Wouldn't that be more effective?

602
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,460
- She's right. - Exactly.

603
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,660
- That's the spirit. - That's the spirit.

604
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,160
- Let's win them over! - Let's win them over!

605
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,830
- Let's win them over! - Let's win them over!

(Semester's starting? Whatever, let's drink.)

608
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,370
(Semester Kick-off Party)

609
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,210
Really? What's with them?

610
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,250
They should merge all the kick-offs.

611
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,280
Having them separately is a waste.

612
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,050
Let's go!

613
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,090
Where's Joo Yeon San?

614
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,670
Kang Dong Won?

615
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,680
Vice-Chair? What brings you here?

616
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,510
I'm just looking for a friend.

617
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,410
And to win over some modelling majors to our Emergency Committee's cause.

618
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,450
No anti-merger shirt today? This look really suits you.

619
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,890
(We want to code, not walk the runway.)

620
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,989
I can't just waltz into the lion's den.

621
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,130
The lion's den?

622
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,500
Who in Modelling are you hitting on? Want my help?

623
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,500
Not "hit on." I said "win over..."

624
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,740
How about we just go our separate ways?

625
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,140
No. I'm enjoying talking with you, Vice-Chair.

626
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,139
- For real? - I'm just sick of...

627
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,980
the CompSci majors looking down on us modelling majors,

628
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,650
and acting smug, so I'm actually picking a fight.

629
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,380
I'm sorry about that.

630
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,220
You're right. The merger isn't the Modelling Department's fault.

631
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,819
We're also collecting signatures.

632
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,989
Seniors are swamped by Fashion Week.

633
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,490
But I'll collect them and give them to you all at once.

634
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,930
So, does this mean we've made up?

635
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,329
Unbelievable!

636
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,500
CompSci majors took more lockers on the first floor.

637
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,969
They took them all behind our back.

638
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,040
What?

639
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,539
Those weren't for every student.

640
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,149
- They were for the CompSci Dept... - What are you talking about?

641
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,480
- It belongs to the CompSci... - Busted!

642
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,020
- Joo Yeon San! - Kang Dong Won!

643
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,480
- Joo Yeon San! - Trying to run away?

644
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,050
- Joo Yeon San! - Where are you going?

645
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,810
Babe.

646
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,310
Hey. You made it.

647
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,260
You just can't contain yourself, can you?

648
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,610
Joo Yeon San. Leave it to you to kill the mood just by showing up.

649
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,420
This vibe is killer!

650
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,020
What are you doing here?

651
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,050
I'm here to see you, Kang Min Hak.

652
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,559
- What? - Don't tell me you're here...

653
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,790
for the Creative Integrated Design class.

654
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,760
I'm here for the Creative Integrated Design class.

655
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,430
No. Min Hak is on our team, and we've already gotten pretty far.

656
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,270
Min Hak, didn't Joo Yeon San say not to even show up for meetings?

657
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,769
That would be completely ignoring the dean's intention...

658
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,840
to foster global talent through interdisciplinary integration.

659
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,739
I've been giving it a lot of thought.

660
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,139
Not just using your popularity...

661
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,509
- for the contest. - I'm a big fan. You're so handsome.

662
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,280
I mean the real reason we actually need you on our team.

663
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,380
Yeon San, I didn't quite catch that.

664
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,719
Don't listen to her, Min Hak.

665
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,050
The important thing is your choice.

666
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,060
I see your potential and skills. I value what you bring to the table.

667
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,759
Value?

668
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,990
What exactly is my potential?

669
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,130
Obviously, it's...

670
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,460
And don't say that I'm handsome, tall, and popular.

671
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,970
Right! That's not potential. Those are assets you already have.

672
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,440
It's more of a passion?

673
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,670
The friendship that's blossoming between us?

674
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,410
Design.

675
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,220
Design.

676
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,650
- What? - The shell?

677
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
No.

678
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,160
In UI design, it's not just a superficial shell.

679
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,890
An intuitive, elegant UI in itself is a brilliant feature.

680
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,730
But for people like me, that sense of design...

681
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,270
that way of thinking is what I lack.

682
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,599
That's why today's young audience...

683
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,400
has gone so wild for your...

684
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,970
Let's go check that out.

685
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,410
Let's go, man. What you think?

686
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,839
- Let me go. What's your problem? - For your beauty.

687
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,780
- Relax! - That's what I need.

688
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,620
- "Beauty"? - It's a polite way to say he's hot.

689
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,420
That's an asset Min Hak knows he has.

690
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,689
Min Hak, let's not waste any more time.

691
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,690
The group's waiting... Hey, come on!

692
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,190
No, the beauty I'm talking about is from a different perspective.

693
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,330
What exactly is it that makes people...

694
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,660
drawn to high noses, sharp jaws, and physiques of guys like you?

695
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,370
What's the algorithm in those lines that fascinates the human mind?

696
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,939
They're the same lines and curves,

697
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,110
so why do we find Ban Ji No's boring?

698
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,239
Hey!

699
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,310
Min Hak, simply put, she's after your fame.

700
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,880
And I'm just part of the scenery.

701
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,950
- What's going on? - What is that?

702
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,750
- No, that's not it. - This place is madness!

703
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,820
It's curiosity!

704
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,350
A spirit of inquiry!

705
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,420
If we drop our preconceptions, we can access a larger data set.

706
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,960
That spirit of inquiry makes me want to do this competition...

707
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,060
I want to do it with you!

708
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,800
He's got nice lines.

709
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,610
Gosh. I missed the object of the sentence.

710
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,650
- I love a public confession. - Keep rolling.

711
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,320
What now? Is everyone really filming something like this?

712
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,360
- What's going on? - She's got some nerve.

713
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,890
That's how it's done lately.

714
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,930
- Yeon San, you're incredible. - So audacious.

715
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,990
Joo Yeon San!

716
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,629
- Hey! - She thinks you're amazing.

717
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,929
- What now? - Tell them to stop filming.

718
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,930
Right.

719
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,330
Let's do it.

720
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,170
- He said yes? - Joo Yeon San is something else.

721
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,510
- She's lost her mind. - No, the group meeting!

722
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,240
I meant the group meeting with you!

723
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,840
I want to do the group meeting with you!

724
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,980
Right, the group meeting.

725
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,510
Let's do the group meeting together.

726
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,580
- What the heck? - I'm in. Let's do it.

727
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,650
- A group meeting? - Is that all it was?

728
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,220
- Kang Min Hak, no! - It's just the group meeting.

729
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,850
- So they're going to be a team? - Hey, over here.

730
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,420
- Hey, for real! - Over here. Drinks!

731
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,490
Get us drinks! Drinks!

732
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,360
Joo Yeon San is stealing what's mine again.

733
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,859
Na Rae! He's doing it with us!

734
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,890
Good. Now we can finally have fun.
