The breakdown of the Innovative University Grant for the merger.

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,889
Apparently, they spent 1,000,000 dollars...

The only work was at the Global Content Development Lounge,

13

That's exactly why it's weird.

180
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,710
(Cheonghak Hall)

181
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,439
Even with just the evidence we've collected so far,

182
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,210
the Ministry of Education will definitely launch an audit.

183
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,280
The media won't ignore this either.

184
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,950
So don't just sit around waiting for the school's response.

185
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,419
Darn...

186
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,090
- like you own the school. - Hey!

187
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,390
Hey! That's enough.

188
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Come on, just ignore him.

189
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,930
What's his deal?

190
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,630
He's just trying to pick a fight.

191
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,400
You know he's been pissed at the Emergency Committee.

192
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,200
The department's reputation was already bad...

193
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,830
because of that forced merger,

194
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,900
and now that all the internal issues keep leaking outside,

195
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,140
they're saying the school's image is totally ruined.

196
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,170
Still, that's no excuse.

197
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,410
Hey, they're graduating soon, too.

198
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,580
It's prime time for job hunting,

199
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,850
so of course they're on edge.

200
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,450
Aren't you graduating after the summer semester too?

201
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,150
Yes, but I've already got a job lined up.

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,389
Really? Congratulations!

203
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,860
It's not a company in Seoul or anything.

204
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,659
Anyway, everyone's busy...

205
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,630
worrying about their own future, around this time.

206
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,430
So don't let Everytime get to you, okay?

207
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,970
Yes, people post anything on there.

208
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,100
They nitpick your private life,

209
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,470
or your orientation, stuff like that.

210
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,150
Hey.

211
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,050
Hey.

212
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,960
That story you posted yesterday...

213
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,560
was that near campus?

214
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,130
Yesterday?

215
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,500
Oh, yes.

216
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,330
It's nearby. The vibe was great.

217
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,630
The yakitori was great, too.

218
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,600
- Is he trying to fish for details? - Yakitori?

219
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,040
You mean those chicken skewers with the green onions?

220
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,140
Just chicken skewers.

221
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,410
Scallion skewers are sold separately.

222
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,650
Am I overthinking this? Maybe Gil Tan's already out?

223
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,850
Did you guys go for a second round?

224
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620
Yes.

225
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,890
But it's not just a place for friends.

226
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,390
But we are friends. At least, I thought so.

227
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,590
Darn it.

228
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,590
Here, let me try.

229
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,400
There were no staples.

230
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,800
No wonder it wouldn't budge.

231
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,800
There you go. Do you want me to get that one too?

232
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,170
I'm good.

233
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,240
And just like that, I've got butterflies.

234
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,820
Do you want to go together sometime?

235
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
For yakitori.

236
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Sure.

237
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,890
The ginkgo skewers were great, too.

238
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,120
Let's go when we both have time.

239
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
Yes.

240
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,830
It's not a place for friends.

241
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm heading out.

242
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,069
Okay, bye.

243
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,370
(Department of Converged Physical Technology and Global Contents)

244
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,509
Now, where is it? Let's see where it is.

245
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,510
Dad, what are you doing?

246
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,880
I was just looking for a pot.

247
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
A pot?

248
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,180
I forgot.

249
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,320
I don't have a pot. Don't worry about making food.

250
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,620
It's right here.

251
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,319
So there is one.

252
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,490
Since when?

253
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,630
So that's all you needed, right?

254
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,200
- No, but... - Dad!

255
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,530
What?

256
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:08,129
Just look at all this dust.

257
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,070
After you leave for school, I'm turning this place upside down.

258
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,370
It doesn't need cleaning.

259
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,769
Look at it with your own two eyes.

260
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,369
This place is an absolute dust pit.

261
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,410
Fine. Then you can clean it for me, Dad.

262
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,880
- You want me to clean it? - The bathroom.

263
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,410
You've got some nerve.

264
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,020
Just because I own a motel...

265
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,520
doesn't mean I'm your personal maid.

266
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
That's not it.

267
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,149
- I saw a cockroach. - What?

268
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,689
- There is. - I didn't see one.

269
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,860
There is one. It's still hiding over there.

270
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,029
I'm positive. There are a few of them!

271
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,030
- Is that so? - Yes.

272
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,860
- Hurry! - Where is this supposed cockroach?

273
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,630
- Let me see. - Why would you send this to me!

274
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,600
Where is this cockroach you're talking about?

275
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,940
What, you can't see it?

276
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,840
It was huge.

277
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,610
"It was huge?"

278
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,210
How many of them?

279
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,250
Didn't it come in from outside?

280
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,250
- Get inside. - Where is it?

281
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,560
Where is it?

282
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,889
Maybe it left the bathroom.

283
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,929
I can't find it.

284
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,660
Yes, maybe it left!

285
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,260
Weren't you just half-asleep?

286
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,330
Yes.

287
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
What?

288
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,070
I guess so.

289
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,539
- I'm late, I'm heading to school. - What about breakfast?

290
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
You can eat by yourself, Dad.

291
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,170
- Eat something! - I'll just have a banana!

292
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,670
You need to eat a proper meal!

293
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,349
How am I going to deliver all this?

294
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,950
(Department Jacket Order Sheet)

295
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,290
Are you heading to class already?

296
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,890
Is it the one that ends at four?

297
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,789
Yes. You?

298
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,790
Me too, four.

299
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,530
I planned my schedule around yours.

300
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Aren't you going to be late?

301
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,930
It's fine if I'm a little late.

302
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,440
You'd better get going. I'm taking off.

303
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,870
Oh, right.

304
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,670
I have to return the department jacket.

305
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,810
Sorry?

306
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,639
It looked so good so I wore it to class,

307
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,110
but I think I left it there.

308
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,010
Sorry.

309
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,450
I'll get it to you later.

310
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,950
All right. I'll see you later.

311
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Such a nice day

312
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,169
Such a nice watch

313
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,170
Heading to pilates

314
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,600
A direct message from Jinny?

315
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,770
Min Hak,

316
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,870
you're not buying their story, are you?

317
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,949
What kind of day should I have

318
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,820
(Min Hak, you're not buying their story, are you?)

319
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,680
Look, there's that girl again.

320
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,320
- Hey, I'm getting off here. - Right here?

321
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,830
Wait, why are you getting off here?

322
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Hey.

323
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,400
Walk over to the locker as naturally as possible,

324
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,710
casually open the bag,

325
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,909
then naturally open the locker door and shove this monstrosity inside.

326
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,310
Gosh, this locker is full.

327
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,980
I can't believe I brought this all the way to school.

328
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,700
San, you dropped...

329
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,299
(Joo Yeon San)

330
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,040
It's heavier than I expected.

331
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,110
Because it holds San's food for the day, a banana.

332
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,810
I spent the whole night lost in my own emotions,

333
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,850
I wonder what kind of weight must San bear,

334
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,350
living on the same Earth with dull people like me?

335
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,120
Sea squirt larvae are like tadpoles.

336
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,560
They swim around freely.

337
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,730
Surprising, isn't it?

338
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,930
When a sea squirt becomes an adult, it attaches firmly to a rock...

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,970
and within 48 hours, it eats its own nervous system and spinal cord.

340
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,400
Once it no longer needs to move,

341
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,870
the brain becomes unnecessary too.

342
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
Doesn't that sound like some people in high places around here?

343
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,810
There she goes, on another tangent unrelated to our major.

344
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,920
Essentially, every brain is an organ that creates movement.

345
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,590
From a human's view, you'd think it's just for thought.

346
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,330
But it's not an organ that only thinks.

347
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,270
Plants, which don't move,

348
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,840
therefore have no brain or nerves.

349
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,139
Of course, the secretion of hormones from the tip of the plant embryo...

350
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,010
could be seen as a kind of movement, I suppose.

351
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,010
Hormones.

352
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,550
But the kind of movement I'm referring to here...

353
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,320
is a more vivid form of interaction.

354
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,860
A dance, if you will.

355
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,770
What's she doing?

356
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,970
Is she dancing?

357
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,570
I think so.

358
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
So weird.

359
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,480
I kept calling your name earlier,

360
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,990
but you didn't hear me and just kept going.

361
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,790
Sorry?

362
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,420
Why were you calling me?

363
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,530
You dropped this.

364
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,770
You're something else.

365
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,810
It's a good thing I picked it up right away.

366
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,140
Wait. Don't tell me he opened it.

367
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,350
Does he know what this is or not?

368
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,710
Therefore,

369
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,950
the notion that plants can listen to music is absurd.

370
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,290
The very definition of "hearing"...

371
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,119
requires the existence of neurons,

372
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,160
which only animals possess.

373
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,930
Man, global warming is no joke.

374
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,930
It's only March, why is it so hot?

375
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,240
Now where's the remote?

376
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,750
Which brings us to...

377
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,560
the "Sonic Algorithm to Promote Houseplant Growth."

378
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,730
I'm rejecting this app proposal, Mr. Ban Ji No.

379
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,460
What? That was Ban Ji No's idea?

380
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,269
- It wasn't even that great? - He did that whole dance for that?

381
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,400
Power on.

382
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,540
Starting in basic mode.

383
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,370
What's that sound?

384
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,940
Why isn't this working?

385
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,320
I have to find the power button.

386
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,890
Why won't this zipper budge...

387
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,030
How do I turn this thing off...

388
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,660
- Darn it. - Since I am not a plant myself,

389
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,970
I can hear an unbalanced motor spinning.

390
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,740
- What's that noise? - Sounds like someone's phone is on.

391
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,670
Why isn't this working?

392
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Everyone, please put your phones on silent.

393
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,250
Please.

394
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,960
Switching to Strong Vibrate Mode.

395
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,800
Be quiet, darn it.

396
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,570
- Shut down. - Whose is it?

397
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,709
It keeps going off, it must be urgent.

398
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,910
You should step out and take that.

399
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,720
Now playing Hot Guys' Moans Mode.

400
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,120
Gosh, what's that doing here?

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
The ridges are vibrating so coquettishly.

402
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,190
That vibration.

403
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,390
- What? - What's with her?

404
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,990
What the heck?

405
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,400
- Why would she bring that here? - Isn't that the "Do me" girl?

406
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
So?

407
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
She's kind of a troublemaker.

408
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,100
This is wild. Why won't my phone record?

409
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,740
- She needs to put that away. - Seriously.

410
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,840
Stay calm, Joo Yeon San.

411
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
Man.

412
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,180
Even in the worst situations, there's always a way out.

413
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,020
What a noise.

414
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Hey.

415
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,219
Feynman won the Nobel Prize for an equation...

416
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,420
he came up with after watching a spinning plate.

417
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,830
The people in this room are also members of the ivory tower.

418
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,840
If I just calmly explain everything, they'll understand.

419
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,170
I have to trust their intelligence and open-mindedness.

420
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,640
- It's still on. - Should we really be filming this?

421
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,980
Why does she carry something so big around?

422
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,390
That's all for today. You did a great job, sweetie.

423
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm sure you're all a bit flustered.

424
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,800
You're probably thinking you've seen it all in this class.

425
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,070
But the fact it took me forever to find the power button,

426
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,870
should be enough to tell you that I'm new to this device.

427
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,709
That's right. I'm in the Department of Computer Engineering.

428
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,040
I do a lot of side jobs.

429
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,649
I was asked to check for a device syncing error,

430
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,480
and it's for a freelance gig I was subcontracted for.

431
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,889
My father made a surprise visit,

432
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,260
and I was worried he might find it.

433
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,929
And get the wrong idea,

434
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,200
so I hid it in my bag.

435
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,270
However, I still have no idea how it suddenly turned on.

436
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,570
My best guess is...

437
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,070
I see.

438
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,280
So that's what that was earlier...

439
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,520
Now that I've gone to such lengths to explain the situation,

440
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:13,220
please don't get the wrong idea or spread rumours.

441
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,690
Thank you for listening to my long-winded explanation.

442
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,399
- That's totally plausible. - Yes, that makes sense to me.

443
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,270
- Right. - Maybe there's still hope...

444
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,140
How can she do that?

445
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,070
You shouldn't be recording this.

446
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,310
Come on, what about her privacy?

447
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,740
- Man. - Everyone.

448
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,710
How about we all put our phones down?

449
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,720
I don't think we need to record this.

450
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,450
Darn, I'm so done for.
