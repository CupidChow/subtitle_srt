All I want for my lord,

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,129
who saw potential in this humble servant,

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,140
is to bring him joy.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,540
You summoned me, a mere commoner,

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,650
to your royal presence,

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,150
and ordered me to strengthen Joseon through technological advancement.

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,650
I humbly bow to accept your command.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,100
A position that had no name.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,600
If there are more people like me in the future,

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,670
what would we be called?

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,200
To open...

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,240
and to develop.

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,710
Someone who opens up new possibilities.

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,980
A person who develops and makes them a reality.

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,650
Yes, that is it.

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,450
"Developer" would be the perfect name.

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,590
Your Highness, the Crown Prince!

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
What is the meaning of this!

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,639
This is the only Honcheonui blueprint.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,840
Your Royal Highness.

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,210
You pathetic fool.

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,010
Yeong Sil.

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,410
Pay him no mind.

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Your Majesty.

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,120
Seeing today's great laptop tragedy, I got this idea for a web novel.

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,230
A poignant friendship between King Sejong and Jang Yeong Sil,

35
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,230
and the Crown Prince, his enemy, has great chemistry with Yeong Sil.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,130
My ears are bleeding. Na Rae, are you trying to get sued?

37
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,500
Seriously. A genius who transcended class...

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,110
to fall for such a pathetic prince.

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,310
It's an insult.

40
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,110
Send an angry emoticon.

41
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,650
I wouldn't call him dim-witted. Crown Prince Munjong was brilliant.

42
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,080
Right, the Cheugugi was actually Munjong's idea.

43
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,249
The prince from my story is actually based on Grand Prince Suyang...

44
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,490
But why did you use my face and San's for the characters?

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,290
Because you two are the hottest engineers I know!

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,330
So, are you skipping the group blind date?

47
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,400
Why would you even ask when you know I'm not into that?

48
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,730
Not you, Yeon San!

49
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,329
How can you even ask that...

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,600
when you know the state San's in today?

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,500
You actually came, Min Hak.

53
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,770
Of course.

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,970
You were great out there earlier.

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,310
Careful.

- It's mine! - Mine! Mine!

60
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,650
Everyone, quiet down, please!

61
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,860
Alright, time for my daily good deed for the environment...

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,300
I told you it was mine.

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,230
I clearly said it was mine.

64
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,130
Besides, you can obviously see it's a different laptop!

65
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,270
To be fair, it looked just the same a second ago.

66
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,710
Let's get the council room bullhorn.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,070
If we wait, they'll walk all over us.

68
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,210
Wait, the thing is...

69
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,240
that the matter of who's at fault is a bit unclear.

70
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,850
Hey, where's our rookie?

71
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,479
If you're talking about responsibility,

72
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,120
I clearly said it was mine and was approaching to get it,

73
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,289
but your security guard forcibly stopped me.

74
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,090
Now, I understand that,

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,660
because these fans were shouting, "He's mine,"

76
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,830
he mistook me for one of them. I'll grant you that.

77
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,100
But in all that chaos, what was I supposed to...

78
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,200
I'm really grateful for my fans,

79
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,570
but hearing "he's mine" can be a little suffocating sometimes.

80
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,070
I wonder if she's one of your fans, too?

81
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Or maybe not?

82
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,950
Then she could be one of your fans, Jinny.

83
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,650
That's it, she's one of your fans! Right?

84
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,250
It must've been "Jinny's mine" then. Not "Min Hak's mine."

85
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,190
Gosh, what is wrong with me?

86
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,190

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660

- Gosh, what a mess. - Is this supposed to shut me up?

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Won't that do?

91
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,140
I'm even paying for this out of my own pocket.

92
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,640
Your own pocket? The rookie staffer's own pocket?

93
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,810
Hold on, Yeon San.

94
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,910
As I'm responsible for this space, I can't let this injustice slide.

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,619
Who are you?

96
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,280
I'm the Emergency Chair of the Computer Engineering Department.

97
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,490
- Who's in charge here? - That's you!

98
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,459
- Yes? - You broke someone's property,

99
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,930
and you're making the rookie pay?

100
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,490
I'm not the one who broke it.

101
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,830
So what? Why should the person with the least authority pay for it?

102
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,070
Shouldn't their bosses cover this? That's why they're paid more, right?

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,770
All right, who's the producer here?

104
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,439
We need to get back to filming,

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,810
so let's talk about this after we wrap up.

106
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
For now, could you please step aside?

107
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,180
I'm not moving an inch until someone takes responsibility.

108
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,550
Everyone! Scrum!

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Scrum!

110
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,720
Do you know who that tall, dashing woman over there is?

111
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,189
Her?

112
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,390
She's Kang Dong Won, the CS chair,

113
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,390
Your Majesty.

114
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,430
Her real name is Kang Dong Won.

115
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,660
But her nickname is also "Kang Dong Won from Engineering."

116
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
Interesting.

117
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,500
Kang Dong Won.

118
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,140
Heads of Hair and Makeup, can I have you for a moment?

119
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
Hey, Jinny.

120
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,150
Oh, gosh.

121
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,050
Didn't I tell you to always be careful when you're mic'd?

122
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,290
Sorry. But hey,

123
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,860
I was just wondering what your schedule was like after this.

124
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,260
There's a screening I have to go to in Yongsan.

125
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,830
Director Cha Nook invited me.

126
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,200
What about tomorrow? Are you free tomorrow?

127
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
Just tell me now.

128
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,870
It's just the two of us here.

129
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,410
The thing is...

130
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,250
Min Hak.

131
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,180
I think we need to make a change.

132
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Really?

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,650
That's exactly what I was going to tell you.

134
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,120
- You were? - Yes.

135
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,260
I think it's time for us to take the next step.

136
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,000
Exactly! The next step!

137
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,870
To advance in our careers, we can't afford to be complacent.

138
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,540
We have to look toward the future.

139
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Gosh.

140
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,810
I was a little nervous about this.

141
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,580
But it turns out we're on the same page.

142
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,050
So what should we do?

143
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,990
When should we go public?

144
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,020
Go public? With what?

145
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,790
What?

146
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,430
You said "next step," so I just assumed...

147
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,900
Okay. Keeping it private is fine too.

148
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,800
It would just be a headache for you if people found out anyway.

149
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,210
Min Hak. I was saying we should end things.

150
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
For good.

151
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,680
You and I are just friends.

152
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,180
You're no idol or actor, Min Hak, so you're not even a coworker.

153
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,050
We're just...

154
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,360
someone who was just passing through my life...

155
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,030
Just passing through...

156
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,030
But we kissed...

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,800
That was just a happening.

158
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,970
We're both young and beautiful. Things happen, right?

159
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,710
Maybe if it was once, but three times is...

160
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,740
And what's more, last week we...

161
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,310
No. Look, Min Hak.

162
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,320
Our careers are on shaky ground.

163
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,020
We could vanish and nobody would care.

164
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,590
I'm an actress, and my best credit? Honestly?

165
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,660
It's that "Like Dew" soju commercial.

166
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,200
And you're just a semi-celebrity who started on "Match on Wheels."

167
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,830
Don't you think we both need to take that next step?

168
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
So...

169
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,870
you're saying I'm not your next one.

170
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,310
I'm going to the US this fall.

171
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,380
It's for a streaming original film.

172
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,980
You know my biggest dream, right?

173
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,220
To be bigger than Jung Ho Yeon and make your mark in Hollywood.

174
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,190
Yes, exactly. I want that more than anything.

175
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,830
Not Jinny, the washed-up idol, but Jinny, the global superstar.

176
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,230
That's really awesome.

177
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,670
From our own respective places,

178
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,240
you, right where you are,

179
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,840
and me, right where I am.

180
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,080
Let's each do our absolute best,

181
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,380
and raise our worth, our value,

182
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,950
and then meet again, Min Hak.

183
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,350
Doing our best on our own for now.

184
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,660
What she's saying is so complicated.

185
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,130
And she's using so much English.

186
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,930
Okay, we can't just stand around here all day.

187
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,230
So you two, just settle it with rock-paper-scissors.

188
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,239
- What? - One of you two has to pay for it.

189
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,540
Or just split it fifty-fifty.

190
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,710
Come on. Rock-paper-scissors.

191
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,510
- Go on. - Ready?

192
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,609
If you don't throw, you lose. Rock-paper-scissors!

193
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,650
Wait a minute.

194
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,380
I'll pay for it.

195
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
What? Why would you, Min Hak?

196
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,030
I'm the one who broke the laptop, so I should pay for it.

197
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,300
Are you okay? Don't cry. It's my fault. I'm sorry.

198
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,570
How much do I owe you?

199
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,410
Alright, let's run the numbers, shall we?

200
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,410
You spectacularly wrecked this new 2025 laptop.

201
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,020
With an Intel Core Ultra 200HX CPU and a GeForce RTX 5070 GPU.

202
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,020
Those two components alone are well over 3,000 dollars,

203
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,130
plus three 1-terabyte SSDs in a Super RAID 5 configuration.

204
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,130
Those run 170 dollars a piece, totaling 510 dollars.

205
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,900
Importantly, with data recovery, the grand total is...

206
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,370
Hold on a second.

207
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,800
I need a calculator.

208
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,669
And that amount I just quoted?

209
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,209
That's not even including compensation for my inconvenience...

210
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,380
while the laptop contents are being recovered.

211
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,249
And if the recovery is impossible,

212
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,250
then there's the priceless value, which is incalculable.

213
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,020
- Three hundred thirty times... - Forget it.

214
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,589
Just give me your number.

215
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,790
I'll send you the official estimate,

216
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,160
and you can wire the money right over.

217
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Okay.

218
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,100
Gosh, did you see that? San got Kang Min Hak's number.

219
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,830
- Was that her plan? - Wait!

220
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,799
No. I can't allow that.

221
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,870
I'm his manager, so please talk to me.

222
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,970
As long as someone is responsible, I don't care who.

223
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,080
Here.

224
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,910
This will work, right?

225
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,920
Min Hak, Jinny's team is panicking because we're delayed.

226
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,120
What? Right.

227
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,390
Let's go.

228
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,660
I'll draw up the estimate and will be in contact!

229
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,059
Were you about to give her your number?

230
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,630
Good thing I was there to stop you.

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,529
That's how you get psycho stalkers.

232
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,640
They shout, "He's mine!" Don't you know that?

233
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,970
I don't think she's like that.

234
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,870
Besides,

235
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,280
I have to take responsibility for my own actions.

236
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,210
I know. You're so responsible and naive.

237
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,680
That's why I'm here, to protect you. See?

238
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,150
- I know, and I'm always grateful. - So, did you ask Jinny about it?

239
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
Well...

240
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,360
I didn't get a chance to bring up the drama.

241
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,290
Why not? What were you so busy talking about?

242
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,669
What I mean is that if Jinny recommends you for it,

243
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,930
it's a natural and great opportunity.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
Excuse me, Min Hak?

245
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,640
I didn't get to say a proper hello earlier.

246
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,540
Min Hak, thank you so much.

247
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,280
Don't mention it.

248
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,780
Min Hak, go get your touch-up now. You know where to go, right?

249
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,080
- Right now? - Yes. Go to the hall by the corner.

250
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,850
Excuse me. One second.

251
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,560
You really went through it earlier.

252
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,100
No. I'm grateful to him, but I feel bad.

253
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,030
He's just a genuinely good-hearted person.

254
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,500
But people online twist things and say his head's in the clouds.

255
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,240
Some people just love to trash him.

256
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,909
I'm worried that this whole laptop incident...

257
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,880
will also start a rumor.

258
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,410
Should I post something online to stop those kinds of rumors?

259
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,509
I'll write that he's a total angel, a savior, a prince!

260
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,320
Gosh, you don't have to do all that.

261
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,090
Maybe don't exaggerate quite that much.

262
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,220
Just stick to the facts. Like you said, an angel, a savior...

263
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,419
Could you post that somewhere for us?

264
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,559
- Of course. - Right.

265
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,159
I have a video of what happened.

266
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,060
Should I send you a screenshot?

267
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,170
- Yes, that'd be great. - Yes.

268
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Great.

269
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,639
Isn't this a blessing in disguise?

270
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,080
You might get a new laptop from this.

271
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,580
But she hadn't backed it up.

272
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
Her high school data is on there.

273
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,220
I'm heading to a data recovery center first.

274
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,920
If it weren't for that brainless fool...

275
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,620
Excuse me.

276
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,990
Yes?

277
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,059
Sorry, it's just been bugging me.

278
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,900
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

279
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,070
I don't think so. Like I said, I'm not a fan or...

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,170
Now he's going to say, "Are you Ahn In Dae?" again.

281
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,670
I guess I just have one of those faces.

282
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,810
We have no connection, so please just go on your way.

283
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,580
I'll contact your manager about the repair estimate.

284
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,920
I knew it.

285
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,190
- You're a fan of Jinny's? - What?

286
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,620
I can tell by how indifferent you've been to me.

287
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,620
By the way, good job just now. Making up with those staff members.

288
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,230
What are you talking about?

289
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I don't mean to criticize, but if you're too harsh with staff,

290
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,000
you know, it can make your celebrity look bad.

291
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,700
So on Jinny's behalf, I'd like to thank...

292
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,970
Should I rip his head off?

293
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,840
If you want to film something, I could do a reel with you.

294
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,050
What do you say?

295
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,900
I want to crack his head open and see what's inside.

296
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,899
What could possibly be going on in a head like that?

297
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,140
(Yongsan)

298
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,210
Who knows. But I can't tell if this is even recoverable.

299
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,180
So...

300
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,780
you rushed all the way to Yongsan this late at night for this?

301
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,320
That's why I need you to recover it, no matter what.

302
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,850
I'll have something to share in two weeks.

303
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,050
Two weeks?

304
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,719
It's going to cost you 800 dollars.

305
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,620
But for an extra 200 dollars,

306
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,590
I might be able to get it done a week faster.

307
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,760
That's a lot more than what it said online.

308
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,360
For water damage, I'd charge 300 and call it a day.

309
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,370
But this wasn't water. It was a sugary drink.

310
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,570
What difference does that make?

311
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,499
Your follow-up care was all wrong.

312
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,440
And it's a one-terabyte drive,

313
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,240
which is double the size of most laptops.

314
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,110
Plus, the newer models are a lot trickier to work on.

315
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,120
- I'll pay once it's recovered. - Payment is upfront.

316
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,889
Look, I'm doing the work regardless.

317
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,660
The price is for my labor.

318
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,230
Fine.

319
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,030
It's not like I'm the one who'll be footing the bill anyway.

320
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,130
(Hangang University)

321
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,740
You could've just used a hand double for the laptop shot.

322
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,510
Hey, where's Jinny?

323
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,270
She filmed her part and left two hours ago.

324
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,840
It wasn't even a cameo.

325
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,180
Said she had to go to a screening.

326
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,180
So you were stuck waiting forever for no reason.

327
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,520
I'm fine.

328
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,750
We didn't have anything scheduled afterwards anyway.

329
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,420
You're too nice for your own good.

330
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,520
Let's go. You're heading home, right?

331
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,330
It's about the laptop from earlier. I've taken it in for repairs.

332
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,670
I'll let you know as soon as I get the estimate.

333
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,040
Hey, I'm going to go meet up with a friend real quick.

334
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,240
A friend? All of a sudden? Who?

335
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,610
- Do Not Answer. - Well...

336
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,180
- Min Hak. - Yes?

337
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,350
Look, I don't care who you meet.

338
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,820
Stay out of trouble, and we're good.

339
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,790
You get me? I'm trusting you.

340
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,160
Thanks.

341
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,760
I'll drop you off.

342
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,590
Seriously? You won't pick up?

343
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
These jerks must be on social media.

344
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,130
Let's see, his handle is...

345
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,530
What a pain.

346
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,740
I swore to never use SNS again, but I guess I'll have to send a DM.

347
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,540
What the heck?

348
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,180
Kang Min Hak bought a pricey laptop to cover for a staffer's mistake.

349
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,879
I heard there was an ad shoot on campus, so I went to watch.

350
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,250
Jinny and Kang Min Hak are stunning.

351
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,890
A laptop got snapped in half. A staffer confused it with a prop.

352
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,619
The laptop owner made a huge scene.

353
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,960
He said the staffer wasn't at fault, but his own.

354
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,490
- He's an angel, a savior, a prince. - A prince.

355
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,560
So he breaks my laptop, ghosts me, and now he gets to be the hero?

356
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,240
(Yongsan Electronics Market, Sinyongsan Station)

357
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,370
It's so chaotic. Darn it.

358
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,350
My Tuna.

359
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,110
How much did you drink?

360
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,750
What took you so long? I was dying to see you.

361
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,720
Sorry. Let's go.

362
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,190
Gosh! You're drunk. Let's go.

363
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,990
Come on. Let's go.

364
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,960
No, I don't want to go. Let's just stay a little longer.

365
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,230
Cheers!

366
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,700
Let's stay a little longer.

367
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,140
You like the student council more than me, don't you?

368
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,870
- Come on, let's go. - Go where? You're so mean.

369
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,310
Come on, guys. Aren't you bored?

370
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,410
It's been forever since my last blind date.

371
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,049
Let's liven things up! Okay, "Timing Game"! One!

372
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,079
- Two! - Three!

373
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,120
- Four! - Five!

374
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,020
- Drink up! - I'll be your Black Knight.

375
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,860
- Come on. - What's this?

376
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,260
Come on. Seriously?

377
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,329
- Timing Game! One! - Two!

378
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,430
- Three! -Three!

379
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,300
Okay!

380
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,630
Drink up.

381
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,570
- Hey. - Drink up.

382
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,930
- Let me get this one. I'm serious. - Come on.

383
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,940
- Oh, boy. - Unbelievable.

384
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,370
He can't even handle his liquor.

385
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,940
I mean, come on.

386
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,510
Gosh, look at him go.

387
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,280
You can really hold your liquor.

388
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm sending you that repair bill as soon as I can, no matter how.

389
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,990
That darn Kang Min Hak!

390
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,160
If this is just a simulation, may its developer be cursed too.

391
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,510
This is nice.

392
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,350
If someone breaks up with you and then calls you at night,

393
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,480
you're supposed to just ignore them.

394
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,620
Even if they're drunk, begging you to come over,

395
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,160
just turn off your phone.

396
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
How could I do that?

397
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,190
What if the next day I pretended I didn't remember anything...

398
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,890
and say I never asked you to come over?

399
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,930
Then I'd just think, "I guess she didn't call me."

400
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,370
Why bother? Why go to all that trouble for me?

401
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,910
You're so sweet, Min Hak.

402
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
You're not like your dad.

403
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,420
You could never be like him.

404
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,890
Never ever.

405
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,290
You should get some sleep, Jinny.

406
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,970
You're so cute. My Min Hak.

407
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,910
Focus on me.

408
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,180
But your phone's ringing.

409
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,020
Hello?

410
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,450
Really?

411
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,450
So who's there?

412
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,430
I don't think I know them.

413
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,600
I'll call you back.

414
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,640
Hey, I think I have to go.

415
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,810
Apparently, Amy says the directors...

416
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,380
and the foreign guests are waiting for me.

417
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,180
But I haven't even finished watching the movie.

418
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,810
What should I do?

419
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,220
You should go, then.

420
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,950
Sorry.

421
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
Want to rest here for a bit?

422
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,650
I'm okay.

423
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,520
Jinny, you reek of alcohol.

424
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,160
I'll head out first,

425
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,160
so you can take your time getting ready.

426
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,930
Okay.

427
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,440
That kid's head is in the clouds, and that manager's a total scammer.

428
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,810
I'll just use my anonymous account to bring justice down on you two.

429
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,480
But I'll be reasonable about it.

430
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,050
"Awaiting response for laptop cost."

431
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,650
Darn it. This battery issue again...

432
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,860
Excuse me.

433
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,430
What are the odds of this encounter?

434
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,869
Is the creator of this game...

435
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,970
just a developer who is obsessed with encounters?

436
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Freeze!

437
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,910
Hey, wait, hold on!

438
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,620
Hey, you! Look at this!

439
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,790
How can you just walk away like that...

440
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,820
What am I supposed to do if...

441
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,140
I knew you wouldn't just let me walk away.

442
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,850
Hey, let go of me.

443
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,250
What are you doing? Let go.

444
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,620
Why?

445
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,460
Hey, I said let go! How dare you just grab and hug me?

446
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,160
I'm sorry. The noise cancellation on my headphones works so well...

447
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,000
- You're the girl from before. - Yes. The one from...

448
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,640
- You were really an obsessive fan? - An obsessive fan?

449
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,470
So this is what it's like. They just follow you all day.

450
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,340
Seriously?

451
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,809
As I told you before,

452
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,379
being like this won't help your celebrity.

453
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,320
If you truly care about someone,

454
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,949
you need to know when to let go. Got it?

455
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,149
Let go of what?

456
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,690
Why don't you let go of some cash for my laptop?

457
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,620
What's her problem?

458
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,630
Gosh.

459
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,160
Hey, where are you going?

460
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,900
Who's a fan of who? You think the world's your fan club?

461
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,029
I wish that weren't the case,

462
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,500
but we keep running into each other, day and night.

463
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,039
On top of that, it's from Gyeonggi Province to Yongsan.

464
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,070
And before that, too.

465
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,739
We've seen each other around before. Right?

466
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,410
The reason you think you've seen me is because you have!

467
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,349
We're in the same department!

468
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,680
That ridiculously named...

469
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,260
Converged Physical Technology and Global Content Development major!

470
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,930
We keep meeting on our small, and now even smaller, campus.

471
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,689
Do you even remember the laptop you broke today?

472
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,259
You bent it, poured soda over it,

473
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,369
and tried drying it with a hairdryer!

474
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,999
I need it for my job, my schoolwork, and a competition,

475
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,270
which is why I came to the electronics mecca,

476
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,969
all the way to Yongsan!

477
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,340
And what? A fan? An obsessive fan?

478
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,210
So it's okay to just grab and hug any fan you see?

479
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,880
Now I get it. I completely misunderstood.

480
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,510
You're just figuring that out now?

481
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,780
It's kind of a long story.

482
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,550
So why isn't your manager picking up his phone?

483
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,489
I had no idea he wasn't picking up. I'm sorry.

484
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,300
But I really have to go now, so if you give me your number...

485
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
I don't trust you anymore.

486
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,669
Yes, that's fair.

487
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,969
Then if you give me your phone, I'll put my number in for you.

488
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,100
My battery's dead.

489
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Dead...

490
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,940
Then do you have any paper?

491
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,820
I promise I'll contact you.

492
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,030
My repair estimate!

493
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,340
Hey, the numbers are all smudged! Hey, stop!

494
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,470
Wait a second!

495
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,410
Get out of the way!

496
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
What do you think you're doing?

497
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,050
I couldn't just let you get hurt.

498
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
Right. And for a second...

499
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,870
- Someone call for a ride? - I didn't!

500
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,740
Well, you were shouting "Stop," so I thought...

501
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,540
Anyone here going to Gangnam?

502
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,220
- Coming through. - Yes, go ahead.

503
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,920
The group blind date today totally bombed.

504
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,090
Is a bad date supposed to be news?

505
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,590
When my day...

506
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,359
Gosh, I always think my dry spell would end...

507
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,500
at the start of every semester.

508
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,440
These guys won't even reply to me.

509
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,240
Darn it...

510
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,040
And look at me, just watching dramas about guys falling in love.

511
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,950
Okay. Now, less bicep, more trap.

512
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,480
Yes, those traps are looking tasty. Let's feed them.

513
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,490
That's it.

514
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,390
Hey, you!

515
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,829
You know these walls are paper-thin.

516
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,830
What was that about something tasty?

517
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,100
Sorry. My personal training session was scheduled for tonight.

518
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,530
No, wait, what? Who does personal training at home?

519
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,800
You seem to go to our school. Let's try to be more considerate.

520
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,070
Okay. I'm sorry. We'll be quiet now.

521
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,210
Come on.

522
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,180
All right, push it all the way up!

523
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,340
Okay. All right, feel the burn.

524
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,850
Okay.

525
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,480
Oh, that's good.

526
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,750
I need to de-stress.

527
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,690
Should I watch "The Demon Slayer" that Finnish drama?

528
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,890
No. Lego ASMR.

529
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,090
Or maybe I should just get to work first?

530
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,600
There are thousands of reasons why a bug might occur.

531
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,940
You might have missed a use case or used the wrong formula.

532
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,540
Why would they send me this?

533
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,580
I'm telling you, it's not a hardware problem.

534
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,450
Or you went outside the memory area allocated for the program,

535
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,720
applied the wrong operation to the data,

536
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,720
or you failed to check if the user input was valid.

(Park Chang Yi)

538
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,030
San, long time no see.

539
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,210
Or, like the moth that flew into Grace Hopper's computer,

540
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,810
it's because something got in that shouldn't have.

541
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,890
What are you doing here?

542
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,730
I came here to apologize.

543
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,200
How did you know where I live?

544
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,630
The dean told me.

545
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,370
Is he even allowed to do that?

546
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,540
I'm a little wet from the rain. Mind if I take this off?

547
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,540
Yes, I do mind.

548
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,940
Darn it.

549
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,020
Joo Yeon San.

550
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,060
Why aren't you answering me?

551
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
What?

552
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,800
What's Python?

553
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,240
- What? - This.

554
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
It's a programming language.

555
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,580
A language?

556
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,550
It's more dynamic and concise than other languages.

557
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,190
And it's highly readable.

558
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,820
So it's great for everyone, from beginners to experts.

559
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,160
So even beginners can use it?

560
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,430
And it's dynamic?

561
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,670
Concise doesn't necessarily mean easy.

562
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,970
But it's compatible with a lot of different operating systems.

563
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,240
So they can connect with each other?

564
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,350
Like us?

565
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,090
Even though we're different?

566
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,130
Which is why it's highly scalable.

567
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,670
Can I kiss you?

568
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Did you hear me?

569
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,680
Processing.

(Python Hacking Program)

571
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,740
Should I put it in now?

572
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,110
No, not yet. It's just...

573
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,420
Gosh, this is definitely rated R.

574
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:43,449
- Wait. This is too racy! - What?

575
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,890
- Is this okay? - I mean, can we even air this?

576
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,290
What is this?

577
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,390
It's something you like.

578
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:50,930
I'm putting it in.

579
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,500
Here it goes.

580
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,970
I know you like it.

581
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,270
I'm putting it in, okay?

582
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,400
- He's putting it in! He's doing it! - What in the world...

583
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,410
Gosh. It's fizzing up.

584
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,810
Gosh, it's really fizzing up!

585
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,410
- Gosh, look at all those bubbles! - It's a bubble party!

586
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,110
They're clothed, flirting in a tub, so why is my heart fluttering?

587
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,050
He's really going all out. This is insane.

588
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,750
- Wait, isn't this getting racy? - Are you okay with this?

589
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,349
- Oh my gosh. - It's cute.

590
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,660
Isn't this a little too much?

591
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,389
No, it's not. He's leading so well...

592
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,429
- to ensure she's comfortable. - What?

593
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,660
Why would I have a dream like that?

594
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,130
Okay. It's been a long week,

595
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,100
and I'm only human, a creature of flesh, blood, and passion.

596
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,309
Meeting him in person, the video's audio,

597
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,170
and the memory of that darn encounter in Yongsan...

598
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,580
All these inputs were simply reflected in my dream...

599
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,909
and supposedly prove the app's theory which is...

600
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,180
a load of bull!
