For raw fish, add sesame oil and plum extract to spicy bean paste.

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,360
We tried to contact you many times and you just left us on read.

12
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,600
You only crawl out of your cave for a test. Yeon San, that hurts.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,530
We were so worried about you.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Why?

15
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,770
How could we not be worried? And you won't believe what happened.

16
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,010
Kang Min Hak was wondering if he should show you something.

17
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,080
- He had an article on masturbation. - What?

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,920
It had stats on how many women use dildos and stuff.

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,420
He thought seeing the data would make you feel better.

20
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,990
Kang Min Hak did?

21
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,760
Seems like he gets you pretty well, doesn't he, Yeon San?

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,560
He feels like he played a part in this whole mess, too.

23
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,460
There's that guy spamming Everytime with posts shipping you and Min Hak.

24
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,530
The guy who can't spell?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You saw those, too?

26
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,600
Min Hak was furious seeing them. He saved hate comments as PDFs.

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,870
Said he was going to either sue them or confront the Everytime office.

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,740
He's surprisingly intense, isn't he?

29
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,940
Anyway, we didn't catch the psycho. But if you decide to sue,

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,650
I bet he'd actually set you up with a lawyer.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,680
Where did Kang Min Hak go? He was right here with us.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,220
Wait. You're right.

33
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,020
He's probably keeping his distance from you.

34
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,690
People were starting to talk about you two always being together,

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,090
so I told him to give you some space.

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,690
He's surprisingly sweet, you know?

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,770
The exam is today, and he's looking for an exam file now?

38
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,570
And you said you'd sell it to him?

39
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,610
I'm a genius. I got double. How about lunch is on me today?

40
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,170

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,130
You think it's the same person as Yeon San's troll?

51
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,270
It's highly likely.

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,340
Do you need the file for Professor Eum Nan Sae's class?

53
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,240
(Anonymous: Yes, but I thought you said it was randomized.)

54
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,080

What do you mean, "carrying?"

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,160
- Let's go. - Wait! The most important thing.

61
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,560

With pathetic creeps like that, when the person they're intimidating...

69
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,560
just turns around and flaunts their desires for everyone to see,

70

- Yes. - Oh? I think we're mutuals.

78

85

So, twenty bucks, right?

86
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,240

Yes. Are you in that class too?

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,510
So I was wrong to assume he was in our department.

89
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,850
Which means he got the video from his girlfriend originally.

For the record, I have zero interest in any of you.

108
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,170
You're making this way too hard. If innocent, show me your gallery.

109
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,680
That's because I'm not obligated to show you my phone.

110

We've met once before, haven't we?

113
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,190
Show me your phone. If I'm wrong, I'll apologise.

114
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,430
Why should I show you my phone? You have no right to see it.

- Give it here! Give me the phone! - Hey! Grab his phone!

118
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,770
Hey, hey! The phone!

119
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,770
Oh, Yeon San!

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Are you okay?

121
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,060
- Hey! - Hey! Joo Yeon San, are you okay?

122
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,200
- Are you okay? Are you hurt? - The phone!

123
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,130
What the?

124
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,430

Gosh, my head!

126
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,250
- Get the phone! Get it, get it! - Yes! That's it!

127
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,250
- The phone! - That's it, that's it!

129
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,840
He took all these and played innocent.

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,470
So the Hangang University Spycam Guy was right here all along.

131
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,270
- Hey, that! - Give it back!

132
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,180
- Hey, record this, record this! - Yes, he made the Everytime posts.

133
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,510
Hey, give it back! You can't just go through my phone.

134
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,320
All right, evidence secured.

135
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,020
We can't just handle this ourselves.

136
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,590
- Hey, guys! Help me! Help me! - Gosh.

137
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,850
Are you okay?

138
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
- I'm fine. - Let's go, let's go!

139
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,090
- I knew it! - Just a second, wait, wait!

Unbelievable!

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,330
- We're going to the admin office. - Wait!

142
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
He's out of his mind.

143
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,040
Honey! It's not what you think!

144
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,510
- Hey, be quiet! - Honey!

145
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Excuse us.

146
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,080
I'll hand out the exams right on the hour.

147
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,660

168
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,360

175
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,010
(10 Minutes Earlier)

176
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Why'd you do it?

177
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,730
- Was that the guy in the Cat Mask? - Why did you do that to Yeon San?

178
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,730
Hey, you of all people should know how horrible it is...

179
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,360
to have everyone talking about you like that.

180
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,230
What did Joo Yeon San ever do to you?

181
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,400
- Why are you harassing her? - Joo Yeon San?

182
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,270
I couldn't care less about Joo Yeon San.

183
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,780
- What? - It's not about her. I hate you.

184
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,810
Honestly, you're not that special.

185
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,510
You just got your one lucky break on TV.

186
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,780
I couldn't stand it, so I wanted to take you down a notch.

187
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,890
But in the end, people kept saying how cool you are and all that,

188
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,350
they just kept hyping you up.

189
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
If you think about it, I made you go viral in the end.

190
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,790
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

191
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,930
Sure, that Dildo Girl got hurt in all this,

192
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,700
but honestly, that's on you.

193
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,830
If she hadn't gotten mixed up with you,

194
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,730
this never would have blown up like it did.

195
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,370
There's a flaw in that logic.

196
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,240
First, the video didn't go viral just because of him.

197
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,550
A dildo flying across a classroom is pretty shocking on its own.

198
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,450
And even if he did post that because of you,

199
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,090
it was because of his own pathetic inferiority complex.

200
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,050
It's not like you're the one to blame.

201
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,660
She's right. Stop blaming yourself. That must have been so upsetting.

202
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,930
And you can stop avoiding Joo Yeon San now.

203
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,730
But still...

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,730
Hey, we didn't even get to thank that Cat Mask person, did we?

205
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,270
You're right. They did everything, and they just disappeared.

206
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,440
That was a prop from the Theatre and Film Department, right?

207
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,540
The Theatre and Film kids definitely have style.

208
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,010
They know how to make an entrance and exit.

209
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,510
So, should we bring them some snacks or something to say thanks?

210
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,390
So, how's our competition project coming along?

211
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,790
Haven't you checked GitHub?

212
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,990
I did, but there was nothing on it.

213
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,290
Yes, that's pretty much where we're at.

214
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,930
What?

215
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,630
(A Few Days Later)

216
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,830
Next.

217
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,470
Next.

218
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,450
Next.

219
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Next.

220
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,630
Next.

221
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,670
Next.

222
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,280
- Darn, dude, that's sick. - What?

223
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,710
Next.

224
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,620
- Next. - Hey, you been working out?

225
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Next!

226
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Next!

227
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,380
Wow, great job!

228
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
What was that for?

229
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,820
Come on, what?

230
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,890
Don't do that. Girls will get the wrong idea.

231
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,090
Next.

232
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
But...

233
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,260
Why are you whispering?

234
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,760
- I didn't mean to, but you know? - Next.

235
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,270
I saw it all, you know?

236
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,640
I have Queer friends, so I totally get it.

237
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,340
It's fine. You can say it. Almost everyone knows anyway.

238
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,040
- What? - Next.

239
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,280
But what were you confused about?

240
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,820
What wrong idea did you get?

241
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,290
When I did this,

242
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,220
you said it was confusing, right?

243
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Next.

244
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,759
This school is making it impossible for me to focus on my studies.

245
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Seriously.

246
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,500
- Go away. No, wait. I'll move. - Next.

247
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,210
Hey, why are you coming up again?

248
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,240
Dong Won, can I talk to you for a second?

249
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,380
I had to check the product details, so I contacted the factory.

250
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,720
But the supply price the factory quoted...

251
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,820
was different from what our varsity jacket supplier charged us.

252
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,860
By how much?

253
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
Look.

254
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,290
See, the difference per jacket isn't much.

255
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,830
But considering our sales volume, it's not a small sum at all.

256
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,130
So you're saying they skimmed this much off the top?

257
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,470
There was another company that offered a lower price,

258
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,870
but the modelling students pushed for us to go with this one.

259
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,840
So maybe the modelling students knew this company was padding the price?

260
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,710
Leading the charge was Im Yoo Ri, the Emergency Committee Chairman.

261
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,790
They said they'd make good jackets since we're juniors, I trusted them.

262
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,330
For now, I'll contact the alum and ensure we get a proper apology.

263
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,970
The company says the extra cash went to the Modelling Dept.'s party,

264
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,330
and that it should all be square.

265
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,470
If that's the case, it'll blow up when we reveal the council's budget.

266
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,010
In that case, I'll process refunds for all students who bought them.

267
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,510
Do we really have to go as far as giving refunds?

268
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,650
It's only a few bucks per person,

269
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,050
It's a pain to contact everyone. Why not use it for contingencies?

270
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,050
The school is already itching for an excuse to...

271
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,550
shut us up for opposing the merger.

272
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,760
Our standing is at risk over this, and the Committee may be dissolved.

273
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,960
I was being complacent.

274
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,900
I'll issue the refunds immediately, even if it takes me all night.

275
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,030
I'll take full responsibility for everything and resign.

276
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,540
That way, the entire Committee won't be targeted.

277
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,440
Simply resigning won't solve this.

278
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,610
We have way too much to do right now.

279
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,110
We worked hard for those interviews with Sisa-IN and O-mai.

280
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,410
I'll leave it to you, Vice-Chair.

281
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,550
The Excel file for this is on the drive, right?

282
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,120
I'm truly sorry.

283
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,060
I know it's late, but I'll make it right.

284
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,790
I'll do my part, even if I have to learn Excel...

285
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,670
All right, exams are over. And all the food is ready.

286
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,670
But we still haven't picked an idea for the competition.

287
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,940
- We're screwed. - Let's go with Min Hak's idea.

288
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Really?

289
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,980
But it's super hard.

290
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,650
So we'll have a better chance of winning the competition, right?

291
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,390
Exactly. The app's name. The Alarm That Tells You You're Breaking Up.

292
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,820
How about Heartbreak Alarm?

293
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,100
- Good. - Or how about Split Alarm?

294
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,530
Split Alarm. An alarm that tells you you're splitting up.

295
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,370
No.

296
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,240
So you never have to lose someone you care about,

297
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,670
it's an alarm that helps you realise what's wrong before it's too late.

298
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,280
- That's more touching. I like it. - Yes, I'm in.

299
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,349
So we're making an app that detects breakup signs...

300
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,250
through conversations and then warns the user.

301
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,290
So we need to prepare the conversation dataset first.

302
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,730
Here comes the grunt work.

303
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,260
- What should I do? - You?

304
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,830
We're going to be labelling the data we can use based on emotion.

305
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,300
Like if it's positive, negative, neutral, or ambiguous.

306
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,570
There's no dataset that meets our criteria,

307
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,280
having to do all of this manually is what's going to be a pain.

308
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,450
How long do you think it'll take? If the four of us split the work...

309
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
A day?

310
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,990
A day?

311
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,390
A day by myself?

312
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,730
But in reality, when people hear the same words,

313
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,930
they often interpret them completely differently, you know?

314
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,700
So we'll split into pairs to label the same data,

315
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,370
and then combine them. I think that's how we'll improve accuracy.

316
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,410
Then the two of us will pair up, and you two can do the same.

317
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,040
If you're not sure about something, ask Yeon San.

318
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240

00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,450

Don't drink too much.

325
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,000
- I got it. - I'll process your refund now.

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,910
- I love you, too. - Yes, I'm so sorry.

(Real-Life Couple Jinny and Timothy May Co-star in New Film)

331
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,820
It says Jinny and Timothy might star in a movie together.

332
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,560
It ruins the immersion for me when a real couple is in a romance.

333
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,690
Where did that come from?

334
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,370
I guess Jinny just has a cameo.

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
There's that.

347
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,500
- Hello. - Pulling an all-nighter?

348
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
We'll see.

349
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,610
All right, then. Here.

350
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,110
Name, student ID.

351
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,459
This is a committee expense anyway.

352
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,790
It was paid for with committee funds.

353
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,060
For Excel formulas, check out The Engineering Ladies on YouTube.

354
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,500
Their explanations are really clear.

355
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,900
- Looks delicious. - Looks delicious.

356
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,070
11 O'clock. Good choice. That one's got two pepperonis.

357
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,810
Wait a second.

358
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,610
I think we should add time information to our data.

359
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,910
Time data?

360
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,920
Contact frequency and the intervals are very important data, you know?

361
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,020
That's true. We totally missed that.

362
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,120
For example, think about people who are cheating.

363
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,890
You know how they say cheaters actually act sweeter to cover it up?

364
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
So the message reply would be positive.

365
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,260
But the frequency would be lower than before.

366
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,470
Definitely lower than it was before.

367
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,270
Or...

368
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,040
they could get even more attentive to make up for it.

369
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,880
- Exactly. - Is Jinny cheating on him?

370
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,980
- Have some. It's good. - Okay.

371
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,250
(Lounge)

372
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,650
Why did my hair tie have to snap right now?

373
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,620
Hey, where are you guys going?

374
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,630
We're all done.

375
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,630
- What? Already? - Yes. How about you? Got much left?

376
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,100
I'm finished with my part.

377
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,270
I'd love to stay and help, but I can't.

378
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,200
I have a really important package waiting at home.

379
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,240
The limited-edition book I splurged on is...

380
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,040
Same here. Judging by all the calls I'm getting,

381
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,710
Lee Soo Min must be totally pissed.

382
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,050
If you have a lot left, just head home and finish tomorrow.

383
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,210
But I really need to get this all done today...

384
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,080
Let's split what's left. I'll help you.

385
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,890
No, it's okay. I can handle it myself.

386
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,690
Just go home and do it tomorrow. Min Hak, you kept getting calls too.

387
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,920
Don't you have somewhere to be?

388
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,460
It's not really plans, just a personal thing, but...

389
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,200
- Are you sure you'll be okay alone? - Yes.

390
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,170
Actually, no.

391
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,470
Kang Min Hak, don't go.

392
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,910
What's this?

393
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,010
Come to think of it, we're a team, and we were filming Reels earlier...

394
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,810
and watching YouTube. We goofed off a lot, you know.

395
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,850
She tells me not to mess around, and she's just staring at Min Hak.

396
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,190
True. Yeon San did take on way too much to begin with.

397
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,890
All right, we're heading out then.

398
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,330
Later.

399
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,100
(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

400
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,710
Okay, then.

401
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,450
I'll do the other half, starting from here.

402
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,130
- Some music? - Some music?

403
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,670
- Jinx. - What?

404
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,470
Hold on a second.

405
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,850
Never mind, Kang Min Hak. You should go.

406
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,150
What?

407
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,490
How are you going to finish all this by yourself?

408
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,900
You said you had plans, right? Sorry, I shouldn't have kept you.

409
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,030
Don't worry about it.

410
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,400
We're a team. We should see it through together.

411
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,010
But are you okay?

412
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,620
What? Me? What about me?

413
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
About Hun Gyu?

414
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,620
That's part of it.

415
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,030
What about you? Are you okay?

416
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,870
I'm...

417
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,600
not fine. Just today, I accidentally...

418
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,440
stumbled upon my video five times. I guess it's the algorithm.

419
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,470
Another item for my embarrassing past after the Quiz King thing.

420
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,080
But the comments that guy, Hun Gyu, posted on Everytime,

421
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,090
and the videos are all completely gone.

422
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,590
It's all thanks to you.

423
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,660
People will move on soon enough.

424
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,170
Yeon San, in that case...

425
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
this...

426
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,110
I've never shown this to anyone, but...

427
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,780
but can you record me just this once?

428
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,250
What?

429
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,610
Just record.

430
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,220
I'm getting nervous.

431
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,490
Yo

432
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,700
Age ten, My father disappeared

433
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,070
Leavin' nothin' but this handsome face

434
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,570
My grandpa said

435
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,010
"Don't you be like your father!"

436
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,180
I pray every single day

437
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,210
I'm gonna be a better man than my father

438
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,520
Amen

439
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,920
- So, what do you think? - What?

440
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,530
- I don't know. - I wanted to be on "Take My Money."

441
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,500
I practised so hard to get on that show,

442
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,370
but my brother said he'd kill me if I did.

443
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,200
So I never got to.

444
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
But now, with this...

445
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,310
If I post this, don't you think it'll go viral?

446
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,840
No, don't do it.

447
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,880
Why? Is it too lame?

448
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,640
I prepared another one, just in case.

449
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,580
That's enough. Just don't do anything.

450
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,910
Okay.

451
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,550
I get it.

452
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,290
- Can I come in? - Yeah, come on in.

453
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,190
- Yo - Just come and sit.

454
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,600
You really...

455
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,670
made the right call becoming a model.

456
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,770
You think so?

457
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,180
I'm here. I'll go ahead and order, okay?

458
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,290
Okay, I'll be right there.

459
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,790
I have a thing for women in engineering.

460
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,220
The problem is liking them so much you get greedy.

461
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,740
What the...

462
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,910
What the... In front of my place again?

463
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,380
The drama is just insane.

464
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,750
Jeez.

465
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,520
I loved you, you son of a gun.

466
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,360
Go on.

467
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,960
Until you get it all out of your system.

468
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,910
Hey. Hey!

469
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,610
Oh my gosh, you're bleeding!

470
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,780
Shouldn't you go to the hospital? We have to!

471
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,010
No. We have to call the police first.

472
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,280
No, it's fine.

473
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,680
It was all my fault.

474
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,490
Are you okay? Can you walk?

475
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,960
Come on, I'll patch you up.

476
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,590
Oh, man. What a mess.

477
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,960
Your place is cleaner than I expected, Na Rae.

478
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,830
"Cleaner than you expected?" What's that supposed to mean?

479
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,770
(Ointment)

480
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,200
- Here. - Thanks.

481
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,140
You guys really have some fiery breakups.

482
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,620
Gosh.

483
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,990
That hurts.

484
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,930
Don't you have any Band-Aids?

485
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,830
The convenience store has them. You can go now.

486
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,500
I have to get ready for the Competition,

487
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,670
and I have homework. I've got a lot on my plate.

488
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,370
- Am I bothering you? - A little.

489
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,110
Right.

490
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,740
- "Dirty Switch?" - What?

491
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,010
Hey, look at this.

492
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,420
"My Brother's Boyfriend?" You're so busy with all your reading, Na Rae.

493
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,420
Get out. Go on, get out. Go!

494
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,190
But wait.

495
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,990
I just got dumped.

496
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,290
Aren't you going to buy me a drink?

497
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,930
Maybe...

498
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,130
Just one drink?

499
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,730
Deal. Since you have a lot on your plate.

500
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,580
All done.

501
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Sorry.

502
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,910
I must have dozed off.

503
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,140
It's okay. I'm all done too. Let's head home.

504
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay.

505
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Thanks for your help.

506
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,630
Not at all.

507
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,760
Analysing the dialogue was actually pretty fun.

508
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,400
"Is this a positive sign or a negative one?"

509
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,910
"Did they lose interest, or are they playing hard to get?"

510
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,580
"Is it the end, or a new beginning?"

511
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,350
When it was my own situation, it was just so hard.

512
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,180
There was this thing I was struggling with,

513
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,450
but when I pretended it was someone else's conversation,

514
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,620
it all became crystal clear.

515
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,030
What the problem was, and where it all went wrong.

(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

517
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,170
Anyway, for me... I'm just saying it was a huge help.

518
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,140
It's getting late. Let's go.

519
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,910
So, did you find your answer?

520
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,690
Yes.

521
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,520
It's become crystal clear.

522
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,140
I didn't come to campus for my midterms.

523
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,810
I came here for you. Because I was worried about you.

524
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,450
Me?

525
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
Why?

526
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,920
Good question. I've been wondering that myself.

527
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,690
Normally, I should hate your guts.

528
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,600
I'm supposed to hate having anything to do with you.

529
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,270
You say you've found your answer, but the more I talk to you,

530
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,170
the more confused I get.

531
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,170
It's like I'm getting lost in a thick fog.

532
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,610
And all these thoughts about you are using up my brain's bandwidth...

533
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:24,350
that my head's about to explode, and I need to do something about it.

534
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,550
So I want to just delete everything,

535
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,690
but another part of me wants to fill it up even more.

536
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,720
I don't even know what I'm saying right now.

537
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,760
I'm not making sense to you, am I?

538
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,530
Yes.

539
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,370
I'm not sure what you're saying, but...

540
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,510
Bonus points for brevity.

541
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
What?

542
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,650
The simplest answer...

543
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,580
is the best one.

544
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,060
Want to kiss?

545
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Problem solved?

546
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,549
(Your PC has a problem and needs to restart.)

547
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,210
(We're collecting error info and will restart.)

548
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
No.

549
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:23,000
(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

550
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,340
(Hangang University)

551
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,479
What does it mean if you kiss someone...

552
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,280
and they don't call you tomorrow?

553
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,250
What? What's with you?

554
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
What's her deal?

555
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:53,360
On the last exam, two students gave very interesting answers.

556
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,230
How should I put this? Completely different,

557
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,329
yet they gave the exact same answer.

558
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,570
It's like two different algorithms...

559
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,070
produced the same result. Joo Yeon San.

560
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,980
And Kang Min Hak.

561
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,190
What's this?

562
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,760
What in the world is this?

563
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,830
What's with this shift between those two who used to hate each other?

564
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,890
What's going on here?
