1
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,500
"Explore with the Note"

2
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,980
"Episode 4"

3
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
Oh, right.

4
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,209
The coffin is supposed
to be placed in the back hall.

5
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,501
Why did they put the coffin
inside the side hall?

6
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,751
And it's even urn-shaped.

7
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,167
Urn burials are performed
during the Warring States period.

8
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:27,667
Don't tell me this tomb...

9
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:29,626
...isn't from the Ming dynasty.

10
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,667
The tomb of Lord Shang?

11
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,584
The tomb of Lord Shang...

12
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,160
...was built in
the Warring States period.

13
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,500
Both these tombs...

14
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,918
...have snake-browed copper fish.

15
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,501
Then, how are these two...

16
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,667
...related to each other?

17
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:05,999
It's here.

18
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:12,000
The drawings here...

19
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,709
...depict some officials
monitoring the construction.

20
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,083
What kind of construction is it?

21
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:27,959
These clothes they're wearing
are obviously from the Ming dynasty.

22
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,250
So, is this tomb from the Ming dynasty...

23
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,667
...or the Warring States period?

24
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,000
Poker Face.

25
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,079
Fatty!

26
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:18,791
Are you okay, Poker Face?

27
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,000
You only have him inside your eyes.

28
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you okay, Bro?

29
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,010
I'm fine.

30
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,410
I was an unloved child.

31
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,876
I was raised by my stepmother.

32
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,180
What happened to your arm?

33
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,280
I'm fine.

34
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,375
It's just a drought demon.

35
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,626
What? That Frankenstein
is a drought demon?

36
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,660
Drought demon?

37
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,090
The Book of Odes did say...

38
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,994
"The drought demon striketh,
til the fields flareth so."

39
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:42,080
I thought it's just a legend.

40
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,334
To think it really exists.

41
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,918
Some people say that she's a demon...

42
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,375
...who can inflict severe droughts.

43
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,810
Some say it's the result of a corpse...

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,083
...being embalmed in
a life force coffin for a long time.

45
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,292
Seeing this monster...

46
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,626
...has really opened my eyes.

47
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:54,584
By the way, Mutey.

48
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,792
Why don't we just, well,

49
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,160
let her have a taste of our ammunition?

50
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:03,466
If we cut of her head,

51
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,700
we can kill her.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,459
But if she's killed,

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,867
large amounts of ptomaine gas...

54
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:08,901
...will be released.

55
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,542
We don't have much air here.

56
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,910
It's not worth it.

57
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:13,876
The ground just moved again, yeah?

58
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,180
Oh, right.

59
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,580
We've conjectured that there's
an elevator-like mechanism here,

60
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,600
but that seems to be wrong.

61
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:25,542
I-It's good that you know
it's wrong, my comrade.

62
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,700
So, you should...

63
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
...rack your brains again.

64
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,980
Are you all right?

65
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,540
I'm fine.

66
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:42,930
The drawings on the jar
show the tomb's owner...

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,292
...monitoring a construction.

68
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,380
Look at this.

69
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,334
The clothes are of the early Ming dynasty.

70
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:49,330
The low hat...

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,440
...and the narrow sleeves...

72
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,556
...means the tomb's owner...

73
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:53,000
...is most likely royalty or nobility.

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,040
Perhaps...

75
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,626
...he was an architect...

76
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,834
...with a high social standing.

77
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,209
He's also an expert in
feng shui and trickery.

78
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,459
Only this can explain...

79
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,876
...how he got the resources
to build an underwater tomb.

80
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,417
Plus, only a person like him...

81
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:07,334
...can set up so many tricks...

82
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,918
...inside his own tomb.

83
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,250
My dear comrade.

84
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,459
You've been a free tour guide for us,

85
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,409
and now you're providing us
the tomb owner's information.

86
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:16,690
You're really a selfless comrade.

87
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,490
It's a pity that you're not an antique,

88
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,370
and if I could sell you for
a pile of cold, hard cash,

89
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:22,650
that would be perfect.

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,600
Don't interrupt me.

91
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,042
Let's pick up what we've left off.

92
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,600
In the Ming dynasty,

93
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:29,751
to be more exact, the early Ming dynasty,

94
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,400
not many people
are equipped with such skills.

95
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,410
Besides, judging from the scale of this tomb,

96
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,876
the tomb owner must have been
a renowned person.

97
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,000
I can only think of one person...

98
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,250
...who meets all these conditions.

99
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,083
Wang Zang Hai.

100
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,334
The guy who built the Ming palace?

101
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,375
That's not the only thing he's built.

102
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,417
Several big cities in that era...

103
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,167
...are planned by
Wang Zang Hai himself.

104
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,500
Back then,

105
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,959
one single order from him...

106
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,375
...can make an entire city...

107
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:02,209
...disappear from this earth.

108
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,190
By the way,

109
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,500
I used to bury myself in old books.

110
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:07,042
I once saw a book about feng shui,
which was written by him.

111
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:09,250
His writings are really deep.

112
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:10,305
It's like looking into...

113
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,417
...secrets of the universe.

114
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,250
So, does looking into
the universe's secrets...

115
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:15,000
...make you the second
Wang Zang Hai?

116
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,125
To him, they may be the universe's secrets.

117
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,334
But, to me, it's just mumbo-jumbo.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,270
Legend has it...

119
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,274
...that Shen Wan San's tomb
at the bottom of Yinzi Creek...

120
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:26,232
...was designed by him.

121
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,999
For him to design such a place for himself,

122
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,209
he must be overloaded.

123
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,042
You're just speculating, aren't you?

124
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,584
Do you have any solid evidence?

125
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,751
These are mere assumptions.

126
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:36,876
Take them with a grain of salt.

127
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,834
What if this tomb really
belongs to Wang Zang Hai?

128
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,083
That would be an unexpected find.

129
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,626
It's certainly unexpected.

130
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,250
I say, your uncle and his team...

131
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,375
...surely aren't the only ones
who have been here.

132
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,459
Look at the tunnel.

133
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,999
Other tomb raiders
must have been here before.

134
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:51,542
That tunnel...

135
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,876
...does look unusual.

136
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,751
It actually links to this lake here.

137
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,501
I think...

138
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:58,792
...that this pool is just an exit.

139
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,170
Maybe the person who dug the tunnel...

140
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,751
...wasn't sure of the main
chamber's location.

141
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,042
That's why he dug several routes
that may lead to the chamber.

142
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,792
The one inside the pool is one of them.

143
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,999
The one beneath the coffin
is also one of them.

144
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,583
I didn't see any forks inside the tunnel.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,458
It was just a straight path.

146
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,792
There are so many bricks inside.

147
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:43,626
It's not hard for them
to cover a few holes...

148
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,751
...with a few bricks.

149
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,918
Maybe you two were in a rush,

150
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:47,876
so you didn't notice them.

151
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:48,918
Otherwise, think of it.

152
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,792
This tunnel connects the pool...

153
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:52,083
...to the underside of a coffin.

154
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,375
Where did he start digging?

155
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,375
That guy was obviously an unlucky one.

156
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,417
Maybe he was cursed.

157
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,292
He just had to hit the slab
at the side chamber,

158
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,083
and reach the pool in this side hall.

159
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,209
Lady Luck sure abandoned him.

160
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,125
Any water? I'm thirsty.

161
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,584
I've already finished mine.

162
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,507
Didn't you take your own?

163
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,667
I was counting on you.

164
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:12,959
Didn't you bring my share?
I thought you did.

165
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:18,959
Hurry up.

166
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,042
Relax.

167
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,820
Here.

168
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:32,375
I've tested it for poison.

169
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:33,876
Take it or leave it.

170
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:34,799
Seriously?

171
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,626
What newfangled technology is this?

172
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,125
Get me one when we get back.

173
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,280
You can have it.

174
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,417
If we can get out of here,

175
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,584
I can give you 100 of it.

176
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,740
Okay.

177
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,876
Do you think the demon knows how to swim?

178
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,375
This doesn't seem to be a sea monkey.

179
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:37,751
We've got stairs now.

180
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,375
I can't see anything in this fog.

181
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,540
Look at this.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,180
It looks like a relief sculpture.

183
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,334
Are these holes here water outlets?

184
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,083
Did you see that?

185
00:10:58,584 --> 00:10:59,709
There's a stone tablet there.

186
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,680
Not bad.

187
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:02,792
You've got sharp eyes.

188
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,876
This is a trick I've learned
from Mei Lan Fang.

189
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,859
I stare at birds every day.

190
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,910
Cut the crap.

191
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,410
Can you see what's written on the tablet?

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,870
That's easy.

193
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,417
Fatty, let's wait for the mist to disappear.

194
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,584
Till when are we going to wait?

195
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,060
It's okay.

196
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,080
Follow me.

197
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,167
Come here.

198
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:03,467
There's English here.

199
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:05,292
How can there be English
inside a Chinese tomb?

200
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:06,834
My English may not be good,

201
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,417
but I still can read the 24 alphabets.

202
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,999
This is really English.

203
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,501
26 alphabets!

204
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,290
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

205
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,240
See?

206
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,918
It <i>is</i> English.

207
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:19,083
No wonder this tomb has nothing valuable.

208
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,125
The white people beat us to the punch.

209
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,834
It may be in English,
but it might not be white people.

210
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,800
After all, alphabets are simpler
than Chinese characters.

211
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,830
And, these are obviously...

212
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,740
...abbreviations.

213
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:28,972
The writing is messy.

214
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,660
Perhaps something happened suddenly,

215
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,910
and the guy carved this message...

216
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,860
...for future raiders.

217
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:33,959
You have a point.

218
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,584
Judging from the traces here,

219
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:40,083
it was probably inscribed 20 to 30 years ago.

220
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,459
Was it your uncle?

221
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:42,918
Impossible.

222
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,930
My uncle's English is no better than yours.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,720
This was probably written by
the other team members.

224
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,083
Whoever it was,

225
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:49,542
what do you think he's doing down here?

226
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:51,292
Is there any treasure down here?

227
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,240
Fatty.

228
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,754
When can you remove that bad habit of yours?

229
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:56,292
Every man has his own idiosyncrasies.

230
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,375
I love antiques,

231
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,299
and that's that.

232
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,300
It can't be helped.

233
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,501
I'm worried that the water
will flow in again.

234
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:04,667
Let's go up.

235
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,000
It's faster to float up than running up.

236
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,540
Did you jam your mind with too many books?

237
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:09,834
Listen up.

238
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,340
When the water's speed and volume...

239
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,540
...reaches a certain level,

240
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,870
it will channel into a strong force.

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,751
If the water hits you till you faint,

242
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:16,751
you can't save yourself...

243
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,864
...no matter how good you swim.

244
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,083
What a scaredy-cat.

245
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,083
No wonder Master Wu refuses
to let you enter tombs.

246
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,417
He spoiled you.

247
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,083
He should throw you inside
a cemetery for a few days...

248
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,042
...and toughen you up.

249
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,225
You're bold if you continue down.

250
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,626
We're here to look for my uncle,

251
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,667
not searching for treasure.

252
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,930
Besides, we have Bro here.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,250
I can't ignore him.

254
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,292
We must avoid taking risks.

255
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,501
Anyway, my strategy in war...

256
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,584
...is to strike first.

257
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,626
Yes, yes.

258
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,999
But, being brash is not a virtue.

259
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,626
I think I've been here.

260
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,480
Bro.

261
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,440
What have you found out?

262
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,080
Bro!

263
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:01,792
So, what were you saying...

264
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,000
...about taking risks?

265
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,930
Bro!

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,870
Slow down, Bro!

267
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,580
Bro!

268
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,042
Where are you, Bro?

269
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,083
Go on, or are you scared?

270
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,160
Watch out.

271
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,751
There's a lot of holes under the water.

272
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:15,751
-Don't fall into them.
-We already have!

273
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,626
That's some Monday-morning
quarterback from you!

274
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,292
Anyway, where are you?

275
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,417
That's enough, let's go.

276
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,042
Is this deep? Be careful.

277
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,542
Okay, let's go.

278
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:58,542
An apotropaic stone monkey.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Bro, what have you found?

280
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,125
Long time no see.

281
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,709
Young Comrade.

282
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,680
Come.

283
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,083
Translate this.

284
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,730
The inscription here...

285
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,100
...is narrating how the tomb's owner...

286
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:37,309
...built a celestial palace.

287
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,242
The door that leads to the palace...

288
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:40,959
...is hidden inside the monolith.

289
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:42,876
If you have an affinity with it,

290
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,292
the door will open for you...

291
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,459
...and send you to the palace.

292
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:03,730
I think this verse...

293
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,700
...looks like an aphorism.

294
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,770
Different people...

295
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,160
...might interpret it differently.

296
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,667
Maybe the palace and the door
are just metaphors.

297
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,317
But, there must be a secret hidden...

298
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:14,652
...inside this monolith.

299
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,167
How is there a door on this thing?

300
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:19,291
You don't share an affinity with it.

301
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,475
Of course you can't see the door.

302
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,540
It's fine as long as I have
an affinity with treasure.

303
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,250
Take a look at this, my comrade.

304
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,200
Look at this.

305
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,450
Did someone really
reach the celestial palace...

306
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,620
...through the monolith?

307
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,640
Fatty.

308
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,042
See if there are any traces...

309
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:01,752
...left by previous
archaeological teams.

310
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:12,930
My uncle did say...

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,867
...that he didn't have any
diving equipment when he left.

312
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,709
Don't tell me that my uncle...

313
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,250
...has really been to
the celestial palace.

314
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:20,791
Where exactly is he now?

315
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,416
These are all junk here.

316
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,709
What a wasted trip.

317
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,999
I had my hopes up.

318
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,280
Fatty.

319
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,250
The water level might rise later.

320
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,709
Let's go up first.

321
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:36,542
It's too far to the top.

322
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:37,792
This is too dangerous.

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,501
Don't scare yourself.

324
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,540
What's that noise?

325
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,542
What, is there something in the water?

326
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,250
Is it another sea monkey?

327
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:57,751
As long as it's not a drought demon.

328
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:05,751
I think we should go up now.

329
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
You're giving up your search?

330
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,501
I'm giving up.

331
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,380
Bro.

332
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,920
Let's go back.

333
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,375
What, he's gone again?

334
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,626
-Poker Face!
-He appears and disappears...

335
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,810
...whenever he feels like it.

336
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,770
He's sick.

337
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,720
Bro.

338
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,870
-Poker Face.
-The fog's really thick.

339
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,959
Is this PM 2.5 pollution?

340
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:28,459
Poker Face!

341
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,125
Mutey Zhang!

342
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,360
Mutey Zhang.

343
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:33,542
Poker Face!

344
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,584
Mutey Zhang!

345
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,950
Bro!

346
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,292
Mutey Zhang.

347
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,540
Bro!

348
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,876
Poker Face.

349
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,000
We meet again.

350
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,250
What are you doing, repenting?

351
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,750
Bro.

352
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,980
Bro.

353
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,660
What's wrong with you?

354
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:04,999
I remember now.

355
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,709
I think I've been here.

356
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,209
<i>Look at this, Wen Jin.</i>

357
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,620
<i>Xu Qiang.</i>

358
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,083
<i>Do you know what to write
for Chen Wen Jin's report?</i>

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,083
<i>I'm going to write a report...</i>

360
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,042
<i>...on the evolution of
porcelain patterns.</i>

361
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,334
<i>Why don't we work together?</i>

362
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,125
<i>The content is kind of weird.</i>

363
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:03,083
<i>You can do the writing.</i>

364
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,334
<i>If we make two reports separately,</i>

365
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,501
<i>we can't hand it in on time.</i>

366
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,292
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

367
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,160
<i>Huo Ling.</i>

368
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,542
<i>San Xing is still asleep.</i>

369
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:22,999
<i>-Don't wake him up.
-Sorry.</i>

370
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,667
<i>Take a look at this!</i>

371
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,709
<i>-There's something queer on the base.
-What is it?</i>

372
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,720
<i>Show me.</i>

373
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,440
<i>I know this.</i>

374
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:35,792
<i>It's the kiln's number.</i>

375
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,209
<i>It shows which kiln this jar comes from.</i>

376
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,160
<i>No.</i>

377
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:40,292
<i>Kiln numbers from Ming don't look like this..</i>

378
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:41,792
<i>This may be a posy...</i>

379
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:43,584
<i>...representing the tomb
owner's identity.</i>

380
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,580
<i>Zhou Yuan.</i>

381
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,234
<i>I think we should write
our reports separately.</i>

382
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:47,959
<i>I don't trust your level of knowledge.</i>

383
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,417
<i>You don't even know that a posy...</i>

384
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,060
<i>...is usually comprised of
four characters.</i>

385
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,876
<i>There's only one character here.</i>

386
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,083
<i>And it's a rare character.</i>

387
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,584
<i>What you've said is impossible.</i>

388
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,751
<i>I didn't take a good look.</i>

389
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,820
<i>What's all the fuss about?</i>

390
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,150
<i>-You can't have it all to yourself.
-Stop fighting.</i>

391
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,490
<i>We can study it together.</i>

392
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,780
<i>-Don't ruin it.
-What are you doing?</i>

393
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,910
<i>Let me take a better look.</i>

394
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,270
<i>That's enough.</i>

395
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,270
<i>Both of you only talk big.</i>

396
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,480
<i>Stop bluffing.
Give it to me.</i>

397
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,120
<i>Let go of it.</i>

398
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,990
<i>Zhang.</i>

399
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,999
<i>Help me see what this is.</i>

400
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,334
<i>Can you stop ignoring me?</i>

401
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:28,626
<i>Tell me when you've looked at it.</i>

402
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,500
<i>What is this?</i>

403
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,650
There were also some symbols
on the base of the pottery...

404
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,754
...in the side chamber we went.

405
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,584
At first, I thought
they were just decorations.

406
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:09,542
Then, I realized...

407
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:10,999
...that every symbol is different.

408
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,501
It seems to follow a specific pattern.

409
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,417
So, I think that these symbols...

410
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,834
...seem to indicate a sequence.

411
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,209
Plus, the drawings on the pottery...

412
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,834
...doesn't seem to be
randomly drawn.

413
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,542
<i>Look, it's very orderly.</i>

414
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,250
<i>It's exquisite.</i>

415
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:31,000
<i>What do these symbols mean?</i>

416
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,667
<i>I really don't understand.</i>

417
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,584
<i>How did he come up with these?</i>

418
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:39,542
<i>The yellow one looks good.</i>

419
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,900
<i>Look at this.</i>

420
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,375
<i>The base design of this jar
is different from the rest.</i>

421
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:45,999
<i>It must have a special meaning.</i>

422
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,240
<i>What do you think?</i>

423
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,480
<i>Look.</i>

424
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,160
<i>Zhang.</i>

425
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:01,751
<i>Are you arranging them in sequence?</i>

426
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,334
<i>He really is.</i>

427
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,918
<i>These symbols have different
numbers of strokes.</i>

428
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,250
<i>They do look like numbers.</i>

429
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,167
<i>Even funerary objects are numbered?</i>

430
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:12,626
<i>That's a hoot.</i>

431
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:14,999
<i>Maybe it's a coincidence.</i>

432
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,140
<i>Maybe it means something else,</i>

433
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,460
<i>and they're mistaken as numbers now.</i>

434
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,460
<i>Yeah.</i>

435
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,820
<i>How else can we explain this, then?</i>

436
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:21,334
<i>What's the purpose of these numbers?</i>

437
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,334
<i>Is this a palace in the sky?</i>

438
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:25,834
<i>What is this?</i>

439
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:28,501
<i>Could it be a symbol?</i>

440
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:29,751
<i>After all, it's impossible...</i>

441
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:31,250
<i>...to build a palace in the skies.</i>

442
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,876
<i>Can this be depicting a legend?</i>

443
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,459
<i>Look, there's a taoist here.</i>

444
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,876
<i>Could he be the famous Lu Dong Bin?</i>

445
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:41,959
<i>It's about his journey to immortality.</i>

446
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,320
<i>-Doesn't look like it.
-Impossible.</i>

447
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,834
<i>These people's clothes...</i>

448
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,280
<i>...seem to be of
the early Ming dynasty.</i>

449
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,125
<i>And, this construction flow...</i>

450
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,626
<i>...is arranged in sequence.</i>

451
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:51,959
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

452
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:53,167
<i>...that these ancient people...</i>

453
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,626
<i>...really built a palace in the skies.</i>

454
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,584
<i>I think she's read too many legends and lore.</i>

455
00:25:57,751 --> 00:26:00,042
<i>-Exactly.
-This is too wild.</i>

456
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,700
Legend has it that the emperor,
Zhu Yuan Zhang...

457
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,000
...wanted to build a palace...

458
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,200
...that's magnificent
and one of a kind.

459
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,250
He assigned this task to Wang Zang Hai.

460
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,260
After that.

461
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,080
Wang Zang Hai really built the palace.

462
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,460
In the skies?

463
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:14,751
Impossible.

464
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,751
They say that he used...

465
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:18,930
...a giant kite...

466
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,375
...and a lot of money.

467
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:22,459
Eventually, he really did create...

468
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,751
...an illusion of a grand sky palace.

469
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,334
He did this to please the emperor.

470
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:28,125
The emperor wanted a palace,

471
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:29,250
but he made a kite instead.

472
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:30,901
If I were the emperor,
I'd be really pissed off.

473
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:33,501
I need to learn a trick or two from
the Ming general, Yuan Chong Huan.

474
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,834
I'm going to sentence him
to death by slicing him alive.

475
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,300
He's deceiving the emperor, after all.

476
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,507
It's just a legend.

477
00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:39,667
Don't take it seriously.

478
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,160
Bro.

479
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,580
After that,

480
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,180
what happened?

481
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,125
I thought more clues could be found...

482
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,125
...at the coffin in the back hall.

483
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,370
Hence, I suggested them
to continue exploring.

484
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,420
<i>No.</i>

485
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,810
<i>Among us, only Wu San Xing...</i>

486
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,114
<i>...is experienced in searching tombs.</i>

487
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,450
<i>But, he's resting now.</i>

488
00:26:58,626 --> 00:26:59,750
<i>Without his lead,</i>

489
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,700
<i>we can't search the place.</i>

490
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,000
<i>Wake him up, then.</i>

491
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,334
<i>In order to manage the expedition,</i>

492
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:04,584
<i>he's been working tirelessly.</i>

493
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,501
<i>Shouldn't we let him sleep a bit more?</i>

494
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:07,834
<i>Zhang Qi Ling!</i>

495
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,480
<i>Don't worry.</i>

496
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,417
<i>I can take care of myself.</i>

497
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,959
<i>How will you take care of yourself?</i>

498
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:17,417
<i>Do you have any experience inside tombs?</i>

499
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,334
<i>Even if you don't think for yourself,</i>

500
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,250
<i>you need to think about everyone's safety.</i>

501
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:22,459
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

502
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:23,876
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

503
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,000
<i>Don't go!</i>

504
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,709
<i>We've already lost one person.</i>

505
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:27,972
<i>\</i>

506
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,542
<i>how am I going to explain this to the boss?</i>

507
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,440
<i>Thank you.</i>

508
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,689
<i>-She let him go.
-What's he doing?</i>

509
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,209
<i>What are we waiting for?
Let's go as well!</i>

510
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,160
<i>Wen Jin.</i>

511
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,751
<i>My report will be on the evolution
of porcelain patterns.</i>

512
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:00,542
<i>I'm here for research.</i>

513
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,000
<i>The porcelain patterns inside this tomb...</i>

514
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,450
<i>...have evolved in an unusual way.</i>

515
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,400
<i>This is too significant.</i>

516
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,750
<i>So, everyone.</i>

517
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:07,792
<i>Excuse me.</i>

518
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,340
<i>I'm going too, then!</i>

519
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:11,709
<i>We're a team.</i>

520
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:12,918
<i>We shouldn't act alone.</i>

521
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,876
<i>Yes, you're right.</i>

522
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,999
<i>Since everyone wants to go,</i>

523
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,459
<i>let's go together.</i>

524
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:19,501
<i>-That's great!
-Let's go!</i>

525
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,940
<i>Wen Jin.</i>

526
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,834
<i>Should we wake him up?</i>

527
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,760
<i>Forget it.</i>

528
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:28,959
<i>He has an incendiary temper.</i>

529
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,584
<i>If we wake him up now,</i>

530
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,542
<i>he'll surely argue with Zhang.</i>

531
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:34,876
<i>Let him sleep a while here.</i>

532
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:36,918
<i>Let's make this trip quick.</i>

533
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:38,501
<i>Okay, I'm off.</i>

534
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,420
<i>Be careful.</i>

535
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,830
<i>Slow down.</i>

536
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:49,834
<i>I'm scared.</i>

537
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,375
<i>What were those?</i>

538
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,140
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

539
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,160
<i>It's over.</i>

540
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,110
<i>It won't come back.</i>

541
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,020
<i>Let go of me.</i>

542
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:57,501
<i>I said, let go!</i>

543
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:58,918
<i>You bunch of people...</i>

544
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,334
<i>...are even older than Zhang here.</i>

545
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:01,501
<i>Why are you all still so timid?</i>

546
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:02,551
<i>What's there to be afraid of?</i>

547
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,500
<i>Let's go.</i>

548
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:04,959
<i>Don't scare yourself.</i>

549
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,120
<i>Exactly.</i>

550
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:07,751
<i>I'll lead the way here.</i>

551
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,876
<i>Don't wander off, Zhou Yuan.</i>

552
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,050
<i>A monster!</i>

553
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,080
<i>A monster!</i>

554
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,459
<i>What are you shouting?</i>

555
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,580
<i>There aren't any...</i>

556
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,560
<i>...monsters in this world.</i>

557
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,200
<i>The fog here...</i>

558
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,417
<i>...contains some
metal-like particles.</i>

559
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:28,834
<i>When exposed to light,</i>

560
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,300
<i>some refracted images may be produced.</i>

561
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:32,459
<i>But, this is just a normal,
scientific phenomenon.</i>

562
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:33,876
<i>Don't scare yourself.</i>

563
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,972
<i>Could this be...</i>

564
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:53,375
<i>...the monster you meant?</i>

565
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,400
<i>I...</i>

566
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,900
<i>...didn't see it clearly.</i>

567
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,459
<i>This is incredible.</i>

568
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,250
<i>This is a whole new discovery on
Chinese funerary customs.</i>

569
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,840
<i>This place might become...</i>

570
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,030
<i>...yet another milestone
in the field of archaeology!</i>

571
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,940
<i>Yeah!</i>

572
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,792
<i>This is a major find.</i>

573
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:12,918
<i>Once the public knows of this,</i>

574
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:13,792
<i>we'll become...</i>

575
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:15,083
<i>...world-renowned celebrities!</i>

576
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,751
<i>-Yeah!
-Wonderful!</i>

577
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,959
<i>Mei!</i>

578
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,000
<i>That's enough.</i>

579
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,792
<i>Let's not waste too much time here.</i>

580
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:27,792
<i>Time to go back.</i>

581
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,720
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

582
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,000
<i>Be careful.</i>

583
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:36,375
<i>Wait, everyone.</i>

584
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,375
<i>Zhang isn't here yet.</i>

585
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,167
<i>He must be really fixated.</i>

586
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,080
<i>I'll call him.</i>

587
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,040
<i>Zhang!</i>

588
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:45,667
<i>Hurry up, everyone's here!</i>

589
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,167
<i>Zhang Qi Ling!</i>

590
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,000
<i>Zhang Qi Ling!</i>

591
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,160
<i>Let's check it out together.</i>

592
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:54,834
<i>Zhang Qi Ling!</i>

593
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,549
<i>Zhang!</i>

594
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,000
<i>What's wrong?</i>

595
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,209
<i>He's going to get us all in trouble!</i>

596
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,083
<i>What is that thing?</i>

597
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:09,999
<i>Zhang!</i>

598
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,334
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

599
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:12,459
<i>Come here!</i>

600
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:14,334
<i>Zhang is standing too close...</i>

601
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,501
<i>...to that thing.</i>

602
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,083
<i>If anything happens,</i>

603
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:18,626
<i>it's hard for him to run away.</i>

604
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,620
<i>What should we do?</i>

605
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,125
<i>Right now,</i>

606
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,417
<i>we can only stay put.</i>

607
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,930
<i>So, we have to stand here like a statue?</i>

608
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,167
<i>What, you want to run off alone?</i>

609
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,080
<i>No.</i>

610
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,667
<i>But, he's going to get us all killed!</i>

611
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,860
<i>Calm down.</i>

612
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,125
<i>I remember that place...</i>

613
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,751
<i>...has an apotropaic stone monkey.</i>

614
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:38,000
<i>Judging from the height,</i>

615
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:39,834
<i>is there anything...</i>

616
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>...on top of it?</i>

617
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:43,125
<i>I remember that it's only a stone monkey.</i>

618
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,959
<i>What's on top of it, then?</i>

619
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,200
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

620
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:47,667
<i>Don't tell me that it's...</i>

621
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,542
<i>...the monster
that followed us just now.</i>

622
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:50,507
<i>No way!</i>

623
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:53,375
<i>Could it be the zombie
that Wu San Xing mentioned...</i>

624
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:54,751
<i>Don't say it anymore!</i>

625
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:56,999
<i>Everyone, don't panic.</i>

626
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,083
<i>This tomb is under the sea.</i>

627
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,375
<i>It's been left untouched
for hundreds of years.</i>

628
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,167
<i>If you look at the sea's surface,</i>

629
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:04,459
<i>the reefs are all broken up.</i>

630
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,000
<i>If you look at the seabed,</i>

631
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,040
<i>the underwater mountains
are all connected to each other.</i>

632
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,409
<i>If this tomb...</i>

633
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:10,708
<i>...really belongs to Wang Zang Hai,</i>

634
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,751
<i>his life elements is short of water.</i>

635
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,751
<i>With all these mountains and water,</i>

636
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,309
<i>this place holds a lot of good energy.</i>

637
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,880
<i>On the east is the dragon's tail,</i>

638
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:19,083
<i>and the west is the dragon's head.</i>

639
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:20,208
<i>With such perfect feng shui</i>,

640
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,417
<i>there won't be any zombies here.</i>

641
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,125
<i>Since it's not a zombie,</i>

642
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,350
<i>that's either a man or an animal.</i>

643
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,114
<i>As long as it's a living thing,</i>

644
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,467
<i>we can outnumber it.</i>

645
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,340
<i>Could it be...</i>

646
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,620
<i>...Wu San Xing?</i>

647
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,501
<i>He woke up to find us gone,</i>

648
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:34,998
<i>so he came here to scare us.</i>

649
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,040
<i>You know him the best.</i>

650
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,208
<i>That's how he is, right?</i>

651
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,958
<i>This is so annoying.</i>

652
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,375
<i>I'm almost scared to death.</i>

653
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,167
<i>Wu San Xing.</i>

654
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,458
<i>-Quiet!
-Stop fooling around!</i>

655
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,792
<i>You're scaring the ladies!</i>

656
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,375
<i>Could he be San Xing?</i>

657
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,250
<i>Careful!</i>

658
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,250
<i>Wait here.</i>

659
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:22,292
<i>I'll call Zhang over.</i>

660
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,040
<i>Huo Ling!</i>

661
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,918
<i>What are you doing, Zhang?</i>

662
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:31,542
<i>Wu San Xing!</i>

663
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:32,834
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

664
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,300
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

665
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,125
<i>Zhang Qi Ling.</i>

666
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:39,709
<i>Guard the stairs!</i>

667
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:40,876
<i>Don't let him go up!</i>

668
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,910
<i>Where's San Xing?</i>

669
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,167
<i>Where is he?</i>

670
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:56,999
<i>What's going on?</i>

671
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,918
<i>This pool...</i>

672
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,292
<i>...is a mechanism in itself.</i>

673
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:20,125
<i>Behind this door...</i>

674
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:22,167
<i>...is another wall
that's turning slowly.</i>

675
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:24,667
The wall was turning?

676
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:25,999
What, a rotating restaurant?

677
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:28,834
Based on my experience,

678
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,083
this mechanism...

679
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:32,250
...is operated by
very simple principles.

680
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,220
Why?

681
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,459
The most complicated traps...

682
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:36,501
...and hidden crossbows...

683
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:38,125
will still degrade in time,

684
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:39,459
be it hundreds of years...

685
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:40,584
...or thousands of years,

686
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:42,083
irregardless of material.

687
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:44,250
So, the best traps
to confound tomb robbers...

688
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:45,292
...are simple traps...

689
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,667
...like this layer of sand
outside the tomb.

690
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,042
Yeah, when you dig till the sand layer,

691
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,190
tons of quicksand...

692
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,190
...will come crushing down.

693
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,500
Even if you don't die of suffocation,

694
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,480
you'll be crushed to death.

695
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:55,240
But, there's a flip side to everything.

696
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,970
If I stick my spade down there,

697
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,350
I can determine the tomb's location...

698
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,540
...based on the quicksand.

699
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,959
And, from the top of the tomb,

700
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,990
I can bypass 12 levels
and reach the main chamber.

701
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,910
You'd better believe it.

702
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,700
Of course,

703
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,751
that's not worth trying out, okay?

704
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,200
I was thinking...

705
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:12,501
...that Wang Zang Hai...

706
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,584
...must have used
the power of the tide...

707
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,042
...to operate these traps.

708
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:17,551
As long as the sea doesn't dry up,

709
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,510
these traps can continue to operate.

710
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,780
You must understand...

711
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,542
...that the weirdest tricks
in this world...

712
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:23,999
...mostly oppose natural forces...

713
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:24,999
...with the power of man.

714
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,667
But, Wang Zang Hai did the contrary.

715
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,150
He followed the flow of nature.

716
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,200
It's perfect and grand.

717
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:30,959
No one can win this battle.

718
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,125
I say, you intelligent people...

719
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,667
...rack your brains too much.

720
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:36,626
You'll get bald easily, you know?

721
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,250
Mutey Zhang.

722
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,751
So, did you find the secret door...

723
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,626
...that Master Wu mentioned?

724
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,580
As a matter of fact,

725
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,042
I found eight secret doors.

726
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:46,542
Eight secret doors?

727
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:48,918
The Divining Gates of Escape?

728
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,167
About these Divining Gates of Escape...

729
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,542
I really don't know much.

730
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,584
Tell us, since you know.

731
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:54,999
The Divining Gates of Escape...

732
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,417
I don't know much either.

733
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,667
Apparently, it goes back a very long way.

734
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,716
It's almost as old...

735
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,584
...as China's recorded history.

736
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:03,542
The first person who used
this divination method...

737
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,459
...is our old ancestor,
the Yellow Emperor.

738
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,375
That's almost 5000 years ago.

739
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:09,709
There are initially...

740
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:11,876
...4320 situations in
the Divining Gates of Escape.

741
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,709
When the Yellow Emperor was using it,

742
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,626
he could only understand 1080 of them.

743
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,959
At Zhang Liang's time,

744
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:18,042
only 72 situations.

745
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:19,334
Right now, my second uncle...

746
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:21,250
...only sorted out 42 situations.

747
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,584
This is already a huge feat.

748
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:26,417
Right now, there are only
18 situations in use.

749
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:28,417
My uncle even had to look for it
in a Han dynasty tomb.

750
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:31,290
So, who was the one who invented
the Divining Gates of Escape?

751
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,460
The Yellow Emperor used it first,

752
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,000
but he only had around 1000 situations.

753
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,709
There's some lost legacy there.

754
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:37,667
About this,

755
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,459
saying that the emperor was the first...

756
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:40,751
...is pretty inaccurate.

757
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,150
To put it simply,

758
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,320
the Divining Gates of Escape...

759
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:46,500
...is used in divination
and military strategies.

760
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:48,042
It's also known as the Eight Formations.

761
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,999
It has eight gates...

762
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,751
...that represents
just about everything.

763
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,834
There's the Gate of Life, the Gate of Death,

764
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,174
and if you enter the other six gates,

765
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,584
you'll see another set of eight gates.

766
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,580
The cycle never ends.

767
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,290
It's recess time, thank you, sir.

768
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:01,626
Just tell me which gate that I can enter.

769
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,215
About that,

770
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,440
I don't know either.

771
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,626
Because these walls...

772
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:10,792
...are always rotating.

773
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:12,299
Besides, the eight secret doors here...

774
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,292
...are always moving.

775
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,334
I don't know which one
is the Gate of Life or Death.

776
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:17,125
If we enter the Gate of Death,

777
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,209
we'll be in huge trouble.

778
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,340
So, which door did you enter back then?

779
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,540
<i>Why did Wu San Xing enter the secret door?</i>

780
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:25,834
<i>Should we follow him?</i>

781
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:26,918
<i>Didn't Zhang tell you?</i>

782
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,434
<i>Some of these doors are equipped with traps.</i>

783
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:29,798
<i>Entering the wrong one can be deadly.</i>

784
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,320
<i>Anyway, he's definitely...</i>

785
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,370
<i>...entered the right door.</i>

786
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,270
<i>We just need...</i>

787
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,280
<i>...to find the door, right?</i>

788
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,080
<i>How do you know he's in the right gate?</i>

789
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:37,250
<i>Who knows, he's already...</i>

790
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
<i>Wen Jin.</i>

791
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,542
<i>It was a slip of the tongue.</i>

792
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:44,959
<i>Don't be mad.</i>

793
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:48,542
<i>Found it!</i>

794
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,660
<i>Look at this!</i>

795
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,610
<i>-What?
-What?</i>

796
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,540
<i>Follow my gesture.</i>

797
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:54,334
<i>See?</i>

798
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,480
<i>Did you see that?</i>

799
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,167
<i>You're standing too high.</i>

800
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:05,549
<i>Lower.</i>

801
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,083
<i>I didn't ask you to look at your reflection.</i>

802
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,000
<i>Touch your temple with your hand.</i>

803
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,040
<i>Right there.</i>

804
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,792
<i>We thought that San Xing
was grooming his hair.</i>

805
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,770
<i>He's actually...</i>

806
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,030
<i>...adjusting his angle and height.</i>

807
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,120
<i>Inside this monolith...</i>

808
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,959
<i>...is another rotating mechanism
that's the same as the pool's.</i>

809
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,709
<i>That's why the marking moved.</i>

810
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:39,125
<i>It should be facing...</i>

811
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:40,959
<i>...the correct door.</i>

812
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:42,209
Get some light over here.

813
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:43,459
I'm going to groom myself a bit.

814
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,030
What are you doing?

815
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,067
Looking for the correct door.

816
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,501
Why do you want to look for it?

817
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:48,918
We can escape this tomb...

818
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,334
...once we find
the correct door, right?

819
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:54,959
Why did they even call it
the Gate of Life, then?

820
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:57,042
But, there's a celestial palace inside.

821
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:11,834
<i>What's wrong, Wen Jin?</i>

822
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,420
<i>Nothing.</i>

823
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,200
<i>Make sure you keep up, everyone.</i>

824
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,200
<i>Okay.</i>

825
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,501
<i>How beautiful!</i>

826
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,520
<i>Oh, gosh.</i>

827
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,460
<i>The Goddess Ma Zu.</i>

828
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:56,876
<i>Is this Heaven?</i>

829
00:42:57,125 --> 00:43:00,417
<i>Oh gosh, this place is magnificent!</i>

830
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,459
<i>To think there's such a place inside a tomb.</i>

831
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,042
<i>This is incredible!</i>

832
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,292
<i>Yeah, this is a whole log of
golden-silk phoebe wood!</i>

833
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,792
<i>This is awe-inspiring!</i>

834
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:09,459
<i>Look at that.</i>

835
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,472
<i>Look at that!</i>

836
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:12,834
<i>Look, those are luminous pearls!</i>

837
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,000
<i>It's gorgeous.</i>
