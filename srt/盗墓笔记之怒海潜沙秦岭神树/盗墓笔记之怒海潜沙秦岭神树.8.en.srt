00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,900
"Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,200
"Episode 8"

3
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,257
Come back.

4
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:12,751
Nonsense!

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,375
Who's more capable? You or him?

6
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,792
Who's more experienced with tombs?
You or him?

7
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,542
What if he comes back...

8
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,751
...and you die in there?

9
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,549
Listen, come here. Look at me.

10
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:26,417
I believe in fate.

11
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,000
We all have our own fate.

12
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,501
Everyone will die.

13
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,542
You'll die even if you don't want to.

14
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,050
But those who aren't supposed to die...

15
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,250
Someone like Bro,

16
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,792
He's around the same age as Master Wu.

17
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,250
But he looks younger than we do.

18
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,417
He's skilled and lives on like a god.

19
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,250
It's impossible for him to die in a tomb.

20
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,000
He's still alive, you know?

21
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:52,709
He's still alive.

22
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,341
Bro.

23
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:06,250
Bro.

24
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,626
He will definitely come back alive.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
He will.

26
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,257
He will.

27
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:24,466
Where's Ning?

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,334
Do you have to worry about everyone?

29
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,792
She'd better taken away by a shark.

30
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,584
I'm going to save her.

31
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,209
Stay here.

32
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,709
Stay here.

33
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:36,458
Can you stay here?

34
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,382
I'll go down there.

35
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:38,708
I'll go look for her.

36
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:39,667
Okay?

37
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:01,167
This stupid woman.
She didn't tell you that she hid a boat.

38
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:08,876
Let me ask you.

39
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,458
Why did you tell me
to save her from down there?

40
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,667
You kept begging me.

41
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:16,291
See.

42
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,584
Did you see that? She left without us!

43
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:24,334
Did you see that? See it
with the shiny and pure eyes of yours.

44
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,709
She left you just like that!

45
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:27,758
You know,

46
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,916
you're really naive.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,876
You are naive! You won't even know
how do you die!

48
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,250
Ning!

49
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,334
Don't let me see you again!

50
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,250
Did you just sit there the whole night?

51
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:01,632
Let me see.

52
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,459
Let me see.

53
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:05,250
Did you turn into a stone?

54
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:10,876
<i>No more next time.</i>

55
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:14,792
No more next time.

56
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:17,542
He hasn't come up.

57
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:31,751
This Poker Face makes me worried.

58
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,626
He's good at disappearing than anyone else.

59
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,667
We agreed that no more next time.

60
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,250
But he's doing it again.

61
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,257
You know what?

62
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,834
He must have came up already.

63
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,583
Poker Face.

64
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:41,796
Come out, Poker Face.

65
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:42,910
Don't you think I can't see you.

66
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,834
-Come out now.
-All right.

67
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,083
Do you hear me? Come out now!

68
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,007
All right.

69
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,209
He likes to surprise you.

70
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,667
Maybe one day when you
take a girl out for dinner and a movie,

71
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,318
then you return to the hotel
to spend the night,

72
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:56,375
the girl pushes you to the bed
and tears off her skin,

73
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:57,546
then Poker Face reveals himself.

74
00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:58,462
Get lost.

75
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,417
You know what? He'd better
don't let me get hold of him.

76
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:03,042
If I really get hold of him,
I'll definitely beat him up.

77
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,965
Yes, beat him.

78
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,459
But before that, I have to pee.

79
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:17,882
A ship.

80
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:20,501
There is a ship.

81
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,667
Help!

82
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,916
Help! We're here!

83
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,708
-We're here!
-Come over here!

84
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,167
Help!

85
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,166
We're here!

86
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,208
Help!

87
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:49,174
Hello?

88
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:52,958
Hello?

89
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,000
Captain.

90
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,375
It's strange.

91
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,279
This is the boat we came with.

92
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,876
Where are the crew?

93
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,299
Fatty.

94
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:11,965
Look.

95
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:13,716
It's an unfinished game.

96
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:14,918
And the water temperature.

97
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,834
It proves that there was someone here
at least half an hour ago.

98
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:20,792
Hello?

99
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,334
I see you. Stop hiding.

100
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,751
<i>Even a pitcher plant is picky.</i>

101
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,920
<i>A high fat, high cholesterol
and highly boorish person like you...</i>

102
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,959
<i>...is not on my menu.</i>

103
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,999
<i>Did you see that? She's eavesdropping us.</i>

104
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,834
<i>Whoever is eavesdropping is the boorish one.</i>

105
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:28,875
Let's put everything aside and eat first.

106
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,834
Here.

107
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:31,334
Eat something.

108
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,999
I've checked all the devices.

109
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,382
They are all functional.

110
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,912
It doesn't look malfunctioning.

111
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:39,758
Do you think...

112
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:41,918
...they met with the coast guard...

113
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,667
...and were arrested?

114
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,000
That's impossible.

115
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,709
They would have towed the ship away.
Why did they leave it here?

116
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,709
There might be pirates on this area.

117
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,250
It can't be the pirates.

118
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:54,584
If there are pirates,

119
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,334
there won't be any supplies left.

120
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,042
I guess they were taken away by ghost, then.

121
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,257
Nonsense.

122
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,792
The haunted ship is looking for a substitute.

123
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,295
There's no such thing as ghost.

124
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,626
You might as well write a novel.

125
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,920
There are two lost guys in Xisha
request for rescue.

126
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,375
There are two lost guys in PXisha
request for rescue.

127
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,459
0101, I'm 02.

128
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,458
Mayday, mayday.

129
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,459
Hello?

130
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,417
Hello?

131
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:30,042
<i>According to the latest news
from the weather station,</i>

132
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,708
<i>the eye of massive typhoon, Thelma...</i>

133
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,375
<i>...is located at 5°7' north
and 92° east...</i>

134
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:37,375
<i>...at 4pm near Xisha.</i>

135
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,834
<i>The central pressure is 910 Pa.</i>

136
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,667
<i>Wind scale exceeding 17 near the center.</i>

137
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,212
<i>The eye of the typhoon
is estimated to be moving...</i>

138
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,333
<i>...at 15 to 20 km per hour...</i>

139
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:48,834
<i>...to the Northwest.</i>

140
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,083
<i>We urge all ships at sea
to seek refuge in nearby ports.</i>

141
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:53,459
<i>We urge all ships at sea
to seek refuge in nearby ports.</i>

142
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:58,417
You're playing around with the device.

143
00:12:58,501 --> 00:12:59,417
Can you sail a ship?

144
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:00,542
I can drive a car. Let me try.

145
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,166
Forget about it.

146
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,250
Move aside.

147
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,292
Can you do it?

148
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,209
-Of course.
-I didn't know you can sail a ship.

149
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:08,334
Go lift the anchor.

150
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,226
I'm not trying to scare you.

151
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,920
There are many submerged reefs around here.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,334
An accident will happen if we hit one.

153
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,417
I was the top rower in Shicha Sea
when I was young.

154
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:19,341
Don't worry.

155
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:20,299
Go lift the anchor.

156
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:22,959
So you don't know how to sail a ship.

157
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,166
Just go and lift the anchor.

158
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,584
Stop procrastinating. Go now.

159
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,125
Mortals, please worship Fatty Wang.

160
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:04,876
We've made it out of the submerged reefs.

161
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,584
I made it out of the submerged reefs.

162
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,799
Great.

163
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:31,999
Why are you all geared up for?

164
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:32,923
Don't you trust me?

165
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:34,999
I'm preparing for the worst.

166
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:35,792
This is mine.

167
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:36,716
This is yours.

168
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:39,918
Bookworms have no guts.

169
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,174
Yes.

170
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,667
You're the greatest, all right?

171
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,542
Yes, I'll show you something greater.

172
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,083
This is...

173
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:50,341
...the luminous pearl?

174
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,208
When did you get it?

175
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:56,626
I would have looked amateurish
if I had let you see I took it.

176
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,591
Since we're free now, let's guess its value.

177
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:14,174
Fatty.

178
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,334
Before we entered the tomb, we agreed
not to take anything from the tomb.

179
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,166
Just guess its value.

180
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,501
Okay?

181
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,007
It can't be.

182
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:39,959
This is fake.

183
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,546
This isn't the luminous pearl.

184
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,292
Don't try to cheat me.

185
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:45,549
See for yourself.

186
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:48,918
This is an apophyllite.

187
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,542
It can't be.

188
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,709
This time, you're the one who's naive.

189
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,090
Think about it.

190
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,792
No matter how rich Wang Zang Hai was,

191
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,334
how many luminous pearls
can he put on a dome?

192
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,083
How many luminous pearls are there in China?

193
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,751
Then,

194
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:03,167
how much is this thing worth?

195
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:04,626
This is...

196
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:07,007
...probably worth a meal.

197
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,459
But the cost of the meal between a small
restaurant and a luxurious one is different.

198
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,000
I still think there's something wrong
with the ship.

199
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,000
What a coincidence for it
to moor right beside us.

200
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,257
Fatty.

201
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:55,758
Fatty.

202
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:09,542
It's disgusting.

203
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:12,542
Get up.

204
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,542
Go take a shower.

205
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,042
You stink.

206
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,542
Get up, Fatty.

207
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:18,834
Get up.

208
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,167
Whose luminous pearl is this?

209
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,132
Where?

210
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,083
Go take a shower now, you stink.

211
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,209
No, I want to sleep.

212
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,083
Don't blame me for not warning you.

213
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,796
Don't blame me when your wound is inflamed.

214
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:43,751
Look.

215
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:45,500
There is a rash already.

216
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:46,709
If it spreads through your body,

217
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,430
you'll most likely be deformed.

218
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,125
Is it that serious?

219
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,083
What do you think?

220
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,166
I applied ointment.

221
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,918
It's right there, it's effective.

222
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,375
You have to take a shower
no matter how effective it is.

223
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,879
You have to apply antiseptic after the shower.
I'll dress your wound after that.

224
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,083
Get up now.

225
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,375
-Don't pull me up.
-Go take a shower.

226
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:08,299
That way.

227
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:09,709
Are you going to bath in the sea?

228
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,626
Don't peek while I'm taking the shower.

229
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:53,583
Why?

230
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,417
Why are you breaking up with me?

231
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:56,380
Have you forgotten...

232
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,250
...about the gift you got me
from the underwater tomb?

233
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,459
-What?
-The luminous pearl.

234
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:05,292
That's just a apophyllite.

235
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,254
What?

236
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,751
How dare you trick me with a rock?

237
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,417
What about our Jack?

238
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:12,875
The sea monkey we raise?

239
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,626
Yes, Jack.

240
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,958
It won't die before you.

241
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,876
Do you have to be so cruel to me?

242
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,709
If that's what you want, I'll jump off here.

243
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:27,042
Have you ever loved me?

244
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:28,382
Ning.

245
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,751
I have never loved you.

246
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:31,916
Go to hell.

247
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,840
You...

248
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,542
You're awake, Mr Naive.

249
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,132
What time is it?

250
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:49,716
1.30pm.

251
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:51,667
Oh, right. Let's see
if you still have a fever.

252
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,915
Thank you, Fatty.

253
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:01,839
Don't talk nonsense.

254
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:05,000
Look at this hotel, it's very bad.

255
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,459
I feel so boring here
that hair is starting to grow.

256
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,583
You already have hair, don't you?

257
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,667
On your back.

258
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:13,674
And it's white.

259
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,359
Stop talking about that.

260
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:17,830
Geez.

261
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,125
What did you apply on my wound?

262
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,583
Don't tell me it's lotion.

263
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,507
I won't believe it.

264
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:24,839
It's my blood.

265
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:27,754
<i>Let me see.</i>

266
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:28,792
<i>Here.</i>

267
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,167
<i>How is it?</i>

268
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:40,292
<i>It's very serious, Fatty.</i>

269
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,101
<i>I'm not trying to scare you.</i>

270
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:43,667
<i>It's moldy.</i>

271
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:45,417
<i>And it's white mold.</i>

272
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:47,291
<i>Ganoderma will grow in few more days.</i>

273
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,375
<i>White mold? Ganoderma? What's that?</i>

274
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:50,751
<i>Take it away from me.</i>

275
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,540
<i>It's itchy.</i>

276
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,959
<i>You might as well cut my flesh.</i>

277
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:54,915
<i>Quick.</i>

278
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:58,334
<i>I heard that someone who got shot
by this arrow committed suicide.</i>

279
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:00,459
<i>Mutey Zhang, I can't believe
you're talking nonsense.</i>

280
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:01,980
<i>Figure out something to help me.</i>

281
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,875
<i>What are you waiting for? Do it now.</i>

282
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,709
<i>-Look at it.
-All right, Fatty.</i>

283
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:07,129
<i>I'll stop teasing you.</i>

284
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,409
<i>Let me tell you the truth.</i>

285
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,459
<i>I have an idea to deal with this.</i>

286
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:11,838
<i>I'll just apply some lotion on it.</i>

287
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,667
<i>You city folks are such princesses.</i>

288
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:23,959
<i>It hurts.</i>

289
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,876
<i>I can't believe you apply lotion...</i>

290
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,208
<i>...when you're raiding a tomb.</i>

291
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:31,709
<i>You might as well bring some
playing cards and play here.</i>

292
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,959
<i>Blow on it, quick.</i>

293
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,626
When we were in the Tomb of Lord Shang,

294
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,207
I accidentally ate Qilin herb, right?

295
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:49,042
Since then, I feel like my blood
has been ever-changing.

296
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,287
After being shot by the arrow
in the underwater tomb,

297
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,626
my body was also itching.

298
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:55,174
But it recovered quickly,
maybe due to my blood.

299
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,062
Seeing you suffering from the itchiness,

300
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,876
so I thought of using my blood.

301
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,542
Enough.

302
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:06,792
You deserve this.

303
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:10,674
Fatty.

304
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:13,542
You and Bro saved my life.

305
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:15,341
To me,

306
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,125
you are my buddies.

307
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:18,914
My buddies forever.

308
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,375
No, stop it.

309
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,341
It's way too mushy.

310
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,750
I might take your blood
while you're asleep...

311
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:27,349
...and sell it online as lotion.

312
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:42,049
<i>Poker Face.</i>

313
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,709
<i>How are you?</i>

314
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,209
<i>Is there really no more next time?</i>

315
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:06,750
<i>Here are two cheques.</i>

316
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,083
<i>One is for your remuneration.</i>

317
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,417
<i>The other one is the payment for this ship.</i>

318
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:12,501
<i>I don't want anyone to know about this ship.</i>

319
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:13,712
<i>Okay.</i>

320
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:14,632
<i>Don't worry.</i>

321
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,174
Sir.

322
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:52,291
<i>When your security detail arrives,</i>

323
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,584
<i>you can come back.</i>

324
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,417
<i>I'll ask someone else to help you.</i>

325
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:59,918
<i>You can have a rest for a few days, okay?</i>

326
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,459
I want to stay.

327
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:06,042
I don't trust the others to handle.

328
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:09,250
<i>The most important things
need your supervision.</i>

329
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,959
For the rest, it's unnecessary.

330
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,042
You should learn to delegate
routine tasks to your people.

331
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,292
Otherwise, what are they for?

332
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:18,591
Okay.

333
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:21,334
What do you think of Wu Xie?

334
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:25,042
<i>Since you have spent a lot of time together.</i>

335
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:28,584
He's a good person.

336
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,959
<i>A nice guy?</i>

337
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:34,424
He...

338
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:36,959
He's very kind.

339
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,999
He will save others...

340
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,500
...even if he's in danger himself.

341
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:42,709
That's foolish.

342
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,876
I don't want you to be like him.

343
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:46,507
<i>Remember.</i>

344
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:49,918
You're always the most important person here.

345
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:52,417
You have to protect yourself...

346
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:54,209
...before anyone else.

347
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:57,591
<i>Sir.</i>

348
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,083
<i>I don't think he's foolish.</i>

349
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,042
<i>He has a sense of righteousness...</i>

350
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:05,375
<i>...and he's smart.</i>

351
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,250
<i>His kindness is very persistent.</i>

352
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:15,758
Okay.

353
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,215
So...

354
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,417
...what else do we have about...

355
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,292
...our kind and righteous boy?

356
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:26,876
A burning curiosity.

357
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:28,542
Oh, yeah?

358
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:33,042
He's fascinating by his family history.

359
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,626
Though his family hid many things from him.

360
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,626
However,

361
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:40,375
<i>the more they hide,</i>

362
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,129
<i>the more he wants to learn.</i>

363
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:45,291
He's very confident about his investigations.

364
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,916
But with the decryption,

365
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,542
he doesn't trust anyone.

366
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,000
Including his uncle.

367
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,000
<i>You're right, Ning.</i>

368
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:54,334
<i>You are getting better and better.</i>

369
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:55,792
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

370
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:56,716
Sir.

371
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,459
My biggest wish is to help you.

372
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:02,125
Since the day I adopted you,

373
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:03,299
...I knew...

374
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:04,792
...that one day...

375
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:09,834
...you'll shine like the Cullinan Diamond
of the crown of the Queen of England.

376
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:13,209
Dazzling and brilliant.

377
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,708
Your pots are hot. Where did you buy them?

378
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,000
I exchanged them with the boss.

379
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,125
They are great.

380
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:25,459
No fire is needed. They heat up on their own.

381
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,334
We, Chinese people are great at food.

382
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,334
We didn't let our millennia of wisdom
go to waste...

383
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,939
...in inventing something like this.

384
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,751
It's hot! Delicious.

385
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:38,674
You know,

386
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,500
if is wasn't for Ning setting us up,

387
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:42,333
would we end up here?

388
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,375
There isn't any restaurants around here.

389
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:45,958
I couldn't figure it out until now.

390
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,959
What exactly is her motive?

391
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,291
Did you get with her,

392
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,751
then dump her and hurt her badly?

393
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:55,834
Dump her?

394
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:58,167
-What are you talking about?
-Tell me, did you get together?

395
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:00,000
What does it have to do with me?

396
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,000
We never even got together,
how could we break up?

397
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:03,299
Delicious.

398
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,459
Fatty, let me tell you something serious.

399
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:10,626
I suspect that...

400
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,626
...the incident where Uncle went missing
in the underwater tomb made up by Ning.

401
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:15,591
Why?

402
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:16,591
Think about it.

403
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:18,918
You know the background of my family.

404
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:20,686
My grandfather was a scholar...

405
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,667
...and my third uncle is sort of
in this industry, too.

406
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,042
But because I'm the only child of the family,

407
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:26,501
they never let me get my hands on this.

408
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:27,674
Furthermore,

409
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,583
even if my third uncle needed help in this,

410
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,962
he would never asked for my help.

411
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,509
He might as well get my second uncle's help.

412
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,690
Your second uncle is also a tomb raider?

413
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,466
No.

414
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:37,792
He's a businessman.

415
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,250
But he's very smart and capable.

416
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:45,041
A lowbrow man like my third uncle
respects him too.

417
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,459
If you say so,

418
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,830
it doesn't make sense that your third uncle
had asked for your help.

419
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,876
Yes.

420
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:53,459
I was suspicious when I first met Ning.

421
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:55,999
But I still boarded the ship
for my third uncle.

422
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,792
Why did she do that?

423
00:29:58,209 --> 00:29:59,375
Why did Ning lie to you?

424
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:01,542
Was it just to trick you into
going down the tomb with her,

425
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,042
and then get you killed
after everything was done?

426
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:06,918
This is not a conspiracy.

427
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:09,250
This is hatred born out of love.

428
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,918
Mr Naive, did you...

429
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,042
No!

430
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:18,375
I swear by my name,
there's nothing between us.

431
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:20,125
Why are you so nervous?

432
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,334
What's there to get nervous for?

433
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,375
Feeling guilty?

434
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,167
Come on.

435
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:32,501
<i>Ning, listen to me.</i>

436
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:37,000
<i>We've planted a seed of doubt
in Wu Xie's mind.</i>

437
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:42,070
<i>And with his character,
he will keep investigating...</i>

438
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,209
<i>...the relationship between Wu
and the tomb in the ocean.</i>

439
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,570
Sir, I will cast new bait soon.

440
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,042
<i>Don't hurry.</i>

441
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,751
<i>I've been waiting for decades.</i>

442
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:55,542
<i>I don't mind waiting for a few more years.</i>

443
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:59,750
<i>And the whereabouts of Wu San Xing,
is there no news?</i>

444
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:00,674
Sir.

445
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,042
Wu San Xing has been too careful.

446
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,209
It's been difficult to track him.

447
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:09,750
20 days ago, he went to Hainan
and rented a boat.

448
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,510
<i>I thought he went to the tomb,</i>

449
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,709
<i>but I didn't find anything new
in the chamber.</i>

450
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:17,390
<i>It looks like we were the only ones
who ever went in...</i>

451
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,034
<i>...since the archaeology team.</i>

452
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:22,209
Wu San Xing is very bold.

453
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:25,250
He didn't go to the tomb of the ocean.

454
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,620
There's only one explanation,

455
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:31,999
<i>that he has found out what was there.</i>

456
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:35,083
So, it's not attractive to him anymore.

457
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:38,375
<i>But we have the copper fish
took out by Xie Lian Huan.</i>

458
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,542
<i>Not many relics were left.</i>

459
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,501
<i>To us, to Wu San Xing,</i>

460
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:45,459
<i>the value of the copper fish surpasses all.</i>

461
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:46,839
Yes.

462
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:49,292
So what does he have?

463
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,882
What are you drawing?

464
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,250
Wait a minute, I'll be done soon.

465
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,504
What is this?

466
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:14,750
The underwater tomb? You drew it all out?

467
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:17,292
You're great, Michelangelo.

468
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:18,882
What's this?

469
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,375
The route we took?

470
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,260
We haven't been to all parts
of the underwater tomb.

471
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,595
So I drew most of the parts
based on my guessing.

472
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,584
It's detailed enough.

473
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:28,839
Look at this part.

474
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,872
The mezzanine between
the top floor and the tomb beneath...

475
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,417
...is where Wang Zang Hai
kept all his treasured beasts.

476
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:36,999
Beasts like cursed granny and sea monkey...

477
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,657
...got out of here.

478
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,916
Are you saying that
he kept the beasts as his pets?

479
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,840
You could say that.

480
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,083
Ancient royal families...

481
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:46,918
...liked to keep a private zoo
when they were alive.

482
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,500
After they died, they'd move
the animals to the tomb...

483
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:50,464
...as companions.

484
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:54,542
This is very common in
the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor.

485
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,507
Oh, right.

486
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:03,292
You've investigated on Wang Zang Hai
all day, yet you found nothing.

487
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:04,709
Even I know him better than you do.

488
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,916
But people are saying on the internet that...

489
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,918
...Macau was designed by Wang Zang Hai.

490
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:12,087
Look, is this Snake-Browed Copper Fish?

491
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,299
Red envelope?

492
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:14,542
Forget about the red envelope.

493
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,751
It's just an application that gives out
red envelope to those with the fastest answer.

494
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,292
Does it contain information
about Wang Zang Hai?

495
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:26,459
This is where we found Ning, right?

496
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,215
Yes.

497
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:40,439
This where Bro and
the archaeology team fainted.

498
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,459
What happened to Bro is weird.

499
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:46,264
I have seen people putting on
thick makeup to look young.

500
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,083
But I've never seen a man his age...

501
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:51,250
...looking like a twenty-something.

502
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:53,709
Who would believe that?

503
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:56,459
If what happened to Bro's body...

504
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:59,918
...and memory had something to do
with the underwater tomb,

505
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,292
will the other members of the team
had a similar experience?

506
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,549
That's not right.

507
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,000
Why wasn't my third uncle affected?

508
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,167
His hair is getting so thin, he's almost bald.

509
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,674
Maybe it has something to do
with the secret passageway.

510
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,292
Maybe your third uncle had never been there.

511
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:16,257
That's impossible.

512
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:17,504
Have you forgotten?

513
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:20,375
They went in after seeing third uncle go in.

514
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:26,833
But Bro didn't actually see your third uncle.

515
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,090
<i>What's the matter?</i>

516
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:37,667
<i>There's someone in there.</i>

517
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,382
<i>What's going on?</i>

518
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,918
<i>There's someone in there.</i>

519
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,292
<i>Who is there? Come out.</i>

520
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:46,958
<i>It's Wu San Xing.</i>

521
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:48,167
<i>I saw his face.</i>

522
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:50,242
<i>Are you sure?</i>

523
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,838
<i>Did you really see him?</i>

524
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,998
<i>I just saw half of his face.</i>

525
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,382
Right.

526
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,039
There was only a female member
named Huo Ling saw my uncle.

527
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,090
No.

528
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,625
The lady named Huo Ling said...

529
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:10,834
...she saw my uncle.

530
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,209
Maybe she didn't actually see your uncle.

531
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,125
Maybe...

532
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:16,751
...she didn't see anyone.

533
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:18,250
Why would she lie, then?

534
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,792
It doesn't make sense for her to lie.

535
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:24,375
Unless she mistook sea monkey as your uncle.

536
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,501
That's impossible.

537
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:29,083
If she did see the sea monkey,
she would have been attacked.

538
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,840
Maybe the monkey
was intimidated by the crowd.

539
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:33,674
That's not right.

540
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:40,174
I remembered something.

541
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,709
Bro and Chen Wen Jin...

542
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,709
...were on the monkey statue when they saw
someone combing their hair by the monument.

543
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:46,959
But they didn't see who was that.

544
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,125
Huo Ling was the only one who went over...

545
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,375
...and startled the person.

546
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,667
And only Huo Ling called...

547
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:53,834
...my uncle's name.

548
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,209
You mean that person wasn't your uncle.

549
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:58,839
Think about it.

550
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:01,167
My uncle is very alert.

551
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:02,501
Unless it's Bro.

552
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:06,920
Or else he would have noticed people like
Chen Wen Jin once they showed up.

553
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
He wouldn't be combing his hair
or looking for marks...

554
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:09,754
...right in front of them.

555
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,959
You might be right. There are a lot of
creepy things happen in the tomb.

556
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,838
The archaeology team
is such an interesting one.

557
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:16,459
Your uncle and Xie Lian Huan...

558
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:18,910
...both started off as tomb raiders,
the successors of The Mystic Nine.

559
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,990
And who else?

560
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:23,466
Well.

561
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:27,915
If Huo Ling was from
the Huos of The Mystic Nine,

562
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,042
then there are three of them.

563
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,417
Was it an archaeology team
or a tomb raider team?

564
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,876
If Huo Ling...

565
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,792
...was from the Huos,

566
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:38,834
she must have known Uncle and Xie Lian Huan.

567
00:36:39,334 --> 00:36:40,999
But we can't confirm her identity yet.

568
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:43,250
What I really want to know now...

569
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,125
...is whether she really saw my Uncle or not.

570
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:47,626
Enough, stop worrying about that.

571
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,042
We're still unclear about
what is happening now.

572
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,709
Let alone things happened over 10 years ago.

573
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,916
Just let Bro take care of the archaeology team.

574
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,459
I'm more interested in finding out
if the Heavenly Palace is real.

575
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:03,209
If Wang Zang Hai wasn't pleasing himself,

576
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:05,959
then what we saw on the mural was real.

577
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,125
The Heavenly Palace does exist.

578
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:10,999
What's unknown is who was buried there.

579
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,501
It must be someone from the royal family.

580
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,667
Or it could be someone who was really rich.

581
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,629
Or else how could he afford
to hire Wang Zang Hai to design his tomb?

582
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:19,292
Not necessarily.

583
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,209
Have you forgotten what we saw?

584
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,958
Their costumes weren't from the Ming dynasty.

585
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,254
They looked more like a minority clan.

586
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,709
Mr Naive.

587
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,334
Don't be a racist.

588
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:29,125
Can't minorities be rich?

589
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:31,375
The key is to locate its position...

590
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:33,375
...on Changbai Mountain.

591
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,834
Treasure hunting?

592
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:39,042
With your alertness,

593
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:42,209
you'll be perfect as
a Chaoyang informant in Beijing.

594
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:45,042
I don't have much clue.

595
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:46,375
How would I know?

596
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:49,417
Even if you know, you wouldn't tell me.

597
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,083
Do you have your temporary ID card?

598
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:22,042
We're going back to Beijing.

599
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:25,667
With his birthday stated on his ID card,

600
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,584
will the security let Bro through...

601
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:31,375
...to board the plane?

602
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,792
Does he even have an ID card?

603
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:39,417
This may be one of the
top ten mysteries of the year.

604
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:42,042
I'll ask him the next time I see him.

605
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:44,501
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll see him again.

606
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:47,591
All right. This is my stop.

607
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,792
All good things must come to an end.

608
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:54,584
But at least we had fun.

609
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,626
Bring me along when there are rewarding jobs.

610
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,341
Don't worry, I got you.

611
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:02,382
All right.

612
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:03,549
Bye.

613
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:40,334
Wu Xie.

614
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:42,923
Pan Zi.

615
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:44,667
Have a seat, Wu Xie.

616
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:45,832
I'll get you some water.

617
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:49,549
Pan Zi.

618
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:51,542
Where's my Uncle's laptop?

619
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:53,542
Look for it yourself.

620
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:54,466
It's on the table.

621
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:03,087
<i>-Stop right there.
-Uncle.</i>

622
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,007
<i>-Stop chasing me.
-Stop!</i>

623
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,292
<i>Are you trying to piss me off?</i>

624
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:09,250
<i>Your item is exactly what the museum lacks.</i>

625
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:13,632
<i>I'll donate you to the museum right now.</i>

626
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,751
<i>Just hit me.</i>

627
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:16,083
<i>Do you think I won't?</i>

628
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:17,876
<i>Do you think I won't?</i>

629
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:19,507
<i>Tell me.</i>

630
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,506
<i>Did I make myself clear?
You still want me to donate?</i>

631
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:22,709
<i>-Please be gentle.
-Donate?</i>

632
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,447
<i>I was wrong.</i>

633
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,850
<i>But still, I have to hand it over
to the country.</i>

634
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:28,242
<i>You're trying to piss me off?</i>

635
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:30,765
<i>You can't keep running away from me.</i>

636
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:55,965
Pan Zi.

637
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,292
This is not my Uncle's laptop.

638
00:40:58,667 --> 00:40:59,834
Where is his laptop?

639
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,334
I don't know.

640
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,716
Here's your water.

641
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:11,000
Where did Uncle go?

642
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:12,876
He went overseas for vacation.

643
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:14,007
When did he leave?

644
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,087
It's been more than a month.

645
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,751
He went alone?

646
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:17,758
Yes.

647
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,840
Wu Xie.

648
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,501
What's going on?

649
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:24,959
A few days ago,

650
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:27,167
someone told me that
Uncle went missing in Hainan.

651
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,157
I called and asked the staff in the shop.

652
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,417
They have no idea where did he go.

653
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:31,792
I wanted to call you.

654
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:33,323
But I didn't have your number.

655
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,417
There's no need for Master Wu to tell them.

656
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:39,751
But I'm sure he's not in Hainan.

657
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,709
Can you still reach Uncle now?

658
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,007
Pan Zi.

659
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,125
From what you say,

660
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:57,667
not only can you not reach Uncle,

661
00:41:57,792 --> 00:41:59,083
but you don't know where he went...

662
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:02,542
...and you aren't even sure
if he's really abroad.

663
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:05,918
It means he went missing, isn't it?

664
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:12,132
Okay.

665
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,459
Since Uncle is not here, I'll ask you.

666
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:22,000
Did he mention about
an underwater tomb in Xisha?

667
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:23,923
I don't know.

668
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,375
Wang Zang Hai archaeology team's shipwreck?

669
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:31,341
How about...

670
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:33,049
...Ning?

671
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,584
I've heard about her.

672
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,584
Do you know Ning has a company?

673
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:40,999
Master Wu said that
Ning's boss is called Cox Hendry.

674
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,424
He's always mixing in
with those antique sellers.

675
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,751
Cox Hendry?

676
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:51,250
<i>I need to know
the whereabouts of Wu San Xing.</i>

677
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:54,292
<i>And keep an eye on Wu San Ju.</i>
