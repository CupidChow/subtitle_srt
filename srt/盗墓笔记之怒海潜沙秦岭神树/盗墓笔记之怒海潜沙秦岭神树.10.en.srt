1
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,890
"Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,200
"Episode 10"

3
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,250
They are not matched.

4
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,751
Besides, look at those placed in the middle,

5
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,999
they are not eye-catching.

6
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,334
What kind of style is this?

7
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,125
The ones on the sides, the middle one...

8
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:25,834
Just forget about it.

9
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,789
Let's look around for
the Snake-Browed Copper Fish.

10
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:28,958
Snake-Browed Copper Horse.

11
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,417
Snake-Browed Copper Ox.

12
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:50,382
Fatty, look.

13
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,203
This will reduce the
lifespan of the painting.

14
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:57,254
Painting should be
kept away from light and dust.

15
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,000
Especially the UV...

16
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,916
...which will cause great damage
to the painting.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
It will make them hard and brittle.

18
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:03,999
I need to talk to the curator.

19
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,417
This is too unprofessional.

20
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:06,916
Don't. It's not necessary to do that.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is not your shop.

22
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:12,375
But the light makes you
can't even look at the painting properly.

23
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,042
Excuse me, Sir.

24
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:17,792
-Hello.
-I need to talk with Hendry.

25
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:18,799
Hendry?

26
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,959
You can find him over there.

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,751
-Okay, thanks.
-That's all right.

28
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:25,118
It's not necessary to do that.

29
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,542
He's meddlesome.

30
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,584
Those are the things
that everyone tried to get their hands on.

31
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:32,758
And of course,

32
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,958
if you ask how much of these,

33
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:37,959
but it's really hard for me
to give you any idea.

34
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,125
These things need to be organised.

35
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,209
Excuse me, Sir.

36
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,007
May I talk with Hendry?

37
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:49,382
Wait a moment.

38
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,861
-I will find you later.
-All right.

39
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,125
What's the matter? May I help you?

40
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:55,379
Good to see you.

41
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:56,375
My name is Wu Xie.

42
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:58,751
Hello, Mr Wu.

43
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,532
You speak very fluent Mandarin.

44
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,709
I lived in China for a long time.

45
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,375
It's a beautiful country.

46
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:06,965
Thank you.

47
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:08,876
What can I help you?

48
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:11,716
Here's the thing.

49
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,999
I'm very passionate about relics.

50
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,329
I'm honoured to have the chance
to visit this museum.

51
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,048
But I've noticed some problem.

52
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,742
The preservation of certain
precious relics should be improved.

53
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:21,866
For example, those paintings.

54
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,999
If the lighting could be slightly adjusted,

55
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,334
-then they will...
-Precious?

56
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,083
Is that praise for those waster paper?

57
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,341
Waste paper?

58
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,959
Most of them are relics
from Ming and Qing dynasties.

59
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:37,584
The painters were nobodies.

60
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:38,709
They aren't worth much.

61
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,208
For me,

62
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,626
they are not much different from waste paper.

63
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:43,875
But you collected them.

64
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,519
You have the duty to protect them.

65
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,754
This is your responsibility.

66
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,167
It's an investment, Sir.

67
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,667
It's just an investment.

68
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,375
In my museum,

69
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,083
there are many relics
that are more valuable than them.

70
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:57,709
Though, it still needs some embellishments.

71
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:00,709
I understand now.

72
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,250
You don't love relics.

73
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,083
You're just a businessman.

74
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:08,501
Whether a businessman or an art collector,

75
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:09,959
it's just a label.

76
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:10,999
Anyway,

77
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,709
Chinese should thank me and people like me.

78
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:15,341
Okay, I understand.

79
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,751
But you should understand...

80
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,999
...that if these relics
are better preserved,

81
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,323
they will be more valuable.

82
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:21,424
Yes.

83
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:22,542
It's not difficult...

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,334
...and doesn't cost much.

85
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,876
But unless I could live longer,

86
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:30,000
these relics will belong to me forever.

87
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,125
Otherwise their future is worthless to me.

88
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,049
Why can't you think about future generations?

89
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,834
To a dead man,

90
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,375
gratitude and hatred are meaningless.

91
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:42,709
Mr Hendry.

92
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,697
What's the most important for you?

93
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,292
Life and death.

94
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,584
So he's Hendry?

95
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,716
It looked like you were having a fight.

96
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,209
I've walked around.

97
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:07,549
There's no fish.

98
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:09,542
That reminds me.

99
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,527
I forgot to ask about the auction.

100
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:12,750
Don't worry.

101
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:13,674
Ask again.

102
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,334
Hello, hello.

103
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,042
Come on.

104
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:21,667
You ask, hurry up.

105
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:23,959
Excuse me, Sir. Do you know about
the auction in here?

106
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,087
I'm sorry, Sir.

107
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,327
You must've mistaken.

108
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,792
There's no auction here.

109
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,915
That's fine. I'll show you the picture.

110
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:31,876
Give me a second.

111
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,214
Do you know the Chinese snake?

112
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:40,375
I know this museum has a Chinese snake.

113
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:41,382
Do you know this?

114
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,667
I'm sorry, Sir. I've
never seen this before.

115
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,356
Why did he shake his head?

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,209
He has never seen the copper fish.

117
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,049
-There's no auction either.
-No.

118
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,083
No...

119
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,501
We came for this.

120
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:54,792
We came abroad.

121
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:58,708
We took a flight from Beijing to come here.

122
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,584
We came all the way here.
How is it possible?

123
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,923
Sorry, Sir.

124
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,916
We saw that on your museum's website.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,501
We came here just for the Chinese snake.

126
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:11,336
What kind of Chinese snake do you have?

127
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,542
I'm sorry. I have no idea.

128
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,041
I told you it was a scam message.

129
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,501
Why didn't we check it thoroughly
before we came here?

130
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,209
Geez.

131
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,000
It's weird.

132
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,250
Uncle?

133
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:32,549
What?

134
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,626
What are you doing?

135
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:45,999
What are you looking for?

136
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:48,750
I saw my Uncle.

137
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:49,671
Uncle?

138
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,375
What are your Uncle doing here abroad?

139
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,299
It can't be.

140
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,870
I'll look around to find him.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,840
You...

142
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:58,298
And you were so sure about the auction of
the Snake-Browed Copper Fish.

143
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:17,716
You...

144
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:42,256
Where is he?

145
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,674
Where is he?

146
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,334
That's really your Uncle.

147
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:50,876
What is he doing there?

148
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,834
Why is he with that guy?

149
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,334
Who's that guy?

150
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,610
He was with the curator in the museum.

151
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,792
But I have no idea about his identity.

152
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:01,716
Hendry.

153
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,375
Go ask him, then.

154
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:04,382
Hurry up.

155
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,166
Hello, can you help us to take a picture?

156
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,170
It's okay, take the picture.

157
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,290
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

158
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,667
-Done.
-Thank you.

159
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,250
Fatty, where's Uncle?

160
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:18,341
He's gone.

161
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,125
He disappeared the same way as Bro.

162
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,090
Geez.

163
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:22,626
He's gone. What should we do?

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,417
Let's go after the foreigner.

165
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,341
Let's go.

166
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:49,999
Follow him.

167
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:08,876
You drive this same car in China.

168
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,612
And you rented the same model
in a foreign country as well.

169
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,584
Do you have an obsession with it?

170
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,269
Was your ex-girlfriend called Maserati?

171
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:16,999
Don't disturb me.

172
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:26,716
The guy has taken the case my uncle gave him.

173
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,375
Where is he going?

174
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,000
He certainly can't be meeting your uncle.

175
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,150
He certainly can't be meeting him
both morning and afternoon.

176
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,020
It's not like they're in a relationship.

177
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,299
Fatty.

178
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:43,250
How is my Uncle related to Hendry...

179
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,125
...and this tall guy?

180
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,250
And what's the auction about?

181
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,417
Is the Snake-Browed Copper Fish
in the museum?

182
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,341
Wait.

183
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,584
Can you ask me something that I know?

184
00:10:58,876 --> 00:10:59,716
Fatty.

185
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:04,042
I feel like my life is a giant puzzle.

186
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,250
It's like there's an exit everywhere.

187
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,132
But you only notice
when you walk out of one...

188
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,792
...that they all lead to a dead end.

189
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:11,716
No.

190
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,750
Can you control your emotion?

191
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,634
You don't have to be so serious all the time.

192
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,501
-No.
-What if you suffered from depression?

193
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:22,965
Think about it.

194
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,876
The message that we received in Beijing
and the website...

195
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:28,751
...led us to here.

196
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:30,156
And we both thought that...

197
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
...we could find
the Snake-Browed Copper Fish here.

198
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,375
But we found nothing
now that we're finally here.

199
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,459
I've been trying to say...

200
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,792
...this whole thing is filled with
one word, schemes, and...

201
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:42,999
No, two words. Schemes and tricks.

202
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,959
You're saying that someone is setting us up?

203
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:49,501
There are only a few people
who are capable of drawing you...

204
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,292
...away from China.

205
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:56,215
This is not what my uncle would do.

206
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,782
Stop talking about your uncle all the time.

207
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,334
What about the other one?

208
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,959
Ning.

209
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,125
Ning?

210
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,334
Her company?

211
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,792
But why?

212
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,900
She didn't kill you in the underwater tomb.

213
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,020
So she's trying to kill you
in a foreign country.

214
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:18,876
If she kills you here,
people wouldn't find out.

215
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,799
Besides,

216
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,334
the cost to kill you this time is low.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,583
You even bought the ticket yourself.

218
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,792
She's way too smart.

219
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,574
But Ning doesn't know about
the Snake-Browed Copper Fish.

220
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,299
Not necessarily.

221
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:36,501
Ning used your uncle
to draw you to the underwater tomb.

222
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,916
And she was so convincing
when she was talking about...

223
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,916
...your uncle and the archaeology team.

224
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,709
Maybe she knows Xie Lian Huan had
the Snake-Browed Copper Fish...

225
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:46,334
...when he died.

226
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,709
But the picture of the copper fish
on that website is real.

227
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,709
The Snake-Browed Copper Fish is with Ning?

228
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:13,751
Great.

229
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,000
She just revealed herself.

230
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:18,875
I'm impressed.

231
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,042
You solved the case bit by bit.

232
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,042
Look at their firearms. They're real.

233
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:11,916
It's not a military base, is it?

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,501
I don't think so.

235
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,135
Hello, Sir. May I have
your invitation card?

236
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,566
Fatty, we can only get in
with an invitation card.

237
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,709
Yes, what should we do?

238
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:44,983
How would I know?

239
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,696
Do I look like an invitation card?

240
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,780
Figure it out.

241
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,750
-Sir.
-Forget it, just go.

242
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,667
Here... This...

243
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:52,625
Hurry up and go.

244
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,209
Let's go in separately.

245
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,254
I'll meet you in there.

246
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,215
-See you later.
-Okay.

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,459
What should I do?

248
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:09,708
Please hold on.
May I have your invitation card?

249
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,583
Hello. I'm the guest here.

250
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:12,915
I forgot to bring my invitation card.

251
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,587
Can you let me attend the event tonight?

252
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,667
I'm sorry. Only those with
an invitation card are allowed in.

253
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:17,871
I really have an invitation card.

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,166
But if I go back to get it,

255
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,330
I will miss the event.

256
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,083
Tonight is very important to me.

257
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,500
Sorry, Sir. I can only let you in
if you have an invitation card.

258
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:25,424
But...

259
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:27,167
Your invitation card is here.

260
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,501
Please wait. May I have
your invitation card?

261
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,987
I came with her.

262
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:38,758
Tina.

263
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,639
You go back first, I'll talk to you later.

264
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,042
How could she dump me because of a guy?

265
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,792
She's annoying.

266
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:54,542
Why would you help me?

267
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,209
On a beautiful night like this,

268
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,167
I need a young and handsome partner.

269
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:01,667
Help me to put it on.

270
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:05,918
It's my honour.

271
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:17,125
What should I do?

272
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,466
Let's go.

273
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:54,709
Are you serious?

274
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,500
What is wrong with you?

275
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,132
-So sorry.
-Take a look at it.

276
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,333
You ruined my shirt.

277
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,254
I didn't mean it.

278
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:01,459
I'll make it up for you.

279
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:03,667
Good evening, Sir.

280
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:05,174
Please.

281
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:07,674
Please, Sir.

282
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:08,999
Please, Miss.

283
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,549
Hands up.

284
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:12,917
Okay, please.

285
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,166
-Please.
-Good evening.

286
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,214
Put your hands up.

287
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:18,758
Okay.

288
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:20,866
May I see your invitation card?

289
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,083
He's with me.

290
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:28,583
That's my friend.

291
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,375
If he's not coming, I'm not coming.

292
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:31,299
I'm sorry, please.

293
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:33,341
This way, please.

294
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:34,591
Put your hands up.

295
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,507
Thank you.

296
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,334
Nice to meet you today.

297
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,501
I think tonight will be a wonderful night.

298
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,000
Hello, Alice.

299
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:51,918
My friend is over there.

300
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,250
Let me take you there
and introduce her to you.

301
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,049
Okay.

302
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,226
But my friends happen to be here, too.

303
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,254
I would like to find them first.

304
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,876
I'll meet you later, okay?

305
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,792
But you could see my friend first
before you see yours.

306
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,083
I'll be back soon.

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,840
Okay.

308
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,466
Father.

309
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:04,799
Whenever I look at the silk book,
I think about human history.

310
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:09,209
There are so many mysterious treasures.

311
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,340
You see.

312
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,208
If it wasn't for the inspiration
I got from a silk book...

313
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,751
...and a Chinese tapestry,

314
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:22,334
who would have thought
that a silk book would be a pattern.

315
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,042
This is the pattern from the silk book?

316
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,049
Yes.

317
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,250
What does it mean?

318
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,292
We're still working on it.

319
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:40,758
What?

320
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,083
I can't believe we have got it...

321
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,000
...after so many years of searching.

322
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:47,257
Yes.

323
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:50,834
I've spent most of my life
solving this puzzle.

324
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,999
You know, soon my time will be up.

325
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,667
I know vampires are timeless.

326
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:01,709
But for them, there's only darkness.

327
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,375
Where's the meaning in that?

328
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:05,000
You are right, Ning.

329
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:08,000
If there is a way to live forever,

330
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:12,999
without the need to hide in the darkness
like vampires,

331
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,542
would you use it?

332
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:16,716
For sure.

333
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:17,882
Me too.

334
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,334
But that's extremely unlikely.

335
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,959
Otherwise the world...

336
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:26,167
...would be full with ageless humans.

337
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:30,292
Maybe it's something
only few people can access...

338
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:34,125
...and it's full of unpredictable changes.

339
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:36,758
Father.

340
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,459
You make it sound real.

341
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,334
Is the auction ready?

342
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Everything's ready.

343
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,500
The person you asked for has arrived.

344
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:54,042
I hope this man will not disappoint me.

345
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,999
I will talk to your manager.

346
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,459
I didn't mean it.

347
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,215
I'm so sorry.

348
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:18,501
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:21,716
Come with me.

350
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,090
No.

351
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,159
Come with me.

352
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:38,174
Let's go.

353
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:44,042
My call...

354
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:03,799
Have you found it?

355
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,959
The angle is not good.

356
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,834
Look towards your 11.00.

357
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,132
Okay.

358
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:44,918
This should be enough.

359
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:46,918
I'm looking like a fool.

360
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,291
And I don't think this catalog
contains all the exhibits.

361
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,215
Yes.

362
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:09,584
Let me take a look at this.

363
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,375
Number 105.

364
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:13,876
Do you like this one?

365
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:18,916
This exhibit looks good.

366
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,542
Yeah, Honey, I like this one.

367
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,125
Miss, can I have a drink with you?

368
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:25,792
I'm sorry, I...

369
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,584
I'm sorry.

370
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:33,952
Why don't you have a drink with him?

371
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,626
I could have a drink with you.

372
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,542
How is it? Can you hear me clearly?

373
00:23:58,334 --> 00:23:59,374
Do you want me to go over?

374
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:27,375
-Hello.
-Sir.

375
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,291
Do you have cocktail?

376
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,240
Wine.

377
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,166
No...

378
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,334
-I don't want wine.
-Good.

379
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:33,875
I want cocktail.

380
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,626
-Very good wine.
-No.

381
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,792
Okay, never mind.

382
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,042
So sorry.

383
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,167
How did you get into this place?

384
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,167
Is this how you talk to the guest?

385
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,132
No.

386
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,045
We got in together
but our identities are different.

387
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,375
I want to be a guest, too.

388
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,659
I don't want to be a waiter.

389
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,334
Do you want something to drink?

390
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,083
No, thanks.

391
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:11,231
The Snake-Browed Copper Fish is here.

392
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:13,333
What's its number? Find out its number.

393
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:14,626
It's really there.

394
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,208
Our trip here isn't a waste of time.

395
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:18,876
Ladies and gentlemen,
this auction will start soon.

396
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:21,083
If you like any items,

397
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,709
just raise your hands
with the bidding number.

398
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:25,834
Find a seat.

399
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:27,417
Stop talking to the waiter.

400
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:28,941
If you want to bid.

401
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,459
Someone will contact you...

402
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:35,876
...about the payment and how
to take away the property.

403
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:38,250
That's for sure, of course.

404
00:25:38,918 --> 00:25:40,292
It's called delivery.

405
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:41,257
Now,

406
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:42,299
everybody,

407
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,709
let's see the first item of the day.

408
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:52,341
Please.

409
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:56,584
Ladies and gentlemen.

410
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,292
As you can see,

411
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,667
this is a Buddha statue from India.

412
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:04,958
It was brought to the United States
by American businessman...

413
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:06,762
...in the 17th century.

414
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:11,042
So the bidding price
for this item is two million.

415
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,125
Two million.

416
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:14,542
Three million.

417
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:17,209
Four million over there.

418
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:18,916
Ladies and gentlemen.

419
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,417
Four million for the statue.

420
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,000
Five million here.

421
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,125
<i>What about six million?</i>

422
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:29,375
<i>Six million for the item.</i>

423
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:33,167
<i>Anyone?</i>

424
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:35,792
Six million once.

425
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,042
That gentleman, six million.

426
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:43,834
Six million once.

427
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:44,959
Let's wrap it up.

428
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,167
Deal!

429
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,334
Congratulations to this gentleman.

430
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:50,959
Wonderful piece of art.

431
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:25,174
Look.

432
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:26,839
He's out.

433
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,375
He looks furtive.

434
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,923
Let's go. Follow him.

435
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:38,716
Fatty.

436
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,840
-It's over?
-Let's go.

437
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:42,174
Who?

438
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:44,584
That Audi right ahead.

439
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,083
That car? All right.

440
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,792
Why did he come back to this place?

441
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,792
These guys do bad things...

442
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:01,958
...yet they still pray for blessings
from Buddha.

443
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:02,999
What's the point?

444
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,379
This place is filled with different kinds
of people and lots of tourists.

445
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:06,792
It's just camouflage for them.

446
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,674
Let's go check it out.

447
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:30,083
I think I've seen this guy before.

448
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:33,002
Where did you see him?

449
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:34,666
In Beijing Antique Market.

450
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:37,083
He's an expert in Chinese culture.

451
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:40,542
He's especially interested in
traditional handicrafts.

452
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:41,915
He learns from masters all over.

453
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,919
But he uses his skills to do bad things.

454
00:29:44,626 --> 00:29:48,834
He has dealt with Mr Han, Mr Sun
and Master Zao before.

455
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,626
Selling relics overseas.

456
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:52,542
An auctioneer...

457
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,459
...and a relic seller.

458
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:59,542
I think they were selling their items
through the auction.

459
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,605
I wouldn't feel sympathise to them...

460
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:05,709
...even if they're executed by having
their bodies shot at for five minutes.

461
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,250
What's wrong with you?

462
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,330
Feeling sleepy because
you didn't sleep last night?

463
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:45,257
Fatty.

464
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,106
Did you see that building behind you?

465
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:53,341
Without faith,

466
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:55,794
a golden pagoda like this
wouldn't be constructed.

467
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,807
It serves like a support for the faith...

468
00:30:58,292 --> 00:30:59,626
...that is guarding this town...

469
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:01,959
...and protecting the residents here.

470
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:03,965
So,

471
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:05,382
faith...

472
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:06,834
...is really important.

473
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:08,709
What do you mean?

474
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,090
Fatty.

475
00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:12,594
Do you have faith?

476
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:13,839
Yes.

477
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:15,965
You know, it's this.

478
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:21,250
What is your faith?

479
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:26,250
I want to do everything meaningful.

480
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:33,758
Fatty.

481
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,257
Tonight, we must win the bidding on
the Snake-Browed Copper Fish.

482
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,333
Mr Wang.

483
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,333
It's okay for you to joke around
at other times.

484
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:10,125
But can't you be helpful
at this critical moment?

485
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,209
Get lost!

486
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,459
I've known you for many years...

487
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:16,229
...but I've never asked for your help.

488
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,375
But this time,

489
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,876
I'm really in troubles.

490
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:22,622
Can you lend me some money?

491
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,999
How's things on your end?

492
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:27,466
Yes.

493
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,840
I understand.

494
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,174
So the money...

495
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:37,876
Hello?

496
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:54,542
Hello, Mr Lee.

497
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm Wu Xie.

498
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:58,250
-<i>Wu Xie.</i>
-Yes, I called you just now.

499
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:00,882
I know you were busy so you didn't pick up.

500
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:03,292
<i>I have heard about your case.</i>

501
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:04,781
<i>You want to borrow money, right?</i>

502
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:06,132
Yes.

503
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:07,461
You have heard about it?

504
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,399
I'm sorry to bother you.

505
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,250
Can you lend me some money?

506
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:41,839
I don't want it.

507
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,542
I said I don't want it.

508
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,632
What do you mean?

509
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,167
I sold a house on Beike.

510
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:01,334
Hurry up and take it. It's heavy.

511
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:06,664
I'll put this down for you.

512
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,834
I might need some time to pay you back.

513
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:13,965
Oh, right.

514
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:17,032
I've cleared my gambling debt.

515
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,965
Don't ask me to do
everything you want anymore.

516
00:35:31,584 --> 00:35:32,984
Then, I won't pay you back.

517
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:42,375
Let's go.

518
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:34,299
Get ready.

519
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:41,626
Ladies and gentlemen.

520
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:43,626
It was a wonderful evening.

521
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:47,375
I'm very glad that everyone
could come to today's auction.

522
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:51,918
And I'm very pleased
to introduce a new item to you.

523
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:54,626
Please.

524
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,292
This is a good stuff.

525
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,375
What is it doing here?

526
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:27,292
It's normal, isn't it?

527
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:31,334
Some of the China's relics were lost
during the fire in Yuanmingyuan Park.

528
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:33,083
But this item is rare even in China.

529
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,337
I've never seen such a good stuff
being in this industry for many years.

530
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:37,584
They're all overseas.

531
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:40,459
Well, ladies and gentlemen.

532
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:45,501
It's the most beautiful vase in
Yuanmingyuan of the Qing dynasty.

533
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,625
There is a touching story
behind this porcelain vase.

534
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:50,549
It can't be.

535
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:53,586
China's relics must not
fall into foreigners' hands.

536
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,999
There are thousands of these relics overseas.

537
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,083
They are all good stuff.

538
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,292
Even if you can save this one,
can you save all of them?

539
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:00,257
Just forget about it.

540
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:01,459
Of course.

541
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:04,916
Let me tell you the touching story behind it.

542
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,042
Only the luckiest man
could have this beautiful vase.

543
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,083
It was in Qing dynasty.

544
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:17,106
And it is right now in the modern world.

545
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,042
He's right.

546
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:21,239
This vase was from Emperor Kangxi's period.

547
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:23,125
It's very valuable and rare.

548
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,667
What's he talking about?

549
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:29,392
They use this beautiful vase
as the symbol of their love.

550
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,877
He's introducing the history of this relic.

551
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,163
It was from Yuanmingyuan.

552
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:34,822
It's Dowager Cixi's favourite item.

553
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,542
Look, the timing matches.

554
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:40,125
But Uncle Sam does not wish this to happen.

555
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,918
He must let her go now.

556
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:45,125
Ladies and gentlemen.

557
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,667
The price of this porcelain bottle
is ten million.

558
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,167
Ladies and gentlemen.

559
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,999
I've got 11 million over there.

560
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,501
-Xiu Xiu.
-Ladies and gentlemen, 11 million.

561
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:03,542
Ladies and gentlemen, 11 million going once.

562
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,167
11 million.

563
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,999
12 million now.

564
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,632
Ladies and gentlemen, over here.

565
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:12,003
Think properly, that's a porcelain vase.

566
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,257
It's not the copper fish.

567
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,999
I know. We can't let foreigners
to win the bid.

568
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:16,923
<i>It's him.</i>

569
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,079
<i>I'll play with you.</i>

570
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:23,257
-This lady bids for 13 million.
-Wait a minute.

571
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:25,459
Chinese. She's Chinese.

572
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:26,965
Chinese won the bid. Stop bidding.

573
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,167
Don't move.

574
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,382
Don't act on impulse.

575
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,459
13 million.

576
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:35,959
14 million now from the gentleman.

577
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,584
14 million, ladies and gentlemen.

578
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,751
I've got a 15 million.

579
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:43,167
What are you doing?

580
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:45,501
15 million, ladies and gentlemen.

581
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,999
Now, 16 million from the
first row of woman in the middle.

582
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,333
All right, just let her win the bid.

583
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:54,671
Do you have to compete with her?

584
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:56,631
Do you think you're capable
to compete with her?

585
00:39:57,626 --> 00:40:00,083
Is 16 million the highest bid?

586
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,583
Ladies and gentlemen, anyone else?

587
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,876
16 million going once.

588
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,125
16 million.

589
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,125
Isn't that Wu Xie?

590
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:10,879
What is he doing here?

591
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,375
Who's the one besides him?

592
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,042
He is Fatty Wang.

593
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:18,626
16 million going twice.

594
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,792
17 million...

595
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:26,667
...from the young gentleman
sitting in the first row on my right.

596
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,459
17 million.

597
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:38,999
Think carefully.

598
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,880
Which is more important?
The Snake-Browed Copper Fish,

599
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,751
your uncle or this porcelain vase?

600
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:45,299
Stop bidding.

601
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,042
Stop bidding. Give it to me.

602
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:48,501
Stop bidding.

603
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,459
18 million.

604
00:40:56,584 --> 00:41:00,000
Still the young gentleman
on my right in the second row.

605
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,542
<i>18 million, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

606
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,194
Hello, is this the police station?

607
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:10,876
Wonderful, ladies and gentlemen.
18 million now.

608
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:12,709
Since when has Wu Xie become so rich?

609
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,584
Ladies and gentlemen,

610
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,250
18 million sold!

611
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:20,334
This vase belongs to
this young gentleman now.

612
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,083
That's my money.

613
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,999
Police will be here in ten minutes.

614
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,209
Ladies and gentlemen.

615
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:37,083
Please calm down.

616
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:41,501
I just received a tip saying that...

617
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:44,999
...the police will arrive in ten minutes.

618
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,501
Did you do that?

619
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,600
<i>Good that you know it.</i>

620
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,125
Stop smiling.

621
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:52,626
What should we do now?

622
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:54,923
Get off work.

623
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:58,667
There is no need to panic.

624
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:01,458
Ten minutes is enough for everyone to leave.

625
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:02,382
Thank you.
