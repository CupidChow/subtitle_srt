"Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,180
"Episode 1"

3
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,125
You bastard.

4
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,083
I've spoiled you too much.

5
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,334
What did I tell you?

6
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,042
I've told you a million times.

7
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,360
Don't look at your grandpa's notes!

8
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,660
You just had to look!

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,876
Having nightmares?

10
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:16,292
That's not it, Uncle.

11
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:17,839
Look at this.

12
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:19,876
This Snake-Browed Copper Fish...

13
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,209
...is different from the one
that Grandpa recorded in his notes.

14
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,542
I've searched through
every page of his notes.

15
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:25,880
Really,

16
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,030
I just can't find...

17
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,180
"Wu San Xing, you unfilial son!"

18
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,200
Look!

19
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,480
Uncle!

20
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:41,709
Uncle?

21
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:26,042
Having nightmares again?

22
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:29,292
How many times have I told you?

23
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,918
Don't look at your grandpa's notes.

24
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,840
Uncle.

25
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,020
You're awake.

26
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,459
What did you dream of?

27
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,959
I just dreamed...

28
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,792
...that you're an evil person.

29
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,501
Is that so?

30
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:53,125
Okay, I shall not disturb you any longer.

31
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,060
I'm going to bed.

32
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,007
You should rest early too.

33
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,420
Uncle.

34
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,120
You're not sleeping?

35
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:22,292
You woke me up.

36
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:23,923
I can't sleep.

37
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:25,923
Let's have a drink.

38
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Okay.

39
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,215
I'll take the beer out.

40
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,500
Here.

41
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Uncle.

42
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,480
Uncle.

43
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,040
"Come to Hainan now
if you want to save your uncle!"

44
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:13,751
You must be Mr Wu.

45
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,300
-I am.
-This is for you.

46
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,020
"Qing Shui Bay Private Pier"

47
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,920
<i>You...</i>

48
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,620
<i>How will you answer to Xie Lian Huan?</i>

49
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,167
<i>How will you answer to the Xie family?</i>

50
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:52,923
<i>You unfilial son!</i>

51
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:25,965
It's you.

52
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:29,466
Long time no see.

53
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:30,882
Follow me.

54
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,380
You were the one who sent me the email?

55
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:37,722
You said my uncle is missing.

56
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:38,632
Is it true?

57
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,209
You still came without verifying it?

58
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:41,999
I called his shop assistant.

59
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:44,209
They don't know where my uncle is, too.

60
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,417
But, my uncle is a veteran.

61
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,999
I don't believe that he...

62
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:49,125
...is missing.

63
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,083
Your uncle has dealings with our company.

64
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,292
Your company?

65
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:55,125
International Marine Resources
Development Company.

66
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,667
We make use of existing marine routes...

67
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:00,250
...and historical records
to locate shipwrecks.

68
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,334
We salvage the supplies inside them.

69
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:04,667
I know what you mean.

70
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,542
One ship has ten tombs.

71
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,340
The supplies obtained from a sunken ship...

72
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,540
...are worth a king's ransom.

73
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,580
Many foreign antique dealers
want a share of it...

74
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,639
...despite it being illegal.

75
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,459
But, how is this related to my uncle?

76
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,125
This time, your uncle was the one...

77
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,542
...who approached us.

78
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,667
My uncle approached you to work with him?

79
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,320
To resell wrecking goods?

80
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,042
It's marine salvage.

81
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,751
We comply with the law.

82
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:31,918
My uncle approached you,

83
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,180
and you agreed to it?

84
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,167
The last time we met,

85
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,450
you're not so open to negotiations.

86
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,626
Your uncle and my boss
are very close friends.

87
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,209
Besides, his clues are very convincing.

88
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:44,918
That's why our board of directors agreed...

89
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,799
...to sign a collateral mortgage
obligation with him...

90
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:49,257
...and provide him some of our
spare equipment and manpower...

91
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,620
...to conduct a search
in the northern reefs.

92
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,459
Everything went smoothly at first...

93
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:54,876
...until 5 PM two days ago.

94
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:57,584
Their boat has suddenly disappeared
from our GPS tracking system.

95
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,460
We still don't have
any news of them till now.

96
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,834
That's enough explanation from me.

97
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,085
We're running out of time.
Let's go.

98
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,209
My uncle is a seasoned veteran.

99
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,930
Something must be wrong
with the boat's equipment,

100
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,417
and you couldn't detect its signals.

101
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,431
Absolutely impossible.

102
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,209
We only use the most advanced equipment.

103
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:14,959
You knew my uncle is in trouble.

104
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,501
Why are we still wasting time here...

105
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:18,834
...without launching a rescue squad
to look for him?

106
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,667
Your uncle has told us.

107
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:21,792
If he runs into any trouble,

108
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,125
we should look for you first.

109
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,220
Impossible.

110
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,224
My uncle has been raiding for so many years.

111
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:29,876
He has never asked me for help.

112
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:31,876
I won't force you.

113
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,940
Go back, then.

114
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,876
I wasn't kidding when I said
we're running out of time.

115
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,542
It's going to be windy
for the next two weeks.

116
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,542
By then, it will be more difficult
to navigate at sea.

117
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,334
Your temper...

118
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:41,751
...hasn't changed one bit.

119
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,459
You still get worked up so easily.

120
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,417
What you're looking at now are our equipment.

121
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,751
As for this box,

122
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,834
your uncle took a set of equipment here.

123
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,083
See if you have any use
for these things here.

124
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,626
I say, Miss Ning.

125
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,417
With this flimsy boat we're on,

126
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,626
we're bound to the River Acheron.

127
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,680
We're bound to Hell.

128
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,209
This boat is too crappy.

129
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:45,709
My young comrade.

130
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,459
What are you doing here?

131
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,125
How come you're here?

132
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,918
Enjoy your chat.
I'll go up first.

133
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,626
Looks like Ning does have some people skills.

134
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She even got the raider's scion on board.

135
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,876
Come, have a seat.

136
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:01,876
What did Ning tell you?

137
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,790
She asked me if I'd like to explore
an underwater tomb here.

138
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,200
How can I pass this up?

139
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,375
These tombs are so rare.

140
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:08,459
I can't miss this.

141
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:09,382
Underwater tomb?

142
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,542
Ning told me it's a shipwreck, though.

143
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:12,876
It is a shipwreck.

144
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,042
And an underwater tomb.

145
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,770
During the Ming dynasty,

146
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,990
there was a rich guy called Shen.

147
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,994
He's as rich as the emperor.

148
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:19,413
His full name is Shen...

149
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:20,549
Shen.

150
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,720
Shen Wan San?

151
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,790
That's right.

152
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,375
You mean Shen Wan San's son?

153
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:25,806
He was buried underwater.

154
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:26,918
But it was in a lake,

155
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,876
not the sea.

156
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,375
Whoever it was,

157
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,792
he's rich enough to rival
the Dragon King of the Seas.

158
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:35,375
There must be some treasure
that's worth a spot in our antique shop.

159
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:39,751
Underwater tomb.

160
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:42,167
No wonder Uncle's here.

161
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:45,167
By the way, where's Master Wu?

162
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,417
Ning said...

163
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,000
...that while my uncle was searching
the shipwreck for them,

164
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
he went missing.

165
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,459
Missing?

166
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:55,758
You know,

167
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,850
I thought I was just having a trip
on someone else's expense.

168
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,950
Traveling and all.

169
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:02,542
But, when I heard that your uncle's here,

170
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,167
I think we must be hitting the jackpot!

171
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,250
Fortunes are rolling in my way.

172
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,292
I'm going to get rich, you know?

173
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,400
Fatty.

174
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,300
This isn't the time to think
about hitting jackpots!

175
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,250
Listen up.

176
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:15,792
I'm here to look for my uncle.

177
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,750
Another thing.

178
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,180
You can't just simply...

179
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,240
...resell the wrecking goods.

180
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,751
I do whatever I want.

181
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,292
It's rare for us to meet,

182
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,626
yet you're giving me an earful here.

183
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,375
Really, it's none of your business.

184
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:32,667
I don't know which part of Ning's tale...

185
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,000
...is true...

186
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:36,549
...or fake.

187
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:40,709
Listen, this jane may look pretty
like a little dandelion,

188
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,709
but she's actually a scheming,
carnivorous flytrap.

189
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,876
She's full of half-truths and half-lies.

190
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,834
"Devious" is her middle name.

191
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,125
Even the best lie detectors...

192
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,751
...can't detect a single trace from her.

193
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,667
<i>Even flytraps choose their food.</i>

194
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,375
<i>A prey full of fats, cholesterol
and lewd jokes like you...</i>

195
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,410
<i>...is deemed inedible.</i>

196
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:57,792
<i>Come to the deck now.</i>

197
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,290
See?

198
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,264
She's even listening in.

199
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,125
Only lewd people dare to eavesdrop.

200
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:03,549
Let's go.

201
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,834
Don't look anymore, go.

202
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,090
Ning.

203
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,080
Didn't you say that it's a shipwreck?

204
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,667
What's it about the underwater tomb?

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,417
Didn't your uncle mention that to you?

206
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,375
Just get straight and steady to the point.

207
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:32,501
Don't keep us guessing.

208
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,042
Your uncle said that your grandpa's notes...

209
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,542
...mentioned an underwater tomb.

210
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,000
According to the notes,

211
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,980
an archaeological team,
in which your uncle is part of it,

212
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,140
has found the tomb's location.

213
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,250
But, something unknown
happened during the expedition,

214
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,292
so they didn't salvage...

215
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,459
...the shipwreck.

216
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,542
They've classified
all information related to it.

217
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,041
This time, your uncle brought
the information here,

218
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,980
and he's very eager.

219
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,709
So, your claim that this
is a legal marine salvage...

220
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:09,751
...was a lie.

221
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,999
You're using this regular
fishing boat as a rescue boat...

222
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,375
...because your activities...

223
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,980
...have already alerted
the marine customs.

224
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,307
You had to keep this under wraps...

225
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:19,251
...and save my uncle
in secret, right?

226
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,541
These are all trivial matters to me.

227
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,166
Finding your uncle is the priority.

228
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,541
Finding my uncle is important,

229
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:27,834
but this is about principles!

230
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:30,125
This is a matter of life and death.

231
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,276
Let's look for your uncle first.

232
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
We can talk about the rest later, okay?

233
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,959
Your equipment.

234
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,600
This boat...

235
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,870
-No way!
-Mr Zhang.

236
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:44,930
-Mr Zhang.
-No, no.

237
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,999
-Let me introduce...
-No way.

238
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,542
Why not?

239
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,007
My boat...

240
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,542
...can go anywhere.

241
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:51,834
There's no such place as "no".

242
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,334
This boat is too old and small.

243
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:55,334
When the storm comes,

244
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,834
this boat can even capsize.

245
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,620
Touch wood.

246
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,767
Don't talk about the bad things.

247
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,542
That's a foul mouth you have there.

248
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,959
A doomsayer consultant, I see.

249
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,040
Mr Zhang.

250
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,450
Let me introduce these two.

251
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:12,834
This is...

252
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,000
Nice to meet you.

253
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:18,751
My name is Zhang.

254
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,209
My full name is Zhang Hao.

255
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:22,000
Hello, I'm Wu Xie.

256
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,876
I'm Fatty.

257
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,780
Okay.

258
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,620
Mr Zhang...

259
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:29,918
...is an expert in sea relics.

260
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:31,792
I'm not exactly an expert.

261
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,042
I was lucky.

262
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,542
I just happen to publish a few articles...

263
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:37,709
...and gain some achievements.

264
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,042
It's not that great.

265
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:39,972
That's very impressive.

266
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:40,959
You're too modest.

267
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:42,410
Not really.

268
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,000
We're all improving along the way.

269
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,620
See?

270
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,667
That's an expensive watch you have here.

271
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,751
It looks fantastic.

272
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,792
You're a budding talent, Mr Wu.

273
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,880
We're different.

274
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,501
At this age,

275
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,626
we can't do anything now.

276
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,042
It's getting cloudy.

277
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,020
It's cloudy now.

278
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,600
It's okay.

279
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,540
Follow me.

280
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:39,959
Tighten the rope!

281
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,375
Bring the supplies in!

282
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,840
-Everyone ready?
-Can we still move on?

283
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,834
The wind is too strong!

284
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,000
We need to find some shelter!

285
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,292
See? I told you
this boat can't take it!

286
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,834
Can you find a way to bypass the storm?

287
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:50,042
We can't!

288
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,626
The storm moves faster than us!

289
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm afraid it's too late for that!

290
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,876
See? I told you
this boat can't take it!

291
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,042
Shut up!

292
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,375
This is invigorating!

293
00:19:58,459 --> 00:19:59,667
Invigorating, my foot!

294
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,375
Everybody, hold on!

295
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:08,709
Hold on!

296
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,501
Hold on!

297
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:13,999
I'll help him!

298
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,260
What are you doing?

299
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,292
-Wu Xie!
-Watch out!

300
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,709
Don't try to fly if you don't have wings!

301
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:26,626
-Hold on!
-Get in the cabin!

302
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,125
Hurry up!

303
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,459
One of the engines is malfunctioning!

304
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,918
Hurry, fix it!

305
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:33,959
What did he say?

306
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,959
He said one of the engines is broken!

307
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,792
We're really on our way to Hell!

308
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,751
-Fix the radio, go!
-Okay!

309
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,709
Fix the radio!

310
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:50,083
If another boat passes by,

311
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,959
send a distress signal!

312
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,250
-Okay!
-Hurry!

313
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,417
I say,

314
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,375
you're all just a bunch of blockheads!

315
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,501
Stop fooling around here!

316
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:59,417
-Get in the cabin!
-Let's go!

317
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,792
Go, go!

318
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,330
Move!

319
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,240
Get down!

320
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:11,132
Get down!

321
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:13,042
Get down, hurry!

322
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,042
O sea! O sea!

323
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,417
-You're crazy, Fatty!
-Get down!

324
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:18,125
Get down, Fatty!

325
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,580
Fatty!

326
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:29,972
Fatty! Wake up!

327
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:31,375
Let's get him inside!

328
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,580
What's that sound?

329
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,740
I'll check it out.

330
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,501
-Slowly.
-Watch out.

331
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,542
Look over there!
What's that?

332
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,542
What is that?

333
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,480
I don't know.

334
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,167
What is that?

335
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,870
Look over there.

336
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,860
What's wrong?

337
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,310
There's a boat accident in front.

338
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,620
They're going to take a look.

339
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,260
Be careful!

340
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:07,250
What is that?

341
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,370
A haunted ship!

342
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,250
It's a haunted ship!

343
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,000
A haunted ship!

344
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,334
Turn around!
Don't look at it!

345
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,300
Hurry!

346
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:33,970
Quick, turn around!

347
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,064
Don't look at the haunted ship!

348
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:35,964
No matter what happens,

349
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:36,806
don't look back!

350
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,190
Even if something touches you,

351
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,294
pretend that you can't feel it!

352
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:40,584
Impossible!
There's no such thing...

353
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,667
...in this world!

354
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,000
Listen to me!

355
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,840
What's that noise?

356
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,250
Hold on!

357
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,120
Ning!

358
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,375
-What is that thing?
-Don't move.

359
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,334
Move aside, comrade!

360
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:05,466
Ning!

361
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:11,507
Ning!

362
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:15,918
-Get back here!
-Let go of me!

363
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,034
-Don't go!
-I can't see her die!

364
00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:17,958
It's useless!

365
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,410
Let go of me!

366
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,750
You're doomed if you get on that ship!

367
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,083
We can't save her!

368
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,540
Let go of me!

369
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,125
Don't go!
Listen to me!

370
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,209
-Don't go there!
-Stay here!

371
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:50,050
-We have to save her!
-No!

372
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,960
We came together,

373
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,080
so we must go back together!

374
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:53,417
Life is more important than anything!

375
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:54,501
If you do that,

376
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:55,667
everyone on the boat will die!

377
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:56,591
-Fatty!
-Don't move!

378
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:57,667
Keep an eye on them.

379
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,167
Don't let them cut the ropes off!

380
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:00,132
I'm going to save her!

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Be careful!

382
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,215
Ning!

383
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,542
Ning, are you okay?

384
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,876
Where's the tentacle?

385
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,880
I'm fine.

386
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,626
This thing is too creepy.

387
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:21,250
I felt drained when it grabbed me.

388
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:22,375
What exactly was it?

389
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,880
Let's go.

390
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,042
Judging from the rust,

391
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,334
this ship must have been
underwater for decades.

392
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:50,292
Maybe the waves from the storm...

393
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:52,459
...swept it up to the surface.

394
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,600
How is that possible?

395
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,125
If it's sunk to the seabed,

396
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,542
it'd be buried by sand.

397
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,375
Even a crane can't lift it up.

398
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,700
Besides, look here.

399
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,459
Except for signs of weathering,

400
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,000
this ship is still largely intact.

401
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:05,209
This means that after the accident,

402
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,375
the ship didn't sink,

403
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,834
but it remained afloat on the sea.

404
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:27,999
Why did you save me?

405
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,420
Ning!

406
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,501
What are you doing, Ning?

407
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,459
Don't move, Ning!

408
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,500
Ning!

409
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:02,542
A sea monkey.

410
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:16,632
Watch out!

411
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:25,999
-Let's go!
-Okay.

412
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,334
How can we get up there?

413
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,876
The keel is broken.

414
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:58,542
This ship is going to sink!

415
00:32:58,999 --> 00:32:59,839
Let's leave here, fast!

416
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,500
The boat is gone.

417
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,520
-I'll go up and see.
-Okay.

418
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,660
Fatty!

419
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,660
I'm here, Fatty!

420
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:35,626
Fatty!

421
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,250
We're here!

422
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,834
Come here!

423
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:44,834
Come here!

424
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:47,542
Baldy Zhang, we're saved!

425
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,584
Fatty!

426
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,880
Give me the knife.

427
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,833
Relax, it'll be fine.

428
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,340
What's this?

429
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,958
It's a leeching argonaut.

430
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:44,876
Just put some ox hair on the wound.

431
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,480
She's fine now.

432
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,958
Just let her rest for a bit.

433
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:19,972
Fatty, is your head okay?

434
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,292
It's okay, I've got a thick skull.

435
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,584
But, I'm seeing two of you now.

436
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,876
Okay, get some rest soon.

437
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,167
Don't get another concussion.

438
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,834
No, one of us needs to be awake.

439
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,042
If I weren't here just now,

440
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,999
they'd have slipped away a long time ago.

441
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,910
I'm right here.

442
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,000
They can run if they want to.

443
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,130
Besides,

444
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,717
he's just trying to earn some money.

445
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:40,626
He didn't see the storm
and sea monkeys coming.

446
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:41,834
Anyone would've ran away.

447
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:44,083
Yeah, they're not the ones looking for loot.

448
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,792
They don't have a missing uncle.

449
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,292
Who's that baldy, anyway?

450
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,834
There is something off with Baldy Zhang.

451
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:53,751
And this Ning.

452
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:55,918
She's hiding so many things from us.

453
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,125
If it weren't for my uncle...

454
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,680
Forget it.

455
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,250
You should rest now.

456
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,250
I'll be keeping watch here.

457
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,501
I'm overly excited now.

458
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,660
I can't sleep.

459
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,709
Okay, I'll get some beauty sleep now.

460
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,292
I'll replace you two hours later.

461
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,160
"Fieldwork Records on the Xisha Reefs"

462
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,900
"From Wu San Xing, to Chen Wen Jin"

463
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,000
"Leader: Chen Wen Jin"
"Members: Wu San Xing, Zhang Qi Ling..."

464
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,042
<i>Where are you going, Uncle?</i>

465
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,100
<i>Take me along.</i>

466
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,500
<i>Come here.</i>

467
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,580
<i>You're all right?</i>

468
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:04,507
<i>I'm all right.</i>

469
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,626
<i>I'm going out to do something.</i>

470
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:09,792
<i>Be a good boy and stay at home.</i>

471
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,760
<i>When I'm back,</i>

472
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,994
<i>I'll bring some snacks for you.</i>

473
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,000
<i>Good boy.</i>

474
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:15,459
<i>Grandpa told you to play with me.</i>

475
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,626
<i>You're a bad boy now.</i>

476
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:21,930
<i>Don't tell Grandpa about this.</i>

477
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,542
<i>I'm going to meet Auntie Wen Jin.</i>

478
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:25,959
<i>This is important.</i>

479
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,501
<i>If I don't meet her,</i>

480
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:29,792
<i>you might not get a third aunt.</i>

481
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,780
<i>Be a good boy.</i>

482
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:13,965
<i>How's this?</i>

483
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:17,000
<i>Still angry?</i>

484
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:20,167
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

485
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,501
<i>I went to meet Wen Jin.</i>

486
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,167
<i>It's an important matter.</i>

487
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,250
<i>Auntie Wen Jin...</i>

488
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:28,501
<i>...may be your third aunt
in the future.</i>

489
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,751
<i>She'll give birth to
many children to play with you.</i>

490
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,870
<i>Auntie Wen Jin...</i>

491
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:34,209
<i>...will be part of our family?</i>

492
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

493
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,090
<i>Zhang Qi Ling.</i>

494
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,626
<i>Isn't that Bro's name?</i>

495
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,480
<i>Is that really him?</i>

496
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,918
<i>That's impossible.</i>

497
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,501
You're awake.
How are you feeling?

498
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,375
You were the one who saved me.

499
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,800
No.

500
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,007
It was Bald...

501
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,584
It was Mr Zhang who saved us.

502
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,920
Him?

503
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,042
I didn't expect it.

504
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,709
Mr Zhang sure knows how to fight.

505
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:42,417
He's a rare talent.

506
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:43,626
Where did you find him?

507
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,540
I don't know.

508
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:46,959
He was hired by our company.

509
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,250
I only know...

510
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:49,751
...he's an expert on sea relics.

511
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,740
Okay.

512
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,580
Since things have turned out this way,

513
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:55,876
it's about time for you...

514
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,200
...to tell me the truth.

515
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,920
What?

516
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:04,000
Why did you ask me...

517
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,292
...to come here?

518
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,999
Your uncle's boat is indeed missing.

519
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,792
But, there are signs suggesting...

520
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,542
...that three hours before
his disappearance,

521
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:19,876
he has found the exact location
of the underwater tomb.

522
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,751
He was preparing to enter the tomb.

523
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:23,299
We think...

524
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:25,501
...that his boat may have been
hijacked by pirates.

525
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:27,626
If, at that time,

526
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:29,834
your uncle is already inside the tomb,

527
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,292
he may have been spared.

528
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:33,380
But, that doesn't make
his situation any better.

529
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,709
Without support from the surface,

530
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,459
he certainly can't swim back.

531
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:39,834
His oxygen tank
can't support him for that long!

532
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:42,751
As a matter of fact,

533
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:44,918
your uncle has said...

534
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,330
...that there's substantial oxygen
inside the underwater tomb.

535
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:48,459
Breathing is possible.

536
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:51,542
He knows the tomb inside out.

537
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,820
He must have been there before.

538
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,540
Of course,

539
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,700
everything I've said...

540
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,042
...is just our speculation.

541
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,209
We can't rule out other accidents.

542
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:08,375
If all of these...

543
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:11,626
...are planned by your uncle,

544
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,326
he's trying to ditch us
and do this by himself.

545
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,460
That's impossible!

546
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,720
You know your uncle...

547
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:17,209
...better than we do.

548
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:18,999
This is not the first time
he's doing this alone.

549
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:19,965
You're lying!

550
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,709
<i>How will you answer to Xie Lian Huan?</i>

551
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:24,209
<i>How will you answer to the Xie family?</i>

552
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:25,417
<i>You unfilial son!</i>
