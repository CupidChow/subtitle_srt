1
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,900
"Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,200
"Episode 7"

3
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:12,965
Poker face.

4
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,999
The position of this entrance is strange.

5
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,139
And there's no other symmetrical entrance.

6
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,739
So it's not meant for balancing.

7
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,959
Why did Wang Zang Hai make this entrance?

8
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:30,250
Being a wild archaeologist,

9
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,834
I believe there are two possibilities.

10
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:33,923
Tell us.

11
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,542
Show some respect.

12
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:39,834
Please tell us.

13
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,875
The first possibility is that...

14
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,915
...the tomb owner
hid some treasures inside...

15
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,129
...and didn't want people to find out.

16
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,000
So he covered it with a mirror.

17
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,083
If it's used to hide treasures,

18
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:52,334
it should be in somewhere more secluded.

19
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:55,375
It's unsafe to put them behind a mirror.

20
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,334
The second possibility
is related to feng shui.

21
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,583
Mirror is an important tool in feng shui.

22
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,626
Maybe there's a theory behind it.

23
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:04,591
Feng shui?

24
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,208
According to feng shui,

25
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,501
if a door is built in a room,

26
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,375
it represents a passageway.

27
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:13,916
It means to let something in or out.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,125
What can go in and out of a tomb?

29
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,167
There's only ghost.

30
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,291
Step aside.

31
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,417
There's no ghost here.

32
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,709
<i>Don't swing your flashlight.</i>

33
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:39,796
<i>How come there's water?</i>

34
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,709
I think I have to go in one more time.

35
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:10,540
No way.

36
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,220
You got into trouble
the last time you were here.

37
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,125
I can't let you risk your life again.

38
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,209
To all of you,

39
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,834
this might be just an odd experience.

40
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,125
But to me,

41
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,834
it's a huge knot in my mind.

42
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:28,792
Is this knot really that important?

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,501
Is it even more important than your life?

44
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,999
Mutey Zhang finished a whole sentence for it.

45
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,379
I guess it's very important.

46
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:35,299
Okay.

47
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:36,424
Poker Face.

48
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,125
If you insist on going in,

49
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:39,417
I'll go with you.

50
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:41,792
I don't care if we die in there
running out of oxygen.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,080
You saved my life just now.

52
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,542
If this secret chamber is really
that important to you,

53
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:47,583
I'll stick with you to the end.

54
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,292
Wait, calm down.

55
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:53,167
I think we should go up first
to get the food and oxygen ready.

56
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,572
Then we'll come down here again.

57
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:55,912
We have experience this time.

58
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:58,792
So it'll be a piece of cake to us.

59
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,049
Poker Face.

60
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,999
We came to the underwater tomb together.

61
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,417
I won't allow something happen to you.

62
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,999
What has gotten into you?

63
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,958
Are you possessed? Let's go.

64
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,709
Come on.

65
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,751
What has gotten into you?

66
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:26,716
Wait a minute.

67
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:34,751
Look who is this.

68
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,792
Try running away again.

69
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,959
You must have thought so highly of yourself.

70
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:42,549
Stop yelling.

71
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:43,959
Something's wrong with her.

72
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,626
She's crazy.

73
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,159
I was a little confused
when I was entering the tunnel.

74
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:55,042
I thought she played tricks on me.

75
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:57,584
But she wasn't clear-minded either.

76
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:58,712
Also,

77
00:06:58,792 --> 00:06:59,632
look at this.

78
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:00,959
The wound on her neck.

79
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,334
Simple.

80
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:03,962
We'll know if she's pretending...

81
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:06,875
...by her reaction when I slap her.

82
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,951
Could you really slap her?

83
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,751
Why can't I?

84
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,803
No. I'm like James Bond, I only
toy with women but I don't hit woman.

85
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,478
We'll listen to you. What should we do?

86
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:21,834
She is scheming.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,167
We don't even know if she's pretending.

88
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,282
Let her taste her own medicine.

89
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:28,959
Tie her up and send her
to the police station.

90
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,125
Are you...

91
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,626
...trying to get yourself killed?

92
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,915
We don't have a permit to enter
the underwater tomb, but she does.

93
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,250
Who do you think
the police is going to arrest?

94
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,796
We're here because she tricked us.

95
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,583
Furthermore, I'm here to look for my Uncle.

96
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:45,959
You'll be an accomplice.

97
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,459
-You...
-Stop fighting.

98
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,918
She looks sluggish
and her reactions are slow.

99
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,959
She looks worse than a dumb.

100
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,384
She's not pretending.

101
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,632
Bro.

102
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,042
This place is creepy.

103
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,876
We'd better head out first.

104
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:00,341
Wait a minute.

105
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,292
Think about it.

106
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:05,542
Why is she hiding here?

107
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,083
Enough, stop looking.

108
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,085
There's something there.

109
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:10,916
I said stop looking.

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,045
Why don't you just give up?

111
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,459
What's that? Is that red thing a tree?

112
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:16,501
So what if it's red?

113
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:19,291
Even if it's gold,
you won't be able to move it.

114
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,215
Let's go.

115
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,750
We'll know if we're able to move it
if we go in and check it out.

116
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,916
What if there's something smaller beside it?

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,462
If we hadn't come in, we can forget about it.

118
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,920
Since we're inside here,
we might as well take a look around.

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,916
We've been in here for so long
yet nothing happened to us.

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,880
What are you afraid of?
Am I right, Mutey Zhang?

121
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:35,958
I'm not afraid.

122
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,876
I'm just worried about Bro.

123
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,049
Follow me.

124
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,131
Don't fall behind.

125
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,215
Follow me.

126
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,507
Don't fall behind.

127
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:49,299
Come back.

128
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,049
You...

129
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:10,341
Young Comrade.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,083
How much does this coral tree worth?

131
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:14,916
I'm not trying to let you down.

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,840
16 yuan.

133
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,542
Not 16 yuan per gram, but per kilogram.

134
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,876
Who are you trying to cheat?

135
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,959
Mutey Zhang, is that true?

136
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,834
What's wrong with my fate this year?

137
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,834
It's so different with
what my fortune teller told me.

138
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:32,375
Did I do something wrong
or did they get it wrong?

139
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:33,821
I have such bad luck with wealth.

140
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38,334
How about this bell?
It worth a lot, right?

141
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:40,959
Can you stop being ignorant?

142
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,542
A bell is made from metal.

143
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,959
It's rarely seen in a tomb.

144
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,500
It has a complex structure
and it's hard to preserve.

145
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,916
But look at the pattern on it.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,542
It's obviously made before the Ming dynasty.

147
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,459
So it's still in a good condition now.

148
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,757
Do you know what does this mean?

149
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,792
Yes, it's more valuable than pure gold.

150
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:55,959
Come on.

151
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:56,923
Don't touch it.

152
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:00,167
Do you protect historical relics, too?

153
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,083
Do you remember where we saw
this kind of bell before?

154
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,918
The cracks of the bell are rusty.

155
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,667
From the look of it, it's made of brass.

156
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:17,751
I've only seen one type of brass bell.

157
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,930
The corpse eater in the Tomb of Lord Shang.

158
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,125
<i>Don't panic.</i>

159
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,999
<i>Hang in there.</i>

160
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,292
<i>Get down there.</i>

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,080
<i>Everyone, get in the water.</i>

162
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,834
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

163
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,667
<i>Calm down.</i>

164
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:54,382
<i>Sit down.</i>

165
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:55,507
<i>Be careful.</i>

166
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,959
<i>The sound we heard just now...</i>

167
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,916
<i>...came from this bell.</i>

168
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,542
<i>How is it able to delude people?</i>

169
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:06,542
<i>What's the secret behind it?</i>

170
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,382
<i>Look at this.</i>

171
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:10,923
<i>This centipede...</i>

172
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:15,459
<i>...might have gotten into its stomach
through this tube...</i>

173
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:16,918
<i>...to eat its flesh.</i>

174
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:21,250
<i>I'm impressed that they figured out
such a method of symbiosis.</i>

175
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,007
<i>Look at me.</i>

176
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,612
<i>There is nothing to be scared of.</i>

177
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,459
These bells are exactly the same
with those on the corpse eater.

178
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:45,166
Uncle told me that the bell
was from before the Warring States period.

179
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,334
He didn't get in details.

180
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:49,542
But there was only a bell back then
and it almost got us killed.

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,542
There are dozens of them here.

182
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:53,751
If it starts to ring...

183
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,501
Relax.

184
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,709
This bell is different from the others.

185
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,375
If wind could make it ring,
it would have rung already.

186
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:07,250
It appeared in the Tomb of Lord Shang
and it appears here, too.

187
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:08,375
Isn't it too coincidental?

188
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,751
I guess Wang Zang Hai also raided tombs.

189
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,796
While he was practising feng shui for people,

190
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,918
he must have seen
some good stuff and taken them.

191
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:17,417
I don't think so.

192
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:18,421
Usually when one raids a tomb,

193
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:21,170
one will leave their mark
in the entire tomb after it's been raided.

194
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,130
It's to gain respect
from people who come after.

195
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:24,174
Bro.

196
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:29,167
Do you find any marks in this tomb?

197
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,007
No.

198
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,458
If he didn't raid it, he might have
dug something from the ground.

199
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:35,494
He works in construction site.

200
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:38,709
He might have swiped some good stuff
while he was digging the foundation.

201
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:39,918
I think...

202
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,999
...he worked in a construction site near
the Tomb of Lord Shang.

203
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,584
He dug these bells...

204
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,333
...and moved them here...

205
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:47,584
...as decorations.

206
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:50,626
No scent at all.

207
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:54,965
That's right.

208
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:59,209
There was a scent
when Bro fainted in the tunnel.

209
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,334
But there's no scent on this bell.

210
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,334
We've been here for so long...

211
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,034
...but nothing happened to us.

212
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,959
This proves that...

213
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:10,781
...it's not source of the scent.

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,834
It's probably the bone musk of cursed nanny.

215
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,049
Impossible.

216
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,667
We have fought her so many times.

217
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,042
We even burned her.

218
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,667
But there was no scent at all.

219
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:20,716
Also,

220
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:24,083
where are the archaeologists
who were on mission with Bro...

221
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:25,709
...back then?

222
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,840
Is there...

223
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:25,918
...a kind of scent that
makes people suffer from amnesia...

224
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,501
...and even become immortal?

225
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,958
Amnesia in exchange of immortal?

226
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,292
I'd like to try.

227
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:34,421
Also,

228
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:37,999
Mutey Zhang, aren't you
around the same age as Master Wu?

229
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,417
Young Comrade, you shouldn't address him Bro,

230
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,292
but Uncle Poker Face instead.

231
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,880
What? I can't even
help you with your seniority?

232
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,750
There's nothing special here.

233
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:54,876
Except for this tree,

234
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:56,299
what else is there?

235
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,209
She kept the good stuff to herself.

236
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,000
All right, let's not waste time.

237
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,005
Let's get out of here.

238
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,003
I can't hold it anymore.

239
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,334
Come and help.

240
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,209
Geez.

241
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:28,542
My gosh.

242
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,000
She looks skinny
but she's actually very heavy.

243
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,209
How confident are you?

244
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,167
This tomb is under the sea.

245
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,003
In order to resist the water pressure,

246
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,643
the top of the building must be arched,

247
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:41,071
with a high center and low sides.

248
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,920
We need to look for the weakest point force.

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,918
Let me find it.

250
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:50,667
But it seems...

251
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:53,876
...this tomb resembles
a ground built palace...

252
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,125
...that has a flat ceiling.

253
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,709
The structure is complex and sturdy.

254
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,834
But this is good news to us.

255
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,398
We can punch a hole anywhere we want.

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You bluff better than I do.

257
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,915
I'm playing it by ear according to
the theory of architecture.

258
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,290
I'm worried about one thing.

259
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,834
If we punch a hole up there,

260
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,250
will we drown when the seawater gushes in?

261
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,000
So, we have to figure out the right time...

262
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,565
...and punch a hole during low tide.

263
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:20,191
Or else the whole pressure resistant
system will be destroyed.

264
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,253
Maybe the top of the building will be
crashed by the seawater gushing in.

265
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,334
We'll either drowned or be crushed.

266
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,487
The chances of survival are slim?

267
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,799
You could say that.

268
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,626
If only Ning is conscious.

269
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:37,504
I'm sure she has a backup plan.

270
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:40,958
She might have hidden
the oxygen tanks somewhere safe.

271
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,602
That's easy. I can just beat her
for her to regain consciousness.

272
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:45,337
Forget it.

273
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,999
Save your strength for those pillars.

274
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,849
Think about how we should climb up there.

275
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,709
It's very slippery and thick.

276
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,250
I'm not a lizard.

277
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,500
I'll slip and fall.

278
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:01,904
How am I going to climb up there?

279
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:14,041
Do you really want to try?

280
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,375
If you fall, you'll definitely die.

281
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:08,674
Are you going?

282
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:13,049
Let's go.

283
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,090
Fatty.

284
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:52,132
Be careful.

285
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,257
Fatty.

286
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,507
Are you okay?

287
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,090
I'm fine.

288
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:01,424
Listen,

289
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,125
don't bother to come up here if you can't.

290
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,500
You can't be of any help anyway.

291
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:07,626
What can you do here?

292
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,129
Do you think I want to be up there?

293
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:11,501
I'm going up to guide and protect you.

294
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:13,999
Didn't you say it's not dangerous up here?

295
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,167
I didn't say that.

296
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,209
Who knows there might be
a mezzanine up there.

297
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,122
You might get buried in the mezzanine
when you get up there.

298
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,709
It better not have any booby traps
like inland tombs.

299
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,334
It shouldn't, right?

300
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,166
The tomb owner has a different mind
from anyone else.

301
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,501
Who knows what will happen.

302
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,167
We all have our own fate.

303
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,504
Now is not the time to be scared.

304
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:36,834
Come on, pull me up.

305
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,291
You're lucky, Young Comrade.

306
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,815
You don't have to climb on your own.

307
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,083
It's really high.

308
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,125
What should we do now, technical support?

309
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:10,374
Let me take a look around.

310
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:23,674
It's solid.

311
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:27,212
It seems Wang Zang Hai is not
that extraordinary after all.

312
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:28,132
Move aside.

313
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:38,330
It's steel concrete.

314
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,754
The cracks are filled with steel concrete.

315
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:40,999
It's like reinforced concrete.

316
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,583
You can't break it even with a huge hammer.

317
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,209
I don't believe. Move aside.

318
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,959
I don't believe.

319
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,542
From the looks of it,

320
00:22:56,626 --> 00:23:00,375
there are at least six or seven layers
and they are intertwined.

321
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:02,792
There's no way to break it
without proper tool.

322
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:09,959
It's all my fault.

323
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,919
The ceiling is a flat roof structure
which has a weak pressure resistance.

324
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,334
So the stone had to be reinforced.

325
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:17,909
I've never thought about this.

326
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,490
I made your efforts go in vain.

327
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:22,916
When there's a will,

328
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,708
there's a way.

329
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,125
Let's break it bit by bit.

330
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:27,549
That's impossible.

331
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,876
The concrete is too thick.
It'll take forever to break it.

332
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,918
I did some calculations.

333
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:35,542
It will be low tide in around 30 minutes.

334
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,083
If we miss it,
it will be difficult for us to leave.

335
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,254
It's almost the windy season.

336
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,000
If we can't get out now,

337
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,542
we have to wait for at least a week,
which is seven days.

338
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:46,458
We'll either die of suffocation
or starvation.

339
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,542
The flesh of the sea monkey is stinky.

340
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,792
I'm not going to eat it.

341
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,250
Why don't we return to where we came from?

342
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,254
Maybe the side chamber
with our oxygen tanks...

343
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:55,584
...will turn back.

344
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:57,257
Impossible.

345
00:24:57,918 --> 00:24:58,918
Unless there's a miracle.

346
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:01,370
Otherwise we won't be able
to find the way out of...

347
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,050
...Divining Gates of Escape
in such a short time.

348
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,710
Furthermore, cursed granny is there.

349
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,007
Bro.

350
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,455
I have to apologise to you.

351
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,159
When we were in secret tunnel,

352
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,590
I was just testing you
when I said your memory was false.

353
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,603
I was afraid that you might do harm
to Uncle when you regain your memory.

354
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,230
But I was only thinking about Uncle...

355
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,240
...and neglected your feelings.

356
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,090
I'm sorry.

357
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:40,792
It's less than 30 minutes...

358
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,542
...to low tide.

359
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,667
I found this on an old ship.

360
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,572
You had been to underwater tomb.

361
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:53,125
Everyone else went missing
and you were the only survivor.

362
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:54,999
I'm sure you can find a way out.

363
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:17,591
Forget about it.

364
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:20,626
If you can't remember,

365
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:23,667
don't force yourself.

366
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:19,299
There's hope for us.

367
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,874
He must have found a way
to break the concrete wall.

368
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,751
Although he didn't recall
how he got out before,

369
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,250
he must have recalled...

370
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:29,291
...the trap hidden in the corpse.

371
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,735
A trap triggered by a secret switch
with a hidden explosive.

372
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
I think it's the idea of the tomb owner.

373
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,584
If someone disrespects the corpse,

374
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,542
the explosive will go off.

375
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,167
How vicious he is.

376
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:41,417
Placing explosive in his own body.

377
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:42,462
But I have a feeling...

378
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,915
...that this body isn't Wang Zang Hai.

379
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,542
Do you think Mutey Zhang...

380
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,593
...knew all along that
there was an explosive in the corpse?

381
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,031
That's why he wouldn't touch it.

382
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:52,999
Who knows.

383
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:55,584
I wonder if the explosive will still work.

384
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,459
What? Do you want to molest the corpse?

385
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,832
What are you talking about?

386
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,584
I'm worried that it's not human flesh.

387
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,667
It may be sculpted by hand.

388
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,574
It shouldn't be so light, then.

389
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:25,031
Maybe it's not made from jade...

390
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,083
...but some other special material.

391
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:28,584
Plastic? How's that?

392
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:29,709
Geez.

393
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:32,882
Bro.

394
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:35,292
This corpse is so creepy.

395
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:37,546
Do you think
the explosive in it will still work?

396
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:39,209
As long as the secret switch works,

397
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:40,542
the explosive will work.

398
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,876
I'm just afraid the trap has gotten rusty.

399
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:46,584
We can only bet on it.

400
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,045
Let's put it on top of the dome.

401
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,792
We'll ignite it when we get down there.

402
00:28:49,918 --> 00:28:51,292
If the trap can still work,

403
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,542
we can get out of here safely.

404
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:53,834
No problem, Young Comrade.

405
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,125
Hand me my Royal 502 tape.

406
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:00,546
How else do I put it up there?
Do you want me to hold it...

407
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:01,946
...and let it explode in my hand?

408
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,708
Where can I find you the 502 tape?

409
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,003
You might as well use me as the tape.

410
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,792
There isn't a place to hang it either.

411
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,209
Tie it on the pillar.

412
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:11,542
That's the only way.

413
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:12,785
Hold the light for me.

414
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:17,125
Come on.

415
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,215
Wait a minute.

416
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:23,959
What did I touch?

417
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,167
Why is there a tail on it?

418
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,443
I don't think the tail was here...

419
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,459
...when we moved it just now.

420
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:35,167
How can it grow all of a sudden?

421
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:39,292
I heard that dead bodies
growing nails and hair.

422
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:41,375
But I've never heard of one growing tail.

423
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:42,667
Is it reverting back?

424
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,709
Let's not waste time.

425
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:45,876
If you keep analysing,

426
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,671
we'll be the ones
who get analysed by others in few years.

427
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:48,626
Let's do it now.

428
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,834
This mummy is more than enough
to deal with the steel concrete.

429
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:00,626
-Let's go.
-Wait a minute.

430
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,709
Come over here, a little bit over there.

431
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,000
Follow what I do.

432
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:09,542
Mighty Tail Lord,

433
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,626
no matter you're human or monkey,

434
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,959
or relative to the lady
with five nipples earlier.

435
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,959
Both of you have something extra anyway.

436
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,501
But since you're already dead,

437
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:24,916
your body is useless now.

438
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,041
We have no choice
but to tie you with explosives.

439
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,667
Please be merciful and forgive us.

440
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:34,792
Just take it as a sauna therapy...

441
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:35,716
...or...

442
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,250
...whatever. All right.

443
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:38,626
We come in peace,

444
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:39,959
so don't take it to heart.

445
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:41,958
Young Comrade, do as I did.

446
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:42,882
Young Comrade...

447
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:46,799
You...

448
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:48,920
You're sneaky.

449
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,840
You didn't tell me and
get down on yourselves.

450
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:54,839
You...

451
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,840
I...

452
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:58,876
Wait for me down there.

453
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:23,507
Bro.

454
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,542
There's 20 more minutes until the low tide.

455
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,792
But it takes time to make a wider hole.

456
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:30,709
So you have to trigger the trap
and blow it earlier with your dagger.

457
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:32,299
Which means...

458
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,751
...you have to do it in ten more minutes.

459
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:35,999
Young Comrade.

460
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:37,542
Tell me,

461
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:40,042
how confident are you?

462
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:41,751
I don't know.

463
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:42,962
We shall see.

464
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,918
You made me even more nervous now.

465
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,584
If the thing doesn't explode later,

466
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:48,792
do you have plan B...

467
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:50,375
...to make me feel ease?

468
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,542
Yes, I do have plan B.

469
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,337
Just like what you said,
we'll return to where we came from...

470
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:57,297
...and see if the oxygen
tanks are still there.

471
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,250
If it won't work, I have plan C as well.

472
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:02,876
We'll wait here for someone to save us.

473
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,042
It'll take forever.

474
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,292
I guess I'll have to die here.

475
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:19,209
Do you think...

476
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:20,709
...Ning's company...

477
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,334
...will just ignore her?

478
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,209
Is she that important?

479
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:25,962
Foreign companies are the most merciless.

480
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,826
She's lucky if they get her insurance.

481
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,459
They won't waste their resources to save her.

482
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:30,459
Nonsense.

483
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:37,501
Bro, do it in another five minutes.

484
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:47,799
Where's the mummy?

485
00:32:58,876 --> 00:32:59,999
Look at its eyes.

486
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,417
Did the sea monkey get into it?

487
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,542
The rope is still on the mummy.

488
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,337
But it looks like it can't hold any longer.

489
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:05,832
Just blow it before it runs away.

490
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:07,417
What do you think, Bro?

491
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:10,632
Poker Face.

492
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,740
Let go of me.

493
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:12,960
I know what you're going to do up there.

494
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,916
I'll tie the mummy up again
and you'll do the explosive.

495
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,167
But you'll die.

496
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:17,792
If the mummy is gone,

497
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,337
this place will explode at anytime.

498
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:20,709
Then, everyone will die.

499
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:21,671
What about you?

500
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:22,876
Can you come back alive?

501
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:24,039
We're running out of time.

502
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:07,549
Where's Bro?

503
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,584
Did he come up with us, Fatty?

504
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,209
Didn't you see it?

505
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,417
He killed...

506
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:19,334
...cursed nanny.

507
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,840
He killed her.

508
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:21,882
It can't be.

509
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,167
We can't leave Bro behind.

510
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:25,792
Don't worry about Bro.

511
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,417
Ning.

512
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:29,792
Fatty, look after Ning.

513
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:30,959
I have to go back.

514
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:32,959
Where are you going?

515
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,716
I'll go save Bro.

516
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:36,751
Do you think you're Superman?

517
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,160
The underwater tomb is destroyed,

518
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:39,834
there's no oxygen in it.

519
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:43,125
No matter how well he fight,
he's human after all.

520
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:44,918
I must save him.

521
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:48,125
We came here together,
so we must go back together.

522
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:52,125
Why didn't you inherit
your Uncle's cold-bloodedness?

523
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,125
Wait here.

524
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:55,459
I'll be back soon.

525
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:48,042
Bro.

526
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:50,375
Look at me, who am I?

527
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:51,758
Fatty.

528
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,958
-You saved my life.
-You're welcome.

529
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,375
Where's Bro? I have to save him.

530
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,584
-Bro.
-Stay right there.

531
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:01,042
If you want to die,

532
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,709
die somewhere secluded.

533
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,436
Stop doing this in front of me.

534
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,040
-Are you crazy?
-We came here together,

535
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:08,709
we must go back together.

536
00:40:09,918 --> 00:40:10,758
Come back.

537
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,292
Nonsense!

538
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:15,876
Who's more capable? You or him?

539
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,292
Who's more experienced with tombs?
You or him?

540
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,000
What if he comes back...

541
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,250
...and you die in there?

542
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:26,000
Listen, come here. Look at me.

543
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:27,876
I believe in fate.

544
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,584
We all have our own fate.

545
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:31,999
Everyone will die.

546
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:33,918
You'll die even if you don't want to.

547
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,977
But those who aren't supposed to die...

548
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,626
Someone like Bro,

549
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,251
he even managed to kill cursed granny.

550
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:41,751
Do you have to worry about him?

551
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,834
He's skilled and lives on like a god.

552
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:46,292
It's impossible for him to die in a tomb.

553
00:40:49,918 --> 00:40:51,709
He's still alive, you know?

554
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:53,250
He's still alive.

555
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:58,000
Bro.
