1
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
"Explore with the Note"

2
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,960
"Episode 6"

3
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,120
Maybe...

4
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,542
...after Xie Lian Huan
managed to escape,

5
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:13,000
he went to look for your uncle.

6
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:14,918
But, your uncle...

7
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,125
...killed him instead.

8
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:21,125
That's why Xie Lian Huan
was found dead on a rock.

9
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:22,918
Another plausible explanation...

10
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,542
...is that Xie Lian Huan
died in a misadventure.

11
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,083
After all, when he was found,

12
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,834
he didn't have his oxygen tank on him.

13
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,042
In that case, why did my uncle...

14
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,387
...still bring the team into the tomb?

15
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,584
When the main vessel returned to shore,
carrying Xie Lian Huan's body,

16
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,959
we were left with a few rubber dinghies.

17
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:41,918
Most of our work...

18
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,751
...was done on the rocks.

19
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:45,334
But, who'd have thought...

20
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,125
...that a storm would come.

21
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,792
We could only hide inside the tomb,

22
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:51,375
which had oxygen in it.

23
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,250
We wanted to plan our next move
after the storm ends.

24
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,918
However, this thwarted your uncle's plans.

25
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,334
That's why your uncle was behaving weirdly...

26
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,751
...and led us to the chamber
with the palace's replica.

27
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:03,542
Then, he knocked all of us out
with some scent inside that passage.

28
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,167
I don't know what happened after that.

29
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:07,876
But, one thing's for sure.

30
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,959
If these people were still alive,

31
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,292
they're the same as I am.

32
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,334
Amnesiac.

33
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,730
Then, why didn't my uncle just kill you all?

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,700
That would be easier.

35
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,780
I don't know.

36
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,042
Your hypothesis...

37
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,626
...makes my uncle
look like a monster...

38
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,042
...with premeditated motives.

39
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,792
But, my uncle is nothing like that.

40
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,125
He was just a young man
who'd just started venturing the world.

41
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,042
Besides, Chen Wen Jin was also in the team.

42
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,501
He wouldn't have harmed her.

43
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,709
Something must be wrong with your memories.

44
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,042
I'm sure...

45
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:41,642
...that your hypothesis is wrong.

46
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,876
<i>You're really a dunce.</i>

47
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,501
<i>You didn't even test for air
before removing your mask.</i>

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,667
<i>If you were inside an airless pit,
you'd be dead.</i>

49
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,120
<i>I'm still okay, right?</i>

50
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,209
<i>To think there's air...</i>

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,500
<i>...inside the depths of the sea.</i>

52
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,209
<i>That's pretty incredible.</i>

53
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,709
<i>How come the reading's so low now?</i>

54
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,215
<i>Xie Lian Huan.</i>

55
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:31,834
<i>Xie Lian Huan.</i>

56
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:05,042
<i>What's wrong?</i>

57
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,999
<i>Look, Bro, look!</i>

58
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,667
<i>This must be the tomb owner's coffin.</i>

59
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,209
<i>I don't know who's inside, too.</i>

60
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:22,709
<i>It's just a sculpture.</i>

61
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:25,083
<i>Where's your gall, Xie Lian Huan?</i>

62
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,042
<i>A sculpture?</i>

63
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,250
<i>It really freaked me out.</i>

64
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,999
<i>But, this scuplture...</i>

65
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,751
<i>...has a really strange design.</i>

66
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,834
<i>It seems to be screaming in pain.</i>

67
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,584
<i>Bro, this is an iron coffin.</i>

68
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,042
<i>This hole goes all the way inside the coffin.</i>

69
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,292
<i>It's a whistle coffin.</i>

70
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,450
<i>What coffin?</i>

71
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,083
<i>An iron coffin...</i>

72
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,250
<i>...with an aperture.</i>

73
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,125
<i>That's what we call a whistle coffin.</i>

74
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,876
<i>There must be something powerful inside.</i>

75
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,542
<i>It might even be a zombie or a demon.</i>

76
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,167
<i>That's why it has to be sealed...</i>

77
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,125
<i>...inside an iron coffin.</i>

78
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,542
<i>Then, they left this hole here...</i>

79
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,709
<i>...for the experts to snag
the treasure inside.</i>

80
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:42,083
<i>If your hand gets caught
by whatever is inside,</i>

81
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,292
<i>you can only cut off your arm.</i>

82
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,542
<i>That's a fancy story.</i>

83
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:47,751
<i>But, it's also a tall one.</i>

84
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,270
<i>It's passed down from our ancestors.</i>

85
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,700
<i>There must be some sense in it.</i>

86
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,320
<i>Bro.</i>

87
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:56,876
<i>Don't you want to know...</i>

88
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>...what's inside this coffin?</i>

89
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,626
<i>Let's go back up...</i>

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,750
<i>...and get some black donkey's
hooves and candles...</i>

91
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:02,709
<i>...before coming back.</i>

92
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,650
<i>This coffin won't run anyway.</i>

93
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
<i>No need to rush.</i>

94
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,209
<i>Just take a look.
Don't touch it.</i>

95
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,127
<i>I'm going there to check the place.</i>

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,940
<i>What should I do?</i>

97
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,834
<i>What happened here?</i>

98
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:51,167
<i>Bro, I just...</i>

99
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,542
<i>...threw a piece of tinder inside.</i>

100
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:54,760
<i>I just wanted to see what's inside,
but I didn't see this coming!</i>

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,459
<i>What's wrong with you?
Where did you even learn this?</i>

102
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,542
<i>This stupid trick...</i>

103
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,830
<i>...won't make you an Indiana Jones!</i>

104
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,125
<i>Under dry conditions,</i>

105
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,667
<i>forget about the zombie's clothes.</i>

106
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:06,083
<i>Even the zombie itself will catch fire!</i>

107
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,375
<i>Can't you use your brains?</i>

108
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,083
<i>Stop scolding me, Bro.</i>

109
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,417
<i>We'd better try and put the fire out!</i>

110
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,209
<i>You're going to get us killed here!</i>

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,110
<i>What's with the blank look?</i>

112
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,160
<i>Get some water here!</i>

113
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,410
<i>Right, water.</i>

114
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,360
<i>Water.</i>

115
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,209
<i>Here, I got it.</i>

116
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,834
<i>Don't worry, Bro.
The water's here.</i>

117
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:25,918
<i>Here, pour it in.</i>

118
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,179
<i>Fuck you!</i>

119
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,042
<i>You brought alcohol
instead of water in a raid?</i>

120
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,375
<i>You're out of your mind!</i>

121
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,659
<i>Water.</i>

122
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,999
<i>Where's the water here?</i>

123
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,360
<i>Hand it over!</i>

124
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,600
<i>I'll settle scores with you later.</i>

125
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,790
<i>What a dope.</i>

126
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,334
<i>What should I do?</i>

127
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,709
<i>You're fucking crazy.</i>

128
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,834
<i>It's out.</i>

129
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,330
<i>It's out.</i>

130
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,140
<i>Only unholy creatures are put
inside whistle coffins.</i>

131
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,370
<i>Very violent creatures.</i>

132
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,918
<i>You just burned him...</i>

133
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,292
<i>...and pissed at him.</i>

134
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,000
<i>You've just made yourself an enemy.</i>

135
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,167
<i>Don't scare me, Bro.</i>

136
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,501
<i>Demons and zombies...</i>

137
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:21,667
<i>...are just superstition.</i>

138
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:22,626
<i>This is just...</i>

139
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,417
<i>...a coffin with some...</i>

140
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:25,626
<i>...special designs.</i>

141
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:26,972
<i>Maybe this tomb's owner...</i>

142
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,083
<i>...was an artisan.</i>

143
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,876
<i>He made this design on purpose.</i>

144
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,160
<i>Forget it.</i>

145
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,042
<i>You've already burned and pissed on him.</i>

146
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:36,584
<i>There's still no reaction yet.</i>

147
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,459
<i>It's probably a dead one.</i>

148
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:39,999
<i>Count yourself lucky.</i>

149
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,140
<i>Bro!</i>

150
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:49,810
<i>Don't you find this disgusting?</i>

151
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,290
<i>We're raiding tombs here.</i>

152
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,083
<i>You can be the clean boy you are at home.</i>

153
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,209
<i>What's inside there?</i>

154
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:00,792
<i>A ring.</i>

155
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,667
<i>It's a jade pendant that's put inside mouths.</i>

156
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,209
<i>-It's fireproof.
-Really?</i>

157
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,167
<i>Take it out, then!</i>

158
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,834
<i>Harder, take it out!</i>

159
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,340
<i>Oh, no!</i>

160
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,560
<i>It's a trap!</i>

161
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:14,667
<i>Don't move, Xie Lian Huan!</i>

162
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,334
<i>Don't move, Xie Lian Huan!</i>

163
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,920
<i>I'll going to take a look.</i>

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,870
<i>Don't go anywhere.</i>

165
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:20,959
<i>Stay here.</i>

166
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,959
<i>Bro, come back quickly!</i>

167
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:08,999
I'm sure your uncle incited...

168
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,584
...some unholy creature
inside the tomb.

169
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:12,751
When we see him,

170
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,626
just splash a basin of
black dog's blood on him,

171
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,584
and he'll be free of those nasty things.

172
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,209
Impossible, those things don't exist.

173
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,667
Then, don't tell me...

174
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:22,292
Does your uncle usually...

175
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,042
...comb his hair like a woman?

176
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,792
Tsk, that's bullshit.

177
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:29,751
<i>What kind of mechanism is this?</i>

178
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,584
<i>It can still operate with such thick rust.</i>

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,840
<i>Lian Huan.</i>

180
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:40,751
<i>Xie Lian Huan.</i>

181
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,250
<i>Lian Huan!</i>

182
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,870
<i>Lian Huan.</i>

183
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,751
<i>Lian Huan!</i>

184
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,751
<i>Lian Huan!</i>

185
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:54,792
<i>Come here!</i>

186
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,501
<i>Come here if you dare!</i>

187
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,459
<i>Come here!</i>

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,440
<i>You fucking dickhead!</i>

189
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
<i>Fuck it!</i>

190
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:40,792
<i>You dope!</i>

191
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,542
<i>I'm not fucking afraid at all!</i>

192
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:14,042
<i>Everyone dies.</i>

193
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:18,000
<i>I'll be another fucking guy in my next life!</i>

194
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,709
<i>The remaining oxygen...</i>

195
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,640
<i>...won't be enough for me
to reach the surface.</i>

196
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,999
<i>But, my stamina is better than yours.</i>

197
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,209
<i>I might just make it out alive.</i>

198
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:47,918
<i>If I make it out,</i>

199
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,125
<i>I'll get someone to save you immediately.</i>

200
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:51,549
<i>If not,</i>

201
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,000
<i>the fish can feed on my body.</i>

202
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:58,999
<i>As for you,</i>

203
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,876
<i>at least you'll have a tomb.</i>

204
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,167
<i>Wait for me.</i>

205
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,880
Forget it.

206
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,580
I know...

207
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,876
...that you might think of
my uncle as a monster.

208
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,918
But, he's actually not that complicated.

209
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,876
He's just a little flamboyant.

210
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,417
He was pretty wacky when he was young.

211
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:41,209
Here's a story.

212
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,375
When I was a kid,

213
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,334
there was a time when
my uncle brought me out.

214
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,250
Then, he bumped into his friends.

215
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,634
He wanted to follow his friends,
but I might get lost alone.

216
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,584
In the end, he tied me onto a tree.

217
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:52,972
I even fainted from the heat.

218
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,083
Guess what happened next.

219
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,876
My grandfather ran out and beat him.

220
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,250
They ran through the whole town.

221
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,751
But I don't know when...

222
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:04,834
...my uncle suddenly
become more stable.

223
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,501
He started coming home...

224
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:08,839
...less often.

225
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,250
He also started talking less...

226
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:12,918
...with the family.

227
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,250
But, I always thought...

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,876
...my uncle...

229
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,209
...is still the young man he was.

230
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:21,292
He hasn't changed a bit.

231
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,860
Don't worry.

232
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:27,792
When I find my uncle,

233
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,959
I'll ask him personally...

234
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,450
...and give you an explanation.

235
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,580
You feeling itchy?

236
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:36,414
Are you feeling itchy?

237
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,292
-You're still feeling itchy?
-I just...

238
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,584
Yeah, it's been itching all along.

239
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,417
Did your sweat get into your wound?

240
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:46,167
Don't touch it, lest it gets infected.

241
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:47,584
All rested up?

242
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,300
Let's go.

243
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,820
Wait for me.

244
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:38,709
Hey, wait.

245
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,700
This is unbearable.

246
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:42,292
It's getting more and more itchy.

247
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,251
Don't tell me it's because
you've not showered for days.

248
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:45,080
What? Listen up.

249
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,792
It's where the lotus arrows struck just now.

250
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,709
-Show me.
-Please do.

251
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:54,959
How is it?

252
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,709
That's pretty bad, Fatty.

253
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,292
I'm not scaring you.

254
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:03,959
There's even fungus on it.

255
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,626
It's white in color.

256
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,693
We might even have mushrooms in a few days.

257
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:09,902
What fungus? What mushrooms?
What the heck?

258
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,140
This is bad.

259
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,950
There must be something
with the lotus arrows.

260
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,167
I was also struck just now.

261
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,542
It did feel a bit itchy when
we were in the side chamber.

262
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,375
But, the itch faded soon.

263
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,167
I did wonder a bit.

264
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:25,556
Hey, what are you doing?

265
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,667
What's going on?
Do something!

266
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,610
This is really...

267
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,918
It's really itchy, you might as well
just cut the whole chunk off.

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,876
Hurry up!

269
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,520
I've heard that some of
the arrows' victims...

270
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:34,918
...even committed suicide.

271
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,334
Jibing me now, Mutey?

272
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:38,876
Just think of a solution!

273
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,083
Hey, just do something about it!

274
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,250
See what you can do!

275
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,292
Okay, Fatty.

276
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,549
No more teasing.

277
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:48,999
To tell you the truth,

278
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,083
I have a secret weapon...

279
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,007
...against this.

280
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,125
Just apply some skin toner.

281
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,000
You urbanites are so pampered.

282
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,542
We're out on a raid, and you...

283
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,876
...brought your skin toner along?

284
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,326
You might as well bring a set of cards
and play poker or gin rummy here.

285
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,667
Give it a blow!

286
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,834
That's enough, what blowing?

287
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,584
-This is killing me.
-Who's the pampered one here?

288
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:17,125
-Just bear with it a while.
-What did you just smear on me?

289
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:20,709
Hey, it's not itchy anymore.

290
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,292
Wait, what brand of toner are you using?

291
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,792
I'm going to buy some online later.

292
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,083
-It's a secret.
-I'm buying it online, okay?

293
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,792
This is miraculous.

294
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,250
Exercise more,

295
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,125
improve your fitness.

296
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,792
You won't...get bullied.

297
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,667
Exercise more,

298
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:31,459
improve your fitness.

299
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,751
Get stronger.

300
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,334
Protect your nation.

301
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,751
Improve your fitness.

302
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,834
Exercise more,

303
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,375
build your strength.

304
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,959
You won't get bullied.

305
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,125
Move.

306
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,501
<i>Why is it soggy here?</i>

307
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:58,167
<i>It even has a nice smell.</i>

308
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,870
Quiet.

309
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Who are you?</i>

310
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:09,751
<i>Please hold me in your arms.</i>

311
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,918
I told you to be quiet!

312
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,375
Didn't you see that?

313
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,751
-There's something!
-I only saw a shadow flick by.

314
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,709
It's moving too fast,
so I couldn't see it clearly.

315
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,542
Calm down and tell us what happened.

316
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,600
It's a woman.

317
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:08,718
She wrapped me with her hair.

318
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:09,834
She wanted to kiss me!

319
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:11,959
You still in puberty?
Still having wet dreams?

320
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,250
It can't be a dream!

321
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,292
Look, my clothes are soaked!

322
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,042
That's just your sweat, isn't it?

323
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,751
Can you get as sweaty as this?

324
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay, enough with the nonsense.

325
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,083
If there was something,

326
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,083
it would've passed by me.

327
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:24,125
I would've seen it.

328
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:25,083
I saw nothing.

329
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,083
A woman, huh?

330
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,330
Any fire?

331
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:48,676
This thing is afraid of fire.

332
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,620
Yeah.

333
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,540
Fatty!

334
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:14,083
Fatty, get up!

335
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,209
Are you all right, Fatty?

336
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Get up!

337
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:26,999
-Are you okay?
-I need air.

338
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,310
This is suffocating.

339
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,040
-You're fine now.
-I almost died.

340
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:31,709
Luckily you're okay.

341
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,250
Otherwise I'd feel awkward.

342
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,340
Why awkward?

343
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:36,390
I was about to give you
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

344
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,360
Scram!

345
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:38,918
What was that thing?

346
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,292
-A cursed granny.
-Cursed granny?

347
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,751
Looks like the legends weren't just stories.

348
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,125
They were actually true.

349
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,042
That Forbidden woman

350
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:51,542
Well, what in the world is a cursed granny?

351
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,980
It's a type of venomous jellyfish
with long, hair-like tentacles.

352
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,209
Once in contact,

353
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:56,910
they will make you hallucinate.

354
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,999
Luckily, we had a lighter.

355
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,257
Phooey!

356
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:02,334
I've been keeping my virginity,

357
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,501
and she almost robbed me off!

358
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,920
You think I don't care about my chastity?

359
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,720
Forget it.

360
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:08,584
Be it sea monkeys or cursed grannies,

361
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,834
I'm sure the tomb owner put them here.

362
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:12,250
They probably can live long,

363
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,375
so they're here as tomb guardians.

364
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:18,709
We'll move once you're rested.

365
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,230
Let's not stay here.

366
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,160
Let's go.

367
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,680
Otherwise, the cursed granny will be back.

368
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,360
Wait.

369
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,167
There were some noises here
before the cursed granny struck.

370
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:29,507
They're all gone now.

371
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,542
Maybe it was the cursed granny
who made those noises.

372
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,501
Impossible, she can't make any sounds.

373
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:36,834
Besides, she moves with her hair.

374
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,920
She doesn't walk.

375
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,042
Don't mention the hair anymore, seriously.

376
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,501
The mention of it made me realize...

377
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:44,125
...there's still some hair
inside my throat.

378
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,959
Say, what was Xie Lian Huan thinking...

379
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,042
...when he dug this?

380
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,642
What kind of fetish does he have?

381
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,918
It's all twisting and turning here.

382
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:12,001
It's not about his fetishes.

383
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,626
Further down here is the tomb's wall.

384
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,042
Behind the wall lies the sea.

385
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:18,042
The seawater will flow in
if he digs through it.

386
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,574
Hence, he could only switch his direction...

387
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:20,498
...and head upwards.

388
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,751
Was he thinking the same as I am,

389
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,167
escaping through the roof?

390
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,375
Great minds think alike, then.

391
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,250
But, the three of us
are surely stronger than him.

392
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,209
If he can get out of here alone,

393
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:34,250
we three stooges can make it out too.

394
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,709
But, he still died out here.

395
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:38,125
We won't die like he did, right?

396
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:42,999
I still don't believe...

397
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,334
...that my uncle killed him.

398
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:48,292
You're really your uncle's favorite nephew.

399
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,060
It's a dead end.

400
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,040
I've found the way out.

401
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,220
Come here.

402
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,580
Wu Xie!

403
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,940
Wu Xie!

404
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:19,751
Not bad, Mutey.

405
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,125
I guess that makes you
the third best in the world.

406
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,083
If it weren't for my help,

407
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,343
you wouldn't have beat him easily.

408
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:27,267
That's enough.

409
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,834
Poker Face is the better one here.

410
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:29,876
I'm not good?

411
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,918
He's good, and I'm not?

412
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:33,501
Do you know what "strategy" means?

413
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:35,751
It's called teamwork, cooperation.

414
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,459
You need two ones to make two.

415
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,740
Don't tell me...

416
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,167
...this is the chamber...

417
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
...with the palace's replica.

418
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,540
Fatty.

419
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,910
We're at the top of the tomb now!

420
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:54,876
Luminous pearls.

421
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:12,458
Wow.

422
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,042
This celestial palace is way too heavenly.

423
00:34:16,692 --> 00:34:18,292
The Forbidden City has a new rival now.

424
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,480
Fatty.

425
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,833
Look at this!

426
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,667
What's so interesting about a replica?

427
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:24,501
I can buy one for you online.

428
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,417
Planes, cannon, tanks,

429
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,292
aliens, you name it.

430
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,833
How is this the same?

431
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,420
Don't tell me...

432
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:35,626
...the celestial palace does exist.

433
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,800
Bro.

434
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,239
What are you looking for?

435
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,167
I think someone is watching us.

436
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,501
Don't tell me sea monkeys...

437
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,083
...live in groups.

438
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,500
So, we killed one,

439
00:34:58,626 --> 00:35:00,167
and his uncles, aunts,

440
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,375
granddads and grandmas...

441
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:02,542
...are here to avenge him?

442
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,667
Give us a break.

443
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,830
All this name-calling...

444
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,042
...might really call them here.

445
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:14,709
You never know.

446
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,640
Bro.

447
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:38,751
Do you think this Buddhist mummy here...

448
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,250
...is actually the tomb's owner?

449
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:41,382
Wang Zang Hai?

450
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't know.

451
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,459
Was Wang Zang Hai a monk?

452
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,501
Can you do more research on history?

453
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:52,000
Wang Zang Hai has never been a monk.

454
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:54,501
Instead, he's more accomplished...

455
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:55,542
...in the study of Taoism.

456
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,959
He's a <i>feng shui</i> guru.

457
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:59,125
That's not Wang Zang Hai, then.

458
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,751
Taoists are all about ascending the skies.

459
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,930
Leaving a mummified body
for others to pray to...

460
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,040
...sounds like a Buddhist monk.

461
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:05,667
It's not that clear-cut.

462
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,937
Actually,

463
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:09,584
many mummified bodies
in history are man-made.

464
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,209
For instance, the mummies in Egypt.

465
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,042
They used certain methods
and curing materials...

466
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,517
...to prevent the corpse from rotting.

467
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,751
Its texture is even akin
to that of a marble stone.

468
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:20,542
It's almost eternal.

469
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:23,709
So, this Wang Zang Hai
brought this upon himself.

470
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,042
He taxidermized himself.

471
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,000
Is he trying to imitate a pharaoh...

472
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,000
...and leave a body here
so he can return to life?

473
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:30,751
Mummies are made...

474
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,584
...because they're afraid of death...

475
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,940
...and wanted to pursue immortality.

476
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,626
Was Wang Zang Hai like that, too?

477
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,792
Judging from the structure of this chamber,

478
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,626
this should be the main chamber.

479
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:55,918
But, there's not even a coffin here.

480
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,360
Don't tell me...

481
00:36:57,876 --> 00:36:59,292
...this replica of a celestial palace...

482
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:00,542
...is actually his coffin.

483
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,375
If that's the case,

484
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:03,834
he <i>is</i> Wang Zang Hai.

485
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,292
But, I've always felt...

486
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:12,626
...a person who had created
a celestial palace...

487
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,999
...won't be so keen...

488
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:15,915
...to hide himself inside
an underwater tomb like this.

489
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:18,000
I say, why are you so stubborn?

490
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:20,370
I don't see the words
"Wang Zang Hai" on his face.

491
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,740
Since it's just a shriveled, old mummy,

492
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:22,790
let's just make a guess.

493
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:24,167
Who cares who it is?

494
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,160
Sir.

495
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,042
Wu Xie's arrived in the main chamber...

496
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,292
...and saw the mock-up
of the sky palace.

497
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,417
<i>He's worthy to be
a descendant of the Wu Family.</i>

498
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:11,542
Wu Xie looks like an ordinary person...

499
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,667
...with a little bit of intelligence.

500
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,375
<i>There are a lot of strange things
in the tomb of the ocean.</i>

501
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:19,542
Cursed grannies and sea monkeys.

502
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:21,417
But, he seems to have managed everything.

503
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:23,292
<i>He has two experts with him.</i>

504
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:25,792
With the experts and their help,

505
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:27,292
<i>that means he's capable.</i>

506
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,290
<i>They don't take him in as a fool.</i>

507
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,083
Well, with that in mind,

508
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,410
I think we can go a step further.

509
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,320
<i>Sir.</i>

510
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:37,260
<i>Are you sure that Wu San Xing...</i>

511
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,460
<i>...will care for Wu Xie?</i>

512
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,020
<i>He's nothing...</i>

513
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,450
...but ambitious.

514
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,600
Someone who won't stop for anyone.

515
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,542
Chinese people are most particular...

516
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,900
...about inheritance.

517
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:51,167
There are three brothers in the Wu family.

518
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:54,125
<i>Only Yi Qiong...</i>

519
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,792
<i>...is married with a kid.</i>

520
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,250
<i>The other two, Wu San Xing...</i>

521
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,240
<i>...and Er Bai, didn't marry.</i>

522
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,200
<i>Wu Xie is very important for the family.</i>

523
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,540
<i>I don't believe San Xing...</i>

524
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,520
<i>...would take risks with him.</i>

525
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,100
<i>Once we let him in,</i>

526
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,000
<i>San Xing will stay put.</i>

527
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:15,880
<i>And everything will start to go awry for him.</i>

528
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,540
And, he will cooperate with us then.

529
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,501
Although...

530
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,380
...if he should leave Wu Xie to die,

531
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,500
he will earn my respect.

532
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,520
<i>Sir.</i>

533
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:31,667
<i>I didn't find any copper fish.</i>

534
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm not surprised.

535
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:34,876
The wisdom of Wang Zang Hai.

536
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,360
<i>He wouldn't put all the things together.</i>

537
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,542
But, he built too many tombs.

538
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,542
We don't know which one...

539
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,667
...that the two copper fish are in.

540
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,375
I got an idea.

541
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:46,299
Don't worry.

542
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,709
<i>We've collected enough information about...</i>

543
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,180
<i>...the tomb in the ocean.</i>

544
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,000
<i>Anything else would be excessive.</i>

545
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,120
<i>Your mission is Wu Xie.</i>

546
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:57,751
Yes, sir.

547
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,910
<i>Watch out!</i>

548
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,320
Poker Face.

549
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:16,334
The drawings here show
the Changbai Mountains.

550
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,876
These murals are all chiseled on.

551
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:19,867
You can recognize them?

552
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:21,417
The main summits in the Changbai Mountains...

553
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,472
...have exceptional features.

554
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:24,709
Anyone with some knowledge
would be able to tell.

555
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,680
Look at this.

556
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,167
The mourners' clothes here are quite strange.

557
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:31,626
I can't tell which dynasty they're from.

558
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:33,000
It looks more like a minority race.

559
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:35,375
Right now, the clothing itself...

560
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,135
...can't tell us which dynasty
the palace is made.

561
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:38,292
The Ming dynasty.

562
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:40,501
Wang Zang Hai was from
the Ming dynasty, right?

563
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:42,876
Of course his palace
was built in the Ming dynasty.

564
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:45,501
Not bad, Fatty.

565
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:46,626
An old-timer, indeed.

566
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:48,918
You bookworms always come up...

567
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,370
...with some stupid theories
and a load of nonsense.

568
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:53,459
It's like squeezing blood out of a stone.

569
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,876
Experience is king, you know?

570
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,375
Yeah, yeah, you're all right.

571
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,918
So, Fatty, did you notice...

572
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,292
...that all the mourners here...

573
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,370
...are women?

574
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:07,792
Hey, you're right.

575
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:09,292
What kind of tradition is this?

576
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,250
I don't know what tradition it is as well.

577
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,334
Do you think the guy in the coffin...

578
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,584
...brought his whole family
to die with him?

579
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,860
That's brutal.

580
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:22,501
That's even worse than the Yang heroines.

581
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,880
Look at this

582
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:30,000
There's a lot of details on these murals.

583
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,083
With these leads,

584
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,410
we can just go to the area...

585
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,751
...and ask the locals there.

586
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,209
Then, we can find the exact
location of the palace.

587
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,334
It's just that...

588
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
...the palace is buried under the snow
for hundreds of years.

589
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,918
Besides, the permafrost is soft.

590
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,959
One wrong move will cause an avalanche.

591
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,542
Hence, digging out the palace...

592
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,250
...is almost impossible.

593
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:47,709
It's archaeology.

594
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,501
Of course it's going to be difficult.

595
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,817
If you're not willing to work to the bone,

596
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:55,459
you can't call yourself a true archaeologist.

597
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,700
You?

598
00:41:56,918 --> 00:41:58,709
-Archaeology?
-Young Comrade.

599
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:00,626
Don't you dare look down...

600
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:02,709
...on experiential
archaeologists like me.

601
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:04,999
We've also contributed much...

602
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,375
...to the field of archaeology.

603
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:07,792
In order to preserve relics,

604
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:09,459
we've gone through hell and fire,

605
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,292
and it's a lifelong commitment.

606
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,480
Fatty.

607
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,375
Tomb raiding is not archaeology.

608
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:18,000
With your lifelong involvement
in hell and fire,

609
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,375
it's a miracle that Chinese archaeology
has made it this far.

610
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:21,918
Mr Always-Right.

611
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,840
Mr Always-Right.

612
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:23,876
Don't be so judgmental.

613
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,959
Just say that you have no desire
to see this with your own eyes.

614
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:29,334
-I do have.
-That's great, then.

615
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,542
When we get out of here,

616
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,375
let's find a chance to go there together.

617
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:33,466
No way.

618
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:36,709
An insensible whelp like you...

619
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,751
...would have been
brushed off ages ago.

620
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,792
Don't you want to visit...

621
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:41,999
...a nice place like this?

622
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,334
Don't let this chance slip away.

623
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:46,375
Right now, I need to keep
my curiosity in check.

624
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:49,999
After all, my uncle is still missing.

625
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:56,209
That's a fancy-schmancy excuse.

626
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:57,542
Acting like a filial kid now, I see.

627
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,300
Poker Face.
