00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,540
"Explore with the Note"

2
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,860
"Episode 5"

3
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,042
<i>Wow!</i>

4
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,417
<i>-This is really...
-Gosh!</i>

5
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:23,876
<i>The Goddess Ma Zu.</i>

6
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,751
<i>Is this Heaven?</i>

7
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:28,918
<i>Oh gosh, this place is magnificent!</i>

8
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,834
<i>To think there's such a place inside a tomb.</i>

9
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,542
<i>This is incredible!</i>

10
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,660
<i>Yeah, this is a whole log of
golden-silk phoebe wood!</i>

11
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:35,959
<i>This is awe-inspiring!</i>

12
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,120
<i>Look at that.</i>

13
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,100
<i>Look at that!</i>

14
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,410
<i>Look, those are luminous pearls!</i>

15
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,125
<i>It's gorgeous.</i>

16
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,000
<i>All these 50 star maps
are embedded with luminous pearls.</i>

17
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,080
<i>Oh, gosh.</i>

18
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,000
<i>The tomb's owner must be made of money!</i>

19
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,792
<i>What are you looking at, Zhang?</i>

20
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:03,556
<i>This must be a replica
of the celestial palace...</i>

21
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,910
<i>...drawn on the porcelains.</i>

22
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,580
<i>Celestial palace?</i>

23
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,700
<i>Did he really build a celestial palace?</i>

24
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,209
<i>Where is it?</i>

25
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,417
<i>In the skies?</i>

26
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,220
<i>This is great!</i>

27
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:17,876
<i>This tomb is a treasure trove.</i>

28
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:18,930
<i>Ever since we came in,</i>

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,999
<i>we've been making new
archaeological discoveries!</i>

30
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,760
<i>When we find the celestial palace,</i>

31
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,792
<i>we're sure to rock the whole world!</i>

32
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:25,918
<i>-Yeah!
-That's right!</i>

33
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,000
<i>This is awesome!</i>

34
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,083
<i>Give me a hand here.</i>

35
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,143
<i>I'm going up to take a look.</i>

36
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:32,067
<i>Coming.</i>

37
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,080
<i>Slowly.</i>

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,960
<i>What's wrong?</i>

39
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,459
<i>There's a corpse over there!</i>

40
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,300
<i>Zhang Qi Ling.</i>

41
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,584
<i>Who are you?</i>

42
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,751
<i>How do you know these tomb raiding trades?</i>

43
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:56,542
<i>Who exactly are you?</i>

44
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,650
<i>Otherwise,</i>

45
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,580
<i>how can you be so calm...</i>

46
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,600
<i>...inside the tomb?</i>

47
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,209
<i>You snuck into our team.</i>

48
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:02,918
<i>What is your motive?</i>

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,960
<i>Wen Jin.</i>

50
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,709
<i>What's going on up there?</i>

51
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:09,876
<i>Who I am doesn't matter.</i>

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,760
<i>Look.</i>

53
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:22,959
<i>There's something inside.</i>

54
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,620
<i>Those who steal from others...</i>

55
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,220
<i>...will be prosecuted by Heaven.</i>

56
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,540
<i>It's alive!</i>

57
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,334
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

58
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:51,709
<i>This must be a reaction...</i>

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,209
<i>...caused by bioelectromagnetism.</i>

60
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:54,959
<i>It is a scientific phenomenon.</i>

61
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,380
<i>Go down.</i>

62
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,900
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

63
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:10,751
<i>-How is it?
-Wen Jin.</i>

64
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,000
<i>What's going on there?</i>

65
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:13,751
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,959
<i>What's with the blackout?</i>

67
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,999
<i>-The torch!
-Hurry!</i>

68
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,667
<i>Everybody, stay calm.</i>

69
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,760
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

70
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:40,549
<i>The w-w-wall!</i>

71
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,751
<i>It's a shadowgraph.</i>

72
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,040
<i>Light rays are projected
using a certain angle...</i>

73
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,292
<i>...onto this wall...</i>

74
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,840
<i>...and the carvings on this wall,</i>

75
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:15,132
<i>thus forming these images.</i>

76
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,540
<i>Yes.</i>

77
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,542
<i>Don't panic, everyone.</i>

78
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,083
<i>This is a scientific phenomenon.</i>

79
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,667
<i>What are these drawings about, then?</i>

80
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,340
<i>Zhang.</i>

81
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:26,501
<i>Any findings?</i>

82
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:28,292
<i>This looks like a narration.</i>

83
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,390
<i>It seems to be depicting...</i>

84
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,380
<i>...what happened when
the palace wasn't finished yet.</i>

85
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,800
<i>Look here.</i>

86
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,751
<i>This palace was actually built...</i>

87
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,751
<i>...on a very steep mountain range.</i>

88
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,709
<i>The summit is covered in mist.</i>

89
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,918
<i>The entire palace is surrounded by it,</i>

90
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:44,990
<i>making it seem like it's on a cloud.</i>

91
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,910
<i>He's right.</i>

92
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,959
<i>This looks like...
a snow mountain?</i>

93
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,120
<i>Look at this.</i>

94
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,334
<i>Isn't that snow on the summit?</i>

95
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,584
<i>This mountain has a high altitude.</i>

96
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,501
<i>But, I don't know which mountain it is.</i>

97
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,334
<i>They seem to be using a shadoof...</i>

98
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,083
<i>...to lift the coffin up
to the mountain.</i>

99
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,417
<i>The people down here...</i>

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,375
<i>...is the funeral procession, right?</i>

101
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,918
<i>So, the celestial palace...</i>

102
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,542
<i>...is actually a mausoleum.</i>

103
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,000
<i>Who's inside the coffin, then?</i>

104
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:28,459
<i>I've never seen any records related to this.</i>

105
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,910
<i>Neither have I.</i>

106
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,250
<i>Who is he?</i>

107
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:37,250
<i>Why is this gallery path on fire?</i>

108
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:40,458
<i>It's probably set by the tomb guards...</i>

109
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,751
<i>...after the funeral procession.</i>

110
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,120
<i>This is to destroy the only path
to the celestial palace.</i>

111
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:46,751
<i>Since no one can reach there,</i>

112
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,250
<i>the mausoleum is safe.</i>

113
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,083
<i>They can't go back down after that, though.</i>

114
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,417
<i>The tomb guards...</i>

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,209
<i>...are supposed to spend
their whole lives in the tomb.</i>

116
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,667
<i>These ancient people are so barbaric.</i>

117
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,292
<i>Why has the palace disappeared?</i>

118
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,999
<i>Did it really fly up to the sky?</i>

119
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:11,626
<i>This looks like an avalanche.</i>

120
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,792
<i>The palace was buried under the snow.</i>

121
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,542
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

122
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,040
<i>No.</i>

123
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:22,876
<i>It's the entire mountain...</i>

124
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,584
<i>...that's covered in snow.</i>

125
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,542
<i>So, this whole mountain...</i>

126
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,667
<i>...has turned into a real grave.</i>

127
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:30,751
<i>So much effort,</i>

128
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,334
<i>labor and resources were put in...</i>

129
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:33,501
<i>...to build this palace.</i>

130
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:34,751
<i>To think that's how it is now.</i>

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
<i>Wang Zang Hai probably
commissioned this drawing...</i>

132
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,626
<i>...out of frustration and regret.</i>

133
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,292
<i>Now, it seems...</i>

134
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:43,293
<i>...that even if we find
the location of the palace,</i>

135
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,330
<i>we can't even dig it out.</i>

136
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,660
<i>Don't worry.</i>

137
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,000
<i>I'm sure technology will continue to advance.</i>

138
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,870
<i>Someday, we'll find the celestial palace.</i>

139
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,800
<i>Yeah.</i>

140
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,360
<i>This one.</i>

141
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,920
<i>What's wrong?</i>

142
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:23,834
<i>There's someone in here!</i>

143
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,806
<i>What's going on?</i>

144
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,584
<i>There's...someone in here!</i>

145
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,876
<i>W-W-Who is it?
Show yourself!</i>

146
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,000
<i>It...</i>

147
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:32,459
<i>It's Wu San Xing!</i>

148
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,083
<i>I saw his face!</i>

149
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,542
<i>Are you sure it was San Xing?</i>

150
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,292
<i>Are you absolutely sure?</i>

151
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,459
<i>I just saw half of his face.</i>

152
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,020
<i>It's okay.</i>

153
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:54,709
<i>Except Zhang and the last person at the back,</i>

154
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,584
<i>turn off your flashlights.</i>

155
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:58,626
<i>We've been consuming a lot of electricity.</i>

156
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,790
<i>We'd better conserve it.</i>

157
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,167
<i>I'm scared.</i>

158
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,167
<i>Why? We've got so many people here.</i>

159
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,200
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

160
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,200
<i>Let's go together.</i>

161
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,083
<i>Don't sway your flashlight around.</i>

162
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
<i>Point it to the front!</i>

163
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:03,959
<i>Why is there water here?</i>

164
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,060
Poker Face.

165
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,660
So,

166
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,626
after you got out of the tomb,

167
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,950
you lost your memory?

168
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,792
In poem recitation,
we call this forgetting your lines.

169
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,376
In soap operas,
we call this a hanging ending.

170
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:08,459
In fan fiction,

171
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,167
we call this a hiatus.

172
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:12,542
It's not just about the tomb.

173
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,876
I don't even remember who I am.

174
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:17,999
It was only until a few months later...

175
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,940
...that I can remember bits
and pieces of my memories.

176
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:23,501
And, a few years later,

177
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,459
I realized there's something
wrong with my body.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,292
I don't remember what reason it was.

179
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:32,918
But, three months ago,

180
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,042
I ran into your uncle.

181
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,792
I find him very familiar.

182
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,125
In order to know more about myself,

183
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:42,542
I followed you to the tomb of Lord Shang.

184
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,640
When we were there,

185
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,584
I found out that something's
wrong with your uncle.

186
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,330
Poker Face.

187
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,250
You just...said so yourself.

188
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,480
You lost your memory after
coming out from the tomb.

189
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,542
Maybe the traps or the smell here...

190
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:25,876
...made you hallucinate.

191
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,000
So, before you fainted,

192
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,459
the person you saw wasn't my uncle.

193
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:30,876
My uncle isn't related to this.

194
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,584
The silk manuscripts...

195
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,584
...that you got from the bronze coffin...

196
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:36,751
...is fake.

197
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:37,965
I'm serious.

198
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,083
Your uncle switched it out.

199
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,540
Poker Face.

200
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:45,959
Why do I recall...

201
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:47,792
...that my uncle said...

202
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:49,709
...it was you who switched it out?

203
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,040
No.

204
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:53,918
It was your uncle.

205
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:55,918
Together with Da Kui,

206
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:58,292
they dug a hole at the back of the tree...

207
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,125
....which directly leads to
the coffin's bottom.

208
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,480
That's why Da Kui had to die.

209
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,880
It can't be.

210
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:13,959
That was just a dream.

211
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,792
Think about it.

212
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:18,501
How many times have your uncle...

213
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:19,959
...tricked and deceived you?

214
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,540
How many times did you realize...

215
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,120
...that your uncle
was behaving strangely?

216
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:26,083
I know my uncle best.

217
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,000
He would never harm me.

218
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,125
If that was really your uncle,

219
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:33,292
he definitely wouldn't harm you.

220
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,290
But...

221
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,042
What do you mean?

222
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:45,360
That's a whole lot of
useless nonsense you're talking.

223
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,375
No matter who's telling the truth,
or who's lying here,

224
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,972
all these will only make sense...

225
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,167
...when we're out of here.

226
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,459
What, you want to stay here?

227
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:54,417
Stuck here forever?

228
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,890
Why don't you each bring a stool here...

229
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,920
...and hold a discussion like
those neighborhood watches...

230
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,410
...to talk about these truths and lies?

231
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:00,918
Really.

232
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,209
Why don't you let Fatty here...

233
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:09,083
...primp and preen, gussy up
and put up a show?

234
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:06,083
Fatty, you're making my eyes burn.

235
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:07,667
Are you a cursed granny?

236
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,501
What do you know?
This is called character immersion.

237
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,083
At this very moment, I am Aphrodite herself,

238
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,792
and Aphrodite herself is me.

239
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:16,083
Open...

240
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,375
...sesame.

241
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,750
Open!

242
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,700
Open!

243
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,520
Okay.

244
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,700
Fatty.

245
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:24,965
Let me ask you.

246
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,270
You're not just...

247
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,180
...thinking of checking out
the celestial palace, right?

248
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,834
We mustn't make this trip a wasted one.

249
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:34,083
Even a few luminous pearls
will be worth our time.

250
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:35,459
Bravo.

251
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:36,611
I knew it.

252
00:20:36,681 --> 00:20:38,584
Even now, you're still
thinking of luminous pearls.

253
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,834
You've wronged me.

254
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,042
I do have a plan.

255
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,042
Didn't Mutey say this as well?

256
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,876
The passage leads up.

257
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,626
Add the room with the murals,

258
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,542
and the high roof crown here.

259
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,959
All these add up...

260
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,334
...to almost ten meters.

261
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:57,459
How deep is this tomb itself?

262
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,584
If we want to get out,

263
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,834
we need to aim for the roof crown.

264
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,292
So, right now,

265
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,542
we have three ways out.

266
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,584
The first way is to retrace our steps.

267
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,417
But, we still haven't figured out...

268
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,792
...how those side chambers move.

269
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,610
I don't know when exactly we can return...

270
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,910
...to the first chamber we entered.

271
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,167
The second way...

272
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:16,972
...is to find the secret passage...

273
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,287
...dug by the builders of this tomb...

274
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,891
...so that they won't end up
as sacrifice here.

275
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:20,972
But, this passage...

276
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:22,042
...leads to the seawater.

277
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,209
So, we're back to the old question.

278
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,709
With the water pressure here,

279
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:26,876
even if we go up,

280
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,584
we're bound to die from
dysbarism or embolism.

281
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,792
Hence, we can't go up.

282
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,000
The third way...

283
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,542
...is to dig our way out.

284
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:37,459
Look who's the expert here.

285
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,083
When we were at the tomb's entrance,

286
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,417
I took a look at the piezometer.

287
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,000
We were then 13 meters...

288
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,292
...below sea level.

289
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:45,918
Right now, this pool...

290
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,167
...is around 10 meters away
from the entrance.

291
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:49,250
So, right now,

292
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,667
we're not even 30 meters below sea level.

293
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,870
This means...

294
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,972
...the room with the palace's replica...

295
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:59,292
...is no more than
ten meters below sea level.

296
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:01,999
We really can get out of here.

297
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,083
Good work, Fatty!

298
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,194
You've finally gotten on point.

299
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:06,167
When have I never gotten on point?

300
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:09,459
Okay, I'm going back to groom my tresses.

301
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:10,876
Don't miss the tide.

302
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:13,709
Okay, have fun styling your hairdo.

303
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,792
By the way, let me warn you.

304
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,334
If we really get to enter that room,

305
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,876
don't touch anything.

306
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:21,250
If there are any traps hidden there,

307
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,709
it's not worth to lose your life...

308
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:23,876
...over some dead guy's stuff.

309
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,209
How annoying.

310
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,167
That's my last warning.

311
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,999
Don't touch the luminous pearls.

312
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,220
Bro.

313
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,417
I was talking with Fatty just now.

314
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:44,918
I've heard everything.

315
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:48,250
Your mama's got it.

316
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,751
Your mama's got it!

317
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,597
Your mama's got it!

318
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:55,876
Your mama's got it!

319
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,918
<i>Sparkling pearls...</i>

320
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:28,501
<i>A sparkling luminous pearl...</i>

321
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:31,584
<i>A sparkling luminous pearl...</i>

322
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,042
<i>Sparkling pearls, spa...</i>

323
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:41,584
<i>Sparkling pearls, sparkling pearls.</i>

324
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,167
<i>Sparkling pearl.</i>

325
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,209
Look at how narrow this road is.

326
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,918
If I can't fit inside here,

327
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:53,083
it either means the tomb owner
has a narrow mind,

328
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,999
...or that I have a really big heart.

329
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:57,709
What kind of road is this?

330
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,660
It's so narrow.

331
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:13,876
Have you noticed...

332
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,560
...that it's really quiet here?

333
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,042
And, this path...

334
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,334
...seems to have no end.

335
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,770
Maybe, at the end of it...

336
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,830
...lies the Milky Way itself.

337
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:22,334
That's as impossible...

338
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:23,626
...as wetting the sea.

339
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,626
Reaching the cosmos from the sea.

340
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:26,667
What were you thinking?

341
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,250
It's just a metaphor.

342
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,751
I've another metaphor for you, then.

343
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,830
An elephant passing through
the eye of a needle.

344
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,542
How can this road be so narrow?

345
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:36,459
This tomb's owner...

346
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,209
...must be really narrow-minded.

347
00:27:38,501 --> 00:27:40,584
I bet his heart is smaller than
the eye of a needle.

348
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,375
Not necessarily.

349
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,542
He must have had his reasons for this design.

350
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,620
After all, it's a tomb inside a shipwreck.

351
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,751
Space is limited here.

352
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,209
In order to highlight the palace,

353
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,840
he probably decided to cut off space here.

354
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,080
Besides,

355
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,580
grave robbers...

356
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,150
...are either short or thin.

357
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,754
Who would have thought
that a Fatso would come?

358
00:27:57,838 --> 00:28:00,042
Yeah, if we're talking about
tomb raiding legends,

359
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,375
my name surely tops the list.

360
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:02,876
If we're talking about body sizes...

361
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:05,870
I've already lost some weight, haven't I?

362
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,780
Really.

363
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:09,876
Hey, this...

364
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:11,876
-Don't laugh!
-Fatty Wang.

365
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:12,918
Everything was fine.

366
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:13,999
Now, I'm stuck!

367
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,667
No, something's wrong with this wall!

368
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,834
This is bad, the walls are closing in!

369
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,590
Let's go back first.

370
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,500
Let's go!

371
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,250
This is bad, we need to figure something out.

372
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,459
If not, this is going to be
the end of our journey.

373
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,501
Let's go back, we might have a chance.

374
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,330
It's too late.

375
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,120
Climb up here!

376
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,800
Let's go!

377
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:24,292
Come on, Fatty Wang!

378
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:45,834
Wait for me!

379
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,040
Come on!

380
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,990
Move!

381
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,800
That was close.

382
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,542
I say, I'd rather get shot by arrows...

383
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:06,999
...than turning into meat patties.

384
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,250
Luckily, you've got thick fat to protect you.

385
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:10,501
Take a quick break.

386
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:11,792
I hope we didn't break any bones.

387
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:13,751
No, I really need a good rest.

388
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,501
I really need rest.

389
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,280
Look at this.

390
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,180
What?

391
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,042
<i>Wu San Xing...</i>

392
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,030
<i>...left me with no way out...</i>

393
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,270
<i>...and made me die a wrongful death.</i>

394
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,440
<i>The Heavens can testify for me.</i>

395
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:47,667
Who's Xie Lian Huan?

396
00:30:47,751 --> 00:30:48,959
Why did Master Wu kill him?

397
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:50,918
Xie Lian Huan was part of
the archaeological team.

398
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:53,083
He's the one who was found dead on a rock.

399
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,410
<i>There seems to be a problem here.</i>

400
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,380
<i>What problem?</i>

401
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,870
<i>Right here, see?</i>

402
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:08,709
<i>You missed this spot.</i>

403
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,430
<i>-Let me take a look.
-Give it back!</i>

404
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,340
<i>What's wrong?</i>

405
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,270
<i>What's happening here?</i>

406
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,990
<i>I said he missed this spot,
but he won't admit it.</i>

407
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,584
<i>He's just picking on me.</i>

408
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,083
<i>That was a chance for you...</i>

409
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,542
<i>...to impress Wen Jin.</i>

410
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:19,751
<i>A lot of people...</i>

411
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:21,209
<i>...are dying to get close to her.</i>

412
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:25,690
<i>I'd like to see who's better than me,</i>

413
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,660
<i>the great Wu San Xing.</i>

414
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,459
<i>That's some bluffing there.</i>

415
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:29,999
<i>We're all part of the Mystic Nine.</i>

416
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:31,542
<i>Even if I...</i>

417
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:33,167
<i>That's enough, keep it down.</i>

418
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:35,417
<i>Do you need a loudspeaker instead?</i>

419
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:38,834
<i>Help me take a look at the water pump.</i>

420
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:40,530
<i>Something seems to be off.</i>

421
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,540
<i>You got it wrong.</i>

422
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,580
<i>You...</i>

423
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,167
<i>-I think he assembled it wrongly.
-Impossible.</i>

424
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:46,709
<i>What if it doesn't work later?</i>

425
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,990
<i>That's enough.</i>

426
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,700
<i>Wen Jin.</i>

427
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,830
<i>Let me handle it.</i>

428
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:04,667
<i>-Hurry, everyone!
-Okay.</i>

429
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,334
<i>The gang's all here.</i>

430
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:11,083
<i>You're all pretty well-equipped.</i>

431
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:13,834
<i>Very professional.</i>

432
00:32:14,626 --> 00:32:15,542
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

433
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,417
<i>I'm here to find you.</i>

434
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,450
<i>Bro.</i>

435
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:23,417
<i>I've been telling you all this time.</i>

436
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,417
<i>Can you bring me out to the sea, too?</i>

437
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:29,959
<i>What sea?</i>

438
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:31,709
<i>What do you want to see there?</i>

439
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,501
<i>You can plan your own vacation.</i>

440
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,584
<i>What's so fun about following
a team of archaeologists?</i>

441
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,460
<i>Bro.</i>

442
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:39,542
<i>Put in a good word for me to Wen Jin.</i>

443
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>I don't need to get paid.</i>

444
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,876
<i>I can even help you around.</i>

445
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,370
<i>I think I'm better...</i>

446
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:45,999
<i>...than those college students
on her team.</i>

447
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,250
<i>Spill the beans.</i>

448
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:50,959
<i>What's on your mind?</i>

449
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,480
<i>I...</i>

450
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:57,970
<i>I'm doing a favor for someone.</i>

451
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,930
<i>Who?</i>

452
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,840
<i>What does he want?</i>

453
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,330
<i>A white guy.</i>

454
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,790
<i>Was it the guy...</i>

455
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:04,334
<i>...who went to Harpoon Ridge with you?</i>

456
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:06,584
<i>Bro.</i>

457
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:09,042
<i>How did you know that?</i>

458
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,334
<i>That is none of your business.</i>

459
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,501
<i>I'd like to ask you instead.</i>

460
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:15,918
<i>How did you know about
the blood thrall's tomb?</i>

461
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,751
<i>It was Cox Hendry.</i>

462
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,834
<i>Cox Hendry?</i>

463
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:24,792
<i>The white guy.</i>

464
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:27,709
<i>He's been staying in Changsha
for a long time.</i>

465
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:29,626
<i>I know him.</i>

466
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:30,876
<i>I don't know...</i>

467
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,584
<i>...how he knew about
the blood thrall's tomb.</i>

468
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,876
<i>But, he's not well-acquainted
with the surroundings there.</i>

469
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,834
<i>That's why he wants me
to follow him as a guide.</i>

470
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,417
<i>You know how dangerous the place is, Bro?</i>

471
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,083
<i>I almost lost my life there!</i>

472
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:42,125
<i>You deserve it.</i>

473
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,083
<i>To think you dared to hang out
with a bastard like Cox Hendry.</i>

474
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:47,167
<i>Wait till he sends a telegram...</i>

475
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,751
<i>...that sends you to the gallows.</i>

476
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,584
<i>I'm fine, Bro.</i>

477
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:53,667
<i>We're living in a commercial world now.</i>

478
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,501
<i>It's all about the brains.</i>

479
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:03,751
<i>Cox Hendry...</i>

480
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,667
<i>...wants me to run
some errands at Xisha.</i>

481
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,125
<i>But, the place is so sensitive.</i>

482
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,751
<i>Without approval from the coastal guards,</i>

483
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,876
<i>regular boats can't enter there.</i>

484
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,918
<i>Well... If I follow the team
of archaeologists,</i>

485
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:17,167
<i>that'd be convenient.</i>

486
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,125
<i>Don't worry, Bro.</i>

487
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,167
<i>I promise you...</i>

488
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,375
<i>...that this won't affect
Wen Jin in any way.</i>

489
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,250
<i>Forget it if you can't help.</i>

490
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,751
<i>I'll think of something else.</i>

491
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,333
<i>It's not that I can't help.</i>

492
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,042
<i>But, I'm not the one making decisions here.</i>

493
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,201
<i>I need to discuss with Wen Jin.</i>

494
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:51,605
<i>Of course she calls the shots.</i>

495
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,375
<i>Wen Jin is the leader, right?</i>

496
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,708
<i>Here, Bro, let me propose a toast.</i>

497
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:04,918
<i>You unfilial son!</i>

498
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,959
<i>You... How will you
answer to Xie Lian Huan?</i>

499
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,751
<i>How will you answer to the Xie family?</i>

500
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,250
<i>How will you answer to Xie Lian Huan?</i>

501
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,167
<i>How will you answer to the Xie family?</i>

502
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,000
Speaking of what we went through just now,

503
00:36:36,876 --> 00:36:40,417
I'm sure I'll lose a pound
or two when I go back.

504
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,542
I'm going to continue working out
till I lose ten pounds.

505
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:45,999
I can't take this anymore,
let's take a break.

506
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:47,959
I can't take it.

507
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,990
Let's take a break.

508
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:56,999
Looks like Xie Lian Huan is a real expert.

509
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,584
This tunnel is shaped like a 'Z'.

510
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,417
Even if a minor cave-in happens here,

511
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,167
it wouldn't be much of a danger.

512
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:06,042
In such a panicky situation,

513
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,167
he could still remain calm.

514
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:08,375
That's not an easy feat.

515
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:09,417
His name is Xie.

516
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,409
He's a descendant from
part of the Mystic Nine, isn't he?

517
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,584
Mutey, your team...

518
00:37:13,876 --> 00:37:16,626
...still landed in trouble even when
there's you and the Mystic Nine.

519
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:18,591
I can't remember.

520
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,167
You remember the way down, don't you?

521
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:22,959
You've been there before.

522
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:25,709
Anyway, your team did okay last time here.

523
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:28,792
So, how come we almost
ended up being meat patties?

524
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,042
Did you lead us to the wrong path?

525
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:33,459
Maybe the marks on the monolith
have been changed.

526
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:38,751
It's possible...

527
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:40,592
...that we didn't enter the right gate,

528
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:42,209
but a booby gate.

529
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,959
Who would do such a thing?

530
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,600
Ning.

531
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:52,334
I say, this lass is really...

532
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,459
This Ning, she...

533
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,667
Maybe Ning wants us dead.

534
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:58,459
But, she's not capable...

535
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,959
...of tweaking ancient mechanisms.

536
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,167
It's your uncle, then.

537
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:03,751
But, don't worry.

538
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:05,626
He won't harm his favorite nephew.

539
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,327
He can only bear ill will
towards Xie Lian Huan.

540
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:08,551
By the way, what kind of grudge...

541
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:09,842
...does your uncle hold against him?

542
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,542
Impossible, Xie Lian Huan is my relative.

543
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,125
He's around the same age as my uncle.

544
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,667
I even met him when I was little.

545
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,910
I still remember him.

546
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,083
Peer rivalry?

547
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,580
Bro.

548
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,167
How much do you still remember...

549
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:25,709
...about Xie Lian Huan?

550
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,740
He doesn't remember.

551
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,560
See?

552
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,459
But, I have a hypothesis.

553
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:40,334
If your uncle and Xie Lian Huan
know each other,

554
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:41,959
and they're even on good terms,

555
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,834
they didn't show that
when they joined the team.

556
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:48,834
But, during their first dive,

557
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:51,792
Xie Lian Huan discovered
the underwater tomb...

558
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,959
...as well as its entrance.

559
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:55,792
He didn't tell the others,

560
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,375
but he told your uncle.

561
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,542
<i>With their backgrounds,</i>

562
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,417
<i>they won't give such an opportunity up.</i>

563
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:05,970
<i>So, they waited for a chance...</i>

564
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,540
<i>...where they can leave
the boat unnoticed...</i>

565
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:10,292
<i>...so they can both dive
to the underwater tomb.</i>

566
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,292
<i>Both of them are experts.</i>

567
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,501
<i>It wasn't something hard for them.</i>

568
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,410
<i>Bro!</i>

569
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,626
<i>Wu San Xing!</i>

570
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,375
<i>Open the door!</i>

571
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:35,834
<i>Open the door, Wu San Xing!</i>

572
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,334
<i>What are you doing?</i>

573
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,501
<i>Open the door!</i>

574
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,999
<i>What are you doing?
Open the door!</i>

575
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,125
<i>Wu San Xing!</i>

576
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,125
<i>Wu San Xing!</i>

577
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,375
<i>Open the door!</i>

578
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,417
<i>Open the door!</i>

579
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:57,375
No man can resist the prospect of treasure.

580
00:41:57,459 --> 00:42:00,042
Lots of tomb raiders have killed
their own companions during raids.

581
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,042
It's nothing new.

582
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:06,360
We won't know what exactly
sowed discord between them.

583
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:08,000
But, one thing's for sure.

584
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:10,667
When Xie Lian Huan realized he's doomed,

585
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,417
he left his last words here using his blood.

586
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,990
However,

587
00:42:15,227 --> 00:42:17,999
he then found out
this wall is actually hollow.

588
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:20,083
So, he used his equipment...

589
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:21,751
...to dig a tunnel here...

590
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:23,834
...and saved himself.

591
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:30,000
But, he was later found dead on a rock.

592
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,520
Maybe...

593
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,890
...after Xie Lian Huan managed to escape,

594
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,450
he went to look for your uncle.

595
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,501
But, your uncle...

596
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:40,834
...killed him instead.
