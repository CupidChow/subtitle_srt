00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,200
"Episode 9"

3
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,459
<i>Even though those nightmares
have never stopped haunting him,</i>

4
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>Wu Xie has decided...</i>

5
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:46,626
<i>...that he will no longer be troubled by
those intangible clues.</i>

6
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,257
<i>Since...</i>

7
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,751
<i>...throughout every thrilling experience,</i>

8
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,667
<i>the happy memories that he had...</i>

9
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,250
<i>...were so vivid.</i>

10
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,510
<i>As if they were happening right before him.</i>

11
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,334
<i>When I found out I'd be entering the
mysterious underwater tomb of Xisha,</i>

12
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,083
<i>I felt more exciting than fear.</i>

13
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:07,502
<i>Exploring the stories...</i>

14
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,915
<i>...that were long gone with history
in tombs...</i>

15
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,319
<i>...has always been...</i>

16
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,999
<i>...one of my pleasures.</i>

17
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,507
<i>However,</i>

18
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,501
<i>the truth is not as simple as I imagined.</i>

19
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:19,292
<i>What has gotten into you? Let's go.</i>

20
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,716
<i>What I've encountered in these tombs...</i>

21
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,208
<i>...completely changed my understanding
of the ancient technology...</i>

22
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:35,083
<i>...of traps and methods of geomancy.</i>

23
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:38,750
<i>I found out that
there are many mysteries in my life...</i>

24
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,354
<i>...are related to these tombs.</i>

25
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,042
<i>When I was young...</i>

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
<i>It's itchy.</i>

27
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,174
<i>Stop messing around.</i>

28
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,709
<i>Nobody can predict the future.</i>

29
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,999
<i>Wu Xie thinks that what he gains
in each adventure...</i>

30
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,584
<i>...is the reason to hold on.</i>

31
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:21,173
<i>Wu Xie.</i>

32
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,349
<i>I've got some results on the old photo
you asked me to investigate.</i>

33
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,083
You just gave me this one photo.

34
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,626
This is the only result I found online.

35
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,834
According to the IP address,

36
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,819
we can be sure that
the person who posted it was in Beijing.

37
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,167
Who are these people in the photo?

38
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,469
This is an archaeology team from decades ago.

39
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:43,918
My Uncle was one of them.

40
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,083
But this is my first time...

41
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,210
...seeing such a detailed name list.

42
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,027
Aside from this name list,

43
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,674
were there other things you found out?

44
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,584
I've tried everything that I could.

45
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:56,424
Look.

46
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,584
Island 701?

47
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,379
Can you locate this person's position?

48
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:04,501
Island 701.

49
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:05,758
There are others...

50
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,542
...who are using this username, too.

51
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,918
The last time it appears...

52
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,792
...was in Taraxacum's system.

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,440
I've checked out their website.

54
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,876
I think it's an Information Technology
headhunting company.

55
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,029
Their headquarter is in Hangzhou.

56
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,042
Taraxacom?

57
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:34,751
Taraxacom Information Technology Co Ltd.

58
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:41,834
What are you trying to do?

59
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,834
You're engaging a high-end IT company
to find Island 701?

60
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,291
The post...

61
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,375
...provided a clue
that has been neglected by us.

62
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:50,158
What clue is that?

63
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,375
On July 20th,

64
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,480
my Uncle and Chen Wen Jin discovered
the entrance of the underwater tomb.

65
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,884
There were ten people on the name list.

66
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,292
Then, Xie Lian Huan left the team
on his own and died.

67
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,377
There should be
nine more people left on the list.

68
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:03,212
But on July 24th, there were only
eight people on the name list.

69
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:04,754
One people was missing.

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
Yes.

71
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,027
If he didn't enter the underwater tomb,

72
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,626
it means he's not dead.

73
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,518
But why didn't he enter the underwater tomb?

74
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,591
I assume...

75
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:27,792
...that he knew...

76
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,337
...there was danger in the tomb.

77
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,626
So he left on his own.

78
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:34,552
So you think there's something wrong
with the person up there?

79
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,083
We'll find out after we test him.

80
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:47,257
Fatty.

81
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:55,542
I have a question.

82
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,132
What is it?

83
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,417
Why should I dress like this?

84
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,708
Just pretend to look serious.

85
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,792
Remember, you're the boss of an organisation.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,840
The big boss.

87
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,834
I'm already a boss.

88
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,318
The boss of Beijing Antique Market.

89
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,543
-What is this?
-Tuck it in.

90
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,166
I don't usually wear these clothes.

91
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,250
What a waste to buy them.

92
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,417
I have to return it later.

93
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:17,542
Tuck it in.

94
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,215
Remember.

95
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,915
What's most important for an actor
is to be believable.

96
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,034
You're the actor.
Your whole family are actors.

97
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,542
It's so awkward.

98
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:28,501
So awkward.

99
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,834
Is that Island 701 that important?

100
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,950
Shouldn't we pay attention to...

101
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,209
...Wang Zang Hai and Heavenly Palace?

102
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,435
This is our only clue.

103
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,719
Tell me, is it important?

104
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:43,166
This is such a mess.

105
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,250
We can't just do this on impulse, right?

106
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,799
What's his name? Xiao Huo?

107
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,257
It's Xiao Yu.

108
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,674
-Hello.
-Hello.

109
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,295
We're here to see Mr Xiao.

110
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,486
Mr Xiao is attending a meeting.

111
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,209
Do you have an appointment?

112
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,106
I called Mr Xiao's secretary yesterday.

113
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,462
We're here to talk about our collaboration.

114
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,709
Okay, I'll take you to the lounge.

115
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,466
-This way, please.
-Okay.

116
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:10,674
Did you really make an appointment?

117
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,090
Of course I didn't.

118
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,212
Let's get inside first.

119
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,667
You're really bold.

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,840
Did you see him?

121
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:50,466
Xiao Yu.

122
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,007
Please come in.

123
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:00,839
Have a seat.

124
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:05,674
Hello, Mr Xiao.

125
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,799
We are...

126
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,000
We are from Sunflower Turing Robot
developing company.

127
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,667
This is our boss, Mr Wang.

128
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,751
I'm Wu Xie, the Creative Director.

129
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,507
Have a seat.

130
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,007
First,

131
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,667
I'd like to thank Mr Xiao for giving me
a chance to introduce my company.

132
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:34,916
Our company is...

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,584
...the first company in China
that is developing Turing Robot.

134
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,937
Actually the foreigners have started
to develop Turing Robot long ago.

135
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,999
This is definitely
the most promising industry now.

136
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,915
For an IT company to top the industry,

137
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,292
artificial intelligence
will be your best option.

138
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,882
I'll present my idea to you.

139
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,667
If you provide me the big data in your cloud,

140
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,751
I can instantly stimulate you
an artificial intelligence robot.

141
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:00,000
It will definitely suit your company,

142
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,760
be definitely user-friendly
and definitely exceed your expectations.

143
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:08,792
Don't waste your time here.

144
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,501
You've probably misunderstood
about our business.

145
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,671
I hope you manage to find a partner...

146
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,375
...in the future...

147
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,000
...and realise your dreams.

148
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,396
I have another meeting this afternoon,

149
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,750
so I'll not waste anymore time with you here.

150
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:22,674
You know the way out.

151
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,501
Mr Xiao, I think I didn't make myself clear.

152
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,083
I know your company does best
in big data cloud.

153
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,526
Let me give you another example.

154
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,667
With a random username,

155
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,458
like Island 701, once a strange term
like this appears,

156
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,022
it will be recorded in your big data.

157
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,667
If it is in your cloud database,

158
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,254
you can analyse its footprint
through the data.

159
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:42,894
If its footprint increases over time...

160
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:45,257
I don't know what is your intention
to be here.

161
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,610
I only have one thing to tell you.

162
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,042
I can't provide anything you want.

163
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,507
There won't be any collaboration
in between us.

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,840
Send them out.

165
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:55,923
This way, please.

166
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,166
Didn't you just put a sign over
where you hid the money?

167
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,546
He didn't give us any information,

168
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:04,796
why did you mention Island 701?

169
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:07,083
-I did it purposely.
-Purposely?

170
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,882
I wanted to see what's his reaction
when he hears this username.

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,250
But why?

172
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,382
What? I've seen this photo.

173
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:22,334
Take a closer look
on the name list Island 701 mentioned.

174
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,299
Chen Wen Jin, Huo Ling,
Li Si Di, Zhang Qi Ling.

175
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:27,751
Xiao Da?

176
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,501
Xiao Huo has something to do with Xiao Da?

177
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,827
I don't know.

178
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,083
But I'm sure he has
something to do with Island 701.

179
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:37,215
Because after I mentioned this name,

180
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:39,417
his reaction says it all.

181
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,417
-Hello.
-Hello.

182
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,667
Oh, you're here, too. I remember you.

183
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:47,916
Aren't you Mr Wang?

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,250
Yes.

185
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,667
You came before, right?

186
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,334
Yes.

187
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:52,299
I remember you.

188
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:54,915
It dropped.

189
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,834
-Let me pick it up for you.
-Don't break it.

190
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,775
Time's running out. How long
will it take for remote control?

191
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:19,960
<i>Show me his computer first.</i>

192
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,632
-Be careful.
-Okay.

193
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,250
Oh, right.

194
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:30,125
I'm here again to see Mr Xiao.

195
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,799
Last time, our staff, Xiao Xie...

196
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:38,632
What happened?

197
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:40,250
<i>My computer has been hacked.</i>

198
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,375
You're Island 701.

199
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,870
-I can't do anything about it.
-It must be hard on you.

200
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,990
What are you doing?

201
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,417
Mr Xiao, I really mean you no harm.

202
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,501
Please tell me the truth
about the underwater tomb.

203
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,591
-Let go of him.
-Yes.

204
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,626
I've heard enough reasons like that.

205
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,412
Everyone who came to ask
about the archaeology team...

206
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:11,999
...said they want to know the truth.

207
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,166
I won't call the police this time.

208
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,290
You're on your own.

209
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:16,873
Just tell me whatever you know.

210
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,477
I promise I won't disturb you anymore.

211
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,209
I'm not leaving no matter what.

212
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:22,542
Because my Uncle went missing a month ago.

213
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,250
You're the only one who has the clue.

214
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:26,923
Your Uncle?

215
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,459
My Uncle is Wu San Xing.

216
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:34,834
Sir, you can't go in.

217
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:38,042
I'm sorry, Mr Xiao. I couldn't stop him.

218
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:42,459
A month ago,

219
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,739
my Uncle was taken advantage of.

220
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,727
He went missing in the underwater tomb.

221
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,221
I personally went into the tomb to find him.

222
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:50,502
But I couldn't find him.

223
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,292
If what you say is true,

224
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,605
I understand and sympathise with you.

225
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:58,882
But I'm sorry.

226
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,626
I only know the things from the past.

227
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,000
They won't be of any help to you.

228
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,132
As long as you give me
the data in your cloud,

229
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,918
I will decide...

230
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,584
...if they are of any help.

231
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,375
I have nothing to do with what happened then.

232
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:34,799
I was never part of it. So,

233
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,709
please understand.

234
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,199
I don't want to be disturbed...

235
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,072
...because of this matter again.

236
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,090
All right.

237
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,170
After a long morning,
I'm done acting with you.

238
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,090
Where's my pay?

239
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,132
Stop messing around.

240
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:58,500
I think he refused to tell us
because of other reasons.

241
00:14:58,584 --> 00:14:59,500
What other reasons?

242
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,083
He's just a jerk in disguise.

243
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,083
What other reasons?

244
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,832
I think he doesn't want
his family to be affected...

245
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,083
...because of this issue.

246
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:07,838
Whatever it is, I'm telling you,

247
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:10,999
Island 701 is a dead end.

248
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:12,876
It's not a dead end.

249
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,458
You go back to Beijing.

250
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:15,382
What?

251
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,208
You want me to come and go as you wish?

252
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,919
I just arrived this morning
and you want me to go back...

253
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,838
If you don't want to go back,
then just stay in Hangzhou.

254
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,546
I'll pay for your meals.
I'm going to meet Ji Jiu Zhang.

255
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:24,466
Wait.

256
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:29,132
I...

257
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:24,999
-Doctor.
-Yes?

258
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,840
-Hello.
-Hello.

259
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,333
-Dr Li?
-Yes.

260
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,000
Do you know you cured my mother?

261
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,646
She's great and healthy at home.
I have to thank you.

262
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,667
That's my obligation.

263
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:39,125
Actually I'm here to find Xiao Yu.

264
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:40,049
Mr Xiao.

265
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,167
His mother, right?

266
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,125
Mr Xiao's mother, right?

267
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,875
She should be sunbathing by the lake now.

268
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:46,919
Mr Xiao should be there, too.

269
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,500
Yes, his mother. All right.

270
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,834
How do I go to the lakeside?

271
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:51,751
Do you want some water?
I'll get it for you.

272
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:57,584
All the water in this lake
can last for a few lifetimes.

273
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,876
Titanic.

274
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,007
Auntie.

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,541
Are you Xiao Yu's mother?

276
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,791
-Come.
-I'm...

277
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,999
I'm...

278
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,462
-I'm...
-How should I address you?

279
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,791
My surname is Wang.

280
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,132
Wang.

281
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,584
You're Wang's son, right?

282
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:26,584
Yes.

283
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,501
-I know your father.
-Yes.

284
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:29,915
Your father is Wang...

285
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,125
Wang...

286
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,459
Wang Ba...

287
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,500
-Ba?
-Ba Si.

288
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:35,459
All right.

289
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,340
To be honest.

290
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,170
Your mother's condition of
intermittent abnormality...

291
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,209
...and amnesia is getting worse.

292
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,215
We don't have better solutions now.

293
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,424
Just spend more time with her
to go for a walk.

294
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,417
Try to avoid some sensitive issues.

295
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,674
Okay.

296
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:52,674
Mr Xiao.

297
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:54,632
Why are you here?

298
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:55,882
Where's my mother?

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,333
Your friend came to visit her.

300
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,542
She was chatting with him.

301
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,584
What friend is that?

302
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,257
-Mr Xiao!
-Mr Xiao!

303
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,958
You work together?

304
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,876
He doesn't only have
that Taraxacom IT company,

305
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,042
we even work together in archaeology.

306
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,208
We go into something like underwater tomb...

307
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:15,375
...or Island 701.

308
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:16,792
Do you know all these?

309
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:19,916
-Underwater tomb?
-Auntie.

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,125
-Mom!
-Auntie, don't move.

311
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,625
Who asked you to do archaeology?

312
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,375
Tell me.

313
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,754
Who asked you to do archaeology?

314
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,625
Who asked you to do archaeology?

315
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,125
Mom, it's fine now.

316
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,751
<i>Xiao Yu is more resolute than I imagined.</i>

317
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,059
<i>Everything about the archaeology team...</i>

318
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:51,125
<i>...is crucial to Wu Xie
to solve the mystery.</i>

319
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,667
<i>All of the confusion...</i>

320
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,042
<i>...seemed to lead to
that Snake-Browed Copper Fish.</i>

321
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:58,292
<i>What kind of a power could it have...</i>

322
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,918
<i>...to make so many people chase after it?</i>

323
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,876
There are three Snake-Browed Copper Fishes.

324
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,362
One is in the Tomb of Lord Shang.

325
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,643
One is in the underwater tomb in Xisha.

326
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,959
Where would the last one be?

327
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:20,276
Would it be in the Heavenly Palace?

328
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:22,501
There are three tombs.

329
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,860
One was from the Warring States period.

330
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:26,918
One was from the Ming Dynasty.

331
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,876
The last one...

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,999
...might be the Heavenly Palace,
where the nobles of...

333
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,337
...ethnic minorities are buried.

334
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:33,537
What do these three tombs...

335
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,000
...have in common?

336
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,799
Where's the suit?

337
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,716
I've returned it.

338
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:52,965
I'm impressed.

339
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:07,584
What are you plotting again?

340
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:10,417
What's poking me?

341
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,626
What is it?

342
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,209
The thing that you wanted.

343
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,625
I didn't give up after we got kicked out.

344
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,875
After a while,

345
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,626
I followed him to the nursing home.

346
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,333
I met Xiao Yu's mother.

347
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,626
She has mid-stage dementia.

348
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:28,959
<i>I'm really envious of you.</i>

349
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,652
<i>You have a mother to take care of.</i>

350
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,083
<i>I have no family.</i>

351
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,125
<i>All of my family is gone since I was young.</i>

352
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:39,542
<i>Mr Xiao.</i>

353
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,007
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

354
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,132
<i>Seriously,</i>

355
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,083
<i>both of you are quite alike.</i>

356
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,299
<i>He...</i>

357
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,810
<i>...lost his family member and
is searching for that family member.</i>

358
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:03,965
<i>And you...</i>

359
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,520
<i>...are taking care of your family member.</i>

360
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,257
<i>Hold on.</i>

361
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,125
<i>What was Wu San Xing's...</i>

362
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:20,876
<i>...last known position?</i>

363
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:23,542
Xiao Yu looks cold-blooded...

364
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:25,706
...and keeps a very keen wariness
to protect himself.

365
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:26,999
But it's not his fault.

366
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:30,549
A family ended up like this
because of tomb raiding,

367
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,542
it would've been the same as anyone else.

368
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:37,196
His father is Xiao Da?

369
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:38,466
You're right.

370
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:43,542
You know,

371
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:47,292
Xiao Da was the only one
in the archaeology team...

372
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:48,834
...who didn't go into the tomb.

373
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,834
<i>My father went to Xisha with Wu San Xing,</i>

374
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,959
<i>Chen Wen Jin and the team.</i>

375
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:56,844
<i>A day before they went in,</i>

376
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,199
<i>he had a high fever instead.</i>

377
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,341
<i>The team left him alone at sea.</i>

378
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,000
<i>When he woke up,</i>

379
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,720
<i>three days had already passed.</i>

380
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,334
<i>Did he go into the tomb himself?</i>

381
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,840
<i>He didn't dare to.</i>

382
00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:12,250
<i>I investigated the work unit
of the archaeology team.</i>

383
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:14,369
<i>But I couldn't find anything.</i>

384
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,507
<i>What happened next?</i>

385
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:19,250
<i>Then, he returned to Beijing alone.</i>

386
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:23,146
<i>My father visited Xisha
at least three times a year.</i>

387
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,209
<i>It lasted for two to three years.</i>

388
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:27,299
<i>Until...</i>

389
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,074
<i>...someone came to find him.</i>

390
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,125
My Uncle went to find him?

391
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:35,544
He went to find Xiao Da.

392
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:36,958
Xiao Da was very happy.

393
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:39,500
He has always been a fan of your Uncle.

394
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:40,950
Did my Uncle mention about other things?

395
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,458
Did he mention about the others?

396
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:43,382
No.

397
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,375
Instead, he asked Xiao Da...

398
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:50,501
...about the whereabouts of those people.

399
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:53,447
<i>My father has been following
Wu San Xing's train of thoughts.</i>

400
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:55,739
<i>If Wu San Xing couldn't explain,</i>

401
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,209
<i>he wouldn't ask.</i>

402
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,527
<i>My father asked Wu San Xing...</i>

403
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:01,469
<i>...about what happened back then...</i>

404
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:02,792
<i>...in the underwater tomb.</i>

405
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,250
<i>What did Wu San Xing say?</i>

406
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:07,549
<i>He said...</i>

407
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:10,304
<i>...that regardless
if they're dead or alive,</i>

408
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:12,409
<i>he wanted to see the person...</i>

409
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:13,834
<i>...or the body.</i>

410
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:19,551
<i>But I think what he was really looking for...</i>

411
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:20,999
<i>...wasn't these people.</i>

412
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,132
Fatty.

413
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:27,992
There's an MP3 recording here.

414
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,751
This was recorded by Xiao Yu.

415
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,876
He recorded the fight
in between your Uncle and Xiao Da.

416
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,000
<i>Why did you not go?</i>

417
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:41,299
<i>Brother Xing.</i>

418
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,819
<i>What exactly are we searching for?</i>

419
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,375
<i>Teammates of the archaeology team.</i>

420
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,667
<i>But we've searched half of China...</i>

421
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,042
<i>Aren't they all dead?</i>

422
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,696
<i>If I can escape from the tomb,</i>

423
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,129
<i>then they must've been able to do the same.</i>

424
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:55,375
<i>Not the same.</i>

425
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:57,000
<i>Xie Lian Huan is dead.</i>

426
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:58,958
<i>How could they still be alive?</i>

427
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:00,083
<i>They must be alive.</i>

428
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:01,417
<i>They have the key.</i>

429
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,584
<i>The secret will not stay hidden forever.</i>

430
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,042
<i>It will eventually be revealed.</i>

431
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,900
<i>The situation that we're in right now...</i>

432
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:10,542
<i>We must not forget our true goal!</i>

433
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,000
<i>Do you know what I mean?</i>

434
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:16,466
Fatty.

435
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,501
Who drew this?

436
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,667
I don't know, Xiao Yu didn't say.

437
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:24,334
Can you ask him?

438
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:25,834
It's all here.

439
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:27,587
Why don't you just figure it out yourself?

440
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,667
I promised not to disturb him.

441
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:30,271
I'd be shameless to disturb him again.

442
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,459
I wouldn't mind to be shameless.

443
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,626
Mr Xiao.

444
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,918
I'm sorry for disturbing you at this hour.

445
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:49,709
Can I just trouble you one more time?

446
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:52,584
There's something here.

447
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:55,667
Can you tell me who drew it?

448
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:08,000
Just look at it yourself.

449
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,112
<i>I don't know what this is either.</i>

450
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:14,709
<i>My father fought with Wu San Xing
many times because of this thing.</i>

451
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:17,839
<i>I guess it's related to my father's missing.</i>

452
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:31,589
Master Hua isn't here?

453
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:33,758
He's already here.

454
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:00,632
<i>They sent a photo to our email.</i>

455
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,794
It's exactly the same
with the old photo you've sent.

456
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:03,758
That's not right.

457
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:04,834
To be precise,

458
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,570
this photo does not have
the words that you wrote.

459
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:08,919
They've been edited out.

460
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,049
<i>I checked it.</i>

461
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,399
<i>It's not edited with your photo.</i>

462
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,709
Besides, there's also
a Snake-Browed Copper Fish...

463
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:18,911
...on this photo.

464
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:23,000
The Snake-Browed Copper Fish is with him?

465
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:24,854
<i>He wants to meet you.</i>

466
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,507
<i>I checked it.</i>

467
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,280
<i>His IP address has been altered.</i>

468
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:29,341
<i>Should we meet him?</i>

469
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:30,882
Yes.

470
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:32,751
<i>Should we make any arrangements?</i>

471
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,083
Put him on a boat.

472
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,709
Don't let him get away.

473
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,090
<i>Okay.</i>

474
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:29,876
Cool.

475
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:37,459
Why did you bring me here?

476
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,709
Are you rewarding me?

477
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,403
You could say that.

478
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:45,375
The girls are sexy.

479
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,083
You're not going to get one of them?

480
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,459
Go ahead and get one.

481
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:53,299
I'll pass. I'll wait for you here.

482
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:54,918
Don't you regret it.

483
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:13,311
You're the person who wants to meet me?

484
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,123
Someone wants to meet you.

485
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,501
-Come over for a while.
-Okay.

486
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:37,632
What do you mean?

487
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,667
What's the matter, Wu Xie?

488
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:44,459
Request a song.

489
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,542
I'm sorry, Sisters.

490
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:56,292
I lost in a truth or dare game.

491
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,250
My buddy insisted me to come here...

492
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,751
...to buy you this drink.

493
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:03,792
Come on.

494
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:05,716
How is it?

495
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,039
Who's going to talk first?

496
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,187
You have the clue about
the Snake-Browed Copper Fish.

497
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,334
You're also investigating
Snake-Browed Copper Fish?

498
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,382
You talk first.

499
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,215
You talk first.

500
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:20,132
Okay.

501
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:22,424
Come on.

502
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:30,049
Okay.

503
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,726
I have one Snake-Browed Copper Fish now.

504
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,490
I need to gather the other two.

505
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:37,982
How do you know there are three in total?

506
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:38,965
I guessed it.

507
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:40,375
What did you base your assumption on?

508
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:41,859
That is the third question already.

509
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,937
You're just asking and not talking.

510
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,203
Are we still friends or not?

511
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,125
I'm just too anxious.

512
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,599
Snake-Browed Copper Fish...

513
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,300
...is very important to me.

514
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,546
Since you're also investigating
Snake-Browed Copper Fish,

515
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:57,291
then you should have seen the photo.

516
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,575
The archaeology team of Xisha?

517
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,167
Then you must know...

518
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,194
...that my Uncle, Xie Lian Huan...

519
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,834
...was also in the photo.

520
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,180
Which one is your Uncle?

521
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,799
-This one.
-This one?

522
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,602
Are you sure this isn't my third uncle?

523
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,958
This photo is of low resolution.

524
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,667
No wonder you made a mistake.

525
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:25,042
As far as I know,

526
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,834
they looked very much alike
when they were young.

527
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,501
Even if someone called them twins,

528
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:30,826
people would've believed them.

529
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Don't forget...

530
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:35,250
...that Xie and Wu families
were related in marriage.

531
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,292
They were cousins.

532
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,042
So, what's wrong with looking alike?

533
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,122
<i>Master Xie, I've brought
the young master here.</i>

534
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,709
<i>Uncle, you're back.</i>

535
00:30:57,918 --> 00:30:59,358
<i>What trouble did you get into again?</i>

536
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:00,716
<i>Yu Cheng.</i>

537
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:05,417
<i>He's your third uncle from Wu family.</i>

538
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:09,751
<i>They look very much alike.</i>

539
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:10,999
<i>Hello, third uncle.</i>

540
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:19,292
Only then did I know...

541
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,177
...that they both
joined an archaeology team.

542
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:25,334
But the ship that transported
my uncle went missing.

543
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,375
Even my uncle's body...

544
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:28,751
...couldn't be found.

545
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:30,918
So, up until now,

546
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,250
he's not included in Xie family's tomb.

547
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:40,174
<i>Look at this.</i>

548
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:46,632
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,125
What are you sorry about?

550
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:53,250
You haven't told me...

551
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:56,679
...how you deduced
that there are three copper fishes.

552
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:57,999
And you even know...

553
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,102
...that copper fishes
are related to the archaeology team.

554
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:04,090
Are you investigating
the archaeology team, too?

555
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:07,999
A while ago,

556
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,643
I went to the underwater tomb of Xisha.

557
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:19,341
Wu Xie.

558
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,142
You shouldn't be involved in this.

559
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,382
Listen to me.

560
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:25,758
Stop investigating.

561
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:27,974
As long as I can't locate my third uncle,

562
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:30,709
I will continue to investigate this case.

563
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,250
Before I got here,

564
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,325
I worried something might happen.

565
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,382
So I put the Snake-Browed
Copper Fish at home.

566
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,501
When I return to Hangzhou,

567
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,083
I'll deliver it to you.

568
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:48,746
Why are you giving it to me?

569
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:50,558
There are three copper fishes in total.

570
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,876
If you have two of them,

571
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:54,876
perhaps it will help...

572
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:56,166
...to find the other one.

573
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,174
I'm not interested in the secret behind...

574
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,280
...the Snake-Browed Copper Fish.

575
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:03,136
I wanted to find
the copper fish belongs to me...

576
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,250
...because I might...

577
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,501
...find out the reason my uncle died.

578
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,799
Xiao Hua.

579
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:11,918
Looks like the two of us...

580
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,250
...are doing the same thing.

581
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:16,382
So,

582
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:19,000
if you have any clue,

583
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,174
remember to tell me.

584
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,799
Okay.

585
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,918
Did you come alone?

586
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:50,822
Do you want me to send you back?

587
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,167
No need. I came with a friend.

588
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:54,132
Let me introduce.

589
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:10,965
It's him?

590
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,751
Why didn't you tell me?

591
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,375
What if something happens to you?

592
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,299
What if human traffickers take you away?

593
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:25,583
Luckily it was Xiao Hua.

594
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,792
Otherwise you wouldn't even know
how you died.

595
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,643
I didn't expect it to be Xiao Hua, too.

596
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:31,918
He shocked me, too.

597
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,375
Xiao Hua really lives up to his name.

598
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:36,000
He dresses in such a fancy manner.

599
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,007
He's crazy.

600
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,466
It appears that...

601
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,761
...he's also investigating the truth
of the underwater tomb back then.

602
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,215
He wants...

603
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,626
...to find out...

604
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,495
...the cause of death of
his uncle, Xie Lian Huan.

605
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,389
Did you tell him about the blood writings?

606
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,984
That's what I worried the most.

607
00:34:52,998 --> 00:34:54,208
If he knows...

608
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,042
...about the writings,

609
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,504
he will really think that my third uncle...

610
00:34:58,584 --> 00:34:59,834
...killed Xie Lian Huan.

611
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,111
Do you think my uncle did it, too?

612
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
No.

613
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:12,999
You can't be sure
that your uncle didn't do it, right?

614
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:18,758
So,

615
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,417
I must find out the truth...

616
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,907
...and give Xiao Hua an answer.

617
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:24,529
I can't let my uncle be framed...

618
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,334
...and not let Xie Lian Huan die in vain.

619
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,709
Sir, turn left ahead.

620
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:40,751
All right, stop thinking about it.

621
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:43,125
I don't care about justice,
but I do care about my friends.

622
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,918
I will never betray my friends.

623
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:47,250
Bro is an introvert.

624
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,246
Besides, he doesn't even know Xiao Hua.

625
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,209
It's not possible.

626
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:52,667
If anything happens, Fatty Wang is here.

627
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,417
Don't worry.

628
00:35:58,584 --> 00:35:59,626
I feel sorry...

629
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:01,626
...towards Xiao Hua.

630
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,375
Why do you keep overthinking things?

631
00:36:05,209 --> 00:36:07,169
Let's have a drink.
Then you'll forget everything.

632
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,042
Besides,

633
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,382
think about it.

634
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:18,542
If you manage to find out...

635
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:21,209
...how did Xie Lian Huan die,

636
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:24,292
aren't you also helping Xiao Hua?

637
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:25,584
What do you think?

638
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:28,250
Are you two really that close?

639
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:32,626
You're just childhood friends
who happened to be playing together.

640
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:34,751
So what? When I was in kindergarten,

641
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,501
I was pretty close with a girl.

642
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,542
We even hold a wedding and kissed.

643
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:40,916
But if we meet now,
we wouldn't know each other.

644
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
Fatty.

645
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,125
Book a flight ticket to overseas.

646
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:45,959
What are you going to do?

647
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,959
I found a way to help Xiao Hua.

648
00:37:14,918 --> 00:37:17,042
We don't even know if it's a scam message...

649
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,876
...and now we're abroad.

650
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:23,375
I don't know if you're crazy or I'm crazy.
I guess we're both crazy.

651
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:24,417
Hello.

652
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:28,250
The Snake-Browed Copper Fish
is not something common.

653
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,236
Most people wouldn't know about it.

654
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:31,674
Hello.

655
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,876
Mind your step, please.

656
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,876
Let me tell you, out there is abroad.

657
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,299
You don't know.

658
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,417
-Just like this.
-Hello.

659
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:43,876
This place is not in our country,
it's abroad. Right?

660
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:45,719
We'll be safe if we're back in our country.

661
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,042
It's dangerous out there.

662
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:48,003
So,

663
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,096
if we're looking for someone
or want to talk about something,

664
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,584
just do it in our country.

665
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:54,751
If we're in our country, we'll be safer.

666
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,375
-You're right.
-Of course.

667
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:58,341
Can we go now?

668
00:37:58,959 --> 00:37:59,959
Where are we going?

669
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,167
Hendry Museum.

670
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:04,549
How do we go?

671
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:12,459
Come on, Fatty.

672
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,417
This is the bike you rented?

673
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,792
You're blaming my bike for being slow?

674
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,838
How about this? Let's make a bet.

675
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,741
Let's see who reaches Hendry Museum first.

676
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:22,674
What's the bet?

677
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,758
What's the bet? We'll talk about it later.

678
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,250
Whoever reaches first has to take a video...

679
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,337
...and upload it on Weibo.

680
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:29,840
-No denying it!
-Start now!

681
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,959
Hello, I'm Wu Xie.

682
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,421
I made a bet with Fatty Wang...

683
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:11,003
...on who reaches Hendry Museum first.

684
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,125
I reach first. This
video will be my proof.

685
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:14,716
Do you see that?

686
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:22,758
Fatty is here.

687
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,083
-What?
-Fatty.

688
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:31,252
Do you accept your lose?

689
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:32,501
Yes.

690
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,027
Just tell me what you want.

691
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,240
I haven't thought about it yet.

692
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:38,876
We're here, right?

693
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,417
This museum is not that big.

694
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:42,671
How about this?

695
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:43,876
You owe me a wish.

696
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:45,958
Once I think of something,
then you will repay me.

697
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:47,584
What? You're serious?

698
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:48,792
Of course.

699
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,709
I got a wedgie.
