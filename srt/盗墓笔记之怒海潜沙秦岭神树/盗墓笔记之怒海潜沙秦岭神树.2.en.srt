1
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,700
"Explore with the Note"

2
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,100
"Episode 2"

3
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,410
Uncle?

4
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Uncle.

5
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,660
What are you doing here?

6
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,540
What kind of ship is this?

7
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,950
How many times have I told you?

8
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,580
Stay out of my business.

9
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,830
Why won't you listen to me?

10
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,700
Uncle.

11
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,310
It was Ning who told me...

12
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,610
...that you had a misadventure.

13
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
That's why I...

14
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,370
Comrade.

15
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,079
Rise and shine.

16
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,660
Young Comrade.

17
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,670
Hallucinating again?
What dreams did you have?

18
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,310
You have too much on your mind now,
and you're confused.

19
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,380
Look at me.

20
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,710
Whenever I feel stuck,

21
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,630
I'd chant.

22
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,500
<i>All money go my home.</i>

23
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,800
Hurry, get up.

24
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,090
Hurry up.

25
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,630
Here, this should bring your spirits back up.

26
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,770
I say, when we enter the tomb,

27
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,920
we will slowly unravel the mystery.

28
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
Got it?

29
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,500
You guys are already digging in
without waiting for us.

30
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,000
That's so rude.

31
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,420
Eat quickly.

32
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,750
We're almost at the shipwreck site.

33
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,590
These are freshly caught?

34
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,590
When it comes to seafood,

35
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,804
you need to enjoy it on the sea...

36
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:11,478
...while the fisherman
makes his catch of the day.

37
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,020
Spare your efforts.

38
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,170
We're going underwater later, so no drinking.

39
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,170
The location of the shipwreck
was pinpointed by your uncle.

40
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,910
Apparently, he has also located
the tomb chamber.

41
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,840
Later on,

42
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,880
we'll be counting on you.

43
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,380
You don't even believe me.

44
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,380
My uncle really didn't tell me anything.

45
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,960
I'm just an archaeology fan,

46
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,460
and I've done some reading on it.

47
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Don't worry, though.

48
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,950
Since it's for my uncle,

49
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,830
I will definitely do my best.

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,330
Wine is my blood, beer is my tea.

51
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,010
Nothing beats some booze before a raid.

52
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,500
It gets sweeter with every gulp.

53
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,000
I got it from the fisherman.

54
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,910
Where did you swipe this?

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,130
What swipe?
I exchanged it with my sorghum wine.

56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,130
That's what we call...

57
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,990
...cultural exchange of wines.

58
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,690
Not bad.

59
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,000
Have a taste, guys.

60
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,000
Give it to me.

61
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,910
Baldy, you can drink?

62
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,000
I say, deal.

63
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,250
I don't like your temper,

64
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,200
but I'm up for a round of drinking with you.

65
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,700
What's a feast without some booze?

66
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,000
-We're drinking pals.
-Yeah, yeah.

67
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,080
Come, come.

68
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,750
I'll get down to business.

69
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,870
The three of you are experts in this field.

70
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,070
Do you have any suggestions...

71
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,070
...for the expedition later?

72
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,040
Is the location confirmed?

73
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
It's confirmed.

74
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,740
The frogmen are cleaning up the rubble now.

75
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,790
All right, then.

76
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,930
For me, this is a potential jackpot.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,250
I'm going to swim all my way in.

78
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,580
Any traps?

79
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,250
Even if there are,

80
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,440
they won't be too complicated.

81
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,000
Firstly, they're underwater.

82
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,120
There's the erosion and water pressure.

83
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,400
Second,

84
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,447
building a tomb underwater...

85
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,870
...is a big trap by itself.

86
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,910
In the past,

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
when technology wasn't that developed yet,

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,880
the tomb owner probably
didn't expect that future tomb raiders...

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,910
...would do their homework
underwater for long.

90
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,380
So, even if there are traps,
they won't be too complicated.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,200
That's what we call...

92
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,870
...<i>plain sailing</i>.

93
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,660
Here, have some booze.

94
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,800
Here.

95
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,830
Where's Ning?

96
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,620
Sir. Everything's going as planned.

97
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,280
Soon comes the crucial step.

98
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,790
<i>Keep your eyes on Wu Xie.</i>

99
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,540
The Wus are tricky.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,120
Don't let him...off-hook.

101
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Yes, sir.

102
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,460
Sir.

103
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,370
Was Mr Zhang involved in any of our projects?

104
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,700
<i>No.</i>

105
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,000
<i>What about him?</i>

106
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,870
I have a feeling.
It's just a hunch that...

107
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,790
<i>...something's off about him.</i>

108
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,289
If he threatens the operation,

109
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,100
take him out.

110
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,179
Yes, sir.

111
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,539
Remember.

112
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,580
<i>Your safety is important.</i>

113
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,520
Ning.

114
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,240
You're my most valuable asset.

115
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,500
Okay, got it.

116
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,450
They said that the entrance tunnel
is very long.

117
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,410
A part of the structure has collapsed.

118
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,910
They're placing stilts for support now.

119
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,620
We'll go down once they're done.

120
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
"The sunken ship's anchor"

121
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,360
"The sunken ship's anchor is set."
"It must be huge."

122
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,620
"Head forward, everyone."

123
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,840
"The marking to the tomb's entrance,
left by my uncle when he came here."

124
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,940
"Come and take a look."

125
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,840
"My uncle was here,
and the entrance is here."

126
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,220
"Check your equipment, and go."

127
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,020
"What are you gawking here? Move!"

128
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,060
"Stop."

129
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,320
"The guy on the wall carvings,
his eyes are opening."

130
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,140
"Let's go."

131
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,700
"Come here."

132
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:20,839
"I saw something nearby."

133
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,340
"What's wrong?"

134
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,520
"I see a lot of hair."

135
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,340
"Impossible."

136
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
"Look down here."

137
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,960
"What the heck was that?"

138
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,000
"How would I know what that was?"

139
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,040
"Oxygen level: 20.9 percent"

140
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,770
Baldy, what in the world
is wrong with your hands?

141
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,700
What were you doing?

142
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,010
You almost made me vomit my gut out!

143
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,950
I might just throw my intestines up on you!

144
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,580
I had to do it.

145
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,750
If I didn't trigger that trap,

146
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,370
you'd be devoured by
that hairy creature, you know?

147
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,450
Mind your own business.

148
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,250
Stop fighting.
Let's go up.

149
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,330
Young Comrade, what is this place?

150
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,180
There aren't any coffins or caskets here.

151
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,660
This is probably one of the side chambers.

152
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,750
I'm home.

153
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,960
Check this out!

154
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,540
There are some footprints here.

155
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,140
Whose footprints?

156
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,290
Can this be Master Wu's?

157
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,870
This footprint seems new.

158
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,140
It's so tiny.

159
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,770
It's a child's, right?

160
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,910
He's no older than three years.

161
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,180
This isn't a playground.

162
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,410
What's a kid doing here?

163
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,200
Wax.

164
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,080
Yeah, it's wet all right.

165
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,690
Corpse wax?

166
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,660
A zombie.

167
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,200
Have you realized?

168
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,290
These footprints are heading outwards.

169
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
They're not heading in here.

170
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,860
This is a coffin for babies.

171
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,200
Was the kid the tomb owner's relative,
or a mere sacrifice?

172
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,410
He's a sacrifice.

173
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,580
There's a lot of good stuff in here.

174
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,870
Especially the stomach.

175
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,200
There are pearls inside, you know.

176
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,370
That's worth a fortune.

177
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,990
Where's the kid?

178
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,870
Baby.

179
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,750
Where's the kid?

180
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,840
Hey, baby.

181
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,910
Naughty little baby.

182
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,290
I'm going to find you.

183
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,300
Lower your voice.

184
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,160
They were sacrificed at such a young age.

185
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,370
You're disturbing him.

186
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,990
No need for crocodile tears, bozo.

187
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,950
Okay, I give up.

188
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,370
Let me see what's left here.

189
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,320
Wait.

190
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,560
This coffin...

191
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,870
...is different from the rest.

192
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,040
We'd better not open it.

193
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,530
We're not here to loot.

194
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,930
Look for the main chamber now.

195
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,860
Stop dilly-dallying.

196
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,370
This is damn creepy.

197
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,450
Why don't we strike first...

198
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,520
...and blast this open?

199
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,910
This urn was made in
the Yuan or Ming dynasty.

200
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,480
Destroying it would be a cultural loss.

201
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,450
We can't carry this heavy thing out anyway.

202
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,120
Is there another path?

203
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,330
What other paths do we have?

204
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,400
It's either this doorway...

205
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,750
...or the hole
which we came in from.

206
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,580
We can either step over this urn...

207
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,910
...or take a flight back to Beijing.

208
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,450
I'll treat you to dip-boil mutton,

209
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,620
roasted duck and pork stew.

210
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,330
Why are you afraid of a mere urn?

211
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,760
Move.

212
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Why did you hit me?

213
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,220
It hurts.

214
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
I'm moving.

215
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,820
Let's go.

216
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,290
This urn sure looks like our tour guide.

217
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,040
Put a red cap and a flag on him,

218
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,080
and he'll say,

219
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,250
"Look this way!"

220
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,540
"Follow me!"

221
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,560
That's enough.

222
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,790
These pranks...

223
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,000
...are used to scare people.

224
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,000
What if he has a mind of his own?

225
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,000
That's very likely.

226
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,000
That's enough, you two.

227
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,100
Let's go.

228
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,830
Wait, such tunnels are usually...

229
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,120
...equipped with traps.

230
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,330
Let me do a check first.

231
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,790
If my uncle was here...

232
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,410
The door in front is ajar.

233
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,910
Someone must have been in there.

234
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,120
It probably wasn't my uncle.

235
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,790
If he did come here,

236
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,080
all the traps here...

237
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,310
...would have been disassembled...

238
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,240
...or triggered.

239
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,870
The way you tread around this place...

240
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,040
...can be consequential.

241
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,450
You sure you can do it, Young Comrade?

242
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,320
Follow me.

243
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,160
Okay.

244
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,830
Damn it, let go of him!

245
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,740
Are you okay?

246
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,460
Fatty!

247
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,500
Move!

248
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,080
Calm down!

249
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,310
Don't touch it!

250
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,220
Don't panic.

251
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,200
-Calm down, it's okay.
-Fatty, look!

252
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,400
Look behind you!

253
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,660
W-Wait a minute...

254
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,700
S-Something's really off here.

255
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,950
Why doesn't it hurt at all?

256
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,880
Yeah.

257
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,880
It doesn't hurt at all.

258
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,640
Fatty.

259
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,450
Does being shot by arrows feel this good?

260
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,450
I've never died before, I don't know.

261
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,320
You...!

262
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,040
There's not even a single drop of blood.

263
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,560
Yeah.

264
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,750
We're really all right.

265
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,040
Move.

266
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,440
Go.

267
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,720
Mr Zhang.

268
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,660
Did you catch it?

269
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,950
It's too fast, I can't keep up.

270
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,260
You two...

271
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,500
We're fine.

272
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,040
Where's Ning?

273
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,450
That lassie is a total crook.

274
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,620
She used us as shields.

275
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,790
She's damn ruthless.

276
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,800
I say, Baldy.

277
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,040
Your mistress is already inside.

278
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,250
Aren't you following suit?

279
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,910
Ning stepped on the trigger deliberately.

280
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,500
You!

281
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,250
Mutey Zhang.

282
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,080
You're here for a cameo?

283
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,870
You deceived us all along!

284
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
These are lotus arrows.

285
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,500
They're harmless.

286
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,120
So, the tomb's owner
set up all these traps...

287
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,830
...to scare us off?

288
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,700
I say, this tomb's owner...

289
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,410
...is as nutty as a fruitcake.

290
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,660
He's sick in the head.

291
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,410
He could've just killed us.

292
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,250
What's with all these gimmicks?

293
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
Ning triggered the trap on purpose.

294
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,250
It might seem that she wants us dead.

295
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,410
But, actually,

296
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,830
these are lotus arrows.

297
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,800
They're harmless.

298
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Now, that's weird.

299
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,950
With her own ability,

300
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,700
she can definitely enter the tomb by herself.

301
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,330
Yet, she used all means to bring us here.

302
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,360
What's her motive?

303
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,250
She felt that this job's too easy,

304
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,660
and she doesn't need us anymore,

305
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,910
so she's butchering the horses
after riding it, see?

306
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,640
Don't tell me...

307
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,160
...it was my uncle...

308
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,830
...who told her about
the tomb's secrets.

309
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,040
Anyway, she's ditched us.

310
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,870
That means she wants to go alone...

311
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,120
...and do some secretive stuff.

312
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,910
She must know where the baubles are,

313
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,450
and she's having them all for herself.

314
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,580
I say, these foreign antique dealers...

315
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,810
...have no sense of mercy.

316
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,500
They'd kill anyone without batting an eyelid.

317
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,830
Okay, stop dilly-dallying here.

318
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,840
Let's give chase.

319
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,040
Go to the chamber on the left.

320
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,370
Mutey, you can't just show up here...

321
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,870
...and give us blind instructions.

322
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,450
Can you trust a little zombie?

323
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,070
He must be leading us to the zombie hideout.

324
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,980
What will become of us?

325
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,140
We're going to be zombie food.

326
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,120
Just listen to Poker Face.

327
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,540
Go to the left chamber.

328
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,330
Entering the lion's den, aren't you?

329
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,790
Okay, as you command.

330
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,980
Hold on.

331
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,080
Bring the oxygen tanks here.

332
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,330
In case anything happens.

333
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,620
Don't do that again.

334
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,659
We've been circling around for ten minutes.

335
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,639
Where is it?

336
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,679
Don't tell me...

337
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,920
...we're on the wrong path.

338
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,580
Ning has gotten rid of the urn.

339
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,980
Impossible.

340
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,290
She clearly went into the chamber.

341
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
Unless there's another path.

342
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,699
Didn't we just pass by here?

343
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,560
The side chamber we were in
didn't have any pillars.

344
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,219
He's right.

345
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:50,150
The baby coffin at the corner...

346
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,060
...has also disappeared.

347
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,040
The funerary items are also
arranged differently.

348
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,159
And...

349
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,280
...look up here.

350
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,660
How could this be?

351
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Did we go the wrong way...

352
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,080
...or enter the wrong passage?

353
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,870
But, there has only been...

354
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,910
...one single path.

355
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,820
Stop searching.

356
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,270
There is only one single path here.

357
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,474
If we're really in the wrong path,

358
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:34,948
I'll take a zombie as my wife.

359
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,200
Hasn't your uncle told you...

360
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,950
...about the passageways
in this tomb?

361
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,000
Bro.

362
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,900
Have you been...

363
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,840
...to this tomb before?

364
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,960
I don't know.

365
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,340
You don't even know if you've been here?

366
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,830
Are you getting Alzheimer's?

367
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,640
Maybe I have.

368
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,200
Some of these places seem familiar.

369
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,120
But, I can't recall them.

370
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,790
I say, Young Comrade.

371
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,270
Underwater tombs are huge finds.

372
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,507
Hasn't your uncle told you about it?

373
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,540
Think about it again.

374
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,620
My uncle...

375
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,160
...did tell me a lot of stories.

376
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,777
But, I don't know which of them is true...

377
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:26,790
...or fake.

378
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,860
Okay.

379
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,250
I'm going to share my part, then.

380
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,120
Before this, I've asked Ning...

381
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
...how Master Wu knew about
this underwater tomb.

382
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,290
Ning said...

383
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,990
...that there was a gang of
tomb raiders...

384
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,000
...who detonated a shipwreck
in the Xisha Islands.

385
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,330
They found a tomb there.

386
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,580
The tomb's cover...

387
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,450
...was almost
completely destroyed.

388
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,030
The outer wall of the tomb...

389
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,234
...was also damaged in some parts.

390
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:48,790
But, they just couldn't find...

391
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,700
...a good way to enter the tomb.

392
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,060
No.

393
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,540
What do you mean it's almost destroyed?

394
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,910
You saw it as well.

395
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,410
There wasn't any severe damage.

396
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,700
It was Ning who said that.

397
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,040
I'm just quoting her.

398
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,250
I'm sharing my story here.

399
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,330
Are you listening?

400
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,160
Really.

401
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,790
Where was I?

402
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,790
Right.

403
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,620
There was also a team of archaeologists...

404
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,200
...who knew about this.

405
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,620
After the tomb raiders left,

406
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,050
this team of archaeologists...

407
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,750
...conducted a secret
expedition here.

408
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,770
<i>The tomb down here is sealed.</i>

409
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,940
<i>The outer wall is waterproof.</i>

410
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,870
<i>It's sealed with plaster.</i>

411
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,700
<i>-It's likely that there's air.
-That's great!</i>

412
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,260
<i>Professor Zhang.</i>

413
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,510
<i>You're the expert here.</i>

414
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,460
<i>Take it from here.</i>

415
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,500
<i>I can only see
the two characters in the middle.</i>

416
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,640
<i>Interior ministry.</i>

417
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
<i>The interior ministry
is a palace department...</i>

418
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,600
<i>...that monitors
the production of royal items.</i>

419
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,960
<i>This box...</i>

420
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,450
<i>...may be from the Ming dynasty.</i>

421
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,200
<i>There should be something
wrapped inside this cloth.</i>

422
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,337
If we want to enter the tomb,

423
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,620
we need to push the walls open.

424
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,160
But, we're underwater.

425
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,200
Once the walls are open,

426
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,500
the water will pour in.

427
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,780
No one will know what will happen...

428
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,830
...to this tomb by then.

429
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,450
Besides, this is archaeology here.

430
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,870
Protecting relics is the main priority.

431
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,840
You can't follow my suit...

432
00:38:49,924 --> 00:38:51,091
...and blast everything in the way.

433
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,790
The only thing that's certain...

434
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,580
...is that the water inlet
holds the key.

435
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,620
Someone had suggested...

436
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,540
...to dig a tunnel
underneath the tomb.

437
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,580
But, after evaluating the geology here,

438
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,250
they found out that the soil here...

439
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,000
...isn't native to this area.

440
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,950
Instead, it's vitrified clay
from the Guan kilns in Fujian.

441
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,230
The sealed area is as wide as...

442
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,330
...7000 square meters.

443
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,660
If we calculate with this ratio,

444
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,740
they couldn't reach the bottom
with the technology back then.

445
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,950
But, they still dug on.

446
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,620
And they've dug 15 meters deep.

447
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,950
They still couldn't reach the bottom.

448
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,540
They couldn't estimate...

449
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,410
...how much longer...

450
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,910
...or how much deeper
they had to dig.

451
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,870
Coupled with some other external factors,

452
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,990
the whole team left.

453
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,410
The area was then buried by sand again.

454
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,330
The funniest thing was...

455
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,330
...that their records back then...

456
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,620
...were all gone.

457
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,160
A few years later,

458
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,250
another team of archaeologists came.

459
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,120
Your uncle was part of it.

460
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,700
<i>This is too preposterous.</i>

461
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,970
<i>How could he go out by himself?</i>

462
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,330
<i>He didn't even tell us at all.</i>

463
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,560
<i>Exactly.</i>

464
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,660
<i>What if something happens?</i>

465
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,260
<i>Look over there!</i>

466
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,200
<i>On top of that rock!</i>

467
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,770
<i>-Where?
-Where?</i>

468
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
<i>I see him!</i>

469
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,790
The snake-browed copper fish?

470
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,700
Yeah.

471
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,990
Ning said...

472
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,900
...your uncle felt...

473
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,580
...that the team member
who died accidentally...

474
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,080
...must have gone down
to the tomb.

475
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,430
The copper fish inside his hand
was his proof.

476
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,300
So, they searched around the vicinity...

477
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,950
...and found 40 gigantic
stone anchors.

478
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,970
We saw those anchors...

479
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
...on our way here.

480
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,750
<i>That's right.</i>

481
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,600
<i>There's a tomb inside a shipwreck...</i>

482
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,330
<i>...right under our very feet
in this sea.</i>

483
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,200
<i>-Really?
-A tomb inside a shipwreck?</i>

484
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,370
<i>It means the tomb was built on a ship.</i>

485
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,080
<i>Then, they found a valley
or trench under the sea.</i>

486
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,700
<i>They chiseled a hole in the ship
and made it sink down.</i>

487
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,500
<i>After covering it with soil,
the sunken ship becomes a tomb.</i>

488
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,200
<i>It's actually the same as tombs on land.</i>

489
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,700
<i>It's just that it's under the sea now.</i>

490
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,410
<i>This place must have been
a sea valley in the past.</i>

491
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,620
<i>It was then filled up with soil.</i>

492
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,950
<i>Oh, God.</i>

493
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,200
<i>That's a gargantuan task.</i>

494
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,700
<i>Is that possible in ancient times?</i>

495
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
<i>-Yeah.
-Wen Jin.</i>

496
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,910
<i>We've finally found it.</i>

497
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,000
What happened next?

498
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,060
After that,

499
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,580
your uncle made a dive down.

500
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,160
Then, the whole team backed off midway again.

501
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,370
Another hanging ending.

502
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,160
Until recently, your uncle...

503
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,430
...approached Ning's company...

504
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,790
...to enter the tomb again.

505
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,950
Let me reiterate this.

506
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,500
It was Ning who told me all these.

507
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,680
I don't know if it's true or not.

508
00:41:17,764 --> 00:41:19,290
But, I think it sounds pretty rational.

509
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,200
She doesn't need...

510
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,370
...to make up any stories
and fool me.

511
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,250
Unless...

512
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,910
Unless my uncle lied to her.

513
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,880
Yes.

514
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,290
I remember when I was little,

515
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,910
my uncle did leave home...

516
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:49,830
...for a long time.

517
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,450
When he came back, he was tanned and scrawny.

518
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,120
He also looked fatigued.

519
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,410
But, I still remember...

520
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,660
...that he and Grandpa...

521
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,660
...talked the whole day away
inside a room.

522
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,200
Grandpa even scolded him.

523
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,840
I believe...

524
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,870
...that my uncle was here before.

525
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,200
But, this still doesn't explain...

526
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,000
...why the layout here
has suddenly changed.

527
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,700
Going off tangent like me, yeah?

528
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,360
Okay.

529
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,120
I've been here before.
