1
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,460
"Explore with the Note"

2
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,080
"Episode 3"

3
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,960
I believe...

4
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,999
...that my uncle was here.

5
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,334
But, this still doesn't explain...

6
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,375
...why the layout in
this chamber has changed.

7
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,834
Going off tangent like me, yeah?

8
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,290
Okay.

9
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,180
I've been here.

10
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,626
My memory is incomplete.

11
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,751
I need some trigger points
to recall my memories.

12
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,160
Bro.

13
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,040
Did you lose your memory?

14
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:36,959
I want to get my memory back.

15
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:38,584
What are you thinking now, then?

16
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,667
If you've found the name list
for the team of archaeologists,

17
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,834
there should be my name on it.

18
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,083
I thought it was someone with the same name.

19
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,709
Stop bluffing.

20
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,410
That was from decades ago.

21
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,410
So, you're the same age as Master Wu?

22
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,709
How did you stay so youthful?

23
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,690
Lamb placenta?

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,660
Botox injections?

25
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,083
Don't tell me it was g-g-gene mutation...

26
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,834
...after getting exposed
to radiation.

27
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,250
That's what I want to know as well.

28
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,626
So, how much do you still remember...

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,000
...about this underwater tomb?

30
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,959
<i>Mei, look.</i>

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,140
<i>Look over there!</i>

32
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,250
<i>It's nice, isn't it?</i>

33
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,132
<i>Wen Jin!</i>

34
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,000
<i>-What are you looking?
-Wen Jin!</i>

35
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,250
<i>You should come and take a look too!</i>

36
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,999
<i>-I'm going down.
-Come down now.</i>

37
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,140
<i>Hurry up.</i>

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,999
<i>We need your help over there.</i>

39
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:00,918
<i>What are you looking, Zhang?</i>

40
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,200
<i>The sea.</i>

41
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,610
<i>We've been at sea for almost half a month.</i>

42
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,000
<i>Aren't you bored with the view?</i>

43
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,334
<i>To be honest, right now,</i>

44
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,626
<i>I do miss the feeling...</i>

45
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,459
<i>...of setting foot on land.</i>

46
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,620
<i>Where's Xie?</i>

47
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,125
<i>Have you seen Xie Lian Huan?</i>

48
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,250
<i>Where did he go?</i>

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,899
<i>No.</i>

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,040
<i>I've checked the ship.</i>

51
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,584
<i>One set of diving equipment is missing,</i>

52
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,959
<i>along with a rubber dinghy.</i>

53
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,918
<i>Maybe Xie went for a casual dive.</i>

54
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,830
<i>Wen Jin.</i>

55
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,000
<i>Did he tell you anything?</i>

56
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,626
<i>If he's diving alone,</i>

57
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:33,751
<i>that would be too dangerous.</i>

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,083
<i>I don't know when he went missing...</i>

59
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,000
<i>...or how long
he's been underwater.</i>

60
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,459
<i>What we should do now...</i>

61
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:40,876
<i>...is to find him back.</i>

62
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,840
<i>No.</i>

63
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,330
<i>We still need to explore the tomb today.</i>

64
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,834
<i>Don't delay our plans because of him.</i>

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,850
<i>He might come back when he's had enough fun.</i>

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,820
<i>Li.</i>

67
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,209
<i>You live by the sea.</i>

68
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,876
<i>You know how complicated...</i>

69
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,876
<i>...the sea is.</i>

70
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,230
<i>What if something happens to him?</i>

71
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,130
<i>Whose fault will it be?</i>

72
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,040
<i>It's going to be okay.</i>

73
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,584
<i>Xie has crossed the line here.</i>

74
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,375
<i>He didn't even tell us that he's going out!</i>

75
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,209
<i>This is too preposterous.</i>

76
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:10,667
<i>How can he just go out alone?</i>

77
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:12,042
<i>He didn't even tell us.</i>

78
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
<i>Exactly.</i>

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,250
<i>He's still not back yet.
What if something happens?</i>

80
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,420
<i>Look over there!</i>

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,660
<i>On top of that rock!</i>

82
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,790
<i>-Where?
-Where?</i>

83
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,740
<i>Where?</i>

84
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:21,758
<i>I see him!</i>

85
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,999
His body can't be preserved,

86
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:52,167
so we got someone to send
the corpse back to land...

87
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,709
...and perform the necessary.

88
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,167
The rest of us left our equipment
and rations on the boat,

89
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,125
then went down to explore the tomb.

90
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,640
<i>"How many people do we have now?"</i>

91
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,900
<i>"Let me take a look."</i>

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,680
<i>"Okay."</i>

93
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,584
The extra guy was a sea monkey?

94
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:13,730
The way my uncle and his team
got gushed in here...

95
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,767
...is about the same as ours.

96
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,375
But, did they enter this side chamber...

97
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,850
...or the one with
the baby coffin?

98
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,790
Neither of them.

99
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:12,292
<i>This smells good.</i>

100
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,250
<i>You guys smell that?</i>

101
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,533
<i>Yeah.</i>

102
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:17,083
<i>Where is this fragrance coming from?</i>

103
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:18,667
<i>Could it be...</i>

104
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,125
<i>...that this tomb's owner is a lady
with a penchant for fragrances?</i>

105
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,167
<i>That's why they put...</i>

106
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,584
<i>...so many fragrances in her tomb.</i>

107
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,500
<i>San Xing.</i>

108
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,100
<i>Have you seen anything like this?</i>

109
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,542
<i>The tombs I've been to...</i>

110
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,918
<i>...are as smelly as dung.</i>

111
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,626
<i>This is my first time coming to...</i>

112
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,208
<i>...a fragrant tomb.</i>

113
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:00,209
<i>Are these paintings of pregnant women?</i>

114
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,459
<i>Why do they have such big bellies?</i>

115
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,667
<i>-Yeah.
-What is that?</i>

116
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,040
<i>Sea ghosts!</i>

117
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,167
<i>They're sea ghosts!</i>

118
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,250
<i>This is a tomb for sea ghosts!</i>

119
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,174
<i>Seagulls?</i>

120
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:13,459
<i>What seagulls?</i>

121
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,180
<i>Look.</i>

122
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:19,709
<i>What paintings are these?</i>

123
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,760
<i>And this one.</i>

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,830
<i>Look at this.</i>

125
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,250
Fragrance?

126
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,709
This tomb reeks of dead meat.

127
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,042
I don't sense any fragrances.

128
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:33,999
Not a trace.

129
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,080
Maybe...

130
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,292
...it was only inside the chamber
that they had entered.

131
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,292
Or, maybe after all these years,

132
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,417
the fragrance has dissipated.

133
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,360
Bro.

134
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,370
What happened next?

135
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:51,970
<i>We should go.</i>

136
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,709
<i>-This place is creepy.
-I think you're scared...</i>

137
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:54,999
<i>...that you'll turn into a seagull.</i>

138
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,620
<i>Hold on.</i>

139
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,980
<i>What is it?</i>

140
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,918
<i>Aren't you scared that something
might happen again?</i>

141
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,417
<i>Everyone, listen up.</i>

142
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,751
<i>The conditions in the tomb
are very complicated.</i>

143
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
<i>A slight mistake...</i>

144
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,370
<i>...may affect everyone.</i>

145
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,000
<i>Our current task...</i>

146
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,209
<i>...is to rest here...</i>

147
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,250
<i>...and retain our stamina.</i>

148
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,667
<i>Without my permission,</i>

149
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,999
<i>no one is allowed to touch these things here.</i>

150
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,167
<i>Don't wander away, too.</i>

151
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:34,542
<i>Got it?</i>

152
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,501
<i>San Xing is experienced in this regard.</i>

153
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:38,876
<i>Listen to him, everyone.</i>

154
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,542
<i>-Okay, got it.
-Noted.</i>

155
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,460
<i>Got it.</i>

156
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,334
<i>Careful.</i>

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,880
<i>San Xing.</i>

158
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:51,751
<i>Are you tired?</i>

159
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,930
<i>Why don't you take a nap here?</i>

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
<i>I'm fine.</i>

161
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:58,674
<i>Don't push yourself.</i>

162
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,083
<i>I'm still counting on you...</i>

163
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,320
<i>...for the rest of the expedition.</i>

164
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,540
<i>Okay.</i>

165
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,580
<i>I'll take a break, then.</i>

166
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,042
What happened next?

167
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,140
I can't remember.

168
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,876
Then, do you need any walnuts...

169
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:10,770
...to improve your memory?

170
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,680
That's enough.

171
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,417
Speaking of hypnotic scents,

172
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,959
I just remembered something.

173
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:19,792
What is it?

174
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,709
J-Just tell us.
Don't make us guess.

175
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,417
I've seen something in
the Beijing Antique Market.

176
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:30,083
It's kind of like a little black pebble,

177
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,626
and it was placed inside a sealed case.

178
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:33,626
When I opened the box,

179
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,542
there was a faint scent of fragrances.

180
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,042
I don't know what fragrance it is.

181
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,887
I didn't expect you to have
such taste for fragrances.

182
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:40,042
Go on, continue.

183
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,876
Dude, I know my ways
around the capital, okay?

184
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:44,375
You know, that fragrance...

185
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,584
...has a really comforting smell.

186
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,125
It makes you want to nod off.

187
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,667
What exactly is that?

188
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,083
The bones of a cursed granny
are known as bone musk.

189
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,910
Bones?

190
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,918
Mind you, even ambergris
is actually whale vomit.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,067
It's still worth a lot of money.

192
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,700
In your eyes,

193
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:04,209
you only find worth in money.

194
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,290
Of course.

195
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:08,042
What's a cursed granny, then?

196
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,250
A cursed granny?

197
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,918
It's kind of abstract.

198
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,330
People who live by the sea
blame all their misfortunes...

199
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,417
...on cursed grannies.

200
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,751
Broken legs, missing chicken, runaway geese,

201
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,083
it's all the cursed grannies' doings.

202
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,542
If I really have to name them,

203
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:22,876
they're evil ghosts.

204
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,334
Nonsense.

205
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,450
There are no ghosts...

206
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:26,584
...in this world.

207
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,334
Cursed grannies?

208
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,250
Bone musk?

209
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,542
I remember now.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,999
It's about the fragrance.

211
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,959
Mu uncle did mention.

212
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,999
<i>Bone musk rarely appears in the market.</i>

213
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,292
<i>It's because everyone thinks...</i>

214
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,930
<i>...that they're the bones of
cursed grannies.</i>

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,840
<i>They bring bad luck.</i>

216
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:53,250
<i>If you ever get to see it,</i>

217
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,542
<i>try not to even touch it.</i>

218
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,459
<i>If you can't sleep,</i>

219
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,792
<i>you can use a little, though.</i>

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,959
<i>You'll sleep faster than you can faint.</i>

221
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,709
<i>Will I have sweet dreams?</i>

222
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:04,375
<i>What sweet dreams?</i>

223
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,330
<i>Count yourself lucky
if you don't get nightmares.</i>

224
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,209
<i>When I was inside the tomb,</i>

225
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,501
<i>I slept like a log,</i>

226
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:12,209
<i>and woke up startled.</i>

227
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,918
<i>Why?</i>

228
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,000
<i>It was like being anesthetized.</i>

229
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,042
<i>When I woke up...</i>

230
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,160
Wen Jin.

231
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,940
Wen Jin.

232
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,320
Wen Jin!

233
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,910
Where's everyone?

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
Where's everyone?

235
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,500
Wen Jin.

236
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:06,999
Wen Jin!

237
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,700
<i>Where are the porcelain?</i>

238
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,501
<i>I was later rescued by a fishing boat.</i>

239
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,250
<i>I wound up in the hospital...</i>

240
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,083
<i>...and almost died.</i>

241
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:24,584
<i>What happened then?</i>

242
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,042
<i>Then...</i>

243
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,125
<i>Then, I heard...</i>

244
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,918
<i>...that I was the only one
who was rescued.</i>

245
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,250
<i>The rest have all disappeared.</i>

246
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,000
<i>What happened then?</i>

247
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,542
<i>Then...</i>

248
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,209
<i>Nothing happened then.</i>

249
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,209
<i>My nephew, be an obedient boy.</i>

250
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,200
<i>Don't be naughty.</i>

251
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,950
<i>Don't learn from your uncle here.</i>

252
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,291
I don't know if my uncle...

253
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,125
...was talking about
what happened in this tomb.

254
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,079
There's no mistake.

255
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,083
There's the fragrance, the tomb and the sea.

256
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,125
Do you think I should check out...

257
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,416
...those shows about
magic and mysteries?

258
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:20,041
The girl in the box...

259
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,834
...gets turned around and
disappears with a "pow".

260
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:22,917
Out comes a tiger instead.

261
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,209
Don't you think this is just like
a magic show?

262
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,209
I mean this tomb.

263
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,626
A partition.

264
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:33,999
Turn around.

265
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,375
A hole in the ground.

266
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:40,792
I got it!

267
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:41,918
What did you get?

268
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:43,918
An elevator.

269
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,320
An elevator!

270
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:48,501
Let me give you an example.

271
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:49,501
You'll get it after this.

272
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,167
Imagine we're inside a two-story building.

273
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,740
You exit the elevator on the second floor.

274
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,250
Then, I build another story
beneath the first floor.

275
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:58,468
When you enter the elevator again,

276
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:00,167
the first floor will become the second floor.

277
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,000
The second floor will become the third floor.

278
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,940
Therefore,

279
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,720
you're actually going to
the original first floor...

280
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:05,854
...instead of the second floor.

281
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,480
First, second.

282
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,972
Second, first.

283
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,842
First, second, third...
Please speak in human language.

284
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,667
Okay, let me put it this way.

285
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,250
Above this chamber,

286
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,290
or beneath it,

287
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:17,501
is another story.

288
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:18,490
These two chambers...

289
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
...are similar to an elevator.

290
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:20,784
They can move up and down.

291
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,501
Although the area is more or less the same,

292
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:23,792
but the items inside them...

293
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,760
...are different.

294
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,751
That's why our oxygen tanks are missing...

295
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:27,930
...when we came back.

296
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,918
It's because this chamber...

297
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,417
...has moved upwards...

298
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,420
...or downwards.

299
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:33,501
Okay, got it.

300
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,560
Isn't this...

301
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:37,250
Isn't this just an elementary trick?

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,209
I expected something more
advanced and complicated.

303
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,320
Yeah.

304
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,000
It's an elementary trick,

305
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,876
but we still got fooled, didn't we?

306
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,542
I did tell you...

307
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,167
...that we shouldn't
over-complicate things.

308
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,972
The simpler the better.

309
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,083
Now, are we supposed...

310
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,375
...to just wait in the tunnel?

311
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,720
When the chamber goes up or down again,

312
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,501
we can get our oxygen tanks back.

313
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,500
No.

314
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,876
Why not?

315
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,042
Did I say something wrong?

316
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,542
I was thinking about
what your uncle has said.

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,083
There's a huge flaw inside his narration.

318
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,097
What flaw?

319
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,334
He said that he was asleep
inside the chamber.

320
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:13,792
He didn't leave the chamber,

321
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,959
but he headed to the tunnel.

322
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,417
Then, no matter how this chamber moves,

323
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,792
he should be inside
the same chamber all along.

324
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,250
How can there be any changes?

325
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,292
You're right.

326
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,660
Then, could it be...

327
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,709
...that the team moved him
to another chamber...

328
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,375
...while he was asleep?

329
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,980
After that, he woke up to find everyone gone.

330
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,140
Hold on.

331
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,751
Master Wu entered the tomb...

332
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,417
...through the inlet.

333
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,918
He also went out through the inlet.

334
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:37,501
How many inlets are there inside this tomb?

335
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,167
We came in from the inlet, too.

336
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,180
Plus,

337
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,375
the chamber with the baby coffin...

338
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,626
...is different from the chambers...

339
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,720
...that Master Wu was in.

340
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,209
I'm only worried...

341
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,626
...that I don't know the chamber's
movement pattern here.

342
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,417
If it moves hourly, that's fine.

343
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,918
If it moves daily or even monthly,

344
00:19:58,292 --> 00:19:59,626
I don't even know if the air here...

345
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,000
...can sustain us for
how much longer.

346
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,370
Don't even mention the air.

347
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,334
We don't even have food and water here.

348
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,667
Put that aside first.

349
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,542
Let's wait inside the tunnel first.

350
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:08,876
When the chamber moves back,

351
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,667
we'll get our oxygen tanks first.

352
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,459
Great.

353
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,709
Marvelous.

354
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,042
Fantastic.

355
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,417
According to our conjecture,

356
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,209
there are two stories here.

357
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,430
And, the side chambers in this tomb...

358
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,840
...are usually symmetric bilaterally.

359
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,999
That's why it's no surprise
to have this here.

360
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,834
This coffin...

361
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,792
...must be made of
golden-silk phoebe wood.

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,999
This wood...

363
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,040
I say,

364
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,660
the original log must be almost as huge as...

365
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,959
...the 32 logs that are used
to build the giant pillars...

366
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:57,626
...inside the Chang Ling Mausoleum.

367
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,584
Even the same worth of silver...

368
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,709
...doesn't match up to this.

369
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,820
Wu Xie.

370
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:07,417
This could be the coffin...

371
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:09,501
...that your uncle found
when he woke up.

372
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,375
We've got nothing else to do, anyway.

373
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:13,375
We've got time to kill.

374
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,420
Let's take a gander.

375
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
This is posh.

376
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:29,334
I say, this is just the side chamber.

377
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:30,667
The tomb owner's coffin...

378
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:31,751
...must be unimaginable.

379
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:37,709
This tomb's <i>feng shui</i> is so strange.

380
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The traps here...

381
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,125
...are more to pranks instead.

382
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
I don't know what the owner...

383
00:21:43,304 --> 00:21:44,184
...was thinking back then.

384
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,450
Forget all about those.

385
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,880
Most importantly, this place is full of...

386
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,880
...treasure and baubles.

387
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,840
Quiet.

388
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,380
What is it?

389
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:57,876
What do you want?

390
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,375
Take it easy.

391
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,209
You look like a decent person to me.

392
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:03,459
but you're scared out of your wits
at the sight of a coffin?

393
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:08,417
Light a candle before opening it.

394
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:09,890
Don't forget the traditions,

395
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,800
got it?

396
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,160
Where's south-east?

397
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,375
We don't have much air here,
yet you're lighting a candle.

398
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,320
Don't you want to live?

399
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,876
How much air can a candle use?

400
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,501
I'll just breathe less, then.

401
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:34,626
What's this?

402
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,375
A cat-lover, I see.

403
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,834
He brought his cat to his tomb.

404
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,125
What are you afraid of?

405
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,626
Don't get superstitious.

406
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,890
Who's getting afraid?

407
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,810
I say,

408
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,290
you got to thank me, you know.

409
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,459
When this place runs out of air,

410
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,459
this will remind us.

411
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:02,584
Naughty boy.

412
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,792
Every spot in this tomb is really weird.

413
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,209
Everything seems illogical.

414
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:13,650
He puts just about everything...

415
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,754
...that shouldn't be in a tomb.

416
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,292
He's breaking all the rules.

417
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:17,918
At this rate,

418
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,190
when we reach the main chamber,

419
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,790
we're going to have our minds boggled.

420
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,834
What a stench.

421
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,417
Gross.

422
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:51,667
Human fats.

423
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:54,876
I can't even lay my hands here.

424
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,000
There are so many arms joined together.

425
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:58,918
What's this about?

426
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,910
Putting multiple corpses like this...

427
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,999
...is so cruel.

428
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,209
It is cruel.

429
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:04,667
They're all twisted and distorted.

430
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,141
Don't tell me this isn't a multiple burial,

431
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,450
but sacrificed humans.

432
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,292
This is life force embalming.

433
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:11,918
You drug a bunch of people
and throw them together.

434
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,209
Life force embalming?

435
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,709
What, you've never heard of it?

436
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,417
Looks like Master Wu
didn't teach you anything.

437
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,375
This thing is called
a life force coffin, you know?

438
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:19,709
It's <i>feng shui</i>.

439
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,292
It's usually done in mountain mausoleums.

440
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,100
Let's say there's two spots here...

441
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,700
...with good <i>feng shui</i>
to place coffins.

442
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,709
If you don't put a coffin
in any one of those spots,

443
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,570
the vacant spot would absorb energy...

444
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,080
...from the mountains and seas,

445
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,080
and that would attract nasty stuff.

446
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:33,459
Hence, the tomb owner's coffin...

447
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:34,751
...is placed in one spot,

448
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:36,125
and the other spot is for...

449
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,950
...someone who is related to
the tomb owner by blood.

450
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,430
That coffin must even be
the same as the tomb owner's.

451
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,767
That's called life force preservation.

452
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:42,691
Got it?

453
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,500
Don't tell me all these people...

454
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:45,959
...are all sacrificed.

455
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,834
Humans are so unpredictable.

456
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,334
Just because of some non-existent <i>feng shui</i>,

457
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:52,918
these people's lives...

458
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,459
...were scythed away like weeds..

459
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:57,542
So, I think we should go to the next room...

460
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,876
...and get some containers
to scoop the water out.

461
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,083
Having water inside coffins...

462
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,049
...is a big taboo.

463
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,220
Fatty.

464
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,440
You're doing this for
the funerary objects, right?

465
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,690
Well, aren't you here...

466
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,894
...for these funerary objects too?

467
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:09,209
I am not.

468
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:10,167
I am.

469
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,640
Fatty.

470
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:23,834
What is it?

471
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,083
There's actually only one person in here.

472
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:30,042
Look at his head carefully.

473
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,167
Six people, six heads, there's no mistake.

474
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,500
No.

475
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,330
There <i>is</i> only one person.

476
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,400
Look at this.

477
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,167
Except for the head at the top,

478
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:43,125
the rest of the heads don't have faces.

479
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,209
They don't even have
the basic features of a head.

480
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:46,334
Most importantly,

481
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:47,626
the arms' joints...

482
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,167
...are all connected to
the same torso.

483
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:52,209
This is sure a big fat worm.

484
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,876
Such a badly deformed being...

485
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,710
...would have been killed at birth.

486
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,290
He won't even get to grow to this size.

487
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:59,501
He must be a human.

488
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,459
Both of you are just throwing in
balderdash and nonsense.

489
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,730
I say, we should go to the next room...

490
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,290
...and take something
to scoop the water out.

491
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,584
We can then take a closer look.

492
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,200
Besides, we might find some clues...

493
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,980
...that can help us escape.

494
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:15,059
I'd like to know why the tomb owner...

495
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:16,751
...did such a cruel act.

496
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,440
Over there.

497
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:32,250
You're a Virgo?

498
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,540
Pisces.

499
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,334
All the fuss over a jar.

500
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,584
You've got some nerve...

501
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,810
...to gawk at the sides.

502
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,447
If you don't want me
to scoop till the next day,

503
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:11,881
come and help me, will you?

504
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,125
The drawings on the pottery...

505
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,584
...are about a bunch of people...

506
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,250
...doing some sort of construction.

507
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,459
Some of them are piling rocks.

508
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,790
Some of them are transporting logs.

509
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,410
And these are placing wooden beams.

510
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,600
That's it!

511
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,874
The order of the pottery...

512
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:48,584
...shows the order of
the construction.

513
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,250
This is incredible!

514
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:55,620
The scale of this project
rivals the Forbidden Palace's.

515
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,459
But, the drawings here...

516
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,330
...don't resemble
that of the Central Plains.

517
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,160
Fatty.

518
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,459
Can you think of...

519
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,667
...any ancient Chinese buildings
as huge as this?

520
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,375
Damn you, Fatty.

521
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:14,118
He didn't even tell me he's leaving.

522
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,020
What's going on?

523
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,480
Where are they?

524
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:01,209
Why isn't Wu Xie back yet?

525
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:02,667
He's suffering from overchoice.

526
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,250
He can't even pick a simple jar.

527
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,751
This is a woman.

528
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,140
One, two...

529
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,500
There are 12 arms,

530
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:16,000
so shouldn't there be 12 boobs here?

531
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,292
Why are there only five?

532
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,334
That doesn't tally up.

533
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:19,417
Lift the body out.

534
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,220
Fatty!

535
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,640
Bro!

536
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,160
Fatty!

537
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:37,584
Don't panic.

538
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,340
It seems like...

539
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:42,709
...this wall moves quite frequently.

540
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,501
Maybe the wall would turn back...

541
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,834
...in a couple of minutes.

542
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,220
Don't panic.

543
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,140
Calm down.

544
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,540
Take a deep breath.

545
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,820
Oh, no.

546
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,000
I can't waste the air here.

547
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:14,292
What a slimy mess.

548
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:26,417
It's only been a minute?

549
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,584
When did my watch break down?

550
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,260
Bro!

551
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,920
That's right.

552
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,680
The theory of relativity.

553
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,120
Yeah.

554
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:00,667
In dark and quiet places like this,

555
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:02,042
it's normal to feel scared.

556
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:04,584
In dark and quiet places like this,

557
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:05,876
it's normal to feel scared.

558
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,876
Hence, under such conditions,

559
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,667
time seems to pass more slowly.

560
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,640
Yep.

561
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,125
Just keep that in mind.

562
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:13,792
That's not so scary anymore.

563
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,042
In this world,

564
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,209
the scariest thing of all...

565
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,167
...is probably
this underwater tomb.

566
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:20,965
No, no.

567
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:23,083
The scariest thing...

568
00:31:23,626 --> 00:31:24,999
...is the human's mind.

569
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:29,709
How can I scare myself now?

570
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,250
The cat was playing dead?

571
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,880
Lift the body first.

572
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,334
This woman is really...

573
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,542
...a terrible scene to look at.

574
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:01,542
A monstrosity.

575
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,542
This is too disgusting.

576
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,751
There are some words engraved on the slab.

577
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,130
The tomb's owner has really
taken care of everything.

578
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,300
With this slab inside the coffin,

579
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:23,834
even if the air retention system
for the tomb is damaged,

580
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,770
and water flows in here,

581
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,080
the coffin won't float.

582
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,083
What's written here?

583
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,000
That's it, I shouldn't be
racking my brains here.

584
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,918
We'll figure it out when
our young comrade is back.

585
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,167
What's taking Wu Xie so long?

586
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:45,923
Where's the doorway?

587
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,820
Stop knocking.

588
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,042
It's the shifting mechanism again.

589
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,834
This tomb owner sure enjoys pranks.

590
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,125
Is he that bored?

591
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:04,000
I say, when I find the main chamber,

592
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,167
I'm going to turn the place upside down.

593
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,920
Move.

594
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,542
Let's lift the slab out.

595
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,292
One, two, three!

596
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:34,167
This tablet isn't that big.

597
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,375
How come it's so heavy?

598
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,209
The slab is smeared with pine resin.

599
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:52,250
It's stuck to the coffin base.

600
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,042
It's empty beneath it.

601
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,125
Why hasn't it turned yet?

602
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:17,501
How long has it been?

603
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,167
Don't tell me that after all these centuries,

604
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,167
the mechanism's stuck somewhere.

605
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,639
Forget it.

606
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,458
No use worrying about it.

607
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,125
Could this have to do with the pottery?

608
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,208
After all, they're from the Ming dynasty.

609
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:39,918
Maybe I can discover something.

610
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:53,042
Go on, push.

611
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:54,042
Feeling annoyed?

612
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:55,417
There's so many fish in the ocean.

613
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,000
Must you find your prey inside a tomb?

614
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:00,834
Am I even edible to you?

615
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,167
Listen up,

616
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,042
I've been eating gutter oil
for my entire life.

617
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm filled with toxins.

618
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:05,959
I'm poisonous.

619
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,918
This is my first time seeing a coffin...

620
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,967
...with a hole underneath it.

621
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,042
It's a secret tunnel.

622
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:47,542
Secret tunnel?
That's amazing!

623
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,459
They even positioned it
right under the coffin.

624
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,584
A genius must have dug this.

625
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,042
How did he even manage to dig it?

626
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,950
It's underwater,

627
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,290
and isn't this chamber...

628
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,999
...capable of moving up and down?

629
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,410
There should be another
chamber down here, then.

630
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,820
How can there be enough room...

631
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,990
...to dig a deep hole like this?

632
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,918
Our young comrade was wrong.

633
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:09,918
This hole has upset...

634
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:11,999
...the embalming's purpose.

635
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,230
Forget about the rest.

636
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,410
Although this corpse...

637
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,292
...won't become a zombie
since it's covered in wax,

638
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,290
but this auspicious tomb...

639
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:25,751
...is now a very inauspicious one.

640
00:38:25,876 --> 00:38:28,542
The <i>feng shui</i> layout in this tomb...

641
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,292
...has already been ruined.

642
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:35,834
I say, we got to be careful.

643
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:38,542
We'll continue when
our young comrade is back.

644
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,375
What in the world is this?

645
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,209
This Frankenstein here really freaks me out.

646
00:38:58,626 --> 00:38:59,751
We can't kill her, run!

647
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,083
It's a coffin.

648
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,501
Why did this tomb's owner...

649
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,792
...design his coffin like a bathtub?

650
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,250
He must have loved bathing when he was alive.

651
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:49,417
How deep is this?

652
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:03,667
The chamber that we first entered...

653
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,125
...also had a wide inlet.

654
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,780
Don't tell me...

655
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,000
...that the water here...

656
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,792
...is from the depths of the tomb.

657
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,440
That's not right.

658
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,760
Isn't there a mechanism here
that functions like an elevator?

659
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,000
Then, how did they induct...

660
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,667
...so much water here?

661
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:27,834
My position now is...

662
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,320
To the left.

663
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,860
The left hall.

664
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:42,542
If it's symmetrical,

665
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:44,542
there should be a right hall.

666
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,334
Since it's an underwater tomb,

667
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,250
the tomb's owner must be loaded...

668
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,220
...and high-status.

669
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:54,083
If we're talking about
how the aristocrats were buried,

670
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,584
both the left and right halls...

671
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,460
...should each have
an alabaster coffin platform.

672
00:40:57,709 --> 00:40:58,999
In the middle of the platform...

673
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,167
...lies another...

674
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,792
...rectangular funerary urn
filled with loess soil.

675
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:11,125
But, there's nothing like that here.

676
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,980
Oh, right.

677
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:19,626
The coffin is supposed
to be placed in the back hall.

678
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,792
Why did they put the coffin
inside the side hall?

679
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,083
And it's even urn-shaped.

680
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,542
Urn burials are performed
during the Warring States period.

681
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,999
Don't tell me this tomb...

682
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:33,000
...isn't from the Ming dynasty.
