Miss,

no matter what you want to eat,

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,479
I can serve it for you.

7
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,280
This and this.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,640
Okay, right away.

00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,240
Enjoy.

Stop!

11
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,040
We can surely earn money with this.

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,680
You women like this?

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,719
Who doesn't like handsome men?

14
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,760
Miaomiao, I think it's awkward.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,200
I feel that it's really embarrassing.

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
I have yet to scold you.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,200
How can you address me as "miss"?

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,439
You should've called me "lady".

19
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,840
Or "Your Highness".

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,200
Miaomiao, why doesn't Zeyi
need to embarrass himself?

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,519
Don't you know Zeyi has gynophobia?

22
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,920
What if the customers
complain about him?

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,319
Miaomiao,
would you think about it again?

24
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,920
There are many ways to earn money.

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,840
We don't have to sacrifice fish.

26
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,760
What's there to think about?

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,439
I need a lot of water for
keeping you here.

28
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,319
If you don't earn money,

29
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,359
my homestay will go bankrupt.

30
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,840
And you, Gu Zeyi.

31
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,159
You're rich, aren't you?

32
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,760
When are you going to pay for the rent,

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
meal,

34
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,599
and water for the four of you?

35
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,159
I said that to trick Song Nan.

36
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,359
I don't have money.

37
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,120
Stop talking if you don't have money.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,599
Just work diligently.

39
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,800
Take that as the fee for the meal.

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,039
Zeyi, do we have to do that?

41
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,800
Miaomiao has all these

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
weird ideas.

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,919
I can tell that we'll have a

44
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,039
miserable life.

45
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,240
Bear with it.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,240
The most important thing
is to get the pearl.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Make her happy.

48
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,759

Welcome.

49
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,439
Tea is only RMB188 per pax.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,599
Welcome. Tea

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,240
This is their new favour.

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,080
Come again.

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,039
You can choose your address,

56
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,240
"My Lady" or "Your Highness".

57
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,759
"My Lady" it is.

58
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,280
Okay.

59
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,199
Please enjoy the coffee.

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
There's dessert here.

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,439
Don't you feel awkward?

62
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
If I don't feel awkward,

63
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,280
others will feel awkward.

64
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:19,960
Checkmate.

65
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,360
You lost again.

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,560
Do you even know how to play chess?

67
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,520
Miss, can you change him
to another person?

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,199
My Lady, I'm sorry.

69
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,639
You're too cute.

70
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,159
All these for RMB188?

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,439
I'd like to have a glass
of orange juice.

72
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,599
Okay, one second.

73
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,159
Here, enjoy.

74
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,800
Thank you.

75
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,960
The homestay is still full house.

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,039
Lu Miaomiao found

77
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,400
four handsome men from nowhere

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,439
and it attracted many young girls.

79
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,319
Since we can't solve the problem,

80
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,560
then deal with the troublemaker.

81
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,639
Table seven wants grape yogurt.

82
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,000
Zeyi, do you know how to make that?

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,560
No.

84
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,000
I saw that on the menu.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,079
I thought you know how to make that.

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,959
Wait. I can make that.

87
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,920
Ask them to wait.

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,399
Okay.

89
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,600
I only know how to make coffee.

90
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,879
I'll do that. It's RMB25 per glass
for grape yogurt.

91
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,720
There are eight of them.

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,759
How much would that be?

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
I'll go get some grapes.

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,519
Take care of the bar.
