3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Here's a good news to everyone.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,560
I'm ready to participate in

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,800
the Best Homestay of the Community.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,640
Let's work hard

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,839
to win this.

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,879
Miaomiao, let's forget about it.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,399
The prize is RMB10,000.
Everyone has a share.

10
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,879
The harder you work,
the more you'll get.

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,079
I think we'll win the prize.

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,160
I'll go wipe the glasses now.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,320
It doesn't matter
if we don't get any prize.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,679
I just like to cut grass.

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,560
Ze'er and Zesan are right.
I'll do some housework, too.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,280
I'll wipe the table. You just be happy.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,640
How dare you enslave the four princes
of the mermaids?

18
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,320
You'll wipe the table then.

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,479
Train your body.

20
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,039
You're lazy.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,439
Ms. Bai, why are you here?

22
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,719
Is this your key?

23
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,479
You left in a hurry.

24
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes. Thanks, Ms. Bai.
You came all the way here for this.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,319
It's okay. I'm leaving now.

26
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,000
You're mermaid?

27
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,560
Uncle Hai, is there any female mermaid?

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,879
Why haven't I heard of that?

29
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,799
Not just you,

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,480
even myself.

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,040
Mermaid will only give birth to males.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,439
Is it something to do with DNA?

33
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,959
Why didn't you go back to the sea?

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,200
I can't breathe in the water.

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,760
Terrestrial fish.

36
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,120
That's terrible.

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Drink this.

38
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,200
Thank you.

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,840
Good girl, now you have a home.

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,599
Welcome back to the mermaid family.

41
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes, this will be your home from now on.

42
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,640
You're taking this as your own house?

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,760
Miaomiao, Bai Qing is mermaid.

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,120
And she's a poor mermaid.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,879
Miaomiao, if you let Bai Qing stay here,

46
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,159
I'll handle the homestay competition.

47
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,319
I'll do anything you ask me to do.

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,960
If it's not possible,
I'll pay double for the room.

49
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,639
Let her stay.

50
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,080
Pay triple for the room!

51
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,599
Yeah!

52
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,680
Could I be a fisherman
in my previous life?

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,560
Zeyi, I bought a lot of new clothes.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,000
Try to put them on.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,159
I don't need them.

56
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,800
Try to put them on.

57
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,800
This one really suits you.

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
What are you doing? Don't come near.

59
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,639
Try to put it on.

60
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,599
I have my clothes.

61
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,520
I don't need it.

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,560
Stop running away.

63
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,159
Don't come near. I'll try it myself.

64
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,560
Here you go.

65
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,520
Go out first.

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
You didn't button it well.
Let me help you.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,479
Don't come near.

68
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,400
Why are you running away?

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,380
Ah!

70
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,080
This is not a pond. Don't run around.

71
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,800
What's going on with you lately?

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,879
You're always upset.

73
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:25,919
Hold on.

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,319
Okay.

75
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,039
Miaomiao, I heard that we're taking part
in the homestay competition.

76
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,240
I bought something

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,439
to decorate the homestay.

78
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
Thank you, but I have everything here.

79

Thanks, Bai Qing.

82
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,560
As long as you like it.

83
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,839
Zesan, why won't you choose one?

84
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,639
There's nothing I like.

85

Look. I got this for you.
