00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,559
I don't have my sea pearl.

4
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,839
I can't go back to the sea.

5
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,759
Zeyi, don't count on me.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,240
I'm not succeeding the throne.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,399
I can't date anyone either.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,920
Zesi.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,280
Zeyi, I'm not smart enough

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,960
to have an heir.

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,280
Zesan.

12
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,920
Zeyi, you know that

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
I only like fish.

14
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:52,880
I mean,

00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,719
how do we get the sea pearl back?

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,280
Zeyi, how did that woman

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,350
take away your pearl?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,239
It's not important.

19
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,079
What's important is that,
how do I retrieve my sea pearl?

20
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,000
It's easy.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,400
Just throw it out.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,920
I tried.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,400
Excrete it then.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,319
I tried that, too.

25
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,640
The four of you

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,519
should stop wagging your tails.

27
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,920
What if someone found out?

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,840
Go to bed.

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,439
Okay, we'll sleep now.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,959
Zeyi's tail is beautiful.

31
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,200
Of course.

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Zeyi's tail

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
is the most beautiful in all the seas.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,239
I need to quickly think of a way

35
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,519
to chase these four fishes away.

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,840
I have the most direct way.

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,840
Kill her to get the pearl.

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,319
Ze'er.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,959
You do it.

40
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,199
Zeyi treats you the nicest. You do it.

41
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,360
Zeyi,

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
didn't you say we have
to do our own things?

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,719
You do it.

44
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,120
Why not we forget it?

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,159
Zeyi, it's important to take the pearl.

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,719
Zesi, you do it.

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm begging you.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,360
Hurry.

49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,879
No.

50
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,439
Hurry.

51
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,680
Why not I do it?

52
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,479
Miaomiao.

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,400
This is a misunderstanding.

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,000
My sister-in-law, listen to us.

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,840
Don't call me your sister-in-law.

56
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,199
You don't sleep at night.

57
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you doing in my room
with the knife?

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,639
We wanted to kill you and get the pearl.

59
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,360
Zesi!

60
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,319
Well, you wanted to kill me
to get the pearl?

61
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,680
Sister-in-law!

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,719
Let me out!

63
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,879
We dare not do that again!

64
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,400
Stop knocking. It won't work.

65
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,159
Zeyi, how do you know?

66
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,240
I got it.

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,599
Zeyi must have been locked before.

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,000
We can't kill her to get the pearl.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,879
Zesan, do you have a better idea?

70
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,639
Zeyi,

71
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,520
how did your pearl

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,560
get swallowed by Miaomiao?

73
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,560
I...

74
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,000
Zeyi, you lost your first kiss?

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,319
That's not a first kiss.

76
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,599
I think that's CPR.

77
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,240
Zeyi, we're fish.

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,199
That, to us,

79
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,879
is first kiss.

80
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,840
Zesi.

81
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,759
Now is not the time to
discuss about first kiss.

82
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,240
Let's think of how to retrieve
Zeyi's pearl

83
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,639
quickly.

84
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,720
Zesan, you have a new idea?

85
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,360
No.

86
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,839
Zeyi, the situation you're in

87
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,480
is not recorded in
the Encyclopedia of Mermaid.

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,160
Our bodies are one with the sea pearl.

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,279
When we turn into bubble,

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,199
the sea pearl will turn, too

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,319
The situation you're in

92
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,959
is rare.

93
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,959
Zesan, there are missing pages
in your book.

94
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,560
Are those missing pages

95
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,879
talking about this content?

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,160
Perhaps.

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,120
I think we should retrieve the pearl

98
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,360
the way it was put into
Miaomiao's tummy.

99
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,720
Zesi, you've become smarter.

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,560
Perhaps this is the only way.

101
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,199
You want me to kiss her?

102
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,240
No way.

103
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,720
Do you want the pearl back or not?

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
I do.

105
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,980
Oh.

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,560
Waitress, come here!

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,340
Oh.

108
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,600
Sir, how may I help you?

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,519
Look!

110

111

That's a big worm in there!

112
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,199
Sir, this must be a misunderstanding.

113
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,639
How can there be a worm in the cake?

114
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,079

115

Listen!
