Zesan, Zesi,

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,399
I think Uncle Hai is right.

5
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,640
Zeyi is of age.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,280
He should go onshore to give birth.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,839
Ze'er,

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,280
do you think he can find a girlfriend?

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,479
He can.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,799
But he has gynophobia.

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,840
Then he can't.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,039
You're fickle-minded.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,240
With his good looking,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,719
I'm sure some women

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,799
would want to marry him
upon seeing him.

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,479
He'll have two children in three years.

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,399
Then, three children in five years.

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,840
I think the chance

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,560
is very slim.

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,320
Zesan, you're so pessimistic.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,960
I think he can do it.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,759
Yes.

23
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,560
You're thinking too much.

24
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,679
He doesn't own a house and a car.

25
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,880
He didn't graduate

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,840
from any top universities.

27
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,480
His qualifications

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,439
are very ordinary.

29
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,959
Your Highnesses, don't worry.

30
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,400
I've been onshore for many years.

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,760
I've earned a lot of money for you.

Oh no! Zeyi is in danger!

Miaomiao.

Miaomiao.

Miaomiao, are you injured?

Song Nan.

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,480
You fell into the sea just now.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,319
I was frightened.

00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,599
Where am I?

42
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,959
Don't be scared. I'll send you home now.

I'm warning you.

48
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,479
My guests here

49
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,680
are all gym trainers who are over 100kg.

If you don't go out,

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,039
I'll scream!

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,599
Help.

53
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,000
Water.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,800
I need more.

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,439
Okay.

(Is he an idiot?)

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
You can't drink this for free.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,159
You have to pay.

59
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,360
It's not nice.

60
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,599
What are you doing?

61

Why?

67
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,120
Fish can drink this.
I can drink this, too.

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,839
Put the fish tank down.

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,639
I'll get you some water.

70
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,160
You don't need to pay.

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,079
Take it as I'm doing a good deed.

72
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,279
After drinking the water,

73
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,079
go home.

74
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,519
I'm not leaving.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,199
You're not leaving?

76
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,399
It seems like you're a scammer.

77

If you're not leaving,

78

I'll call the police to arrest you.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,399
I need to get back my pearl.

80
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,600
Pearl?

81
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,839
Your pearl is gone?

82
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,199
What does that have to do with me?

83
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,759
My pearl is with you.

84
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,720
It's with me?

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,279
Yes.

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,759
Here?

87
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:15,920
Or here?

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,399
Where?

both of us will be in danger.
