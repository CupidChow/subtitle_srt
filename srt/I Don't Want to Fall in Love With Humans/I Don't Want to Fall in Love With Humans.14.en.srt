00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,439
Zeyi, let me help you.

4
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,199
Miaomiao, are you tired?

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,920
Why not you go and take a rest?

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,640
Momo, I've been looking for you.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,719
You're looking for me?

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,120
Let's go.

9
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,280
Bai Qing,

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,920
is Zeyi really into taking a bath?

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,479
Of course. If you clean the pool,

12
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,640
Zeyi will think of you
whenever he's taking a bath.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,119
Okay.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,439
Here, change to some clean water.

15
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:54,920
Okay.

16
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,560
Where are Uncle Hai and Momo?

17
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,040
Momo is sick.
Uncle Hai's sending her home.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,519
Uncle Hai, you're leaving?

19
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,840
I wonder why Momo is

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,680
suddenly having an allergy.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
I need to quickly bring her to a doctor.

22
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,799
Is she okay?

23
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,840
Miaomiao, don't you dislike Momo?

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,760
Who said that?

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,680
She's fine.

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
She'll be fine after checking by
the doctor in the hospital.

27
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,200
Miaomiao, do you like to
eat Qing Bu Liang?

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,439
Zeyi likes to eat it.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,239
Miaomiao, I kept this for you.

30
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,840
Thank you.
But I don't like to eat it.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,039
Are you not welcoming Bai Qing?

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,800
Not just that.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
Do you know what she has done?

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,039
What has she done?

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,159
She wanted to acquire the beach.
My homestay...

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,319
My homestay was the last
that didn't sign the agreement.

37
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,159
They've been trying to chase me away.

38
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,319
Miaomiao, are you thinking too much?

39
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,680
We're fish. We're not that bad.

40
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,319
You're fish.

41
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,879
You either stay here for nothing

42
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,520
or you try to acquire my homestay.

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,000
You even pretend to look weak.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,560
Miaomiao.

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,240
Zeyi.

46
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,960
Gu Zeyi.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,280
Gu Zeyi.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Gu Zeyi.

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
What's wrong with him?

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
Zeyi must have fainted because

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,479
he doesn't have the sea pearl.

52
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:02,960
Ze'er.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,719
Bai Qing is not an outsider.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
Zeyi's sea pearl was
swallowed by Miaomiao.

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
His sea pearl was
swallowed by Miaomiao?

56
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,199
Maybe I have a solution.

57
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,560
There's nothing recorded on
the Encyclopedia.

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,360
What solution do you have?

59
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,840
I'll check the Encyclopedia again.

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,280
Miaomiao, take care of Zeyi.

61
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,919
If I knew it'd be this dangerous,

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,080
I wouldn't have let Zeyi come onshore.

63
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,120
It's just the matter of
succeeding the throne.

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,719
I'm young. I can do that.

65
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,719
What are you doing?

66
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm sprinkling salt.

67
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
Why are you sprinkling salt?

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,159
We're fish that live in the sea.

69
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,520
Maybe when the water is salty,

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,879
Zeyi will wake up.

71
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,480
This is sea water.

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,639
Sea water?

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,560
Gu Zeyi.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,879
You're awake.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,839
I'm thirsty.

76
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,160
It's so salty.

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's go.

78
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,079
You better get up first.

79
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,000
Otherwise, you'll become salted fish.

80
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,720
Zesan.

81
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,000
Here you go.

82
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,879
Where did you get this?

83
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,279
This is the only thing
my father left to me,

84
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,920
but I think you need it more than me.

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
So I'm giving it to you.

86
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,839
You're giving it to me?

87
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,160
Are you sure that
you're giving it to me?

88
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,199
Two pages? There's one page short.

89
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,079
But that's all I have.

90
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,079
No worries.

91
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,759
I'm just curious what's written
on the other page.

92
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,319
You can retrieve the sea pearl
when your loved one kisses you.

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,800
Good news for Zeyi.

94
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
