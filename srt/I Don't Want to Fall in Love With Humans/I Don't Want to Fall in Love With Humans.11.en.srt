00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,119
Uncle Hai.

00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:15,119
I caught you. Come back.

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,920
Uncle Hai, why are you here?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,719
See who I've brought here for you.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,719
Momo, come greet Zeyi.

8
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,760
Zeyi.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,839
Momo is about the same age as you.

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,559
Her family is doing business with us.

11
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,440
You two are a match made in heaven.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,640
The most important thing is

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,560
she's healthy.
She can give birth to many children.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,880
Uncle Hai, don't mention women to me.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,079
I'm not getting married.

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,920
Uncle Hai,

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,320
Zeyi's not available now.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,200
Uncle Hai,

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
the name of the girl you found
is inauspicious.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,439
It scares us.

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,759
Zeyi, having an heir
is your responsibility.

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,560
You have to be the role model
for the mermaids.

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,759
Furthermore,

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,280
Momo is a nice girl.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,759
She'll be a good wife.

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,520
I don't agree.

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Zeyi's marriage

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
has nothing to do with you.

29
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:10,840
I...

30
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,359
Uncle Hai, let's talk in private.

31
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,359
Your Highness,

32
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,120
are you rejecting Momo

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,599
because of Lu Miaomiao?

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
Lu Miaomiao is not good.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,799
She doesn't seem to
be able to give birth.

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,400
Uncle Hai, my pearl is with Lu Miaomiao.

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,079
What did you say?

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,799
How could it be?
Mermaids can't live without the pearl.

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,840
I can't breathe inside the water now.

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,599
I'll become thirsty if I'm far away
from the pearl for some time.

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,840
There's nothing else.

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,200
Your Highness,
what does the Encyclopedia say?

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,159
Nothing about this was recorded
in the Encyclopedia,

44
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,079
but there are missing pages in
the Encyclopedia.

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,239
Maybe it's about this aspect.

46
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,200
We need to get the pearl back
as soon as possible.

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,319
We've been thinking of a way.

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,439
How did Lu Miaomiao swallow the pearl?

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
Well...

50
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,639
What a shame that the a marriage

51
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
of Crown Prince of the seas

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,360
is done in such a manner.

53
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
What marriage?

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,479
I just want to retrieve my sea pearl.

55
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,759
What colour is your sea pearl?

56
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,879
Blue. What other colour can it be?

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,719
That means you haven't fallen in love
with each other.

58
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,599
Can the sea pearl change its colour?

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,439
When mermaids fell in love,

60
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,879
the sea pearl will turn red.

61
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,439
See.

62
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,599
Then?

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,400
How do we retrieve the sea pearl?

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,560
How do I know?

65
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,000
No point talking about this now.

66
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,080
The last time it was so speechless

67
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,719
was the last time.

68
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:18,960
Momo.

69
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,840
I told you father that
I'll introduce a boyfriend to you,

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,000
but I didn't expect that

72
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,520
Zeyi already has a girlfriend.

73
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,520
Uncle Hai, don't be sad.

74
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,759
Even though Zeyi has a girlfriend,

75
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,280
and I can't marry him,

76
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,199
I honour you and your wife.

77
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,199
I'll still come visit you often.

78
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,639
Let me get a car to send you home.

79
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,159
Uncle Hai, it's not easy for me
to come out her.

80
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,680
I want to stay here for a few days.

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,800
Do you have a room?
I want to stay here for a few days.

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
No more room. Not available.

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,520
Miaomiao, what's wrong?

84
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,000
This is the first time
you're rejecting a guest.

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,000
I said no room means no room.

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,199
There's a room.

87
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,439
I'll get it for you.

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,399
Okay.

89
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,879
Here. This way up, please.

90
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,600
Okay, thank you.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,879
Uncle Hai.

92
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,439
Please pay for the room.

93
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,720
Do I have to pay to stay here?

94
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,240
Of course. We need to survive.

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,279
Don't we need to drink water?

96
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,279
Doesn't drinking water cost us money?

97
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,959
Uncle Hai, buy some souvenirs.

98
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,439
Do I need to by shells?

99
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,279
Uncle Hai, we're penniless.

100
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,480
If you don't pay us,

101
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,920
where do we have money to buy water?

102
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,240
Uncle Hai, we're living
in other people's place.

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040
We're pitiful.

104
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,480
Uncle Hai, you have many
children and grandchildren.

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,560
Bring some souvenirs back for them.

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,959
Uncle Hai, we dare not drink water.

107
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,360
Our tails are about to go dry.

108
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,240
Enough of talking.

109

I'll just buy it.

Zeyi, I bought water for you.

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,399
I'm not thirsty.

113

I've also brought Qing Bu Liang
for you, Zeyi.

It's nice, try it.

I've tried it. It's just okay.

Zeyi, let me help you.
