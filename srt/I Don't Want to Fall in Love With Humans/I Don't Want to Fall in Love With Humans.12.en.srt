Ms. Lu, are you planning to give birth?

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,439
After giving it a thought,

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,800
looking at your age,

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,879
you should do it quickly.

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,679
You should be able to give birth
to five children for His Highness.

8
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,480
Although I'm totally against the idea of
the woman older than her husband,

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,760
I can't help it

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,160
since the pearl is with you.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,719
Uncle Hai, giving birth
is women's right,

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,159
not women's job.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,479
However, giving birth for mermaids

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,119
is your responsibility and duty.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,079
Uncle Hai, I care not about

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,359
mermaids and I don't want to.

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,000
I just want to take out the pearl

18

for you to leave immediately.

What's wrong with her?

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,439
Maybe she failed to make a new drink,

60

so she felt bad.
