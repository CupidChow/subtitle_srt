Gu Zeyi, what should I do?

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,079
You must have been
affected by the sea pearl.

5
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,079
Then...

6
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,399
Then, will I become a fish?

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,839
We have to take it out
as soon as possible.

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,480
How?

9

Well...

10

We have to take it out
the way we put it in.

What are you waiting for? Let's do it.

Don't think too much.

Not necessary.

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,520
Don't bother them. Let's continue.

18

It seems like Zeyi is being eaten
by Miaomiao.

Zeyi, did you retrieve your pearl?

00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,519
Zeyi, talk to us.

25

It's too comfortable.

Zeyi, how can you forget?

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,680
You're not being serious.

Zesi, can you change your habit of

barging in for no reason?

Zeyi,

I can't change all of a sudden.

Please do it again.

Did it go back?

No.

42

you fell down from above.

45

You should hold me then.

You're heavy.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,680

No.

51

Maybe the environment is not right?

52
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,479

Didn't I give my pearl to you?

What?

I did that to take back the pearl.

00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,199
Could it be the environment?

74
