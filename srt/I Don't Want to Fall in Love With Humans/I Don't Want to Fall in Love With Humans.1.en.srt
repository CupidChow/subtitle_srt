8
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,799
Zeyi!

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,280
Where's Jiaosha?

10
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,159
He's waiting for you.

11
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,599
You're finally here.

12
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,719
I'm glad that

13
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,680
I can meet you for the last time

14
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,719
before I turn into bubble.

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Why did you risk your life
to find a woman?

16
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,359
I was tempted.

17
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,719
I didn't manage to hold myself.

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,879
The divorce rate of human

19
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,480
is as high as 45.9%.

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,639
Now, dating a girl

21
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,639
equals to dying.

22
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,120
I got it now,

23
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,639
but it's too late.

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,039
-Jiaosha!
-Jiaosha!

25
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,120
Remember this!

26
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,039
Care for your life!
Stay away from women!

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Zeyi.

28
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,039
Where should we go next?

29
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
This water is not safe anymore.

30
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,039
Uncle Hai will surely track us.

31
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,240
He might get me to get married.

32
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,199
Let's head east

33
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,039
and find new sea.

34
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,039
Your Highness!

35
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,800
Cheers!

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,240
Congratulations.

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,439
Thank you, everyone.

38
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:14,759
Come on.

39
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,680
Congratulations.

40
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,439
Enjoy yourselves.

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,240
Thank you. Thank you.

42
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,360
Congratulations on your promotion.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,960
You're important to your company.

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,719
They're holding a nice gathering
for your promotion.

45
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,560
Of course.

46
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,000
The company's beach acquisition project

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,360
was done by me.

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
Ms. Bai

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,439
likes me a lot.

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,560
Not long later,

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,240
I'll be promoted again.

52
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,280
All the best.

53
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
Take it slow.

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,639
Maybe you'll be promoted too.

55
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,439
Congratulations, Song Nan.

56
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,439
Thank you for helping me, Ms. Bai.

57
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,120
Toast to you.

58
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Ms. Bai, thank you for
appreciating Song Nan.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,280
I should thank you.

60
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,879
Ms. Lu, thank you for

61
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
willing to sell off Xiangyu Homestay

62
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,800
so that the Sunset Beach's
acquisition project

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,719
was able to be done.

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,800
Ms. Bai, is there a misunderstanding?

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,719
I didn't agree to sell Xiangyu Homestay.

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Excuse me.

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
You know how important
Xiangyu Homestay is to me.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll never sell it off.

69
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,199
Miaomiao!

70
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:41,800
Song Nan.

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,720
Ms. Bai,

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
I can explain.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,879
I'm going to propose to her soon.

74
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,639
Once we're married,

75
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,360
Xiangyu will become our common property.

76
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
I can sell it if I want to, can't I?

77
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,079
Ten days.

78
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,439
I'll give you another ten days.

79
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,560
Ms. Bai, don't worry.

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,399
I'll get it done.

81
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,800
Don't mention age to me!

82
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,519
Your Highness,

83
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,839
you're the Crown Prince.

84
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,079
You need to give birth to many children

85
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,800
and be the role model
to the younger ones.

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,519
Uncle Hai.

87
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,319
I'm just a nobody, Uncle Hai.

88
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,879
You can do this.

89
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,199
Giving birth is not hard.

90
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,600
Giving birth is not hard,

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
but it's easy to turn into bubble
if I touch a woman.

92
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,199
Uncle Hai!

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
My brothers!

94
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,079
Uncle Hai.
