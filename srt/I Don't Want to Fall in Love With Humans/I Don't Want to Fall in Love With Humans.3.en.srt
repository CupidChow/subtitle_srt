I really didn't do anything.

You don't have to forgive me.

49

Am I still your boyfriend?

Yes.

51
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,799
Then ask him to get out.

52
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,920

The way you choose your man is terrible.

68
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,439
He doesn't really love you.

69
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,439
That's my own business.

70
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,599
It has nothing to do with you.

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,879
Quickly take your pearl and leave.

72
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,840
What?

73
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,280
You don't know how to

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,599
retrieve your pearl?

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,120
Will this work?

76
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,439
Do you have a better idea?

77
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,199
I'll count on you then.

78
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,879
Are you sure you can drink this?

79
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,159

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,000
Did you find the pearl?

81
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,639
No.

82
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,639
No.

83
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,599
Wait.

84
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,599
Wait and throw out later.

85
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,360
Your pearl is so stubborn.

86
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,599
Maybe we didn't use the right way.

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,759
No.

88

89

Wait.

just now.

94
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,959
That's because I was afraid
that he'd take the pearl away.

let's stay together.
