Lu Miaomiao.

00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,000
You're really dating with this guy.

Miaomiao.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,960
Let me check on her.

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,320
The sea pearl has stayed in her body
for too long.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,640
Her body can't take it anymore.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,840
What should we do?

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,640
Get her into the water.

11

Let's go.

Tail. Mermaid!

13
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,040
When the sea pearl turns red

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,680
and the pearl is taken out,
she'll be fine.

I wonder when Zeyi's sea pearl

16

will turn red.

17
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,599
How does the sea pearl turn red?

18
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,680
We have no experience.

19
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,040
Perhaps, we need to ask someone
with experience.

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,120
That'd be helpful.

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,519
Yes, I can ask Uncle Hai.

22
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,760
I'll go right away.

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,480
Zesi, you have no sense of direction.
Let me come with you.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,719
Be careful.

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,360
I don't drink wine.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,039
Try it. It's tastier than water.

27
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,719
Don't drink wine like that.

28
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,759
I'm feeling dizzy.

29
