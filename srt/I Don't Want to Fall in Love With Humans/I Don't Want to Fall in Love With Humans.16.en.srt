What are you doing?

00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,640
Why did you turn off the light?

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,719
It must be your brothers who did that.

7

Why did they turn off the light?

Why do you think

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,199
they pushed you into my room at night?

10

I'm determined to be single.
Nothing can change that.

You better keep your words.

Let go of me.

I'm scared of darkness.

Okay.

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,840
Isn't the sea darker than this place?

19
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,159
Ze'er, don't open it. I'm scared.

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,599
Zesi, don't be scared.

21
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,120
Think about it. When Zeyi sees the cat,

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,599
he'll surely hug her.

23
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,239
As long as Zeyi's able to
get back his pearl,

24

everything we're doing is worth it.

What's going on, Gu Zeyi?

26
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,159
I used to like cats.

Why am I trembling in fear now?

28

Fish is scared of cats.
That's our nature and it's in our blood.

Am I becoming a fish now?

It's coming here.

Gu Zeyi, let's fall in love with
each other! I don't want to die!

00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,840
We're willing to date! Open the door!

Let us out!

Bai Qing?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,439
She was really using me.

00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,919
She took my project

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
and she's trying to get rid of me.

38
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,000
Dream on.

39
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,000
Zeyi, Miaomiao,
go watch a romance movie.

40
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,719
A movie?

41
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,879
What movie?

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,960
The cinema is dark

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,520
and we have to stay in there
for two hours.

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,560
I'll be freaked out.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,039
Why not you go watch the dolphins
performing in the public aquarium?

46
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,599
I'm not Zesi. I don't want to
watch dolphin performance.

47
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,039
Not a public aquarium.

48
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,360
What about playground?

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,759
It's worse than
the previous two options.

50
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,439
Do you really know how to go on a date?

51
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,000
Zeyi, don't just lecture us.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,120
Do you know how to go on a date?

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,240
I might shock you with my dating skills
although I've never shown you.

54

I'll make the arrangement tomorrow.
Lu Miaomiao.

Just wait to fall crazily for me.
