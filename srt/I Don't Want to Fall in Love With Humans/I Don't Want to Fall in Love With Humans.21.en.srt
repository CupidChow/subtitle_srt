What's going on?

5
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:23,369
This is probably the power of true love.

6
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,450
Okay. First of all,
let's celebrate for winning

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,129
the Best Homestay of the Community.

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:46,849
Cheers!

Thank you, Uncle Hai.

00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:51,769
Congratulations.

13
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,010
Miaomiao and Bai Qing were right.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,370
We can't force any relationship.

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,930
We need time to build the relationship.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,209
We need to hold more
large-scale blind dates like this.

17
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:04,049
Not long after this,

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,170
the mermaid's population
will increase tremendously.

19
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,890
Okay, I'll pass the time to you,
young people.

Here.

21

Cheers.

23
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,530
- Come and drink wine.
- Cheers.

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,329
Drink slowly.

25
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,170
This is not bad.

26
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,450
What are you thinking?

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,689
I'm thinking that I should

28
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,250
write the last page of

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,730
the Encyclopedia of Mermaid.

30
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,489
How are you going to write that?

31
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,569
Actually, there are female mermaids
in the world,

32
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,849
but they are born
without the sea pearl

33
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,290
and they can only live for 25 years.

34
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,849
When they find their true love,

35
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,770
it can fill up the missing sea pearl.

36
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,210
I've prepared a gift for you.

37
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,370
You have a gift for everyone
who came for the party.

38
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,449
Are you jealous?

39
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:52,090
No!

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,140
(Mermaid DNA)

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,060
(Mermaids can only give birth
to male mermaid to survive.)

42
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,140
(Only five female mermaids
were known thus far.)

(Female mermaids are born
without the sea pearl.)

45

(They need the sea pearl of the male
mermaid who owns true love to live on.)

46
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:08,889
You've indeed hidden a page.

47
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:11,210
This is my dowry.

48
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,530
How can I give them all to you?

49
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,770
I'm all ready to marry you.

50
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,650
I was just kidding.

51
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,169
Why are you not blushing?

52
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,289
You are influenced by them.

53
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,650
I'm very serious.

54
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,770
You can't keep asking
if she has eaten or not.

55
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,449
I can't stand it,

56
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:37,930
not to mention the girls.

57
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,889
You have to be interesting.

58
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,090
Otherwise, how do you go out with girls?

59
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,050
After fighting with your girlfriend

60
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,969
and she says she's fine,
then you go to bed.

61
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,250
She'll be mad for the whole night.

62
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:54,050
I see.

63

You two know a lot about love now.

66
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,889
Of course, Uncle Hai.

67
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,569
We managed to help Zeyi
and Miaomiao get together.

68
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,250
I'm a genius in romance.

69
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,490
Please take a look at your right side.

70
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,330
These two girls

71
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,689
are the candidates I've chosen
carefully for you two,

72
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:14,009
Maomao and Paopao.

73
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:14,729
Greet them.

74
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,530
Hello, I'm Maomao.

75

Hello, I'm Paopao.

76
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,610
Come back.

77
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,490
Uncle Hai,
we can work on this ourselves.

78
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,490
You don't have to look for wives for us.

79
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,210
Uncle Hai, all the girls you found

80
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,569
have a scary name.

81
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,810
Zeyi and Zesan have found
their loved ones.

82
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,330
It's just you two left.

83
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,689
Madam Hai, why are you here?

84
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,400
Run!

85
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:44,810
It's new on the menu. Try it.

86

Try it.

How is it?

88
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,050
It's good. Don't do it anymore.

89
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:00,689
No way.

90
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,529
Someone wants to see you.

Who is it?

92
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,529
