Miaomiao!

00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,400
Bai Qing, why did you tie us up here?

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,199
Bai Qing, what are you doing?

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,280
Gu Zeyi,

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,519
do you know the difference between
male mermaids and female mermaids?

10
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,359
I don't know.

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,960
Female mermaids are born
without a sea pearl.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,439
All female mermaids
can't live longer than 25 years.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,079
But

14
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,880
we can get the male mermaid's sea pearl.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,600
So, you approached us

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,920
to get the sea pearl?

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,679
That's right.

18
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,079
So, you have two options today.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,520
Either I kill her...

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,240
Miaomiao!

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,799
Or you kill yourself.

22
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,880
When you're dead,

23
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,799
the sea pearl will come out naturally.

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,920
But, I promise that I'll let her go.

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,359
Bai Qing, you're crazy!

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,679
Gu Zeyi, choose now.

27
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,759
Gu Zeyi, don't listen to her.

28
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,399
No, don't listen to her.

29
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,400
I'll choose.

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,879
No, Gu Zeyi!

31
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't worry.

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,239
After all,
I'll die without the sea pearl.

33
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,799
When I'm dead,

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,599
the sea pearl will leave your body.

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,799
Your life will become normal again.

36
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,480
Do it.

37
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,040
Gu Zeyi, what are you talking about?

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,400
Don't listen to her!

I want you to die together.

I've finally got the sea pearl.

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
I've finally got the sea pearl.

52
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,680
Ms. Bai, what should we do with them?

53
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,879
Let them go.

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,560
No one is leaving.

You've been trying everything

62

to get this pearl.

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Come on.

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
Stop pretending.

66
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,360
In the beginning, you were eager

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,039
to ask me to help you
with the beach acquisition project.

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,759
But ever since you met them,

69
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,840
you stopped the acquisition.

70
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,919
I think you were using me.

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,360
But now, I got it.

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,280
You've got what you wanted.

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
It's this pearl.

74
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,800
Bai Qing, is what he said true?

75
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:53,800
I...

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,599
I've actually been watching you.

77
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,840
You, you, and you all are not human.

78
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,159
You're mermaids.

79

80
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,199
And you!

81
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,639
You broke up with me

82
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,199
for a fish.

83
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,480
Song Nan, let go of me!

84
