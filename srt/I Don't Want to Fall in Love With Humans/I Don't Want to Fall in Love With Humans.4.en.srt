What?

00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,279
You want to resign?

00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,359
Please don't.

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,039
We had a deal that

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,000
we'll make this homestay
a five-star hotel.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
You'll be the general manager.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,320
Ms. Lu,

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,600
I know you well.
Please don't try to fool me.

11

Our homestay

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,280
doesn't have many guests.

00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm the general manager, finance,

Just give me my salary for this month.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
I don't need any compensation.

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,479
Business is bad
and it's not easy for you.

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,600
Why not you consider again?

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,159
Ms. Lu, let me advise you this.

20
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,439
Close the homestay and stop loss.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,119
Aren't you a fish?

22
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,960
How can you be choked?

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,159
Such an idiot.

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,359
Your homestay is not having profit.

25
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,439
Why not you sell it?

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,120
Such an idiot.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,000
Go tidy out the premise.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,319
I don't keep a freeloader.

29
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,400
Wait for a while.

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,200
Tian,

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,879
why did you take down the advertisement?

32
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,480
The period is over.

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
I know you're having a hard time.

34
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,840
So, I extended it for a few days.

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Let me continue the payment.

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,760
Help me to post it.

37
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,799
Post it on more websites.

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Miaomiao, why not just stop looking?

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,680
It has been 10 years now.

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,879
If he wants to come back,
he would've come back already.

41
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,359
Think more of yourself.

42
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,519
Lu Jin will surely come back.

43
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,760
I'll transfer RMB5,000 to you first.

44
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,359
I'll think of a way for the rest.

45
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:40,680
Okay.

46
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,519
Thanks, Tian.

47
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,439
Tian, cookies.

48
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,400
Bring them home.

49
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,480
It's okay. Keep it.

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,359
Who are you looking for?

51
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,400
My younger brother.

52
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,280
He ran away?

53
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,719
No, he didn't.

54
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,480
He's missing.

55
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,680
This homestay

56
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,280
is the only memory of his way home.

57
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,479
I must guard it.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,199
In my family,

59
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,759
we're brothers wherever there's sea.

60
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,639
That's where home is.

61
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,960
You human are weird.

62
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,159
Why would home be a house?

63
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,280
Also, you need to earn money.

64
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080
We don't need to earn money.

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,400
All the fishes are equal.

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,879
We can do anything we want.

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,879
It's nice.

68
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,319
I'll tidy up the premise.

69
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,039
He's so handsome. We'll just stay here.

70
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,800
But, we've booked

71

Crescent Bay Homestay.

72
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,039
Just cancel it.

73

Handsome, is there any room available?

74
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,960
Why are you running?

75
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,719
Women.

76
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,039
Miss, we want to stay here.

79

working here?

Look at the camera.

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Zeyi should be somewhere around here.

That guy looks like Zeyi.

90

It can't be Zeyi.

91
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,199
It seems like Zeyi.

Look here.

93
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,439
Zeyi must have been kidnapped.

94
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,199
Save Zeyi.

95
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,000
Handsome, look at me.

Zeyi.

Let's go, Zeyi.

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,319
Let him go! Don't run!

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
I really can't leave now.

101

Let's go. Stop talking.

102

Let's go, Zeyi.

103
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,560
My sea pearl is with her.

104
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,000
No.

105
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,079
They're my younger brothers.

106
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,920
No means no.

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,439
Ms. Lu,

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,480
we're not bad fishes.

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,399
We have only four rooms here.

110
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,000
If the three of them are staying here,

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
how can I run the business?

112
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,600
You have no business
even though they're not staying here.

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,439
Gu Zeyi, what do you mean?

114
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,720
My sister-in-law, Zeyi means

115
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,160
we'll only stay here for one night.

116
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,399
No.

117
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,199
Not even one night.

118
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,439
We're so pitiful.

119
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,079
Zeyi has lost his pearl.

120
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,240
Now, he's neither

121
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,519
a man nor a fish.

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,959
We came to look for Zeyi.

123
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,000
We know no one else onshore.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,959
If Zeyi doesn't care for us,

125
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,279
we'll...

126
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,079
We'll be homeless.

127
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
We'll be homeless.

128
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,680
Just one night.

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,160
Don't touch anything in here.

130
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,120
Especially my room.

131
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,160
No one can come in.

132
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,160
Gu Zeyi, you need to watch them.

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Okay, no problem.

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Yeah!

135
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,720
Also, I'm not your sister-in-law.

136
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,079
Good night, my sister-in-law.

137
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,319
