00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,400
Zeyi, Miaomiao, Ze'er, Zesi,

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,000
I found the way to
retrieve the sea pearl.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,560
How do we do that?

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:13,680
Look.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,359
(Sea pearl)
Look.

00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:14,950
(Sea pearl)

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,879
When a mermaid finds his true love, the
pearl will turn red and be retrieved.

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,039
I don't want my sea pearl to turn red
and I'm not getting married.

11
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,760
Zeyi, you're in trouble.

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,480
Life is more important.
Be brave and love someone.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,000
Zeyi, don't be too pessimistic.

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,399
The book says "when the mermaid
finds his true love".

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,000
It means

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,640
it's okay as long as Miaomiao loves you.

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,679
If you don't love her,
you won't turn into bubbles.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,479
Poor Miaomiao.

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,119
She falls in love with a male mermaid
who doesn't love her back.

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,560
That's enough, four of you.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,960
I don't love Gu Zeyi.
I won't fall in love with him.

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,840
Did you hear that? It's impossible.

23
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,640
Zeyi, are you silly?

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,799
If Miaomiao doesn't love you,

25
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,200
you can't retrieve the pearl.

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,799
You'll turn dry and die.

27
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,319
You should choose to turn into bubbles.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
Zesi has become smarter
after coming onshore.

29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,640
Of course.

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,239
My brain used to be filled with water
back in the sea.

31
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,799
Zesi was right.

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,480
Instead of turning into bubbles,

33
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,120
we should try our best.

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,599
Even Zesan is complimenting me.

35
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,319
It seems like
I've really become smarter.

36
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,439
Let's think about it.

37
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,879
What?

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,120
Gu Zeyi.

39
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,000
Are you saying you'd rather
turn into bubbles

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,599
than fall in love with me?

41
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,799
You were so determined
when you broke up with Song Nan.

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,840
I don't feel safe

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,599
to be with you.

44
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,560
I broke up with Song Nan

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
because he was trying to sell my house.

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,000
Speaking of the house,

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,719
Bai Qing,

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,519
are you still planning
to acquire my house?

49
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,280
I wanted to acquire this beach

50
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,079
because I knew there's mermaid
in this sea.

51
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,879
Now, I've found my species.

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,959
So, I stopped the acquisition.

53
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,159
Really?

54
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,200
Of course.

55
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,799
We mermaid never lied.

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,799
I trust Bai Qing, too.

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,159
You fishes are scratching
each other's back.

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,120
I can't talk you over.

59
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,879
I'm going to bed.

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Zeyi, are you tired?

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,719
I'm not tired.

62
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,840
No, you're tired.

63
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm not tired. I'm really not tired.

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,719
No, I'm not tired.

65
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,199
Miaomiao, we've brought him here.

66
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Ze'er, Zesan, Zesi, let me out!

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,680
Bai Qing, you're good.

68
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,639
Now, no one can run away.

69
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,560
Zesi, cut the power later.

70
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,319
Why do we need to do that?

71
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,919
Only then Zeyi can make it.

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,680
Bai Qing, you're great.

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,719
I think we can do something
more exciting.

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,479
Zeyi is afraid of cats.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
Everyone is afraid of cats.

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,599
Zeyi is more scared of cats than us.

77
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,560
Zesi, you cut the power.
I'll find a cat.

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Let's go.

79
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,439
I'm leaving now.

80
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,840
Hello.

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,199
Ms. Bai, I saw Song Nan
near the homestay

82
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,080
this afternoon.

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,159
What was he doing here?

84
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
Monitor him.

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,599
Don't let him ruin my plan.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
Gu Zesan?

87
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,159
Are you following me?

88
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,759
It's already at this hour.

89
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,520
Why are you here alone?

90
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm getting my coffee.
Would you like some coffee?

91
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,639
Hello, here's your coffee.

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,399
Here's your coffee.

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,839
Thank you.

94
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,480
You're welcome.

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,680
Why are you looking at me?

96
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,279
What's the difference between
a female mermaid and us?

97
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,879
No difference. We're the same species.

98
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,399
Do you have a tail, too?

99
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,639
Of course. I'm fish.

100
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,040
Can I look at your tail?

101
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,000
Come to my house then.

102
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,959
Why are you blushing?
We can't see it without water.

103
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,639
