Zesi, break open the door.

Listen, this homestay is unconscionable!

I'll send you to the hospital, okay?

Sir,

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,520
we better go for a check-up

This must be a misunderstanding.

Listen.

26
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,119
I've recorded a video.

27
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,200
I'll post it online to expose you

28

so that no one will be cheated by you.

00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,520
There's no worm in your cake.

It doesn't mean
there's no worm in my cake.

It doesn't mean
there's no worm in their cakes.

Why are you here?

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,400
I was doing something nearby.

36
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,480
It's fine, I'm here.

I'm her fiance.

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,599
My word counts.

41
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,959
Zeyi, Lu Miaomiao has a fiance?

Tell me.

How do you want to solve this?

44
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,519
I'll report you to the market authority.

45
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,519
Let us discuss first.

46
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:27,920
Okay.

47
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,200
Since the food has an issue,

48
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,599
we should comfort them first

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,480
and settle it in private.

50
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,719
Give him some money

51
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,560
and keep it a minor issue.

52
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,000
But my food is fine.

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,439
Why should I admit it?

54
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,680
Furthermore, I have no money
to compensate him.

55
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,640
Do you remember
the relocation agreement?

56
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
Why not you sign it?

57
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,719
After all, if the video is posted,

58
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,040
our homestay has to close.

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
I told you.

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
I won't sell it off.

Hey.

63
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Have you come to an agreement?

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

65
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,439
We'll settle this in private.

66
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,159
How much do you want?

67
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,959
Name a price.

68
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,240
I disagree!

69
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,159
Then close the homestay.

70
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,719
How much do you want?

71
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,400
Name a price.

72
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,439
RMB100,000.

73
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Fine, I'll give it to you.

74
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,319
Zeyi has a lot of money.

75
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,159
What a shameless guy.

76
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,280
They're just fine.

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
You all

78
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
just want to bribe me!

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,919
I'll expose you!

80
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,960
You must close your homestay!

81
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,520
Fine, call the police.

82
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,719
My food is fine.

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,240
Don't call the police.

84
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,919
I believe that the cake is fine, too.

85
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,680
Call the police.

86
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,919
They're doing it intentionally.

87
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,080
I'll expose you all now!

88
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,599
No!

89
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
They're fighting!

90
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,000
My mobile phone! Give it back!

91
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,039
What's going on?

92
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,879
What's that?

93
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,479
So, you're framing us.

94
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,960
Sorry.

95
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
My mobile phone.

96
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,159
Yes.

97
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,919
It's an accident.

98
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,680
May you prosper

99
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
and have a child soon.

100
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,919
It's been solved.

101
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,719
I'm leaving now.

102
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,719
Okay.

103
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,479
Come with me.

104
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,800
Where are we going?

105
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,240
Pay me.

106
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,120
How dare you ask for money?

107
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,800
If you didn't mess it up,

108
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,960
she would've signed the agreement.

109
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,120
What? Are you taking back your words?

110
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,080
Pay me.

111
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,719
No way.

112
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,840
What do you mean?

113
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,800
How dare you push me?

114
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,560
No, I don't want the money anymore.

115
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,120
I don't want the money anymore.

116
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,800
I'll leave.

117
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,039

118
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,520
Leave!

listen to me.

121
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,639
I'll say it one more time.

122

Xiangyu Homestay

123
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,479
is the only landmark for
my brother to come home.

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,719
I'll never sell it.

125
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,839
Let's break up.

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,040
Break up?

don't sound like you're all that nice.

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
You're breaking up with me

130
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,160
because of this rich guy, right?

131
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

132
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,920
It's all because of him.

133
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,920
Don't you say that.

134
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,879
We're not related at all.

135
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,680
Brother, sister-in-law, are we fighting?

136
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Brother?

137
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,000
Sister-in-law?

138
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
What a family.

139
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,120
Just wait and see.

140
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,800
Don't call me sister-in-law anymore.

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,680
Did you hear her?

142
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,759
Did you hear her?

143
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,160
Did you hear her?

144
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,759
You won't do anything

145
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,240
and all you do is drinking water?

146
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,399
Miaomiao, we're fish.

147
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,079
What else can we do
besides drinking water?

148
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,560
Stop talking.

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,040
Tidy this place up
when I come down again!

150
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,279
Or else, leave!

151
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,879
Why did you say that?

152
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,560
Hurry.

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,160
Zeyi, why is Miaomiao angry?

154
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,079
She has broken up with her boyfriend.

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,240
Isn't that good?

156
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,600
That man doesn't seem like a nice guy.

157
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,600
Miaomiao is not good at judging a man.

158
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,959
Miaomiao is not happy.

159
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,759
Why did she vent her anger on us?

160
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,319
Yes.

161
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,639
Zeyi, what should we do?

162
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,360
Make her happy.
