00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,450
THE LATE OH OK-SUN
CHIEF MOURNER: GRANDSON, BAE GYEON-U

2
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,078
STANDARD ROOM

3
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,916
Don't you dare mess with him.

4
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,292
He's mine.

5
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,964
You don't scare me.

6
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:30,925
Why not?

7
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:32,927
Because the really scary person

8
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,680
is sitting right behind me.

9
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,016
Gyeon-U.

10
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,393
Can you do something about that glare?

11
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,438
Excuse me.

12
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,774
Mr. Bae. A moment, please.

13
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:48,901
Oh, sure.

14
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,742
He has me on tenterhooks.

15
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:00,204
I wouldn't mind the deathly glare
if I'd actually done something horrible.

16
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,956
But I'm protecting him here.

17
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,249
He has no clue.

18
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,753
Ma'am. Your grandson's a bit ungrateful.

19
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,006
Just wait
until I ward off your misfortune.

20
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,634
I'll make sure you make up
for all of it with love.

21
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,887
She must've been a bad person.

22
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,266
-There are no visitors.
-I know, right?

23
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,228
You see, you must order
a minimum of 30 portions of food.

24
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,312
In that case…

25
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,356
19 CONTACTS

26
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,984
Is 19 people too few?

27
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,820
However few visitors you have,
you must order 30 portions of food.

28
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,531
Okay.

29
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,540
Enjoy the meal.

30
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,337
It's my first time at a funeral.

31
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,381
What am I supposed to do?

32
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,554
SPIRIT-MOTHER

33
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:04,894
MY DARLING SPIRIT-DAUGHTER

34
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,770
POWER OFF

35
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,856
The person you have called
is not available.

36
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,065
You'll be connected to voicemail.

37
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,650
How could she hang up like that?

38
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,073
Who can I call other than Mother?

39
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,457
PARK SEONG-A

40
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,792
Jeil Funeral Hall,
Standard Room, Oh Ok-sun.

41
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,586
Come if you have time.

42
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,963
Gyeon-U's grandmother passed away.

43
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,309
It's a nasty energy, all right.

44
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,102
But it's not so bad to anger the spirits.

45
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,228
DIVINE PUNISHMENT FOR A FORBIDDEN ACT

46
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,189
Maybe you're being dramatic,
Village Chief.

47
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,858
People have died.

48
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,486
Three people died in this house already.

49
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,030
Houses in other villages
sell for hundreds of millions of won.

50
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,282
Why do you think
house prices here are frozen?

51
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,953
You're our only hope, General Dongcheon.

52
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,747
Don't worry. I'm good at this.

53
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,083
Big Sister, are you ready?

54
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,129
Let's go.

55
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,052
-Put the lights down. Let's begin.
-Yes, ma'am.

56
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,994
Mom.

57
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,746
Mom…

58
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,873
Oh, Mom.

59
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,127
How could this be, Mom?

60
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,883
You sold off all the wealth you had

61
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,427
and ended up penniless.

62
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,763
What's this, Mom?

63
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,600
You could've at least put
some flowers around her photo.

64
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:51,643
The armband.

65
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,856
If you go to the office
by the main entrance…

66
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,942
-I'll go get you one.
-Give me yours.

67
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,695
What is it?
Can't give up the chief mourner role?

68
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,578
You're being ridiculous.

69
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,498
That won't change anything now.

70
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,334
If you had wanted to kick him out,

71
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,503
you should've done so long ago.

72
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,047
When I said

73
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,841
we should send him abroad
or anywhere else,

74
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,304
before Mom spent
her remaining savings on him!

75
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,598
Don't you remember
how much she hated that idea?

76
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,684
I do remember!
But you should've persuaded her somehow.

77
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,104
You're the eldest son, aren't you?

78
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,772
Honey. You too, stop it.

79
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,316
Please calm down, will you?

80
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,152
Come on. Hand it over!

81
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,905
Don't touch him. He's bad luck!

82
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,741
I'm sorry, Uncle. But please…

83
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,035
Could you let me stay here?

84
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,038
Who are you calling "Uncle"? Why you…

85
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,582
What do you think you're doing?
It's disrespectful.

86
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,792
What?

87
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,836
Why kick him out
when he's stayed here until now?

88
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,712
You want the world to know
how messed up your family is?

89
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,841
Do you think being loud
means you're right?

90
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,468
Are you a shaman?

91
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,554
Yes.

92
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,055
-My gosh.
-What?

93
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,099
-So what?
-A shaman?

94
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:16,478
A shaman at a funeral?
Don't you know shamans can't be here?

95
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,772
How dare you act like
she's a ghost already?

96
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,191
You called this con artist, didn't you?

97
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,443
-No, it's not what--
-You stay out of it.

98
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,823
Must you defame her
even on her final journey?

99
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,243
-Fine. Today's the day.
-I'd rather take on a ghost.

100
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,536
People are much worse.

101
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,330
-Come with me.
-Leave him alone.

102
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:37,976
Big Sister.

103
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,520
Isn't it a bit weird?

104
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,037
Dongcheon!

105
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,429
Gwi, as in "ghost."

106
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,432
It's a curse! Get out this instant!

107
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,850
A PUNISHMENT FOR ANGERING SPIRITS

108
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,688
Get out now!

109
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,821
A GHOST

110
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,463
You're still here?

111
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,540
TO BLOCK

112
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,003
THE LATE OH OK-SUN IN STANDARD ROOM
HAS BEEN MOVED TO SPECIAL SUITE 2

113
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,713
STANDARD ROOM

114
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,593
Hello. Thank you for coming.

115
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,721
How unfortunate.

116
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,783
Just say thank you.

117
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,326
It's the perfect time to say that.

118
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,454
Thank you.

119
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,835
How did you know to come?

120
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,712
Seong-A told me.

121
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,214
Seong-A?

122
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,840
Park Seong-A?

123
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,467
So, the thing is,

124
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,303
she works part-time in this area.

125
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,181
She saw you and told me to come.

126
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,101
She should be clocking out soon.

127
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,855
Get changed
and join us like you just arrived.

128
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,024
GET CHANGED AND JOIN US
LIKE YOU JUST ARRIVED

129
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,859
I don't have other clothes.

130
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,196
Hey, Gyeon-U.

131
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,075
Your parents…

132
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,244
They'll be here soon.

133
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,705
I'll leave. Don't worry.

134
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,874
Will you?

135
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,545
Thanks.

136
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,013
-You'll leave? For real?
-Yeah.

137
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,811
See you.

138
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,272
Bye. Get some rest.

139
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,773
You look like a mess.

140
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,861
CONDOLENCES

141
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,868
You didn't stop him. I thought you would.

142
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,080
You heard what the man said.

143
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,249
"Thanks."

144
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,586
Of all the things
people said to Gyeon-U today,

145
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,546
that was the one nice thing.

146
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,299
You can't stop him then.

147
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,219
About earlier.

148
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,349
I wouldn't have been mistreated so badly
if I hadn't been a shaman, right?

149
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,351
You would've been.

150
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,604
Because we're nothing but noobs.

151
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,985
Hey, Shaman. Can you get home on your own?

152
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,905
-Sure.
-See you tomorrow.

153
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,548
You'll return my money and that's it?

154
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,634
You said you could do this.

155
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,385
That was before I got hit by a curse.

156
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,099
It's a miracle
that only three have died so far.

157
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,810
Even ghosts would perish here.

158
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,523
You and your excuses. You're just a quack.

159
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,607
Watch it.

160
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,655
Don't call another shaman
to try to exorcise the ghost.

161
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,699
Whoever offers to do it
would be the real quack.

162
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,871
Here's your money.

163
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,545
What am I to do if even a rite won't work?

164
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,714
If it's hiding
its murderous energy so well,

165
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,592
it means it's
an exceptionally strong spirit.

166
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:06,096
Until the spirit moves away on its own,

167
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,098
there's nothing us humans can do.

168
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,267
All we can do is pray.

169
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,852
"Drive out the darkness."

170
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,230
"Let go of the evil within."

171
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,356
Just pray.

172
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,694
Are you all burned yet?

173
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,912
Don't let anyone near the house.

174
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,123
We'll see if we can find a solution.

175
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,332
Okay.

176
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,959
Let's head back, then.

177
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,128
-Okay.
-Let's go.

178
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,839
-Pack your stuff.
-Okay.

179
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,296
Hello.

180
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,380
Hi.

181
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,009
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

182
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,935
What a shame.

183
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,021
The bike's new.

184
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,091
What was that noise?

185
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,425
Is there an accident?

186
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,095
-A kid was hit!
-I think a child was hit.

187
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,055
-Someone call an ambulance.
-Call 119!

188
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,848
-Was it an accident?
-Hurry.

189
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:14,933
Oh, no.

190
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,067
You don't have to walk me further.

191
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,610
Get going now.

192
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,862
Okay, then.

193
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:28,947
I'm off.

194
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:42,794
What's wrong?

195
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,879
What?

196
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,840
It's nothing.

197
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,937
I heard your grandmother passed away.

198
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,940
She's finally free from you.

199
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,653
Congratulations.

200
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,127
I know you gave fake amulets
to my spirit-mother.

201
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,045
I won't tell on you. Make me 100 more…

202
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,756
No, make me just 50 more.

203
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,090
Are you some thief?

204
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,551
-Please.
-I can't make you any more.

205
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,012
I sent you a link instead. Check it out.

206
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,975
EPISODE 1. FLOWER MASTER'S
LIFESAVING AMULETS

207
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,060
What's this?

208
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,563
I started an online lecture series
on amulets.

209
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,814
It's 500,000 won per month,

210
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,484
but a 12-month plan is
5.4 million, with a 10% discount.

211
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,860
Are you some thief?

212
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,363
Oh, please. Call me entrepreneurial.

213
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,490
Hey, kiddo.

214
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,825
Aren't you
General Dongcheon's spirit-daughter?

215
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,869
Don't you know she's no ordinary shaman?

216
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,580
If she helped you become a shaman,
you must be pretty powerful too.

217
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,750
Why's a tiger cub harassing a fox?

218
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,251
Don't you call me again.

219
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,336
Bye-bye.

220
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,195
I'm sorry, Gyeon-U.

221
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,240
I'm sorry I upset you, Gyeon-U.

222
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,037
My grandson

223
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,082
is plagued with misfortune.

224
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,670
Please save my grandson's life.

225
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,215
How could this be, Mom?

226
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,300
THE LATE OH OK-SUN

227
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,095
How did you end up like this?

228
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,847
If you had wanted to kick him out,

229
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,723
you should've done so long ago.

230
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,727
Before Mom spent
her remaining savings on him!

231
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,416
I'm sorry…

232
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,755
for being the source
of your misfortune, Grandma.

233
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,138
Are you okay? You took a hit earlier.

234
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,390
It stung a bit.

235
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,559
It jolted me awake.

236
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,771
You really are a strong shaman.

237
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,733
I wonder who the crazy bitch is.

238
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,946
She offered herself as a living sacrifice
to strengthen an evil spirit.

239
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,697
BOOK ON THE SECRETS
OF THWARTING EVIL

240
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:43,493
She should've known better
than to use those vile spells.

241
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,619
It could cost her life.

242
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:49,123
"I'll cut a long lock of hair short
and pull out nails."

243
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,797
"I'll write a secret spell with blood

244
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,174
and become a shaman
serving an evil spirit."

245
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,729
"A spell that promises the evil spirit
to go to hell with it."

246
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,858
A GHOST

247
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,778
Whoever did this, she's not a human being.

248
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,655
It's a ghost in a shell of a human being.

249
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,866
How could you, Mother?

250
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,077
How could you ignore my call?

251
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,665
What are you doing in the dark?

252
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,504
Great Aunt?

253
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,507
When greeting an elder,
you first say, "How are you?"

254
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,134
Where are your manners?

255
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,013
How are you?

256
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,056
Hello. I'm fine.

257
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,146
Do you know how much I needed your help?

258
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,981
Ring, ring, ring!

259
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,483
It wasn't just you, okay?

260
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,777
I needed help too.

261
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:03,031
Don't lie. Why would you need help?

262
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,116
I bet your clients called for help.

263
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,744
You always need to have the last word.

264
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,622
You two are still on great terms.

265
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,791
This is not funny, Great Aunt.

266
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,211
I'm facing a massive life crisis.

267
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,005
Goodness.

268
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,174
It's not just a crisis but a massive one?

269
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:22,633
Yes.

270
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,096
He's my first love.

271
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,852
How is that Gyeon-U's fault?
They should blame his misfortune.

272
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,479
But he must survive 21 days

273
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,940
to get an apology
from those nasty people or fight them.

274
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,276
There's no point if he dies before then.

275
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,987
Once I fight off his misfortune
and he becomes normal,

276
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,740
Gyeon-U won't be hated.
Actually, he'll be really loved.

277
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,283
Because he's the nicest ever.

278
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,578
Mother. Great Aunt.

279
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,123
Please help me.

280
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,584
I'm too unskilled yet to protect Gyeon-U.

281
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,213
Great Aunt, look…

282
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,591
I'm on my knees.

283
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,844
You fool.
You went on your knees just like that?

284
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,554
What else should I do?

285
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,682
I have no idea what to do.

286
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,769
-Do you like him a lot?
-I love him.

287
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,444
You should be the one
protecting what you value.

288
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,031
Weaklings lose out eventually.

289
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,324
BOOK ON THE SECRETS
OF THWARTING EVIL

290
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,493
Hang, as in "to defeat."

291
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,370
Ma, as in "evil."

292
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,539
Bi, as in "mysterious."

293
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,791
Seo, as in "writing."

294
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,462
"Writing on mysterious knowledge
of defeating evil."

295
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,256
"Book on The Secrets of Thwarting Evil."

296
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,053
It took me 30 minutes to read 4 letters.

297
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,473
It'll take me ten years
to read the whole thing.

298
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,730
I'll never finish it in my lifetime.

299
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,863
HANJA DICTIONARY

300
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,580
Wow, Seong-A.

301
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,040
What's gotten into you?
Why are you studying?

302
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,712
-Any good with hanja?
-I can barely read hangul.

303
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,255
Damn it.

304
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,631
What is it?

305
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,426
What is this antique?

306
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,431
It's a book full of secrets

307
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:37,727
that make you a damn powerful shaman
who can take on even the strongest ghosts.

308
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,022
They say a way to protect Gyeon-U

309
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,482
is written somewhere in this book.

310
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,448
It's too hard. I don't understand a thing.

311
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,290
Let's find another way, buddy.

312
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,712
TRAVELING AROUND KOREA

313
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,631
Gyeon-U will miss school, won't he?

314
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,926
Yeah. Wouldn't it be best for him
to be alone?

315
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:11,886
I guess.

316
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,473
He'd be bothered
if there's someone by his side.

317
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,516
Right.

318
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,394
My goodness.

319
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:21,979
Hello, kid with a nice build.

320
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,148
-Do me a favor.
-No, thanks.

321
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,486
I'm the archery team coach.
I have crazy strong arms.

322
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,988
He'd want to be left alone.

323
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,283
There should be no one by his side.

324
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,536
No.

325
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,788
Absolutely no one.

326
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:45,795
So,

327
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,630
you left something behind?

328
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:53,010
-Yeah. I'll leave as soon as I find it.
-No, wait.

329
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,220
Stay here. I'll get it.

330
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,304
No.

331
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,390
It's a thing girls use in secret.

332
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,145
So, have you eaten?

333
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,190
Shall we eat together if you haven't?
I have a pretty huge appetite.

334
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:07,608
My mother says

335
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,111
if you can lift a spoon,
you can chew and swallow.

336
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,154
That's what life is like.

337
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,241
You didn't even drink water
at the funeral.

338
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,034
Did you eat anything after you left?

339
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,495
At the funeral?

340
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,623
Were you there?

341
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,208
I didn't see you.

342
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,422
Ji-ho.

343
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,966
He filled me in.
I couldn't have been there.

344
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,843
I was so not there.

345
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:38,389
So, have you… Did you eat?

346
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,017
I'm great at rinsing rice.
Do you want to watch?

347
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,144
-No, thanks.
-Come on.

348
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,729
You'll change your mind

349
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,480
-if you see me do it.
-I won't.

350
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,316
Watch, at least.

351
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,319
If you can't find what you came for,
please get going.

352
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,321
Gyeon-U.

353
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,368
Gyeon-U, don't entertain such thoughts.

354
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,996
What thoughts?

355
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,290
Bad thoughts.

356
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,543
That you want to die.

357
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,088
That ghost

358
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,758
only comes to those
who have such thoughts.

359
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,852
Your grandmother would be sad…

360
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,106
to see you like this.

361
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,658
Please leave.

362
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,191
Hey, Park Seong-A.

363
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,944
Park Seong-A?

364
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,112
She was here?

365
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,614
Forget it.

366
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:20,658
What do you want?

367
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,080
The coach asked me
to give you the archery team room key.

368
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,963
I did what I was told to do. Bye.

369
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,261
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

370
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,180
ARCHERY TEAM

371
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,981
Give me Yeomhwa's number.

372
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,735
Why do you have this?

373
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,280
-Give me her phone number.
-I don't have it.

374
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,700
She's a regular. You have her number!

375
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,910
I don't have it.

376
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,830
Goodness.

377
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,208
Here.

378
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,048
YEOMHWA

379
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,261
What kind of nonsense is this?

380
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,013
Well, she's…

381
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,265
She's awfully famous.

382
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,268
"Influenza"? That's what she is now.

383
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:33,439
She's the first shaman
to become so well-known.

384
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:36,692
She's so popular,
so her number's never disclosed.

385
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,613
If you tap on this and send a DM,

386
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,822
she replies.

387
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,574
Shall I do it for you?

388
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,495
Forget it.

389
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,628
Don't sell Yeomhwa anything.

390
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,213
You'll be punished.

391
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,599
Well done.

392
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,976
I thought I'd die before my time.

393
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,896
Didn't you say you'd meet Dongcheon soon?

394
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,231
Why did you even hide?

395
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,024
You could just meet here and talk.

396
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,237
Well…

397
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,531
I don't look pretty today.

398
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,328
I want to look so pretty
that she'll be stunned.

399
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,833
Will this make me look nicer?

400
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,087
What do you think?

401
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,174
Mother!

402
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,722
You kneel all the time now.

403
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,057
What is it now?

404
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,017
I need your help. There's no time.

405
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,352
BOOK ON THE SECRETS OF THWARTING EVIL

406
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,899
Hey, that's against the rules.

407
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,860
A Suicide Ghost is stuck to Gyeon-U.

408
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,742
It looks like he let it in only recently.
It doesn't follow him around yet.

409
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,579
You've delayed it by about two days, then.

410
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,999
But don't let your guard down.
Suicide Ghost is quick and quiet.

411
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:21,046
If it gets as close to him
as a noon-time shadow…

412
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,840
NOON-TIME: 11:30 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.

413
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,361
He'll die.

414
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,822
He'll take his own life.

415
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,366
My gosh.

416
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,035
You and your damn first love.

417
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,703
It's a tough one.

418
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,506
Do you want to save him that badly?

419
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,967
-Yes.
-How about him?

420
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:09,011
Does he have a reason to live?

421
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,016
It's a Suicide Ghost.

422
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,809
First, he must want to live.

423
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:18,228
You wanting him to live isn't enough.

424
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,068
He might not know if he wants to live yet.

425
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,738
If you're too sad, that's the first thing
you become unsure of.

426
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,204
Make him want to live first.

427
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:37,623
Can you do that?

428
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,087
Yes. I'll try everything I can.

429
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,139
This is all I have to offer.

430
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,974
Oh, gosh. Thanks.

431
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:00,854
The framed folk paintings tell me

432
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,191
my mother-in-law kept her refined taste.

433
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,404
May I ask why you're here?

434
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,115
Well…

435
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,785
Here you go.

436
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,207
USONG COLUMBARIUM 2-28-501

437
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,000
Neither my wife nor her brother

438
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,461
had a single photo of their mother.

439
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,673
We had nothing to put next to her urn.

440
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:30,968
But now that's settled.

441
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,137
You have lots of photos here.

442
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,016
Thank you,

443
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,643
Uncle.

444
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,247
What's an amulet?

445
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:45,751
It's just a little piece of paper.

446
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:50,589
But what sets it apart
from other pieces of paper?

447
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,926
An amulet contains heart.

448
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,221
The determination to protect someone.

449
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,264
The hope that they will stay safe.

450
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,141
The well-wishes for their future.

451
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,521
Those are what fend off misfortune
and protect someone.

452
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:12,027
What if it were a human
instead of a piece of paper?

453
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,907
-A human?
-Humans are powerful.

454
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,703
They're warm.

455
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:26,792
"A Human Amulet."

456
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,045
This turns a person into an amulet.

457
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,673
Write on your body
instead of on a piece of paper,

458
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,758
stick close to him,

459
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:37,636
and share your warmth like this.

460
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,805
Then misfortune will be driven out.

461
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,478
We must hold hands?

462
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,274
You don't have to hold it.
You can brush his with yours.

463
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,985
Sharing your warmth is what's important.

464
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,573
-Mother.
-What?

465
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,368
Oh, right, he's your first love.

466
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:06,623
Are you too shy to touch him like this?

467
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,336
It's the best method, Mother.

468
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,257
Oh, my gosh. You little…

469
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:17,718
Wish me luck.

470
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,514
Why didn't you tell me
about the Human Amulet sooner?

471
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,437
I will save Gyeon-U

472
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,273
with my physical touch.

473
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,445
Gyeon-U!

474
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,034
Gyeon-U, long time no see.

475
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,953
Hey, it's great to see you.

476
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,039
Shall I read your palm?

477
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,874
I'm really good at it.

478
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,417
What now?

479
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,794
Should we bring out the child in him?

480
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,214
Hi.

481
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:57,966
Hi.

482
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,062
Hi.

483
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,779
That's too close.

484
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:26,995
Have you eaten?

485
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,790
Did you sleep well?

486
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,340
Gyeon-U, sit with me.

487
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:46,682
Is this necessary?

488
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,145
-Then…
-Unnecessarily clingy.

489
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,231
Hey, Ji-ho, morning to you too.

490
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,702
Did you study last night?

491
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,370
You're acting real strange.

492
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,790
What was that?

493
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,417
What?

494
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,752
Here.

495
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,380
Guess which finger I poked you with.

496
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,506
Go on.

497
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,968
-This one.
-Wrong.

498
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,845
This one.

499
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,561
It's too early for that.

500
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,566
Why did I use this finger?

501
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,110
Guys, you're mistaken.

502
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,236
That was me trying

503
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,280
to bring out the child in you.

504
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,749
You're no better than a tabloid hack.

505
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,543
Didn't I tell you to look into it
before spreading a rumor?

506
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,380
-Exactly.
-I'm a victim of fake news too.

507
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:03,592
Now that's the downside of mass media.

508
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,178
What's going on here?

509
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,387
Why are you sulking?

510
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,348
Our poor Gyeon-U
almost got framed because of him.

511
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,018
-Him, an arsonist? How ridiculous.
-Right.

512
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,729
I went to ask our math teacher
for help with a problem.

513
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,272
What?

514
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,732
An arsonist?

515
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,861
You bought that stupid rumor
and made the kid write a report?

516
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,071
It's not like that, Coach Yang.

517
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:29,409
Spare me your excuses.
Why would Gyeon-U set a fire?

518
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:32,037
Why would he set fire to the storage?

519
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,749
The only thing he sets fire to
are the girls' hearts.

520
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,335
I must say he set fire to mine too.

521
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,213
In the end, our homeroom teacher
apologized to the archery coach.

522
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:44,549
I told you to watch what you say.

523
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,720
I'm not the only one in the wrong.
You spread rumors too.

524
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,430
Not again. Watch your tongue.

525
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:51,723
Did you forget already?

526
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:55,977
Well, Gyeon-U even missed school
for a few days because of that.

527
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,813
I feel so terrible about it

528
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,898
that I don't know what to say.

529
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,569
He didn't miss school because of you.

530
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,740
Gyeon-U's grandmother passed away.

531
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,409
That's why he missed school.

532
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,829
Put your face down on your desk.

533
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,081
-You idiot.
-Seriously.

534
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,083
-You should've been careful.
-Smack him.

535
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,086
It made no sense.

536
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,298
I'm glad you're not
being mistaken anymore.

537
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,424
Show some remorse.

538
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,643
Tap my hand again.

539
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:37,727
Stronger this time.

540
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,739
Well done.

541
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,244
-Let me help you.
-What?

542
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,205
I'll do it. Why are you doing this?

543
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,665
-Hey, wait.
-Hey.

544
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,460
Gyeon-U, where were you?

545
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,337
Why is there so much dust?

546
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,673
-What…
-Look at all this.

547
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,566
I'm sorry.

548
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,240
Oh, my gosh.

549
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,618
Thank you. You got it for me.

550
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,917
What are you doing to Gyeon-U?
Is it a new way of bullying?

551
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,752
It's not.

552
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,880
Would you like it
if someone kept doing this to you?

553
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,008
That's not what I did.

554
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,220
I know that.

555
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,472
You did this.

556
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:58,892
I'm not bullying him.

557
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,646
What an interesting method.
A person can be an amulet?

558
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,356
So when I touch him like that,

559
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,859
it's not just for my own greed.

560
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,821
The determination to save Gyeon-U.

561
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,074
With that pure intention,
I'm willingly sacrificing myself

562
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,159
to save a life, okay?

563
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:17,619
There's no ulterior motive.

564
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,955
Stop it. It looks like you totally
have an ulterior motive.

565
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,457
Does it?

566
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,337
Does it have to be so hard?

567
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,339
Can't you just tell him everything
and offer to help?

568
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,299
No. You saw what it's like.

569
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:34,344
Me being a shaman
puts Gyeon-U in a tight spot.

570
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,807
To accept my help, he must trust me.

571
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,600
A shaman at a funeral?

572
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:44,187
Must you defame her
even on her final journey?

573
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,109
I can't make things
even more difficult for Gyeon-U.

574
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,236
So what?

575
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,571
You'll become a weirdo for him?

576
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,949
Yeah.

577
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,493
I may not get him to understand,
but I can protect him.

578
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,497
If I have no choice
but to be hated by him, so be it.

579
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,001
I'll just focus on
what I can do right now.

580
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,753
Hey.

581
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,672
You sound like

582
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:13,842
you're being genuine.

583
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,345
Hey.

584
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,264
I am being genuine.

585
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,183
I'm genuinely a shaman, punk.

586
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,300
What are you doing?

587
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,222
-How far will you follow me?
-What?

588
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,058
Oh, well…

589
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,770
-Until you catch me?
-I just caught you, though.

590
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,900
This is the opposite direction
of where you live.

591
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:14,903
I'm not going home.

592
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,029
Where are you going?

593
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,532
To the columbarium.

594
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:01,449
Gyeon-U.

595
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,077
Your grandmother…

596
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,789
She must've been really competitive.

597
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:15,046
A bouquet of flowers won't make her smile.

598
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:19,342
She only smiles when you put
a gold medal around her neck.

599
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,679
She's a total gold medal hunter.

600
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,324
You've got this, right?

601
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,993
-Look at mommy.
-I'll get you something yummy.

602
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,870
WE WELCOME THE FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS

603
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,250
Let's eat something tasty.

604
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,503
GYEONGGI YEOUN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

605
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,921
You have to beat your classmates.

606
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:58,715
-Here. Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

607
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:25,575
NATIONAL ARCHERY COMPETITION

608
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,868
Congratulations.

609
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:27,952
Thanks.

610
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,670
Grandma.

611
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,381
So you were happy that day.

612
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,513
That made you happy.

613
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:51,768
I'm glad.

614
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,943
JOONGHYUN HIGH SCHOOL
ARCHERY TEAM BAE GYEON-U

615
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,403
When did he…

616
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:33,202
Three,

617
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,663
two,

618
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:37,832
one.

619
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,631
For this practical assessment,

620
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,926
you're to pick a key theme
from the chapters of Life and Ethics

621
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,470
and come up with a program
to improve awareness on that topic.

622
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,597
We're all in the same group.

623
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,682
PARK SEONG-A, BAE GYEON-U

624
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:38,101
I'll give you ten minutes.

625
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,560
Pick a group leader

626
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,813
and if possible,
decide who will give the presentation

627
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,356
so you don't fight later on.

628
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,692
I'll lead our group. No objections, right?

629
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,278
No. You've already taken
the leader's seat too.

630
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,072
-Hey.
-What?

631
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,033
-You be the leader.
-Me?

632
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,285
And you're the assistant leader.

633
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,496
But we don't need one.

634
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,750
-Do you want a beating or not?
-Not.

635
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,336
So just do as I say, okay?

636
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,130
They're screwed.

637
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:09,882
And I'm screwed too.

638
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,057
Do-yeon.

639
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,852
Why do you have such a nasty thing
clinging to you?

640
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,813
-You're putting my Gyeon-U in danger.
-You do it, then.

641
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,273
The Three Ominous Ghosts.

642
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,359
There are three types of ghosts
you must avoid.

643
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:31,237
Smiling Ghosts, Dancing Ghosts,

644
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:33,072
and Baby Ghosts.

645
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,032
What do you think they have in common?

646
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,909
They're all fine being on their own?

647
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,454
That's kind of right.

648
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,705
To be exact,

649
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,166
those three ghosts don't complain.

650
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:47,128
Most other ghosts move on
when they're consoled,

651
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,504
but not them.

652
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:49,797
You can't reason with them.

653
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:54,093
You can't talk to them
if they're not reasonable at all.

654
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,137
But you need to talk to them

655
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,182
to help them cross over, right?

656
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:02,477
Then the Baby Ghost
will be the most troublesome.

657
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,644
It can't talk at all.

658
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,563
That's right.

659
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,857
That's the worst of the three.

660
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,944
I can barely handle a Suicide Ghost,
and there's a Baby Ghost too?

661
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:19,368
What should I do, then?

662
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:20,620
You can wait.

663
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:24,707
Sorry.

664
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,667
What's up with her?

665
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,419
Ji-ho, you and I will do the research.

666
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,302
Gyeon-U!

667
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:37,762
Gyeon-U!

668
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,933
You came to the archery field.

669
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:45,394
Yeah, just because.

670
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,021
How did it feel to shoot after a while?

671
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,357
Did it feel like second nature?

672
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,067
Are you getting back into archery?

673
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,276
No, I'm not.

674
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:56,239
Come on.

675
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,242
You should've cleaned up after yourself.

676
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,077
You can't just leave like that!

677
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,162
-I cleaned--
-Come with me, punk.

678
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:05,581
Clean up before you go. Follow me.

679
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,377
-But I--
-Follow me, I said.

680
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,549
Mop every corner, okay?

681
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:15,842
Under that desk too.

682
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,470
Gyeon-U.

683
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:24,141
Isn't archery just amazing?

684
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,521
I'm not saying
you should get back into it.

685
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:31,232
Well…

686
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,025
You know,

687
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:38,155
girls dumped me left and right
when I was young.

688
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,325
I never got why, but they did.

689
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:42,827
But you know,

690
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,496
girls who rejected me

691
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,875
with a short, sharp, "I don't like you,"
stuck in my mind forever.

692
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,294
"I should've said this to her face."

693
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,713
"I should've made her
pay me back for the handbag."

694
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:57,008
"I'd paid 2.5 million won for it
at a duty-free store."

695
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,886
Those girls appear in my dreams even now.

696
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,305
I can never forget them.

697
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,431
But think about this.

698
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,809
"This is what I don't like about you."

699
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:10,646
"This is why I don't think
we're a good match."

700
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,773
Girls who cared enough
to put in the effort

701
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,151
to explain before the break-up?

702
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,028
I didn't think of them ever again.

703
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,238
"Oh, yes. That happened."

704
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,908
"There was that girl." And that's it.

705
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:29,916
You were with this bow for ten years.

706
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,920
Even if you want to break up,
put time and effort into it.

707
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,380
Here.

708
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,383
That way, you'll have no regrets.

709
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:55,900
Who is that?

710
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,527
You don't know Bae Gyeon-U?
The best in the high school division.

711
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:00,446
He must've decided to come back.

712
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,577
-He's good.
-Agreed.

713
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,580
He's so cool.

714
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,381
He's awesome.

715
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,825
I see he really likes archery.

716
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,704
What a relief.

717
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,253
Here's a special tip
just for my Flower Fam.

718
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,088
When you're plagued by a Baby Ghost,

719
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,757
most shamans will sell you
a Protective Amulet.

720
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,468
But would Baby Ghosts know what that is?

721
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:05,553
No, no.

722
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,679
They'd have no clue.

723
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,014
So, Protective Amulets?

724
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:11,017
I don't use them.

725
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,810
I go for wish-granting ones.

726
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,563
Baby Ghosts only leave

727
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,898
when you wish for the good
of both you and them.

728
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:21,819
You must make an amulet with a kind heart.

729
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,196
Like who? Just like me.

730
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,160
Wish-Granting Amulet, ready.

731
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:33,956
I'll put it in Do-yeon's desk drawer
tomorrow to console the Baby Ghost.

732
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,126
Suicide Ghost.

733
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,627
Just you wait.

734
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:45,843
KU DO-YEON

735
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,731
My goodness.

736
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,192
Oh. Hey.

737
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,027
You got here really early.

738
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,410
Good morning.

739
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,163
Hi.

740
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,915
Are you off to shoot some arrows?

741
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,837
-No.
-I know that's what you're off to do.

742
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,506
You absolutely love archery.

743
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,388
We should talk.

744
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,892
Don't you think
you're following me around too much?

745
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,562
Oh, yeah? I don't think so.

746
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,439
Why are you following me around?

747
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:41,607
Don't do that.

748
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:45,444
I'm not following you around.
You just happen to be everywhere I go.

749
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,655
Do you call that an excuse…

750
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,199
I see it didn't work.

751
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,331
I want to ask you something. Can I?

752
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,751
-Yeah.
-About archery.

753
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:02,878
How does it make you feel
when you shoot the arrow?

754
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,134
That's him.

755
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:09,260
The haunted kid.

756
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,554
-Yes. He causes the accidents.
-The accidents were all him.

757
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:12,805
I heard.

758
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,682
-Because of him…
-Will something happen today?

759
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,392
That kid suffered too.

760
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,435
-So what if he's great?
-Three.

761
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:21,063
-The other kids suffer.
-Two.

762
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:23,065
Something happened on the bus last time.

763
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:24,191
One.

764
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,041
He's good, I guess.

765
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:47,715
I feel good.

766
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:50,259
However strong the wind blows…

767
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,266
I can beat it with a single arrow.

768
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:00,895
That's cool.

769
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:02,730
And I'm proud of you.

770
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,215
You want to know why I follow you around?

771
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:33,260
Kids should be protected by adults,
but you protect yourself.

772
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:36,430
That's why I want to be nice to you.

773
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,015
Can I do that?

774
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:40,768
Is it pity?

775
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,770
It's friendship.

776
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:48,776
Come on.

777
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,237
You'll change your mind
if you see me do it.

778
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,323
Guess which finger I poked you with.

779
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,407
Go on.

780
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,826
Well done.

781
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:07,419
I'm sorry.

782
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,819
-Hey, Gyeon-U.
-What?

783
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:32,903
High-five.

784
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:35,572
-Right now?
-Yeah, right now.

785
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,534
Sure, I guess.

786
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:39,910
Come on. Hurry.

787
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:33,047
First love.

788
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:35,799
Here we go.

789
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,297
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH MIN-AE

790
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:17,049
Hi. Good morning.

791
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,634
The weather's lovely.

792
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,428
What's he doing instead of archery?

793
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:22,763
Romance is in the air, I see.

794
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:26,016
From now on, nothing bad will ever happen.

795
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,018
Because I'll ward it all off.

796
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:29,812
This is what's bad
about being in a group of three.

797
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,563
I feel left out.

798
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,857
-Let's talk.
-About what?

799
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:36,777
-I have to dash to my part-time job.
-I'll walk you.

800
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,113
This boundary was made with the purpose
of making the one inside

801
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,364
an evil deity.

802
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,490
I found you.

803
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:44,368
You, the mask on your face.
Can you take it off for a moment?

804
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,709
