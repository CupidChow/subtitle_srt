1
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,001
It's been five years since I started
studying for the civil service exam.

2
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,003
-You'll pass.
-Will I really?

3
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,505
Forget about that.

4
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,674
A man and a woman high-fived,
and then she clasped his hand by mistake.

5
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,593
They high-fived, then she did this.

6
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,761
But then

7
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,930
the man folded his fingers
over hers like this.

8
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,223
Doesn't this mean

9
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,433
the man's kind of interested in the woman?

10
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,394
I sacrificed myself
by working my fingers to the bone.

11
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,063
It must've been tough.

12
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,815
By the way,

13
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,818
if a man holds a woman's hand like this,
he's interested in her, right?

14
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,153
It was a bit like this.

15
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,781
Slow and gentle.

16
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,035
Clasping hands. Do it now.

17
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,121
It's nice, isn't it?
Do you feel butterflies?

18
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,873
Yes.

19
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,292
I knew it.

20
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,253
I was right.

21
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,631
You can't throw salt on her.

22
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,175
-She's your spirit-daughter.
-That brat.

23
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:45,583
I can't focus.

24
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,422
THE LATE OH OK-SUN

25
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:16,238
Hello, Ms. Oh Ok-sun.

26
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,713
Didn't you say
a really powerful evil spirit lived here?

27
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,631
I did.

28
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,467
Then why put up a straw rope
and scatter red clay?

29
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,470
This is what you do
when you host a powerful deity.

30
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,265
"Look over us, dear deity,
as we carry out a rite."

31
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,352
Aren't we groveling a bit too much?

32
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,561
It hurts my pride.

33
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,396
You're right.

34
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,942
We're not here to ask a favor of a ghost.

35
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,195
-Then what?
-We're asking a person.

36
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:57,947
A person? Who?

37
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:00,783
Me.

38
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:07,122
"I can save them. I can make it right."

39
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,041
Words of affirmation for me.

40
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,752
This spirit is difficult to deal with.

41
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,088
I'm doing this because I'm nervous,

42
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,714
so quit talking and cooperate.

43
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,675
Mother.

44
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,636
You're an awfully cool shaman.

45
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,223
If I had been actually cool,
I'd have succeeded on my first try.

46
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,935
You haven't given up yet.
That means it's still your first try.

47
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,814
That's the mindset I'm trying to keep
while protecting Gyeon-U.

48
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,274
Even though everyone else says
he'll die in 21 days,

49
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,193
I won't ever give up.

50
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:40,906
Ta-da.

51
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,826
Today is already

52
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,952
the 13th day.

53
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,453
Just eight more days,

54
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,540
and Gyeon-U will be free
of his misfortune.

55
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,585
Even in this grave situation,

56
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,838
-he's all you think about?
-Yes.

57
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,049
I guess I'll become a real cool shaman
who's all about love.

58
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,058
Guys.

59
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,186
Gonjiam has nothing
on this abandoned house.

60
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,022
ABANDONED HOUSE TOUR

61
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,189
Brace yourselves.

62
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,692
Do you know who told me about the place?

63
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,069
The police.

64
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,240
Even they're too scared to go in here.

65
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,202
I'll protect him more thoroughly
for the remaining eight days.

66
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,540
Okay. Don't ever give in.

67
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,042
I won't give in.

68
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,627
As if you won't.

69
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:37,838
Can you beat this spirit?

70
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,259
Maybe not by myself.

71
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,094
You silly…

72
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,890
I won't let Gyeon-U come here.

73
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,434
He's safe as long as
he's kept away from evil spirits.

74
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,643
That's right.

75
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,978
That's what you must do.

76
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,772
What?

77
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,735
Avoid fights you can't win.

78
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,946
Tell a few lies and run away
when you have to.

79
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,199
Do everything you can to not lose.

80
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,576
Remember that.

81
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,496
You're the only one who can protect him.

82
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,666
Okay. I'll make sure to keep him safe.

83
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,253
Hey, the doors won't open.

84
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,172
Shoot.

85
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,466
Who are those fools?

86
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,844
I'm not lying, guys.
The door really won't open. Wait.

87
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,224
What are you doing?

88
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,643
That startled me.

89
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,019
What? You want to go in?

90
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,481
Don't. You'll never make it out.

91
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,274
Are you a shaman?

92
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,653
Guys, this is insane.
Real shamans are here!

93
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,862
Hey, give me that.

94
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,116
Stop fooling around and go home.

95
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,118
That's for me to decide.

96
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,703
I heard there's a real evil spirit here.

97
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,413
Are you here to take care of it?

98
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,333
I would've let you go in if I had.

99
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,836
If it were an ordinary ghost,
I would've let you go.

100
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,505
But I stopped you from going in
because you actually will die in there.

101
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,510
I can tell you're a typical bastard
who does things you're told not to.

102
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,679
But I stopped you

103
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,223
because even those bastards
have parents who'll mourn their deaths.

104
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,601
You're scaring us a bit too much, lady.

105
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,438
How about we go in together?

106
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,774
It's four against one.

107
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,026
It can't beat us four. I guarantee that.

108
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,611
Let's go inside together.

109
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,904
What do you think you're doing?

110
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:29,199
Come on and join us.
I'll let you into our field.

111
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,827
You look touched.

112
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,745
Hi, guys.

113
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,751
ABANDONED HOUSE TOUR

114
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:40,752
I have a sword.

115
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,671
This is great. Keep filming.

116
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,425
This is real.

117
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,096
Hey, dang.

118
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,182
Gosh, look at that.

119
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,893
Wow.

120
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,000
You made it look like a real sword.

121
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,252
Did you see that? I don't lose.

122
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,429
They're leaving.

123
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,639
They've left at last.

124
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,098
Took them long enough.

125
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,769
Don't throw shade at me, guys.
This is for real.

126
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,686
Let's go.

127
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,022
It's finally open.

128
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,693
Dang it.

129
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,240
Guys.

130
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,492
You heard what she said, right?

131
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,410
I risked my life to come in here.

132
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:59,748
Like, subscribe, and turn on notification.
I'd really appreciate it, guys.

133
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,212
What's this?

134
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,009
A ring?

135
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,060
What's the matter?

136
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,188
No pranks.

137
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,535
No!

138
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,587
Give something
with eyes, a nose, and lips

139
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,632
with the Human Amulet's scent on it
as a stand-in.

140
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,676
When the Human Amulet cannot be close,

141
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,386
the stand-in can still protect.

142
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,473
Shamans don't have anything
with eyes, a nose, and lips.

143
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,810
I didn't even play with stuffed dolls
as a kid in case they'd attract spirits.

144
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,071
Eyes, a nose, and lips?

145
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,994
Peekaboo.

146
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,584
How do I casually give him the lip balm?

147
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,669
Shall I call it
a symbol of our friendship?

148
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:28,628
No.

149
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,506
Who gives a used lip balm
as a symbol of friendship?

150
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,509
That's bullying.

151
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,139
The weather's lovely.

152
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,474
The weather?

153
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,391
That's it.

154
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,020
You can't let your guard down
because it's a nice day.

155
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,689
That's when you must make sure
to stay moisturized.

156
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,649
Do you know
what should be kept most moist?

157
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,109
Your lips.

158
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:53,945
My lips?

159
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,280
Yeah, your lips.

160
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,790
So…

161
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,667
if your lips become a desert,

162
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,629
then no life can breathe.

163
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,546
Here.

164
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,091
Let's stay moisturized.

165
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,391
What's up with her?

166
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,518
I don't know.

167
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,479
She's extra weird today.

168
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,939
This won't do.

169
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,110
Pinky.

170
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,116
It was you, Gyeon-U.

171
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,617
I thought it was Ji-ho.

172
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,495
Why did you think it was Ji-ho?

173
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,039
I'm a child at heart too.

174
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,793
Okay.

175
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:51,962
I'll keep that in mind.

176
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,690
The Baby Ghost.

177
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,739
A sleeping baby's an angel.

178
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,575
Even when it's become a ghost.

179
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,412
I'm glad the Wish-Granting Amulet worked.

180
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,664
It won't harm Gyeon-U.

181
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,917
Oh, my gosh.

182
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,544
I'm so sorry.

183
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,172
Are you grabbing him by the collar now?

184
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,298
It's fine.

185
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,634
The weather's lovely.

186
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,263
Wait up.

187
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,183
The weather?

188
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,268
What?

189
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,700
I'm hurt.

190
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,660
-Huh?
-What?

191
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,371
This is what's bad
about being in a group of three.

192
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,707
-I feel left out.
-What?

193
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,044
I pulled out a chair for you out of habit
because you'd always sit next to me.

194
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,922
But you ignored that completely
to sit next to Gyeon-U.

195
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,674
Isn't that too mean?

196
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,303
-Sorry for--
-That's it?

197
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,599
Get over here.

198
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,894
Don't focus on your new friend
and look out for your old friend too.

199
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,854
How childish. Are you a grade schooler?

200
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:33,813
I'm a kindergarten kid.

201
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,525
You'll do as he asked?

202
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,777
I must before he gets even more childish.

203
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,488
Hey, you…

204
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,741
This seat is for--

205
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,410
Let's eat together
until we finish the assessment.

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,831
-Whatever.
-What are you doing stood up? Sit down.

207
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,500
Okay.

208
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,087
-Sit somewhere else.
-Let's go.

209
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,548
Get moving, will you?

210
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,841
-Go eat somewhere else.
-Are they thugs?

211
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,594
Why tell them to move
when there are other seats?

212
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,429
-Group leader.
-Yes?

213
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,473
Our vice leader.

214
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,850
Is that a new kind of bullying?

215
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:12,852
Don't mind them.

216
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,688
Jin-ung bullies others all the time.

217
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,070
Today's lunch is awesome.

218
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,238
The soup's amazing.

219
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,739
It's incredibly good.

220
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,660
Eat up.

221
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,037
Do you want help?

222
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,833
So what?

223
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,544
Am I not supposed to care
about the assessment?

224
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,921
That's not what I mean, but…

225
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,799
So tell me.

226
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,551
What even are animal rights?

227
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,430
Why did you pick that as a topic
if you didn't know?

228
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,099
There's a reason
I need to know about animal rights.

229
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,143
What's that?

230
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,437
Why do you need to know that?

231
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,110
How cute.

232
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,197
What? Oh, dear, no.

233
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,282
That's not right at all.

234
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,743
What?

235
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,122
You said you liked Gyeon-U.

236
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,790
It was love at first sight.

237
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,708
Yeah.

238
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,047
I get that you like him.
He's handsome, he's a great archer,

239
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,131
and he's handsome.

240
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,800
You called him handsome twice.

241
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,470
That's how handsome he is,
so I get you liking him.

242
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,138
But Jin-ung…

243
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,186
-Just why do you think Jin-ung's cute?
-What?

244
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,563
You said earlier that Jin-ung was cute.

245
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,231
Me? When?

246
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,775
Give me a light.

247
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:43,860
You startled me.

248
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:48,948
How cute.

249
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,701
What?

250
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,162
You want a smoke too?

251
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,374
Here.

252
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,711
He's cute?

253
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,588
How?

254
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,714
No.

255
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,799
Okay.

256
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,425
Go ahead and pee.

257
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,510
Relieve yourself.

258
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,140
Why are you staring at me?

259
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,476
You want a piece of me?
Is that what you want?

260
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,270
I don't get it.

261
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,482
-Scared?
-What's up with him?

262
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,858
What's his problem?

263
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,443
Sir, they're smoking in the men's room.

264
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,278
Toss them.

265
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,656
Hey, it wasn't about Jin-ung.

266
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:31,741
Then what was it?

267
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,326
I was smiling at a dog.

268
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,744
Jin-ung's dog, Bok-i.

269
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,996
-A dog?
-Yeah.

270
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,457
-This dog?
-Yeah.

271
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,750
Jin-ung has a dog?

272
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,295
I thought Jin-ung was the dog.

273
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,798
She's always with him.
She must be his Guardian Spirit.

274
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,925
She's small but brave. She's really cute.

275
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,096
Oh, a Guardian Spirit? I thought you…

276
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,473
Bok-i's sweet and won't harm Gyeon-U.

277
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,058
But that's actually really hard.

278
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,560
Ordinary ghosts

279
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:02,230
get the urge to pick on and bother Gyeon-U
as soon as they see him.

280
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,524
Only those who had good discipline in life

281
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,402
or naturally sweet-tempered ones
can stay away from him.

282
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,238
Bok-i's like that.
She only cares about her owner.

283
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,490
That's fascinating.

284
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,452
Jin-ung may look harmful,

285
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,036
but to a shaman, he's okay.

286
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,747
The really dangerous person…

287
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,583
is Do-yeon.

288
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,335
-Ku Do-yeon?
-Yeah.

289
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,671
The Baby Ghost that's stuck to Do-yeon
is hard to deal with.

290
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,798
Do-yeon's haunted?

291
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,926
Quiet. She's a dangerous case,
so I took some precautions.

292
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,179
Didn't you feel anything weird?

293
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,098
You could feel suffocated
or get a headache around her.

294
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,475
I can't breathe.

295
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,019
My head hurts.

296
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,855
I feel nauseous.

297
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,822
I never noticed
because she was never nice anyway.

298
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,034
-But I feel just fine around her.
-I knew it.

299
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,913
I've always thought you have
a really strong qi.

300
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,748
-Is that good?
-Really good.

301
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,920
I wish Gyeon-U's qi were
half as tough as yours.

302
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,172
No, even a quarter would be nice.

303
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,427
Not Gyeon-U again.
It's always about Gyeon-U.

304
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,143
I can't help it. I'm just a girl in love.

305
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,146
They say love makes you look prettier.
What do you think?

306
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,064
Do I look pretty?

307
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,233
Well?

308
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,572
Can you be any more clueless?

309
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,951
I'm not pretty?

310
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,494
Gyeon-U's prettier, okay?

311
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,831
You're right.

312
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,542
I like Gyeon-U.

313
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,672
I miss him. I wonder what he's doing now.

314
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,341
I like Gyeon-U.

315
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,018
What should we do? They're unconscious.

316
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,229
They're both at death's door.

317
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,107
We must do a rite as soon as possible.

318
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,359
You said last time that it wouldn't work.

319
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,404
It won't work now either.

320
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,283
Remember the blind shaman?

321
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,202
She's bringing
some powerful shamans together.

322
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,413
I'll perform a cleansing rite
until they get here.

323
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:24,831
What?

324
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,834
I'm just trying to do whatever I can

325
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,752
before the young men die.

326
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,464
It'll be harder to deal with the spirit
if it takes more lives.

327
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,426
Oh, you're amazing.

328
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,719
Let go. Stop being clingy.

329
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,725
I warned them, but these damned idiots
still went in there.

330
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,605
INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY,
DO NOT ENTER

331
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,693
-Slowly.
-To the right.

332
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,028
Let's gather the leaves.

333
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,823
I thought their cleaning duty was done.

334
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,284
Why are they still at it?

335
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,244
No idea.

336
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,538
SPIRIT-MOTHER

337
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,418
Yes, hello?

338
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,212
Okay, got it.

339
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,213
Bye.

340
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:17,967
Sorry.

341
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,928
I have to dash to my part-time job.

342
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,095
-I'll walk you.
-I'll walk you.

343
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,015
No, I'd rather go on my own.

344
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,017
-Would you?
-Yeah.

345
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,688
Oh, right. One last touch
as the Human Amulet.

346
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,068
Gyeon-U. I'll see you tomorrow.

347
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,071
And you too.

348
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,280
Bye.

349
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,299
Let's bring in the two guys' souls
before the cleansing rite.

350
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,510
Yes, Mother.

351
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,844
A RITE FOR BRINGING IN WANDERING SOULS

352
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,100
-Let's go.
-Okay.

353
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,906
Gyeon-U. I'll see you tomorrow.

354
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,969
Hello, Newly-dead.

355
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,971
NEWLY-DEAD: NEWLY DECEASED SOUL

356
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,557
What are you doing here?

357
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,645
I'm here to see you.

358
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,654
How much longer

359
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,199
must I protect your family from you?

360
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,552
It's an amulet

361
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,179
that wards off evil.

362
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,181
It's familiar, isn't it?

363
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,392
You could've drawn it on my face only.

364
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,354
Why did you draw on Grandma's face too?

365
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,648
In case she doesn't cross over.

366
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,776
She was with you for such a long time.

367
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,949
Your father's quite worried

368
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,576
that you'll show up.

369
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,381
Close your eyes.

370
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,896
Here. Let's stay moisturized.

371
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,064
Is her part-time job very tiring?

372
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,107
Looks that way, right?

373
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,749
Existentialists can be
divided into two groups.

374
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:42,959
One is…

375
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,419
Seong-A, are you dead and gone?

376
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:46,963
Okay, sure.

377
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:47,922
I see.

378
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,592
Some existentialists believe in gods,

379
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,678
while others believe gods don't exist.

380
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,887
What's important is…

381
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,517
Jin-ung is practically forcing us
to eat ramyeon every day.

382
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,726
I want a proper meal.

383
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,604
I want a proper meal too.

384
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,481
U-TUBER FOUND UNCONSCIOUS

385
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,694
Isn't this our neighborhood?

386
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,862
What is it?

387
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,156
"These guys were found unconscious

388
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,742
at an abandoned house in Bongsu-dong
yesterday and made the news."

389
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,787
"They must be dead by now. Rest in peace."

390
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,664
I think it is our neighborhood.

391
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,416
Let's watch this. It looks fun.

392
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,167
-I don't want to.
-Let's watch together.

393
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,712
-Let's watch. It looks really--
-I said I don't want to!

394
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:28,671
Hey!

395
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,382
It's not about Water Ghosts. Let's watch.

396
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,633
No!

397
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,676
Coward.

398
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,264
Guys. Gonjiam has nothing

399
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,933
-on this abandoned house.
-Let's skip the boring intro.

400
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,393
Guys, this is insane.

401
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,312
Real shamans are here! Hey, give me that.

402
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,272
-Shaman? Why?
-Stop fooling around and go home.

403
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,857
That's for me to decide.

404
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,900
I heard there's a real evil spirit here.

405
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,277
Are you here to take care of it?

406
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,570
Hi, guys.

407
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,282
I have a sword.

408
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,244
This is real.

409
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,501
Seong-A, here's something incredible.

410
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,503
Wake up. You'll regret not watching this.

411
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,048
Come on. Quick!

412
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:12,965
What is it?

413
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:14,884
-This is about--
-This is real.

414
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,295
You…

415
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,464
Are you a shaman?

416
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,931
Why so serious?

417
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,808
What? It's nothing.

418
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,811
It's not nothing.

419
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,940
Maybe we should've woken her for lunch.

420
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,233
What?

421
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,735
Seong-A. Japchae was on the menu today.

422
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,368
Say it just once.

423
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:26,831
I can't.

424
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,043
Is it that hard to say?

425
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,711
"I have a sword."

426
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,505
"This is real."

427
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,215
Is that hard?

428
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,718
Well, it's…

429
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,763
It's not hard to say, but it's…

430
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,060
You try to laugh your way
out of everything.

431
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,311
If you keep this up,

432
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,022
I have no choice but to suspect
you're the shaman in the video.

433
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,315
You look just like her.

434
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,693
Am I wrong? Look.

435
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,653
-Don't they look alike?
-They do.

436
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,281
Hey, check out trending video
number eight. It looks just like her.

437
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,449
What are you doing?

438
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,367
Hey, do you want to watch it too?

439
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,452
Come over here.

440
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,745
Doesn't this shaman look like Seong-A?

441
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:10,291
U-Tubers had an incident
in an abandoned house nearby,

442
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,501
and two shamans who were there
got caught on camera.

443
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,045
One of them looks so much like

444
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,174
Seong-A here.

445
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,426
This person?

446
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,178
You can barely see her face.

447
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,762
It's really her.

448
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,765
Come on, I'm not that shaman.

449
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,436
So let's confirm

450
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,105
if you're her or not.

451
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,398
Here. Take this cutter.

452
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,531
Repeat after me.

453
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:44,825
"I have a sword."

454
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,629
I…

455
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,924
-have--
-Don't do it.

456
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,926
What? Why not?

457
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,803
Park Seong-A. Are you a shaman?

458
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:05,846
What?

459
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,389
No.

460
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,308
Then why are you doing as he says?

461
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,268
Maeng Ju-seung.
Do you know what a shaman is?

462
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:12,269
What?

463
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:13,979
Do you know
what you're running your mouth about?

464
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,398
-Hey, stop it.
-Answer me.

465
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,733
-What's wrong?
-Hey.

466
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,818
It would be nicer to ask
if she killed someone.

467
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,490
Murderers

468
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,368
get punished at least.

469
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,459
What's wrong with him?

470
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,338
Why is he so angry?

471
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,215
Are you okay?

472
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,635
Why did he get so worked up?

473
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:45,594
Hey, wait.

474
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,222
Let's talk.

475
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,849
You can't vent your anger like that.
You could've talked nicely.

476
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:51,767
"Nicely"?

477
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,019
How can I be nice
when the victim's standing there smiling?

478
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,856
I'm sorry.

479
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,276
I'll stand up for myself next time.

480
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,070
Apologize to yourself, not to me.

481
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,781
You just smile
when you're called a pick-me or a shaman.

482
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,783
You apologize first
when you did nothing wrong.

483
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,410
Shouldn't you feel bad for yourself?

484
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:11,495
Or are you

485
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,289
actually a shaman?

486
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,041
No.

487
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,878
Hey, why would she be a shaman?

488
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,715
Then why do you keep smiling?

489
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,801
Why do you do whatever they say

490
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,261
like they have something on you?

491
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:28,929
That's because…

492
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,935
I am a shaman!

493
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,606
-I really am a shaman.
-What?

494
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,027
I'm doing more than ten people's work

495
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,571
to keep you alive for 21 days.

496
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,615
I chased away a Water Ghost
and a Fire Ghost,

497
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,618
made myself into a Human Amulet,
and put Do-yeon's Baby Ghost to sleep.

498
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,786
I don't want to deceive you either.

499
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,789
What do I want to do with you?
Nothing but love.

500
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:58,375
Why are you so mean to me
when you don't know anything?

501
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,294
Hey, Bae Gyeon-U.

502
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,630
Say just one more thing,

503
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,882
and I will shut your mouth

504
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,550
with my lips.

505
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,059
I can't say that.

506
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,105
Forget it. Let's drop it.

507
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,363
Still,

508
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,785
it's shamans he hates, not me, right?

509
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,497
You're a pushover. Don't you hate him?

510
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,416
No.

511
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,252
I don't hate him.

512
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,881
I hate him a bit, though.

513
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,052
Gyeon-U.

514
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,137
Let's talk.

515
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,138
About what?

516
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,265
I don't know.
I need to start talking to know.

517
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,560
-Are you here to shoot?
-No.

518
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,062
Okay.

519
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:02,314
We are.

520
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,401
-What?
-Let's shoot some arrows.

521
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,319
-Hey, you…
-Will you?

522
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,123
It's heavier than it looks.

523
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:27,631
Put down the bow and stand
with your feet at shoulder width.

524
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,426
That's the square stance.

525
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:31,510
-Like this?
-Yeah.

526
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,804
Positioning must come first.

527
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,432
Before you look at the target,
check your current location.

528
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,891
See if the wind's strong or gentle.

529
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,018
If it's a good or bad spot.

530
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,855
You can't tell just by looking.
You must stand to know.

531
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,232
Okay. I'll feel it with my body.

532
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,004
This is a bad spot. Let's swap.

533
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,643
Is the bow defective?

534
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:23,687
You wanted to talk.

535
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,773
We'll get to that when I'm done.

536
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:40,412
Seong-A smiles like that
because I taught her to.

537
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,214
It was about a week after
we'd first started school.

538
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,007
I noticed this girl who couldn't eat

539
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,509
because she couldn't find a seat.

540
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,102
Smile.

541
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:09,483
Excuse me?

542
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,194
I'm in 10th grade, like you.

543
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,987
It helps to smile when you're intimidated.

544
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,366
Smiling makes you look relaxed, like me.

545
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:19,785
Okay.

546
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,373
Shouldn't you thank me?
I just told you a life hack.

547
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,376
Thanks.

548
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,336
What about the smile?

549
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,761
I said she just had to keep her cool.

550
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,348
That if she fakes confidence,
she'll actually be confident one day.

551
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,353
So don't be so harsh on her.

552
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,730
It's my fault, if you think about it.

553
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,652
That's what you wanted to tell me?

554
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,739
I have a crush on Seong-A.

555
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:01,034
If I grow to like her more,
I might play dirty.

556
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,830
I won't tell you things like this then.

557
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:07,916
You see,

558
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,587
I plan on cherishing the ones dear to me.

559
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,891
See? I said you had it in you.

560
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,393
-That was quite far.
-But he did it.

561
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,477
That's nothing.

562
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,022
This is his first try.
Come on, Gyeong-min.

563
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:34,776
SOJI: WHITE PAPER BURNED
TO CLEANSE THE IMPURITIES

564
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,281
Do you know what a shaman is?

565
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,700
It would be nicer to ask
if she killed someone.

566
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,993
Murderers

567
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,661
get punished at least.

568
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,121
Are you actually a shaman?

569
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,664
Then why do you keep smiling

570
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:48,874
like they have something on you?

571
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,563
-Gosh, that's hot.
-Oh, hot.

572
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,948
We should be cleansing the impurities
but we're just burning paper.

573
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:22,658
I know.

574
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,578
Our hands get burned,
but the impurities remain.

575
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,748
It's not working. Let's call it a night.

576
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,709
Yes, Mother.

577
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,130
Is something worrying you?

578
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,257
What about you?

579
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,636
I'm the same.

580
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,763
You're worried about your love.

581
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:46,890
Yes.

582
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,977
You know, Mother,

583
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,354
I'm envious of Spider-Man.

584
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,690
At least MJ doesn't hate spiders.

585
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,150
Gyeon-U…

586
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,946
hates shamans.

587
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,366
It's not just him.

588
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,619
Not many people like shamans.

589
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:10,080
Seeing ghosts isn't an enviable talent.

590
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,832
It's a divine punishment and our fate.

591
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,419
It's okay.

592
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,088
It's fine as long as
no one sees you like this.

593
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,841
Spider-Man?

594
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,093
He's only a spider
when he's wearing spandex.

595
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,804
He's usually an ordinary high-school kid.

596
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,933
What if,

597
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,144
and this is a big if.

598
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,646
What if I get caught?

599
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,605
Well,

600
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,150
worry about it when it happens.

601
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,576
Mother, shall I buy some Hanji paper?

602
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,703
-To burn more Soji tomorrow.
-Yes.

603
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,756
-Let's buy it tomorrow.
-Why?

604
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,716
Gyeon-U. He's behind us.

605
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,553
He is. Let's walk on.

606
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,183
Excuse me.

607
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,684
-What do we do?
-Excuse me.

608
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,019
-Don't talk. Run.
-Wait.

609
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,979
-Run.
-Aren't you the shamans in the video?

610
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,647
Just a moment. Wait.

611
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:21,359
Why ignore me when you heard me?

612
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,154
You, the mask on your face.

613
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,698
Can you take it off for a moment?

614
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,703
Who do you think you are?

615
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,998
You think you can boss
my spirit-daughter around?

616
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,542
Excuse me.

617
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,962
My friend was put in a tight spot
at school today

618
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,464
because people thought she was you.

619
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:47,094
I'm sorry, but can I take a photo of you?
I want them to stop suspecting her.

620
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,682
Please.

621
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,521
Okay.

622
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,773
-Thank you.
-"Okay"?

623
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,775
You'll take that off in front of him?

624
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,279
It's not okay.

625
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,365
I can't do it.

626
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,117
You heard her.

627
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,411
She can't show her face. Go away.

628
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,955
But she just said "okay."

629
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,790
That was a slip of the tongue.

630
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,041
Also,

631
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,710
your friend's problem
has nothing to do with my spirit-daughter.

632
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:21,837
That's her problem.

633
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,256
If you have time for this,
go tend to that friend.

634
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,467
How dare you ask for a photo?

635
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:28,927
Is she your friend?

636
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,850
You're very right.

637
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,228
But my friend's trouble

638
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,230
wasn't because of anything she did.

639
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,523
It was entirely on me.

640
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:46,319
I'll go and apologize to my friend, then.

641
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,696
Sorry.

642
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:54,911
Seong-A, sorry to text so late.

643
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,707
Can we meet up for a bit?

644
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,917
I have something to say.

645
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,670
No. I want to apologize.

646
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,302
What are you looking at?

647
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,387
Eyes on the ground!

648
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,306
I should just…

649
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,029
Oh, no.

650
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,199
Oh, no.

651
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,330
I was afraid he'd find out, so I ended up…

652
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,499
Did you text him back?

653
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,253
How could I?

654
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:48,381
I told him, "Eyes on the ground."

655
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,261
Seong-A.

656
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:55,972
How's that?

657
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,141
Is it pretty?

658
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,685
Yes.

659
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,104
It's pretty.

660
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,369
It's pretty.

661
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,623
Why are we buying clothes out of the blue?

662
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,420
Think about it.

663
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,507
Spider-Man's only that
when he's wearing spandex.

664
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,342
Am I wrong?

665
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,472
Go on. Run to him.

666
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,310
I love you, Mother.

667
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,647
See you later.

668
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:14,718
Gyeon-U. Where are you?

669
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,471
I'm at Yuwol Park.

670
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:19,639
Where are you?

671
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,975
I'll be right there.

672
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:40,535
I found you.

673
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,120
Gyeon-U.

674
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:43,705
Seong-A.

675
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,625
I'm sorry. I was too mean earlier.

676
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:51,421
No, I'm sorry. I texted back too late.

677
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,131
No, it's all right.

678
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,508
That's nothing.

679
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,553
Right.

680
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,430
We're here, so it's fine.

681
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,766
Nothing else matters now, right?

682
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,658
The power's out.

683
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,420
It's dark.

684
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:33,922
Yeah.

685
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:38,593
Was it a long run?

686
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,263
Yeah.

687
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,226
We're lucky that it's a cool day.

688
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:49,020
Not too hot, not too cold.

689
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,068
Yeah.

690
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,699
But a power outage

691
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:04,661
isn't too bad every now and then.

692
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,415
It's nice and quiet.

693
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,755
No, is it spooky?

694
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,468
Darkness belongs to yin's domain.

695
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,764
The yin energy attracts ghosts.

696
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,770
I was scared of blackouts as a kid.

697
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,607
Why? Because it was dark?

698
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,234
Yeah.

699
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,111
I hated the dark.

700
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:40,905
I got so scared at night
that I slept with the lights on.

701
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,117
Do you know

702
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,661
that you feel calmer
when your hands are warm?

703
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,127
When I first met my mother,

704
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,421
she held my hand like this and said…

705
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,926
I may not be able to summon the morning,

706
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,554
but I can stay with you
like this until then.

707
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,266
Are you still afraid, child?

708
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,936
That's when I realized

709
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,356
how powerful a person's warmth is.

710
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,234
So?

711
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,445
It's not so spooky, is it?

712
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:33,708
To be honest,

713
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,127
I don't like it when you force a smile.

714
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,589
It reminds me of what I used to be like.

715
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,425
I kind of know what goes through your mind

716
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,427
when you smile like that.

717
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,413
Bad people

718
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,666
treat you worse if you smile.

719
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:17,418
They keep at it until you cry.

720
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:24,842
But you and I are two different people.

721
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,722
I projected myself onto you

722
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,474
and got angry.

723
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,185
I'm really sorry.

724
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,655
Don't think about the past now.

725
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,532
From now on,

726
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,034
nothing bad will ever happen.

727
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,203
Because I'll ward it all off.

728
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,540
I'm really warm.

729
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,050
Hi. Good morning.

730
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,304
Let's cycle to school today.

731
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,347
I don't have a bike.

732
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,349
I have lots.

733
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:59,896
Ta-da.

734
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,098
Hello!

735
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,182
Hi.

736
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:33,740
-Let's go.
-Okay.

737
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,138
Hurry, Gyeon-U.

738
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,098
My gosh.

739
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,976
What's he doing instead of archery?

740
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,479
Romance is in the air, I see.

741
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,860
What a freaky dream.

742
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,404
It's not a dream.

743
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,572
It's not a dream?

744
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:22,622
SERVING THE EAST SEA DRAGON KING,
FLOWER MASTER

745
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,582
So this wasn't
about the Heaven and Earth Fairy?

746
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,627
Every shaman knows what Yeomhwa is up to.

747
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,505
You didn't have to come
all the way to Yangyang.

748
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,298
You could ask any random shaman.

749
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:34,300
So, what is she up to?

750
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,928
You know, she does a lot of no good.

751
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,888
What kind of no good?

752
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,182
She seems to do anything for money.

753
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,892
Why? Shall I ask her the specifics?

754
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,938
No, that's not necessary.

755
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:51,567
Hello? Yeomhwa?

756
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:52,860
Hey, Yeomhwa.

757
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,951
Tell her it's none of her business.

758
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,036
Hang up. I'm busy.

759
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,226
TO BLOCK

760
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,437
Shall we bike home from now on?

761
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,106
Riding home is a bit--

762
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,149
Yeah, twice a day is too much.

763
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,067
You're right.

764
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,319
No, it's not that.
I finish archery practice really late.

765
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:36,237
Archery?

766
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,782
Have you decided to go back into archery?

767
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,959
Let's chat after school.

768
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:54,755
Come to the storage.

769
00:52:58,217 --> 00:52:59,135
See you.

770
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:00,761
See you.

771
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:03,472
You want a smoke too?

772
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,475
-Scared?
-What's up with him?

773
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,021
Sir, they're smoking in the men's room.

774
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:15,735
What's that about?

775
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,486
It's a long story.

776
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,363
I'll tell our homeroom teacher.

777
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:21,449
No. It's fine.

778
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,785
Are you sure you'll be okay?

779
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,454
Yes.

780
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,254
Because I won't be there.

781
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,677
Should we kill him?

782
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,600
Is he going to stay on?

783
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,101
Why does he keep coming?

784
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:50,686
-He even has a locker--
-Be quiet.

785
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,147
He's still in the middle of breaking up.

786
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:58,486
What a Casanova.

787
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,781
You're seeing another girl
before you break up with her?

788
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,449
Are you that disloyal?

789
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,201
Don't you feel bad for archery?

790
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:06,619
I don't.

791
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,663
Such a jerk.

792
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,581
Because I won't quit.

793
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,250
Archery, I mean.

794
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,969
Why's Mother so busy

795
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:25,304
when we have
such an important rite coming up?

796
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,849
She expects me to set up everything alone?

797
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:34,939
Come on, let's go.

798
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,065
Keep going.

799
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,527
Ghosts that appear in nightmares.

800
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:42,613
Murderer Ghosts so terrifying
even spirits would run away.

801
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,281
Hideous, bizarre, and freakish ghosts.

802
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,575
Cursed ghosts of those that buried
human remains in secret.

803
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,202
Ghosts of male and female shamans.

804
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,413
Ghosts that followed funeral visitors.

805
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:51,789
Ghosts that rob people's wealth…

806
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,844
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

807
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:18,941
What's this?

808
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:28,367
Hello.

809
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:31,829
Hello.

810
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:34,290
Who are you?

811
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,294
Did you complete the cleansing rite?

812
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:41,130
Not yet, but we're almost there.

813
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:42,590
Who are you again?

814
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,013
Are you a shaman Great Aunt called?

815
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,017
I see.

816
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,103
Are you here alone?
Mother said a group would come.

817
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,523
Well, I got here a bit early.

818
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:01,776
I see.

819
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,571
What?

820
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,616
You were inside.

821
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,327
Did you manage to reason with the spirit?

822
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,578
I'd like to see too.

823
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,081
You can't yet.

824
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:15,998
Anyway,

825
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,960
let me see how well-prepared you are.

826
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,839
Why did you change your mind?

827
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:25,257
You didn't even tell me.

828
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:26,383
Because…

829
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:28,552
I like it.

830
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,888
You fool…

831
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,350
For real?

832
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,435
Yes, you're this good at push and pull.

833
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:38,896
If you're not a born archer,
I don't know who is.

834
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,439
Kids, the hazing ritual. Go.

835
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:42,108
-Okay.
-Go what?

836
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:43,859
Our team has a hazing ritual

837
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:46,278
-that every new recruit has to go through.
-Don't fight it.

838
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:48,989
You know the abandoned house
that's supposedly haunted, right?

839
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,783
Go there and get back in an hour.

840
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,202
If you're late, you must run 50 laps.

841
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,370
Are you ready, rookie?

842
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:55,955
-But I--
-Ready, set,

843
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,081
go.

844
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,918
You have an hour. Four, five.

845
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:02,837
Run!

846
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,357
I was wondering how pretty you are.

847
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:27,820
Okay.

848
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:29,738
Please give it back.

849
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,286
If you pull off the dance.

850
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:44,879
This is a dance for two.

851
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,133
I know.

852
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,190
Bad accidents were like fate.

853
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,150
They were always waiting for me.

854
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,527
119

855
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,654
Grandma.

856
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,600
Lucky breaks were like a miracle.

857
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,020
They never happened to me.

858
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:17,072
A girl said she'd be there for me

859
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,867
until darkness gave way to light.

860
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,545
Her hands were so warm

861
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:35,716
that I thought I could be happy for once.

862
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:13,962
But it turned out to be

863
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,048
an impossible dream.

864
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:53,502
You dared dance alone

865
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:56,505
with that notorious Yeomhwa?
It's worse than smoking with an elder.

866
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,257
You are a shaman after all.

867
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,175
-How dare you?
-For just five days starting tomorrow.

868
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:02,010
Stay friends with me
for just five more days.

869
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,471
Of all the things you said to me so far,

870
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,056
how many of them weren't a lie?

871
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,559
I'll be much more unhappy
than you want me to be.

872
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,394
Seeing ghosts

873
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,271
isn't a skill or talent. It's a curse.

874
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,982
I don't know you well,
but I know about shamans.

875
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,068
Can you let me off just this once?

876
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,320
The power of the Human Amulet

877
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:21,780
disappeared completely.
