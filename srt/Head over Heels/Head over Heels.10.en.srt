1
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,239
You're not Gyeon-U. You're Bong-su.

2
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,826
Seong-A, you're scaring me.

3
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:17,703
Bong-su.

4
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,246
What happened to Gyeon-U?

5
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,708
Where is Gyeon-U?

6
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,632
Tell me how I can take over
his body completely.

7
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:31,550
Get him tarnished by blood.

8
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,595
Just draw blood

9
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,263
while around a ghost.

10
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,071
It'll be perfect if it's a Suicide Ghost.

11
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:00,663
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,796
I need Newly-Dead to draw blood.

13
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,008
Seong-A, we should go.

14
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,844
Wait.

15
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:15,886
Hey.

16
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,848
You said you'd protect her.

17
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,724
You can't let her go
to a Suicide Ghost by herself.

18
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,184
-Hey.
-No, don't!

19
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,270
Let go!

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,154
Gyeon-U.

21
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,367
Gyeon-U!

22
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,109
Gyeon-U. Are you okay?

23
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,575
Yeah.

24
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,243
I'm okay.

25
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,663
That's a relief.

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,418
But…

27
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,593
You don't seem well.

28
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,636
What?

29
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,267
Oh, you're right.

30
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,186
You want my bike?

31
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,896
Yeah, just for the day.

32
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,734
Seong-A's not well,
and I want to take her home.

33
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,195
Really? Then I'll take her home.

34
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:57,655
No…

35
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,409
Just a moment, Seong-A.

36
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,745
-Hey!
-Damn it.

37
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,622
Hand it over when I ask nicely.

38
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,249
-Kicking doesn't count as asking nicely.
-Oh, whatever!

39
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,668
Give me the bike!

40
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,086
Stop it, Bong-su.

41
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,588
Gyeon-U, let's keep holding hands.

42
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,718
Ji-ho.

43
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,138
Bong-su's way worse than you think he is.

44
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,475
We don't know what he might do,
so hand it over to me…

45
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,103
I mean, to him.

46
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,359
Bye.

47
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,029
Right.

48
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,073
I'm a massive pushover.

49
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:54,878
Let's go.

50
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,343
Bong-su.

51
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,013
Where is Gyeon-U?

52
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,140
I…

53
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,394
devoured him.

54
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,881
You said you'd curse me.

55
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,926
You need an item of mine
to do that, remember?

56
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:51,894
An item?

57
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,590
I keep drinking,

58
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,219
so why don't I feel drunk?

59
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,113
My poor friend.

60
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,807
Don't pity me, friend.

61
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,222
What are you doing? Looking for something?

62
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,147
What did you do with the silver ring?

63
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,482
Did you return it to the owner?

64
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,944
Why do you even care? It's not even yours.

65
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,826
How does it feel

66
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,162
to have full control
over Newly-Dead's body?

67
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,498
Not so loud. She's asleep.

68
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,294
Are you going somewhere?
Why are you dressed up?

69
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,755
I'll be back soon.

70
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,382
What does that even mean?

71
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,176
Don't come back.

72
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,469
Don't.

73
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,025
What is she plotting this time?

74
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,569
I wonder.

75
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,839
Will you just let her be?

76
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,927
For now.

77
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,721
I must know where she's flying to

78
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,556
before setting a trap.

79
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,104
This Maetoe belonged
to Mount Gokma's Shaman Park.

80
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,565
Why do you want to smash
a haunted object so urgently?

81
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,234
That was really hard to get.

82
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,611
You know how the rich
are always short on time.

83
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,830
Let me see. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight…

84
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,874
Thank you so much.

85
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,043
Do you need anything else, madam?

86
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,504
No. Good job.

87
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,756
I see you reconciled with Dongcheon.

88
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,216
That's hers.

89
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,927
You bought it for her here ten years ago.

90
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,804
Mom.

91
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,723
This is just for you.

92
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,974
Right?

93
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,143
Butterflies suit you better.

94
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,561
Let's have a look.

95
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,605
You look so pretty, Mom.

96
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,485
You two were so adorable then.

97
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,783
Oh, my goodness. What's this?

98
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,245
Why put a goblin's face
in a field of butterflies?

99
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,830
Dongcheon did this, didn't she?

100
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,458
My goodness…

101
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,043
She really doesn't know fashion.

102
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,338
The goblin's face
is said to ward off evil.

103
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,174
There must've been a ghost
she wanted to ward off.

104
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,095
Probably…

105
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,058
a Butterfly Ghost.

106
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,191
I know I did wrong.

107
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,026
But I don't want to give it back.

108
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,028
Who told me how to take it?

109
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,906
Yeomhwa did.
It's obvious what she's up to.

110
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,492
She wants to kill Gyeon-U
and turn me into an evil deity.

111
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,661
But to do that,

112
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,705
she needed me to claim Gyeon-U's body.

113
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,499
So she told me right away.

114
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,918
But that's all there is, okay?

115
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,545
I really am not in league with her.

116
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,798
I want to live as a human.

117
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,466
Oh, what should we do about Yeomhwa?

118
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,550
We'll stop her.

119
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,761
I've stopped her once already.

120
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,514
I was actually tied to an object,
not the abandoned house.

121
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,183
As soon as she heard
I'd taken over this body,

122
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,685
she came to ask me where the object was.

123
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,814
I didn't tell her.
Then she just changed the topic.

124
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,191
I did use a pretty scary tone.

125
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,610
When I want to scare someone,
I'm do it properly.

126
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,240
I don't want to be an evil deity.
Do you now get where I stand?

127
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,954
Say something, you old shaman.

128
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,797
A haunted object.

129
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,259
She was looking for that?

130
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,595
Yeomhwa

131
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,682
is looking for an object
that was haunted by Bong-su.

132
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,351
She plans to smash it

133
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,020
and summon the Grim Reaper.

134
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,108
Since Bong-su is refusing
to leave Gyeon-U's body,

135
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,486
she's trying to force Gyeon-U
to the other side.

136
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,947
What should we do, then?

137
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,033
We must protect Bong-su.

138
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,620
What about Gyeon-U?

139
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,080
If the Grim Reaper gets him,

140
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,040
Gyeon-U will be gone forever.

141
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,835
Protecting Bong-su is the way
to protect Gyeon-U.

142
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,882
Is there any other way?
Is there anything else we can do?

143
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,137
He said he wanted to live as a human…

144
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,141
and stay by your side.

145
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,934
That's why he took Gyeon-U's body.

146
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,687
To me, it sounded like

147
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,482
he wants to be loved.

148
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,904
Try to really understand his cry for love.

149
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,655
Don't just hate him blindly.

150
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,746
My dear daughter.
What is it that we shamans do?

151
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,171
We console spirits.

152
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,798
That's right.

153
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,427
Rites and amulets are a means.

154
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,304
What's really important is in the heart.

155
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,099
If you console a wounded heart,

156
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,102
the rest will fall into place
as meant to be.

157
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,647
But still,

158
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,775
that will take so long.

159
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,079
But that's the right path to follow.

160
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,106
Hey.

161
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,860
How is that thing going?
I mean, finding a name.

162
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,238
Did you find it?

163
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,657
Why do you suddenly care?

164
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,118
Did the old shaman say something?

165
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:32,872
She just told me

166
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,666
to be kind to you.

167
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,502
She said you should survive
for Gyeon-U to live.

168
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,134
So you'll be kind to me?

169
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,595
Yeah.

170
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,183
How, exactly?

171
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,854
How will you be kind to me?

172
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,527
I won't make you feel lonely.

173
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,282
Loneliness can turn anyone into a ghost.

174
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,588
Gyeon-U, I'll get things back to normal.

175
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,341
Until then,

176
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,551
please stay safe.

177
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,021
Hello?

178
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,815
Is anyone there?

179
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,236
I don't know where I am,

180
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,280
and there's no path.

181
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,791
Is someone crying?

182
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,718
Hey.

183
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,389
What are you doing? Everyone's watching.

184
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,974
You said you'd be kind to me.

185
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:19,896
Are they dating?

186
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,777
This is amazing.
It's like a sticky rice cake.

187
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,154
You said you'd be kind to me.

188
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,749
The perfect height to rest my chin.

189
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,667
I like it.

190
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,293
Are you two dating?

191
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,964
No, it's one-sided on my part.
It's unrequited love.

192
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,216
What are you even talking about?

193
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,259
Hey.

194
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,304
Is Bong-su rubbing off on you
from being around him all the time?

195
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,682
Get off her.
Why are you acting like Bong-su?

196
00:16:58,727 --> 00:16:59,853
Because I'm Bong-su.

197
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,354
What?

198
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,690
What part did you not get?
I'm Bong-su, punk.

199
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,360
That's not fair.

200
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,279
What about Gyeon-U? What about his life?

201
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,322
Losing all senses to a ghost is very rare.

202
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,575
Consoling Bong-su should be the priority.

203
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,911
I'll start the 100-day prayer today.

204
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,955
It takes that long?

205
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,041
There's no guarantee
that will work either.

206
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,919
If 100 days aren't enough,
I'll pray for another 200 or 300.

207
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,547
I'll pray for and console him
until he moves on.

208
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,301
I can't wait that long.

209
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,096
Hey. Get back inside when I ask nicely.
Bring Gyeon-U back out.

210
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,432
How is this asking nicely
when you're pinning me here?

211
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,767
Cut it out!

212
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,977
Enough fooling around.

213
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,232
Let me off.

214
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,650
We're partners, after all.

215
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:49,986
What?

216
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,154
I like you guys.

217
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,572
I like the shaman.

218
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,824
I want to stay with her.

219
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,663
But when I reach out to hold her,

220
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,415
Gyeon-U comes back.

221
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,501
Let's go home, Seong-A.

222
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,796
I can't help her up when she falls down.

223
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,547
And even when she cries,

224
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,216
I can't wipe away her tears.

225
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,551
That's been…

226
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,804
so painful.

227
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,431
Very.

228
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,153
Should I offer
to pray with her for 100 days?

229
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,696
-Here we go!
-Like that will work.

230
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,448
Okay!

231
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,408
Sa-rang, you're pathetic. You lost.

232
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,702
-You didn't stand a chance.
-I let you win.

233
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,912
-No.
-I let you off.

234
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:41,996
Hey.

235
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,042
Why? What?

236
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,878
-Where's Seong-A?
-What about Seong-A?

237
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,839
I just…

238
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,717
Will you thank her for me

239
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,719
for telling me about Bok-i?

240
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:58,888
Why are you asking me…

241
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,891
Tell her yourself.
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.

242
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,142
I'm depressed.

243
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,644
I'm sad.

244
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,068
Hey! Don't pick on my friend!

245
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,403
What was that?

246
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,196
-That was Ju-seung.
-What?

247
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,115
Are you crazy?

248
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,783
We're friends.

249
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,872
-Where is he?
-Who are you talking about?

250
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,832
That Hwamok High guy from last time.

251
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,749
Hey!

252
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,210
Who's that?

253
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,997
-Isn't that him?
-Come on.

254
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,209
What are you up to?

255
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,380
Can you throw a punch?

256
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,343
Hey.

257
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,637
-Hey, no, wait!
-Don't!

258
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,807
Okay, fine.

259
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,226
-You darn--
-Stop it.

260
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,269
-Grab him!
-My gosh!

261
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,480
Why are you grabbing me? Why stop me?

262
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,816
-Keep him here.
-Let go! Come at me!

263
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,908
Guys.

264
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,576
Why did you stop me earlier?

265
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,078
I can fight.

266
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,288
They can fight too.

267
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,626
Why did you let them beat you up?

268
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,545
Jin-ung can't get into trouble right now.

269
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,130
Why not?

270
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,675
If he gets in trouble,
they'll call his parents.

271
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,635
He can't see his mom at the moment.

272
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,847
Did she threaten to disown him?

273
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,848
Don't.

274
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,225
I must stay away

275
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,311
to protect my mom

276
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,730
from my dad.

277
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:31,582
Let's go.

278
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,126
Let's go home.

279
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,031
-Hey.
-What?

280
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,367
Why are you back so late?

281
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,162
I had lots to do. I was busy.

282
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,582
You look very pretty today, as always.

283
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,918
Don't be silly. Go back to the room.

284
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,755
Wait.

285
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,257
What's this? Is it blood?

286
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,217
Yeah. I got into a fight.

287
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,178
You did what?

288
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:29,515
Hey, you can't fight in Gyeon-U's body.
Don't you know athletes shouldn't fight?

289
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,768
-If you were to get hurt--
-I won't fight.

290
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,354
Shaman, do you know something?

291
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:36,981
Know what?

292
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,192
You are

293
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,070
pretty even when you're angry.

294
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,488
Why you…

295
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:45,823
Hey!

296
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,660
He's so annoying.

297
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,933
Where did he go this time?

298
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,446
He's hard at work early in the morning.

299
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,160
-What's this?
-Were you at archery practice?

300
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,954
Yes, I should train hard.

301
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,289
Archery's everything to Bae Gyeon-U,
and he's damn good at it.

302
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,042
Move. I'm exhausted.

303
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:48,970
Hey.

304
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,054
Give me that.

305
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,683
How dare you help my girlfriend?

306
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,351
-Hey.
-Hang on.

307
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:58,813
Hey.

308
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,650
Why? What?

309
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,653
Just take this.

310
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,448
Hey, I'm serious. It's so tasty.

311
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,908
-This is just…
-What's wrong with him?

312
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,869
Hey, thanks a lot.

313
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,121
He says this is tasty.

314
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,373
He got that excited over a lollipop?

315
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,542
-He's like a kid.
-It's way nicer than yesterday's!

316
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,335
What?

317
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,715
It's so good. So sweet.

318
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,759
You did get beaten up.

319
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,012
What? No way.
I was man enough to let them hit me.

320
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,722
-Like a real man.
-Guys, stop arguing.

321
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,974
Let's arm-wrestle instead.

322
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,475
-Come on.
-Arm-wrestling? Okay.

323
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,728
Hey, partner.
Get over here and be the referee.

324
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,104
What for?

325
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,105
You're the referee.

326
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,857
-We play on three.
-Okay.

327
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,734
One, two, three.

328
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,824
Gyeon-U has changed, hasn't he?

329
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,619
Yeah. He's become pretty charming.

330
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,870
He looks more at ease.

331
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,330
I'd like to be his friend.

332
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,706
Shall we ask him out to coin karaoke?

333
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,709
Why would you make him uncomfortable
when he's just starting to loosen up?

334
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,129
Gyeon-U, do you want to
go to coin karaoke with me?

335
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:06,547
Sure.

336
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,884
What's the occasion, Gyeon-U?

337
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,302
-Great.
-Not you.

338
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,054
-Not me?
-You'll come too?

339
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,347
-I'll…
-Let's just go.

340
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,556
-Later on.
-Why on earth…

341
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,599
Everyone…

342
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,893
seems to prefer

343
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,270
Bong-su over Gyeon-U.

344
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,956
You're wasting your time there. Geez.

345
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,171
The face is the same,
so how are they so different?

346
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,384
Because they're different people.

347
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,056
It's not that I dislike Bong-su.

348
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:02,436
But he does stuff
that Gyeon-U would never do.

349
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,646
It's exhilarating, but…

350
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,774
Oh, dear. He's growing on you.

351
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,569
But…

352
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,281
But…

353
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,452
No one knows that Gyeon-U isn't Gyeon-U.

354
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,789
Only I know that.

355
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,377
What if Gyeon-U fades away?

356
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,089
What if he disappears from the world?

357
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,261
I miss him so much.

358
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,806
You can bring him forth and meet him.

359
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,310
How can I see him when he's not here?

360
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,812
Call on him during the Hour of the Ox.

361
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,772
-What?
-That's the hour of ghosts.

362
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:51,652
The Hour of the Ox.

363
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,536
Gyeon-U.

364
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,706
Gyeon-U. It's time to wake up.

365
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:06,876
Gyeon-U.

366
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,691
Who's there?

367
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,070
Who are you?

368
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,322
Show yourself.

369
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:39,950
Yoon-bo.

370
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:42,578
It's me.

371
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,457
Hey.

372
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,583
Yoon-bo.

373
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,379
Are you okay? You aren't hurt, are you?

374
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,421
Gyeon-U.

375
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,216
Gyeon-U.

376
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,435
Gyeon-U.

377
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,521
Seong-A.

378
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,108
Gyeon-U.

379
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,572
Just now…

380
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,118
I was in a mountain. What happened?

381
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,747
That must have been a memory.

382
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,834
A soul without a body resides in memories.

383
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:36,465
So you want me to befriend the soldiers

384
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,175
and listen to their stories?

385
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,513
It's Bong-su's memory,

386
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,306
so one of them must be Bong-su.

387
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,058
Right?

388
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,269
Yeah. We must find out
why Bong-su couldn't cross over

389
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,104
and became a ghost.

390
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,315
Only then it'll be easier to find a way
to console his soul.

391
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:56,861
I'll give it a go.

392
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,533
The Hour of the Ox is over.

393
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,957
Hang in there.

394
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,083
I'll be back soon.

395
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:16,005
Okay.

396
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,798
I'll be waiting.

397
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,979
Lie down.

398
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:46,827
Hello.

399
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,829
Guys?

400
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,422
Befriending them won't be so easy.

401
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:20,736
The evil spirit
definitely has the silver ring.

402
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,200
How do I get it from him?

403
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,204
You took every one of the amulets I wrote.

404
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,206
Where are you, you witch?
I'll come to you.

405
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,582
What's the evil spirit up to?

406
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,419
Is he all you care about?

407
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,298
He's having the time of his life,
and the others are stressed out.

408
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,592
Heaven and Earth Fairy is having
a breakdown.

409
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,970
She even forgot she could summon a ghost
at the Hour of the Ox.

410
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,974
You reminded her,
so she must've summoned him.

411
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,393
I guess? But why do you ask?

412
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,020
She hung up on me.

413
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:57,648
Yes.

414
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,151
It's the heart

415
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,029
that I must stir.

416
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,378
Gyeon-U!

417
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,590
Come here.

418
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,636
You'll enter the trial
to get on the national team!

419
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,097
Jeez, cut it out.

420
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,308
What? The national team?

421
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,810
You'll compete with our flag
on your chest and all that?

422
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,938
I'm not on the team just yet.

423
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,857
I will be soon, though.

424
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,192
-No way.
-That's awesome.

425
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,236
Can I get your autograph in advance?

426
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,405
-Sure, give it here.
-No, me first.

427
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,990
Sign your name right here.

428
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,533
I'm ticklish.

429
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,535
You're so cool.

430
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:52,870
You have a weird autograph.

431
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,915
Hey, that looks cool.

432
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,000
-Hey.
-Hey.

433
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,169
-Just a moment. Hang on.
-Where are you going?

434
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,004
THOSE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES WILL TRIUMPH

435
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:02,921
Hey.

436
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,798
What?

437
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,967
Grant me a wish
if I make the national team.

438
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,177
A wish?

439
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:09,970
What's your wish?

440
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,142
What?

441
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,477
You and me.

442
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,522
You're really testing my patience here.

443
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,859
What? Where are you going?

444
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,780
I didn't say we should do it now.
I just told you what my wish was.

445
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,156
I can't even say it?

446
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:32,076
No, you can't.
Don't bring it up ever again.

447
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,911
That's utter nonsense.

448
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,038
What do you mean?

449
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,540
I want to have my first kiss.
And I want to do it with you.

450
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,377
That's the one thing
I desperately wish for.

451
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,046
What's so nonsensical
about saying what I want?

452
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:51,220
I want to have my first kiss with Seong-A!

453
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,523
Have you lost your mind?

454
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,029
What's the issue?
Do you want to kiss the shaman too?

455
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,365
Of course you do. Sorry for asking.

456
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,574
Do you have a death wish?

457
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,618
Too bad.

458
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,204
I'm hard to kill.

459
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,872
Getting revived is my specialty.

460
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,045
Here's what I think.

461
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,341
If I keep on trying,

462
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,428
she might care about me a little,
don't you think?

463
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,143
I do have Gyeon-U's face
and body, don't I?

464
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:49,570
FATHER

465
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:50,988
Hey, Gyeon-U.

466
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,490
Your father keeps calling.

467
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,575
My father?

468
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,368
Gyeon-U doesn't have a father.

469
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,479
I've seen her before.

470
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,618
She's that deadly scary shaman
who only has feeble powers.

471
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,454
You used Gyeon-U's family?

472
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,538
How crafty.

473
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,792
Right back at you.

474
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,877
You have the silver ring.

475
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,797
Didn't you become a ghost

476
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,049
because you didn't get to
return it to its owner?

477
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,843
You said you'd return it
as soon as you possessed a body.

478
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,261
Why do you still have it?

479
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,389
I've been a bit busy.

480
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:02,476
I have to get on the national team.

481
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,320
You must be having a great time
pretending to be human.

482
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,197
Yes, I am. It's fun.

483
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:16,990
I plan on doing this for life.

484
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,371
You're close to becoming an evil deity,
so you're too strong.

485
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,665
You're unruly

486
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,625
and hard to control.

487
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,380
So I gave the matter some thought.

488
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,966
"It's this hard for me,

489
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,927
so it must be tormenting
for Heaven and Earth Fairy."

490
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,189
Do you know that Newly-Dead can surface
during the Hour of the Ox?

491
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:54,987
The Hour of the Ox?

492
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,948
Who surfaces then?

493
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,910
Bae Gyeon-U can do that?

494
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,705
I knew it.

495
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:06,874
You had no idea.

496
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,004
Now that he's the ghost,
the Hour of the Ox is his time.

497
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,798
Even I wouldn't tell you that.

498
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,217
You're an evil spirit
who stole another's body.

499
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,136
You could turn at any moment.

500
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,222
So you want to be human?

501
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,057
But why?

502
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,018
It's not like anyone would

503
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,812
love you if you became human.

504
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,275
How frightening would it be

505
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,111
to have something that isn't human

506
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,822
keep on pretending to be one by her side?

507
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,148
It's me.

508
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,900
Make me an amulet.

509
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,944
You're so weak
you can't make an amulet yourself,

510
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,446
so why do you keep plotting things?

511
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:21,657
Hey.

512
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:24,284
Slow down a little, will you?

513
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,455
Sure, I get that.

514
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,499
Nothing is more important
to a mom than her child.

515
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,668
What?

516
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,002
You want me to hurry up?

517
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,714
Okay.

518
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,929
I don't usually make Ghoul-Making Amulets.

519
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,135
What are you doing here?

520
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:30,851
It's…

521
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,310
It's nothing.

522
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,190
Let's go.

523
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,653
You're welcome at any time.

524
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,363
I'll be waiting at the shack.

525
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:44,823
Who are you?

526
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,701
You must have no other friends

527
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,120
if you're hanging out with him.

528
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,335
Dang, that was scary.

529
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,378
Who is she?

530
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,756
She's no one important.

531
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,550
Hey, wait up.

532
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,893
Don't you want to know
how Heaven and Earth Fairy really feels?

533
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,604
See for yourself.

534
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,092
Gyeon-U.

535
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,303
Gyeon-U, it's time to wake up.

536
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:50,972
Gyeon-U.

537
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:56,978
Gyeon-U.

538
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,174
What's wrong?

539
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,553
Why do you look so sad?

540
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:31,847
Your eyes are full of sorrow.

541
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,521
I can't say.

542
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,607
I guess I missed you a lot.

543
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,279
So did I.

544
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,657
I missed you so much too.

545
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,787
How is it over there? Is it okay?

546
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,540
Did you get to get closer to the soldiers?

547
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,750
Do you know which of them is Bong-su?

548
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,345
What's the matter?

549
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,015
You guys aren't close yet?

550
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,437
That's okay.

551
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,065
Still, I hope you get close to them soon

552
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,776
so we can find a way
to help Bong-su cross over.

553
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,617
Once we send Bong-su off,

554
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,994
you can come back to where you belong.

555
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,416
Shaman.

556
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,345
Shaman.

557
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,151
Shaman.

558
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:13,949
Bong-su.

559
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,020
What's up with them?

560
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,862
Attention. Bow to the teacher.

561
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,781
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

562
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:58,201
You only cheer up when the day is over.

563
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,121
Who wants to go to the Internet café?

564
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:03,456
-We should go.
-Internet café, anyone?

565
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,836
-Pack up, quick.
-You too.

566
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,054
What's going on?

567
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,055
What's up?

568
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,890
-He dragged her out.
-What's going on?

569
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,770
Can't the school just ban dating?

570
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,356
I can't breathe. It's suffocating.

571
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,357
You'll hurt her hand.

572
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,445
We're here. I was about to let go.

573
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,905
Why are we here?

574
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:41,328
YOUNG SOULS OF HWAMOK!
REST IN PEACE

575
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,955
The name I was looking for is right here.

576
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,250
Out of the two student soldiers,

577
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,210
I was the tall one.

578
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:50,879
And the short kid

579
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,506
was Jang Yoon-bo.

580
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,592
When Yoon-bo died,

581
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,510
he asked me to send home

582
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,846
the silver ring his mom had given him.

583
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,434
But I died before I could do that,
and that regret has plagued me.

584
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,021
That's why I became a ghost.

585
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,654
JANG YOON-BO

586
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,558
Now that I've done this,

587
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,853
it should help me overcome my regret.

588
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,688
Bong-su.

589
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,732
My regret is resolved,
so I'm done being Bong-su.

590
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,193
I'll live as Bae Gyeon-U.

591
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,656
Then what about the real Gyeon-U?

592
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,075
Bae Gyeon-U?

593
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,871
He's already a ghost
who can only appear at the Hour of the Ox.

594
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,916
Let's go home now.

595
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,877
No, wait.

596
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,088
-Hey.
-You're hurting her!

597
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,222
I'm hurting too.

598
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,395
I…

599
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,230
I'm hurting just the same.

600
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:46,578
Hello.

601
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,079
Where's the amulet?

602
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,914
You're too impatient.

603
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,083
Dear friend, do you even stop to breathe?

604
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,920
Why do I smell cheonggukjang?

605
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:56,838
Where's the amulet?

606
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,132
It's over there.

607
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,018
What are you doing?

608
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,311
Friend.

609
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,228
I'm sorry.

610
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,089
Untie me right away.

611
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,801
Even a daredevil like yourself
should know better

612
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:47,055
than to consider
summoning the Grim Reaper.

613
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:50,892
A Grim Reaper without a list
is no better than a murderer.

614
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:54,521
They can kill whoever
and however many they want.

615
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,774
Even evil spirits
avoid Grim Reapers with no list.

616
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,944
However desperate you are,
you must not do this.

617
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,195
So what?

618
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,072
What are you going to do now?

619
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,241
I'm going to remove
that petty ghost stuck to you

620
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,451
pretending to be your patron deity.

621
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:09,953
I'll get rid of it.

622
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:15,959
No.

623
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,002
You can't.

624
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,170
No!

625
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,048
No.

626
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:23,466
Don't.

627
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,219
Don't do it, okay?

628
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,471
You can't do it. Don't!

629
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,640
Don't do that.

630
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,142
I beg of you. Please don't do it.

631
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,728
No. Don't do it!

632
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,105
It's time for you

633
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,148
to stop being a shaman.

634
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,692
Don't.

635
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:41,859
No, don't do it.

636
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,111
Don't!

637
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,237
No, don't.

638
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,572
Don't do it.

639
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,740
Don't…

640
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:13,016
I helped you out because you asked me to,

641
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,184
but she has gone too far.

642
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,770
Letting her go might be better
for both you and her.

643
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,566
She won't come around.

644
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,113
I'm not holding on to her
to make her come around.

645
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,033
Then what?

646
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,076
I'm copying her.

647
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,704
She won't give up on her child,

648
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,040
so how can I give up on her, my child?

649
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,711
I'll go as far as she goes.

650
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,299
Even if she crosses the line?

651
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,052
I'll still follow her.

652
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,897
She rendered me powerless yet again.

653
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,566
What about my baby?

654
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,029
What about my baby?

655
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,282
Does she fear the Grim Reapers…

656
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,911
and evil spirits?

657
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:18,748
She's wrong there.

658
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,417
She should fear me the most.

659
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,338
I'm a mom who lost her child.

660
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,980
So what if I lost my patron deity?

661
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:48,528
There are random ghosts
to replace it everywhere.

662
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,434
Can Gyeon-U really never come back?

663
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,353
If Bong-su decides to live as Gyeon-U,

664
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:26,441
does Gyeon-U have to give up his body
without a chance to fight back?

665
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:32,113
I guess so.

666
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,912
I have another solution, though.

667
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:43,958
Another solution?

668
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,087
Other shamans can only console
the spirits,

669
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,965
but I know how to scold them.

670
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:56,721
You'll quit archery?

671
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,599
What kind of nonsense is that?

672
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:00,767
I quit.

673
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,310
It's no fun.

674
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,479
What about the national team
or the Olympic Games?

675
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,189
If you want that so badly,

676
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,733
train and compete yourself!

677
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,568
-You brat, how dare you--
-Whatever!

678
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:18,493
-Screw this!
-Stop right there!

679
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,827
No!

680
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,500
Archery is Gyeon-U's dream.

681
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,293
Who are you to give up on his dream?

682
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,795
I'm Bae Gyeon-U.

683
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,297
Me, the person standing here
is Bae Gyeon-U.

684
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:34,592
Why do you care
when I'm giving up on my own dream?

685
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,927
You're not Gyeon-U. You're Bong-su.

686
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,012
Don't call me "Bong-su," damn it!

687
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,557
That's not my real name anyway.

688
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:44,519
You made up that name as you pleased.

689
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,522
I won't go by a shoddy name
someone made up on the spot.

690
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:50,274
If you're not going to
address me as Gyeon-U,

691
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,276
don't even talk to me. Got it?

692
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,659
I have another solution, though.

693
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:08,334
The evil spirit has this silver ring.

694
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,132
Bring it to me.

695
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,885
Then, the evil spirit will perish.

696
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,559
No, stop it.

697
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:25,601
Don't do that.

698
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,937
Don't. Stop doing that.

699
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,896
Move!

700
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,649
Why won't you let me throw out my things?

701
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:32,817
Who do you think you are?

702
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,336
Thank you.

703
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,755
What will you do with that?

704
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,928
You should've asked that
before you gave me the ring.

705
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,138
Goodbye.

706
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:11,397
Wait.

707
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:15,902
Excuse me.

708
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,070
Hey!

709
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:37,840
Darn it.

710
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:41,552
PYO JI-HO

711
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:42,720
What's this?

712
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,434
Hey, Seong-A. What do I do?

713
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,311
I think I messed up.

714
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,771
Hey.

715
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:54,065
Are you okay? Bong-su.

716
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:57,026
Bong-su!

717
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,402
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

718
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:01,030
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

719
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,740
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

720
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,451
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

721
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,662
…Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

722
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,121
May it be done immediately.

723
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,457
Stop it! It hurts!

724
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:19,632
Now that she has the haunted object,
Yeomhwa will summon the Grim Reaper.

725
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,551
Let's distract the Grim Reaper.

726
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,514
I'll set up a boundary
and hide Bong-su's location.

727
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,766
Seong-A, you can go
to where the ring was buried

728
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,059
and perform a rite.

729
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,227
YOUNG SOULS OF HWAMOK!

730
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,020
I will hide him here,

731
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,231
and you can protect him
with a rite from over there.

732
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:38,985
We'll lure the Grim Reaper
to the wrong place.

733
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,411
We're holding a rite to console
the lost souls. Please step back.

734
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,079
Shoo.

735
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,457
BAE GYEON-U, BORN IN 2007

736
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,835
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

737
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,211
Vanquish all spirits,

738
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:00,339
wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

739
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,634
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

740
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:06,220
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

741
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,680
May it be done immediately.

742
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:09,765
May the pure sun shield us from harm.

743
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:12,393
Protect us and allow us peace.
May it be done immediately.

744
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,896
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

745
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:19,567
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

746
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,237
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

747
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,072
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

748
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:26,157
BAE GYEON-U

749
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:31,954
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

750
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:34,248
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

751
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,499
May it be done immediately.

752
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,751
Protect us and allow us peace.

753
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,627
-May the pure sun shield us from harm.
-Hey!

754
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,046
-Protect us and allow us peace.
-Look.

755
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,338
A Grim Reaper's right there!

756
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:42,465
-Close your eyes!
-Hey!

757
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:43,507
Ma'am.

758
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,094
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

759
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,596
May it be done immediately.

760
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,723
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits…

761
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,808
MUST LIVE

762
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:55,311
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

763
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:59,065
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

764
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:01,776
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

765
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:10,910
BAE GYEON-U, BORN IN 2007

766
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,746
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

767
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,081
May it be done immediately.

768
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:16,457
May it be done immediately.

769
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,795
It worked.

770
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:21,712
Let's go.

771
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,175
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirit…

772
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,357
Hey!

773
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:42,900
Hey, you!

774
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,247
May it be done immediately.

775
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:03,712
Why…

776
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,051
Why should I suffer such pain?

777
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,222
I just want to live.

778
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:16,308
I just want to live, that's all.

779
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:29,446
"If a living person became a ghost
because they hated the world

780
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,031
and cursed people,

781
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,075
fear them."

782
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:35,202
"They can use a spell to vanquish evil

783
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,872
to vanquish you just the same."

784
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,546
The one who should die

785
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,214
is Yeomhwa.

786
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,718
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

787
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,053
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

788
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:56,307
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

789
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,602
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

790
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,645
May it be done immediately.

791
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:03,647
May it be done immediately.

792
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,695
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits

793
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,530
wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

794
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:14,116
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits…

795
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,326
Who is it?

796
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:17,912
Who is it?

797
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,914
Who is counter-cursing me?

798
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,666
-I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
-I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

799
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,667
Who is it?

800
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,629
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

801
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,465
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

802
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:42,728
Something went wrong.

803
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:47,316
The Grim Reaper left.

804
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:52,696
No.

805
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,532
-I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell!
-I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell!

806
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:56,700
-Vanquish all spirits…
-Vanquish all spirits…

807
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,285
No.

808
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,624
I can't die like this!

809
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,334
I won't die like this.

810
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:08,921
I never got to see my baby.

811
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,299
Come to mommy.

812
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:17,137
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

813
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,473
Vanquish all spirits…

814
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,434
-May it be done immediately.
-May it be done immediately.

815
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:24,520
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell…

816
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,346
The goblin's face
is said to ward off evil.

817
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,807
"The Human Amulet method

818
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,685
allows a person
to protect another as an amulet."

819
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:09,356
"Give something with eyes, a nose,
and lips as your stand-in."

820
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,400
"Even if you are not there,

821
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,818
you can protect them."

822
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,389
"Even if you are not there…

823
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:49,772
you can protect them."

824
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,739
Mother!

825
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,954
No, Mother.

826
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:43,158
Why?

827
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,035
Why on earth did you do it?

828
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:53,252
I knew you would go all the way.

829
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,170
So, I decided

830
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,132
to wait for you at the end this time.

831
01:01:58,924 --> 01:01:59,800
Why…

832
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:03,220
Why would you

833
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:06,056
cling to a wretch like me
and end up like this?

834
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:08,976
Didn't I tell you

835
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:12,312
I wouldn't let you go?

836
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,544
Mom.

837
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:37,254
Mom.

838
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:41,675
Mom!

839
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,099
Mom…

840
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,104
Mom…

841
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:35,020
To eliminate the evil deity,
Heaven and Earth Fairy

842
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:36,063
has to die.

843
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,774
She has no idea
what she's doing right now.

844
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,193
Will you do me a favor?

845
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:42,110
Let's go on our date.

846
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:43,195
She knows.

847
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:44,821
She knows everything.

848
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:47,074
I'll come back
before the graduation ceremony.

849
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,576
The shaman is dead.

850
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,078
Seong-A isn't dead.

851
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:53,413
Seong-A. Wait.

852
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:54,957
I'll come to you this time.

853
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,333
I'll kill her if I find her.

854
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,584
Would he cooperate?

855
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:58,502
Go!

856
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,545
Go on, Seong-A!
