1
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,947
Help…

2
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,784
So people shouldn't be treated
as a means to an end.

3
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,911
-Why?
-What?

4
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,370
What do you mean, "Why?"

5
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,040
What aren't you getting about
not treating humans as a means to an end?

6
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,334
Sir. I'll go and get Jin-ung.

7
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,627
-Where…
-Hey.

8
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,383
Sir. I'll go help her out.

9
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,093
Why would you…

10
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,220
Hey.

11
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,473
-I'll bring them all back.
-What?

12
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,016
What was that?

13
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,352
Your group's really tight.

14
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,271
-But Jin-ung's in our group.
-But Jin-ung's in our group.

15
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,107
Those little punks!

16
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,322
Seong-A. Wait up.

17
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,491
They're so darn fast.

18
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,126
Wait.

19
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,462
I don't feel good about this.

20
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,550
-What's wrong?
-This path leads to the abandoned house.

21
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,052
Does it?

22
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,180
Then I'll go alone from here.

23
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,683
You have to be careful until tomorrow.

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,686
Here.

25
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,646
-What?
-I promised.

26
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,191
I saw Seong-A cry.

27
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,320
Like hell she would.

28
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,822
Seong-A never cries.

29
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,494
And I think she cried because of me.

30
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,249
Do you think she'll ever forgive me?

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,626
She was bawling.

32
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,044
Did she really cry?

33
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,922
Did you actually make her cry?

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,886
I'm like 99% sure it was because of me.

35
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,554
You jerk. Die, punk.

36
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,264
-Just die.
-Don't…

37
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,725
Oh, wait, no. You shouldn't die.

38
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,727
Don't die.

39
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,563
Darn it. You little…

40
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:11,317
Stop it already.
I won't make her cry again, okay?

41
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,445
I won't make her cry ever again.

42
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,032
I promise.

43
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,835
Hey, Jin-ung, breathe.

44
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,170
Jin-ung!

45
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,173
Release him already!

46
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,927
Kim Jin-ung. Hey, Kim Jin-ung!

47
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,136
Seong-A!

48
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,971
Why won't these doors open?

49
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,348
Seong-A!

50
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,019
Hey, let's use that rock.

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,569
The heck? It's dead heavy.

52
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,572
Hey, wait.

53
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,956
-Hey.
-Seong-A!

54
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,250
Darn it. Gyeon-U!

55
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,544
-Are you okay?
-Why are you…

56
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,671
What's the matter with you?

57
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,297
Hey, what's wrong?

58
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:17,549
What's happening?

59
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,885
Why are you here? It's dangerous in here.

60
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,680
-Get out, quick.
-You want me to leave without you?

61
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,932
I'm not such a selfish jerk.

62
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:29,395
And I had to come in
because you weren't safe.

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,563
I can only be safe if you're safe.

64
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,690
See? I'm fine.

65
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,108
Let's leave together.

66
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,193
Get the doors for me.

67
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,111
Let's get out quick.

68
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,748
This can't be…

69
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,250
Seong-A, the doors.

70
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,294
You really crossed the line.

71
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,215
Why the heck would she go inside?

72
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,509
I might die saving her spirit-daughter.

73
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,767
Give me that. That's what I'm here for.

74
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,730
-General…
-Let's hurry.

75
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,942
A person

76
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,821
shouldn't do this to another person.

77
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,949
I chose

78
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,453
the last offering for you myself.

79
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,458
The boy absorbed
his family's misfortune for ten years.

80
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,294
Eat him up whole

81
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,380
and be born again

82
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,924
as a great evil deity.

83
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,388
Why is it Gyeon-U again?

84
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,933
Because he's easy prey.

85
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,020
He has no one by his side.

86
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,064
Why would you go this far?

87
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,316
Just why?

88
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,151
Weaklings

89
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,236
are always the prime target.

90
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,798
Gyeon-U!

91
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,932
Pick a card while thinking of the one
you're to meet in the near future.

92
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,857
It's the Devil card.

93
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,985
They're like the Devil,
charming but also dangerous--

94
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,822
I'll think of the near future

95
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,573
and pick one more card.

96
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,501
"Death."

97
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,002
The loss of life.

98
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,465
The Death card
doesn't just mean one's passing.

99
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,676
An end is always followed
by a new beginning.

100
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,097
Death means rebirth, a new beginning,

101
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,183
and the time for a closure.

102
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,352
Finally,

103
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,480
he's coming.

104
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,487
Meet the devil and reach death…

105
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,699
You're pretty good.

106
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,202
I'm sure your business will thrive.

107
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:55,976
The evil spirit?

108
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,379
Hello, Shaman.

109
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,468
Get out of Gyeon-U's body.

110
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,931
Hello.

111
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,225
Leave Gyeon-U's body right now.

112
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,731
Get out now!

113
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,650
Darn it.

114
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,404
If I'm to get out,
I'd have to kill this body…

115
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,531
or you.

116
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,616
No!

117
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,410
Shut up.

118
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,291
Why are you so reckless?

119
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,668
You're a shaman.

120
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,295
Then you must know who I am.

121
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,463
Right?

122
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,267
Come on, don't be like this.

123
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,561
Shouldn't you say hello back?

124
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,313
Go on.

125
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,169
Run.

126
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,720
What was that just now?

127
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,681
Come here.

128
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,565
-Leave. Get out of here, quick.
-What?

129
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,900
What the heck? Darn it.

130
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:09,985
Hey!

131
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,655
Don't try anything funny,
or I'll kill him!

132
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:14,948
No! Don't kill him.

133
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,452
I didn't try anything.

134
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,455
I think you're the one who did.

135
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,123
Like hell I did.

136
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,083
Explain what happened just now!

137
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,294
Run.

138
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,838
Go on. Get out of here.

139
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,011
That's not fair at all.

140
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,056
You think you can do whatever
because you're pretty?

141
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,975
Let's see…

142
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,647
How about we make a bet?

143
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,610
Shamans don't wager with ghosts.

144
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,904
The person who offered
this body to me is on the way.

145
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,407
If you catch me before she does,

146
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,784
I'll grant you a wish.

147
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,874
Any wish?

148
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,752
Yes, any wish. Whatever you want.

149
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,003
I'll do it.

150
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,755
Okay. Then…

151
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,342
Close your eyes and count to ten.
You've played hide and seek before, no?

152
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,010
Ready, go.

153
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,388
One, two…

154
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,848
Oh, and I hope you win.

155
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,683
I like you more than her, you see.

156
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,229
-Here goes.
-Three.

157
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:31,817
Four.

158
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,111
Five.

159
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:36,988
Six.

160
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,783
Seven.

161
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,703
Eight.

162
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,539
What happened? Are you all right?

163
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,541
Hey! Don't come in here.

164
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,750
Wait outside.

165
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,628
Nine.

166
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,341
Ten.

167
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,324
The thing that went by.
That's it, isn't it?

168
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,370
You two go ahead. I'll go after him.

169
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,917
-Let's go.
-Keep going.

170
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,468
Ma'am.

171
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,305
He's been afflicted, and one got possessed
and left. Please look after him.

172
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,557
We saw him on the way.
The General went after him.

173
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,267
You'll be too late
by the time you reach them.

174
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,351
Not if I run.

175
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,645
Fairy. Heaven and Earth Fairy.

176
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,773
Open your eyes and see what you've done.

177
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,235
Is he a fish?
Why did you pickle him with salt?

178
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,491
Even if you join the General,
you won't be helpful.

179
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,243
See what you must see,
not what you want to see.

180
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,996
Wake up!

181
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,294
BOK-I

182
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,046
Bok-i.

183
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,675
-We pray as one…
-We pray as one…

184
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,054
The evil spirit that dwelled in the shack
harmed that young man.

185
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,889
They refer to his state as "afflicted."

186
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,475
The shamans have begun
to cleanse him of it.

187
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,852
It's dangerous,
so it's best to keep your distance.

188
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,187
Shoo!

189
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:55,794
Here we go!

190
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,315
Why did you do this?

191
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,318
So I can live.

192
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,280
This is all so I can live.

193
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,004
Shall I tell you
why your life is a living hell?

194
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,136
Don't touch me.

195
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,310
You dare pick up the bells
in your current state?

196
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,520
No wonder your life is hell.

197
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,150
You're no longer a person.
You've become a den for random spirits.

198
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,154
Let go.

199
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,405
Let go!

200
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:07,782
I don't want to.

201
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,334
Yeomhwa.

202
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,305
Yeomhwa, you foolish thing.

203
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,109
You poor thing.

204
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,278
Great job hanging in there, handsome.

205
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,864
Gosh, he has beautiful eyebrows.

206
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,990
You'll be fine.

207
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,201
-You got lucky.
-I'm glad you're okay.

208
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,619
But just to be safe…

209
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,164
Turn around.

210
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,503
Stop making contact with Gyeon-U
as his Human Amulet.

211
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,963
If you see him, don't go up to him.
Just call me right away.

212
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,382
-Why?
-I'll explain later.

213
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,300
Go straight home
instead of looking for Gyeon-U.

214
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,510
Why?

215
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,555
I'm swamped.
Protecting Gyeon-U is already a lot.

216
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,519
Are you saying I'm bothersome?

217
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,479
Seong-A!

218
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:24,984
I don't know where I'm going right now

219
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,614
-But I don't think to look around
-How do I get here?

220
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,035
I don't know the way
I'm stupidly clueless

221
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,540
I don't know
I'm clueless

222
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,334
I don't know the way
I'm clueless

223
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,086
Oh, shoot.

224
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,379
I'm lost

225
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,465
I can't go where I want to go

226
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,676
But I don't stop walking

227
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,762
I look straight ahead and go

228
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,599
-Earlier on… I think I'm at…
-I don't know the way, I'm clueless

229
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,274
You're getting on my nerves.

230
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,151
Your singing's just…

231
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,695
Go home!

232
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,123
MO BEOM
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

233
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,797
Shall we see what's in Beom's bag?

234
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,799
Take everything that's worth anything.

235
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,092
-Okay.
-Okay.

236
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:35,430
To think we'd meet
a friend from middle school.

237
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,602
I'll pay you back when I can.
You know that, right?

238
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,776
-Jun-u, count it out.
-Okay.

239
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,444
-Hey, nice wallet.
-Nice.

240
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,696
Hey, there. Buddy.

241
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,072
Do you know how to get here?

242
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:53,990
Who are you?

243
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,367
You must've come from here too.
Do you know how to get there?

244
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,327
Hey.

245
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,120
Didn't you hear me?

246
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,173
Give me that.

247
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,801
Come on.

248
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,222
Hey. Why did you give it to him?

249
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,141
Thanks for… What?

250
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:22,894
Come with me.

251
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,857
I need to get to this place.
It's called Hwamok High School.

252
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,360
-Do you know where it is?
-What are you saying, Gyeon-U?

253
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,320
I don't know the way, you see.

254
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,113
-Come on, what don't you get?
-What are you doing?

255
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,573
-Where are you going?
-Jump him already!

256
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,450
Come on, tell me the way first. Don't go.

257
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,494
-Don't just stand there.
-Get back here!

258
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,419
How do I get to the school?

259
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,763
Hey, punk! Get back here!

260
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,098
Tell me where to go first.

261
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,182
-Come here!
-What?

262
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,184
-Let go of me.
-Gyeon-U…

263
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,561
-What's the matter?
-Come here.

264
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,815
CONTACTS

265
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,941
PARK SEONG-A SEONG-A

266
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,487
I'm swamped.
Protecting Gyeon-U is already a lot.

267
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,119
Why you…

268
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,332
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

269
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,043
Are you a thug or what?
Why would you beat them up?

270
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,255
Hey. Are you with them?

271
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,676
What do you mean? I'm with you.
Partners in crime. We're friends.

272
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,470
PYO JI-HO
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

273
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,767
"Friends"?

274
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,103
Yeah, we're friends.

275
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,023
In fact, I'm losing my mind here
out of concern for you.

276
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,983
Where did he go?

277
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,495
It's not him.

278
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,082
He must be where ghosts would love to go.

279
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,877
Somewhere dark, damp, and dank.

280
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,546
Where are you?

281
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,840
Did something happen
in the abandoned house?

282
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:16,925
What?

283
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,928
She was all about us teaming up
to save you not so long ago.

284
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,723
Then Seong-A said I should stay away
from you even if we met.

285
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,559
Just what on earth happened back there?

286
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,522
Nothing happened,
but something almost did happen.

287
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,316
What?

288
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,070
Wait, so the shaman told you
to stay away from me?

289
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,364
She must care for you a lot.

290
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,240
Here's the thing, buddy.

291
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,743
You should do as she says for now.

292
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,411
Right now, I'm a bit…

293
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,330
dangerous.

294
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,249
What's going on?

295
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,210
Why have you turned into an edgelord?

296
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,379
What is an edgelord…

297
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,590
Whatever.

298
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:00,802
Do you like her?

299
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,057
Good for you.
The girl you like cares for you.

300
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,184
Hey, have you lost your mind?

301
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,145
I didn't tell you that I like her
just so you could tease me.

302
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,897
I was putting Seong-A first--

303
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,108
You don't just like her. You love her.

304
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,319
Come with me, you nutcase.

305
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,238
What do you like so much about her?

306
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,073
Are you into short girls?

307
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,308
I'll get more change. Wait right here.

308
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,727
No, come back here.

309
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,562
You want to keep playing?

310
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,355
Again? But you'll only get 6,000 points…

311
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,066
You're laughing?

312
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,485
Don't laugh. You're freaking obnoxious.
Do you know that?

313
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,991
Damn it. Were you always this annoying?

314
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,294
What are you looking at?

315
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,378
What are you doing?

316
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:19,505
Get out of my body.

317
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,425
I don't want to.

318
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,053
Didn't you see?
Even your friend couldn't tell.

319
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,263
-But--
-I think I can stay.

320
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,666
Get down!

321
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:00,797
Hey, move it!

322
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,553
Move!

323
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,598
Don't just stand there!

324
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,058
Get a hold of yourself, you idiot!

325
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,327
Please help!

326
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:32,954
I found you.

327
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,709
I won our game of hide and seek.

328
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,794
Now grant me my wish.

329
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:23,963
Please let Gyeon-U go.

330
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,300
The thing is--

331
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,260
You'd feel sorry for Gyeon-U too.

332
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,639
He walked into my shrine upside-down
when we first met.

333
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,934
People who do that
are destined to die within 21 days.

334
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,938
He had only 3 weeks to live
when he was just 18 years old.

335
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,732
I couldn't just let him die.

336
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,025
So I've protected him.

337
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,653
"Let's get him past those 21 days
and keep him alive at all costs."

338
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,699
Goodness.

339
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,076
What a pitiful kid.

340
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,536
You're wrong.

341
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,873
That in itself isn't pitiful.
He is just unfortunate.

342
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:03,211
What's pitiful is that the whole world
has been hating on him

343
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,048
and that made him hate himself too.

344
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,551
He doesn't love himself one bit.

345
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,596
That is what's pitiful about him.

346
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,310
Today's the last of the 21 days.

347
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,562
He can live freely after today, so please.

348
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,733
I beg of you. I need to save Gyeon-U.

349
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,659
Why would you go to such great lengths?

350
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,204
Because he's my first love.

351
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,539
Because I like Gyeon-U a lot.

352
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,045
Please help me.

353
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,386
Seong-A.

354
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,764
It's me right now.

355
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,476
-I'm Gyeon-U.
-What?

356
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,771
I'm Bae Gyeon-U right now.

357
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,738
What are you looking at?

358
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,161
It's me, Seong-A.

359
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,957
What the heck are you…

360
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,792
It's me.

361
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,589
-Gyeon-U?
-Yes?

362
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,476
What's this?

363
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,480
Hello.

364
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,833
Heaven and Earth Fairy, let go.

365
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,960
I don't think I should.

366
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,212
He's tied up anyway. Go on.

367
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,804
You shaman witches! Untie me this instant!

368
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,140
I'll just kill you all!

369
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,018
What are you? Are you a woman or not?

370
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,644
Put your hands back on him. Quick.

371
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,942
I didn't realize Human Amulet
was this effective.

372
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,487
He's Gyeon-U when touched,
and an evil spirit when not.

373
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,946
The vicious evil spirit

374
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,616
tried to possess him
but got locked up in there instead.

375
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,493
Even ten experienced shamans
couldn't have done it,

376
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,953
but these two teenagers
accomplished it somehow.

377
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,582
Don't make a fuss. He's still possessed.

378
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,543
It isn't over until we remove the spirit.

379
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,421
At least she found the evil spirit
and locked it up.

380
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,465
You know that's the hardest part.

381
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,842
Everything's ready.

382
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,971
Let's free the afflicted kid
from the spirit.

383
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,807
Let's begin.

384
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,145
Gyeon-U. Stay strong.

385
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,563
Okay.

386
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,568
Untie me, will you?

387
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:15,653
What are you…

388
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,197
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

389
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,117
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

390
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,996
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

391
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,833
-Please hear our plea and take pity
-Please hear our plea and take pity

392
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,002
-What are you even doing?
-All ghosts including the sinister ones…

393
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,589
That feels so good.

394
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,217
It's refreshing. Keep going.

395
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,513
Where are you going?

396
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,224
Hey, don't toy with food.

397
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,184
Don't do that. No. Don't.

398
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:51,063
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

399
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,483
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

400
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:58,154
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

401
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,116
It's tasty. Quite nutty.

402
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,078
What are you looking at?

403
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,914
I really hate that. Don't do that.

404
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,499
I don't like it! Don't!

405
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,084
Don't you dare. I hate it.

406
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,212
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

407
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,674
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

408
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,886
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

409
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,347
-Please hear our plea and take pity
-It tickles. It got inside.

410
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,016
-All ghosts…
-All ghosts…

411
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,853
Hey. This doesn't taste bad either.

412
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,188
What the…

413
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:37,693
What's the matter?

414
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,028
Where are you going?

415
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,287
-It's not working at all.
-Tell me about it.

416
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,664
We'll keep going until it works.

417
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,459
-Get more tofu and the five grains.
-Okay.

418
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,137
Hey.

419
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:07,932
Oh, my gosh!

420
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,059
Hey, you! Stop!

421
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,143
-Hey.
-Get him.

422
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,698
Seong-A.

423
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,997
Today's the last day.

424
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,377
You just had to pull through one more day.

425
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,881
I've tried so hard.

426
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,344
It's not fair.

427
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,849
This is just not fair at all.

428
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:16,584
Right now, the best option
is to lock up the evil spirit inside you.

429
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,718
I'm sorry I failed to help you
make it through today.

430
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,595
Don't be.

431
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,973
We're getting through today just fine.

432
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,434
Don't cry, okay?

433
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,019
I'm sorry.

434
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,984
I promised never to make her cry again.

435
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,236
I made her cry yet again.

436
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,658
I'm sorry, Seong-A.

437
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,412
I promise

438
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,040
not to make you cry ever again.

439
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,083
So please stop crying.

440
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,964
I just asked you to stop,
but you're crying even more.

441
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,841
Don't cry.

442
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,177
I wish I could keep them apart.

443
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:12,473
Are you all right?

444
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,309
Sure, I'm good.

445
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,520
I saw that done in a historical drama.

446
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,064
Dismemberment of the limbs.

447
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,485
We can't trust an 18-year-old boy.

448
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,154
This is the least I can do
to ease my mind a bit.

449
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,614
No, Mother.

450
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,157
This is a bit too much.

451
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,867
Be quiet and move.

452
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,329
Hey!

453
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,499
You old hag of a shaman.

454
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,875
Are you going to rip me to pieces?

455
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,959
-Exactly.
-Untie me!

456
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:42,294
Gyeon-U!

457
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,508
I'm sorry. Really, I am.

458
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,592
Why you…

459
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,595
I'm sorry.

460
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,181
I told you, didn't I?

461
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,147
Hey, kid.
No more than holding hands, got it?

462
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,066
Yes, ma'am.

463
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,484
Mother, please.

464
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,903
She has a point. You're going overboard.

465
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,862
Look at their faces.

466
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,699
He's out of her league.

467
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,075
-Master.
-Darn you.

468
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,203
Let's all go to bed.
It's late. Come along.

469
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,329
Hey, 18-year-old.

470
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,415
Hold her hand, nothing else.

471
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,458
Stay in the boundary we set up

472
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,627
and keep your eyes on the ceiling
like a proper gentleman.

473
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,672
Okay. I'll remember that.

474
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,133
Let's go. Even I'm sick of your lecturing.

475
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,467
So sick of it, really.

476
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,677
She's too much, right?

477
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,684
My gosh.

478
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,146
Mother's being dramatic, isn't she?

479
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,106
She's not.

480
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,024
Think about what happened
at the abandoned shack.

481
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,070
I totally understand
where she's coming from.

482
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,489
That was the evil spirit, not you.

483
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:55,451
As soon as you let go,
I'll become that evil spirit.

484
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,708
But I don't regret it at all.

485
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,919
I went in knowing it would be dangerous.

486
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,797
And even if I had known this would happen,

487
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:10,549
I'd still have gone in.

488
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,384
If I hadn't been there,

489
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,428
you'd have become the victim.

490
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,972
This is a thousand times better than that.

491
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,266
That's ridiculous.

492
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,726
It's not.

493
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,644
This is exactly what you always say to me.

494
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,607
Every archery arena

495
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,651
has good spots and bad spots.

496
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,029
Right now, I feel like

497
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,241
I'm standing in the worst spot
with the wind blowing in my face.

498
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,243
It's that bad.

499
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,205
But oddly enough, I'm not worried.

500
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,831
I think I can beat everyone.

501
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,171
Do you think you'll win gold?

502
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,799
Yeah, totally.

503
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,305
You sure are gutsy.

504
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,265
Why did you let that thing in here?

505
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:03,060
Should I have left her
on the street, then?

506
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,155
How is she?

507
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,367
She must've grown very weak.

508
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,285
She still hasn't woken up.

509
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,206
Even accumulating bad karma
requires a sturdy body.

510
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:28,627
She couldn't stand a touch of the sword
used to chase away petty spirits.

511
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,046
What made her think
she could commit all those evil deeds?

512
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,214
Isn't it obvious?

513
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,550
She was banking on the evil spirit
nesting in that shack.

514
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,426
Ma'am.

515
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,720
Don't you think General Dongcheon
is a bit strange today?

516
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:41,598
What? I'm not sure…

517
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,809
She's acting way too strange.

518
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,728
The young and handsome teen
may not be the only one that's possessed.

519
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,064
She must be possessed by something too.

520
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,525
Why else would a powerful shaman like her

521
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,695
keep an evil spirit and the shaman
who's served it in the same house?

522
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,655
It could be disastrous.

523
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,241
You're yapping away again.

524
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,702
She's done it before.

525
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,000
She tied my hands and feet,

526
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,460
gagged me with a cloth,

527
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,838
and hounded me mercilessly.

528
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,425
She's done it before, so she's confident

529
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,510
that she can do it again.

530
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,891
You should have let me die then and there.

531
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,810
Why did you let me live
knowing I'd become a problem?

532
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:32,608
You're at death's door,
but you have the energy to run your mouth?

533
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,362
I learned from the best.

534
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,134
This is nuts.

535
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,844
Why can't I fall asleep?

536
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,134
Shoot.

537
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,094
Where the heck did he go?

538
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,682
I found it.

539
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,685
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

540
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:22,986
It's you, Gyeon-U.

541
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,905
Why are you here so early?

542
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,615
What?

543
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,452
No. I'm late.

544
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:32,954
I got here too late.

545
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,999
You little brat, talking so casually
like I'm your friend.

546
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,335
And you're dressed like a damn clown.

547
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,634
Just look at all this.

548
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,513
You'd find nicer clothes
in a clothing donation drop box.

549
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,723
You have horrible style.

550
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:57,437
I know you don't have many friends,
but find someone to help you buy clothes.

551
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,522
I could help, you know.

552
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,565
Look at you.

553
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,068
You finally look like
a Hwamok High archer.

554
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,488
Am I really on the archery team?

555
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,657
That's not how you speak to your elder.

556
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,034
Address me as "coach" or "sir."
Try it. "Sir."

557
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,286
Sir.

558
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,372
I'm on the archery team?

559
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,045
You're rushing it.

560
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,589
Give yourself more time.

561
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,802
What's wrong with his posture?

562
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:31,805
Darn it.

563
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,598
What's wrong with him?

564
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,999
Would you look at that?
My body knows what to do.

565
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,507
Hey!

566
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,925
I'm pretty good at archery!

567
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,933
Yes, ma'am. I've just arrived
at Gyeon-U's house.

568
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,144
I'll call as soon as I find him.

569
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,984
Gyeon-U. Are you in there?

570
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,158
Evil Spirit. Evil Spirit.

571
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,535
Evil Spirit from the Bongsu-dong shack.

572
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,788
I guess he didn't come here.

573
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,795
Bok-i, I'm sorry.

574
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:48,840
I need to sort this out
before I help Jin-ung.

575
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,552
What about me?

576
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,430
Jin-ung.

577
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,144
Am I supposed to follow her?

578
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,278
I heard it clearly.

579
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:12,781
She said "Bok-i."

580
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,792
It's only the morning,
but he's already annoying.

581
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,762
This is great fun.

582
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,606
Gyeon-U.

583
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,360
Hey, Gyeon-U.

584
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:52,946
Hey, partner.

585
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,962
What do you think you're doing?
Drop the bow!

586
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,637
Hey.

587
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,640
I've had enough of you.
Bae Gyeon-U, come over here.

588
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:22,475
-Everyone, gather around.
-Hey.

589
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,269
-Come here.
-You're not Gyeon-U, are you?

590
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,814
That's right.

591
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,609
What's going on over there? Why, you…

592
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,071
Hey!

593
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,490
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

594
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,159
It hurts.

595
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,745
What is it, Bok-i? What's over here?

596
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,664
Where? Right here?

597
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:45,665
What's going on?

598
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:46,958
Not here?

599
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:49,294
What's wrong, Ji-ho?

600
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:52,172
Gyeon-U.

601
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,173
Gyeon-U?

602
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,091
Gyeon-U kicked him.

603
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,051
He kicked him hard.

604
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,094
Gyeon-U? He was here?

605
00:43:58,178 --> 00:43:59,804
He just ran off. Didn't you see him?

606
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,431
Thank you.

607
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,807
Wait. Stop.

608
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,353
You came to school like this?

609
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:08,772
In your pajamas?

610
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,829
So you'll do
a curse-cleansing rite for me?

611
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:27,749
If I don't release you
from all the layers of curse,

612
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,459
you'll wither away and die.

613
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,420
I can't let a person die on my watch.

614
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,090
"A person"?

615
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,551
Was I a person to you?

616
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,097
If you're a ghost,
let go of your grudges and cross over.

617
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,683
Human or ghost, I'll help you.
So don't complain.

618
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,020
You. Grab the drumstick.

619
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,021
You won't call a musician?

620
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:52,357
Everyone knows each other
in this line of work.

621
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,901
We'll keep it simple, just between us.

622
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:58,696
Goodness.

623
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,574
I'm not in the mood to play music.

624
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,244
I'll help you.

625
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:08,373
Don't worry.

626
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,049
Darn it.

627
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:30,895
What?

628
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:38,570
What do you want?

629
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,661
No!

630
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,461
You can't mistreat ghosts.

631
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,464
-Why not?
-He should've moved on but couldn't.

632
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,382
It means he has something to say.

633
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:03,178
We should hear him out so he can leave
with no regrets or grudges.

634
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:08,558
You're sweet.

635
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:10,393
But what's with the tone?

636
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:15,940
I'm done being polite.
You didn't keep our hide-and-seek deal.

637
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,901
Wait.

638
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,904
I'm a ghost too. Won't you be nice to me?

639
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:22,947
How shameless.

640
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:24,908
You ran off first thing in the morning.

641
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,786
Give me your hand so I can summon Gyeon-U.

642
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,581
No! Don't get in my way.

643
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,542
There's something I should do
with this body.

644
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:37,545
The only thing
a student should do is study.

645
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:41,174
-Cut it out and come along.
-Fine. Catch me if you can.

646
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:44,886
My goodness.

647
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:45,970
Hey.

648
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,017
I prefer the shaman.

649
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,478
Why you…

650
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:54,562
Get over here.

651
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,316
Come here right now.
Don't you dare run off!

652
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,619
Wait.

653
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:10,954
Is that a lovers' spat?

654
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,002
Hey.

655
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:20,380
-It's just a spat.
-I'll end you.

656
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:24,509
It's a dogfight.

657
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,265
Take my hand.

658
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,308
Call it a truce.

659
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:35,395
Holding hands is not a truce for me.
It's a surrender.

660
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,479
What's a truce for you, then?

661
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,982
Why bother with a truce?
Let's have a full-on war!

662
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,066
You're unbelievable.

663
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:44,696
Fine.

664
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:46,573
Tell me your name, then.

665
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,158
My name?

666
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,120
-I don't have one.
-You must have a name!

667
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,204
I don't because I forgot it!

668
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:54,372
Try to recall, then.

669
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,708
I can't keep calling you Evil Spirit.

670
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,460
Keep calling me that.

671
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,504
Who cares what you call me?

672
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,840
That's nonsense.

673
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,759
If you call something an evil spirit,
they'll become evil even if they weren't.

674
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,262
You may be an evil spirit,
but I can't call you that.

675
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,264
I should call you by a nice name
so you become nice.

676
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,976
Parents are super careful when they name
their babies for a reason.

677
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:17,687
Wait.

678
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,732
If you have no name, I'll give you one.

679
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,359
After all, names are given.

680
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,821
I'll give you a name.

681
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:34,412
Since you used to stay
at the abandoned shack in Bongsu-dong…

682
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,205
Bong-su. How's that?

683
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,916
-Shouldn't you put more thought into it?
-You don't like it?

684
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,377
Then…

685
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,839
Bong-su…

686
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,051
It's a pretty neat name.

687
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,094
Great, then. Bong-su it is.

688
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:53,306
Bong-su. From now on, you're Bong-su.

689
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:55,558
Whatever.

690
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,896
-Bong-su.
-Yeah?

691
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,231
Bong-su. Shall we play?

692
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,486
-Okay.
-Bong-su. Shall we play hide and seek?

693
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,155
I'd like that.

694
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,699
Now then, let's play.

695
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,496
What the heck?

696
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:31,344
If you call a ghost's name three times
and the ghost replies all three times,

697
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,681
they must submit to you
for a little while.

698
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:35,973
It's a simple Summoning Spell.

699
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:37,183
Darn you.

700
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,393
Bong-su.

701
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:39,894
Let's hold hands.

702
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:50,321
You gave me a really hard time this time.

703
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,992
What?

704
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,953
We can't go home right now?

705
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,289
They're setting up a boundary.

706
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,125
She'll call you when she's done.

707
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,084
But…

708
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,253
That means

709
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,339
I have to keep my hands on Gyeon-U
so the spirit doesn't come out.

710
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,675
Lady Fairy. Good luck!

711
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,345
What's wrong?

712
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,935
It looks like
we'll have to stay like this all day.

713
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,937
I don't mind.

714
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,899
What if people gossip?

715
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,485
That's okay.

716
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:32,113
People pick on everything I do anyway.

717
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,282
No, wait.

718
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,743
If we're holding hands,

719
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,536
will they gossip about you too?

720
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,037
I wouldn't like that.

721
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:45,084
Let's see. What should we do?

722
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:50,131
-That's a bit awkward.
-Come this way.

723
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:54,719
No, this is too weird.

724
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,638
Behind the back like…

725
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:58,639
Our hands…

726
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,059
What should we do?

727
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:06,022
Oh, dear, Gyeon-U.
I hope you feel better soon.

728
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,900
That was close.

729
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,903
-Gosh. That was really close.
-My stomach hurts.

730
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:13,613
Hey, Seong-A.

731
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,949
Gyeon-U's sick, so I'm propping him up.

732
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:18,493
We're not dating at all.

733
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,161
How do you know Bok-i?

734
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,206
-What?
-Bok-i, my dog.

735
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:27,210
-Hey, where are your manners?
-What?

736
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:31,047
-Who are you to pick on me?
-I'm not picking on you.

737
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,174
-I'm asking nicely.
-Oh, you are?

738
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,177
Bullshit.

739
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,472
Guys, don't be like this.
Let's talk it out.

740
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,848
There's a fight!

741
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,517
Hey, they're fighting.

742
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,684
-A fight?
-Isn't that Gyeon-U?

743
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:44,894
Gyeon-U.

744
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,896
-Why are they fighting?
-I don't know.

745
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,356
Ji-ho!

746
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,607
I need help.

747
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,775
-Seong-A.
-Help.

748
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,193
Help. Get rid of him now.

749
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,044
Seong-A. Are you okay?

750
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,381
Thanks a lot, partner.

751
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,632
What?

752
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,052
Hey, are you okay?

753
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,097
Hey, stop right there!

754
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,517
How do you know Bok-i?

755
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,146
11TH HANRAGI ARCHERY COMPETITION

756
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,156
I got you, you punk.

757
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:43,578
It's over, guys.

758
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,459
Your dog, the white dog.

759
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,503
She wears a collar
with "Bok-i" engraved on the tag.

760
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,339
She's always by your side,
keeping you safe.

761
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,716
-What?
-You--

762
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,970
What? Everything's fine.

763
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,763
Don't worry. It's all good.

764
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,600
I'm letting this slide for her sake.

765
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,560
If you do this again, then I'll…

766
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,980
-Your hand.
-What?

767
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,106
Let go.

768
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,358
You little…

769
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,782
Your dog, the white dog.

770
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,118
She wears a collar
with "Bok-i" engraved on the tag.

771
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,038
She's always by your side,
keeping you safe.

772
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:30,124
"School."

773
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,919
Hwamok High School.

774
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,254
What great courage.

775
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:37,590
You're really something.

776
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:38,633
NAME:
SCHOOL: HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

777
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,426
"Name."

778
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,387
What was his name?

779
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:45,890
I forgot again. I keep forgetting.

780
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,600
I can't be bothered. You fill in the rest.

781
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,560
It happens if you have a lot on your mind.

782
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:52,730
Who cares about the name?
You want to enter. That's what counts.

783
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,401
What? He's entering a competition?

784
00:53:57,485 --> 00:53:58,319
Him?

785
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,155
Oh, hey. Our one-day teammate.
Good to see you again.

786
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:05,284
He will enter that competition?

787
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:09,288
Yes. Our dear Gyeon-U
made a huge decision.

788
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:11,958
Choosing the Hanragi Archery Competition
to make a comeback

789
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:15,127
can almost be called an iconic move.

790
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,546
Wait, he's an archer.
Let's call it "an iconic shot."

791
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:20,383
-Don't come close.
-Are you serious?

792
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:21,968
What did I do now?

793
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,303
Why would you enter
an archery competition?

794
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:25,638
Take it back right away.

795
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,807
I'm not the one who said I'd enter.

796
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,975
He…

797
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:30,559
What's my name again?

798
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,020
-Bae Gyeon-U.
-That's it. Bae Gyeon-U wanted to enter.

799
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,940
I saw you fill in the form just now.

800
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,985
We made a deal. You don't know anything.

801
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:39,944
Stop lying.

802
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,278
Hey, one-day archery teammate.

803
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:44,281
Wearing our uniform
doesn't make you a full-time teammate.

804
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:47,243
Why are you raging over an archer
entering an archery competition?

805
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:49,370
I mean…

806
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,164
Sir. He…

807
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:56,669
I mean, Gyeon-U is in no condition
to enter a competition.

808
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:57,712
Forget it.

809
00:54:58,838 --> 00:54:59,922
If you're so suspicious,

810
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:01,799
check for yourself.

811
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:11,517
Sir, can you hand me the form?

812
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,144
Okay.

813
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:14,895
Gyeon-U.

814
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,650
NAME: BAE GYEON-U

815
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,283
Excuse us, sir.

816
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,534
Sure.

817
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:30,911
-I'm so sorry.
-No, don't be.

818
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,830
Let's go.

819
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,123
Bye.

820
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,547
Oh, to be young and in love.

821
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,844
I made a deal with Bong-su.

822
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,846
Enter the Hanragi Competition.

823
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,806
A competition is the best way
to regain your form.

824
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,851
It'll be a lot of pressure,
but you need to face it head-on.

825
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,978
What is archery?
It's all about keeping composure.

826
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:58,689
"Bad-mouth me all you want.
You can't get to me."

827
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:01,192
It's your chance
to prove that to the whole world.

828
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,109
Fill out the form.

829
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,905
Tell him you'll enter
and fill out the form.

830
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,658
This competition is important to me.

831
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:13,704
Hey, isn't archery a solo sport?

832
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,247
That means I have to participate.

833
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,168
Of course you may think
you're in it alone.

834
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,545
But if you turn to look behind you,

835
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,130
yours truly will be right there.

836
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,716
You're not alone.
Don't think that you are.

837
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,218
I'll participate as myself.

838
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,302
No matter what.

839
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:37,937
Let's make a deal, then.

840
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:40,606
-A deal?
-Yeah.

841
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:43,317
Lend me your body while we're at school.

842
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,610
Then I'll…

843
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,613
join this competition.

844
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,323
You'll have my full cooperation.

845
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,953
Is that self-affirmation?

846
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,496
That's very important.

847
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,705
Let me join in.

848
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,917
You punk.
Give him your full cooperation, okay?

849
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,086
You are your only rival.

850
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,921
Fight him and win. Bring it, punk.

851
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:05,631
Come at me.

852
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:07,967
Let's do it.

853
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:09,802
Your deal or whatever.

854
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:17,059
We don't know what Bong-su is thinking.

855
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:21,605
But I thought I might have an advantage.

856
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:23,524
Like it or not, we're sharing a body.

857
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,823
Don't try anything funny,
or I'll kill him!

858
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,410
It's too dangerous. Your life is at stake.

859
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,287
I'm pretty hard to kill.

860
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:38,581
Well done.

861
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,041
Because someone

862
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:44,003
has worked really hard to protect me.

863
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,511
When we hold hands tight like this,

864
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,807
it keeps me from thinking
that I might lose.

865
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,103
I'm actually really timid.

866
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:02,521
But…

867
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:04,273
I'm not afraid at all right now.

868
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,152
Because you're so warm.

869
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:11,697
Gyeon-U.

870
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,032
I like you, Seong-A.

871
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:16,452
Now, it's…

872
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:19,413
my turn to protect you.

873
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,468
I like you.

874
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:34,970
I mean it.

875
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,581
Are you having fun playing with kids?

876
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,208
It's too dangerous.

877
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:48,002
Do you know what drives me crazy the most?

878
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:51,088
You shouldn't hold
someone's hand so recklessly.

879
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:55,301
Parents and children
are bound to break each other's hearts.

880
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:57,094
You gave up on me.

881
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,554
You ditched me for being unclean.

882
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,807
I can't find a way
to separate you and Gyeon-U.

883
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,351
Just trust me. I have a plan.

884
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,353
I must save only one of them?

885
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:07,688
That is too cruel.

886
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:08,605
Sorry.

887
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:11,400
I won't ever let go.

888
