1
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,446
…wicked and evil.
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell…

2
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,948
-Vanquish all spirits…
-Mom!

3
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,289
Mom.

4
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,922
-This isn't...
-Mom.

5
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,006
what I wanted to do.

6
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,509
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,845
I'm sorry, Shaman.

8
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,310
I just wanted to survive.

9
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,273
It was so I could survive.

10
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,118
Open the door.

11
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,205
Open the door, you damned evil spirit!

12
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,457
Open up.

13
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,251
Open the door.

14
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,420
You damned evil spirit!

15
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,297
Open the door!

16
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,628
Are you a good person?

17
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,297
What?

18
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,591
Are you a good person?

19
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,011
Well…

20
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:58,971
I can't say.

21
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,432
I'm a bad person.

22
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:03,726
What?

23
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,238
The evil spirit's gone.

24
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,574
We must find him and get rid of him.

25
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:21,994
You can't go.

26
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,078
What?

27
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,247
You're not going.

28
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,876
Who knows what the evil spirit will do?

29
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,212
General Dongcheon was the last one.

30
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,424
He just claimed his hundredth life.

31
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,009
He has become an evil deity!

32
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,678
Let go. Let go of me.

33
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,181
-Let me go.
-Yeomhwa.

34
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,391
-Do you have a plan?
-Let go!

35
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,560
Do you know a way
other than dying with Bong-su?

36
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,396
She wanted to save you!

37
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,320
My mom died while trying to save you!

38
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,407
You know,

39
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,660
I really hate you

40
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,287
with all my being.

41
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,166
But I'll protect you.

42
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,297
I'll protect you no matter what.

43
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,852
Please just hear me out!

44
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,104
Man-sik!

45
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,440
Where is Heaven and Earth Fairy?

46
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,276
-I don't know if this is right.
-We have to find her.

47
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,696
Where is she right now?

48
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,870
What's this? Where am I?

49
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,006
Seong-A.

50
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,055
Where are we?

51
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:07,891
Is this a dream?

52
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,520
What is it?
Am I so pretty that it feels like a dream?

53
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,067
Now that you're up, let's go on our date.

54
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,904
Stop it.

55
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,783
One, two, three.

56
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,165
You're taking selfies, aren't you?

57
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,463
There.

58
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:39,965
Done.

59
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,718
Great. Thanks.

60
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,062
-You made a wish?
-Yeah.

61
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,021
Let's go.

62
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,463
So…

63
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,840
Where did Bong-su go?

64
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,093
I can't sense his presence anymore.

65
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,386
He's gone.

66
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,680
He's gone?

67
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,807
Yeah.

68
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,849
Where to? How?

69
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:31,892
Shush.

70
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,561
Talk about him, and he'll come back.

71
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,774
Flower Master.

72
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,859
Man-sik, I know you're there.

73
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,903
Hong Man-sik!

74
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,656
You don't need to untie me.

75
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,409
Just hear me out! Man-sik!

76
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,745
Hong Man-sik!

77
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,663
Ma'am!

78
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,748
MUST LIVE

79
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,792
Why do you keep calling me?

80
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,794
Man-sik.

81
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,837
You don't know.

82
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,422
Heaven and Earth Fairy doesn't either.

83
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:03,841
What do you mean?

84
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,635
Evil deities don't cause calamities.

85
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,846
They're calamities themselves,

86
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,806
so they don't bring disasters.

87
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,727
If an evil deity resides in you,

88
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,397
things start to get plagued.

89
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,857
Seong-A!

90
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,025
First, plants start to wither.

91
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,027
Then, animals perish.

92
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,697
In the end, people die.

93
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,074
You must stop Heaven and Earth Fairy.

94
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,245
She has no idea
what she's doing right now.

95
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,246
No.

96
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,085
Yeomhwa.

97
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,587
She knows.

98
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,215
She knows everything.

99
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,552
Did you get one of everything
from the vending machine?

100
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,887
Well,

101
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,472
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I got one of each.

102
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,308
You don't know what I like?

103
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,230
I like you.

104
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,152
You are my first love.

105
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,659
-You're also my--
-And…

106
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,204
this is my first kiss.

107
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,902
I'll come back
before the graduation ceremony.

108
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:15,889
It's time to go now,

109
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,475
Bong-su.

110
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,367
Mother.

111
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,079
I'm surrounded by darkness,
and I can't see a thing.

112
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,583
How can I tell
if I'm walking along the right path?

113
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,669
By leading the way.

114
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:51,133
You don't know what's awaiting,
so you walk in the front.

115
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,259
Will that

116
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,011
help me take the right path?

117
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,513
You can then protect

118
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,182
the ones behind you.

119
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,143
Mother.

120
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,854
I'll take the right path.

121
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,064
I won't go astray.

122
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,401
I promise to protect them.

123
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:12,779
Bong-su.

124
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,240
Follow me from behind from now on.

125
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,951
Why? I want to walk next to you.

126
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,829
Stay behind and keep watch.

127
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,707
Make sure I'm walking straight.

128
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,127
Okay, sure.

129
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,644
I'll come back
before the graduation ceremony.

130
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,774
Seong-A.

131
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,859
Seong-A.

132
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,361
Seong-A!

133
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:53,945
Seong-A…

134
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,030
Seong-A.

135
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,284
Seong-A!

136
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,787
Park Seong-A!

137
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,334
Seong-A!

138
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,796
Seong-A!

139
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,009
Park Seong-A.

140
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:17,928
Park Seong-A...

141
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,081
I can't believe I'm in my last year.

142
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,966
Seong-A left, and we became 12th graders.

143
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,975
What's going on? Hey, Jin-ung.

144
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,143
You're actually dating?

145
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,275
It's seasoned perfectly.

146
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,279
We were in different classes,
but we ate lunch together.

147
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,030
Come on out!

148
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,282
-Who's this?
-Just get out.

149
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,491
-What?
-What's this?

150
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,868
Get out already.

151
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,161
What are you even doing?

152
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,872
Do you have a death wish?

153
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,790
-Here.
-Quit smoking.

154
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,584
Okay?

155
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,961
-I smiled a lot over small things.
-Cigarettes, you know…

156
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,346
And Gyeon-U.

157
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,274
Come here.

158
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,027
I'm proud of you. Well done.

159
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,158
Well done, Gyeon-U.

160
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,243
Hey.

161
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,411
What?

162
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,626
You're the best.

163
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,757
Bae Gyeon-U was doing well.

164
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,674
A bit too well.

165
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,557
He's more like a machine.

166
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,600
Goodbye.

167
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,976
Thank you.

168
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,783
I found that so weird
that I quietly followed him a few times.

169
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:50,121
GENERAL WARD B

170
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,039
Hui-na.

171
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,133
Congratulations on going home.

172
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,472
Do you still hate me?

173
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,182
Yeah.

174
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,393
I think I will forever.

175
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,354
You know

176
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,440
the person responsible
for the fire in the dorm

177
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,693
was actually me.

178
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:28,952
It's too late to come clean now,
and I didn't pay for what I did.

179
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,414
I guess I'll suffer from guilt
for the rest of my life.

180
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,586
How was that possible?

181
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,089
Why didn't you tell anyone it was me?

182
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,176
You wouldn't have done that

183
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,345
if it hadn't been for me.

184
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,770
You're still a fool.

185
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,523
And I'm still a coward.

186
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,402
You think so?

187
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:07,699
But…

188
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:11,786
I think it's about time

189
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,247
we both found happiness.

190
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,501
I really want you

191
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,588
to be happy now.

192
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:24,674
Why?

193
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,011
Because I'm your first-ever friend?

194
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:30,597
Yeah.

195
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,015
And…

196
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,185
I met and made another friend.

197
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,563
She taught me…

198
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,733
it's okay

199
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,027
to be happy.

200
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:46,988
So what?

201
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,782
Are you happy now?

202
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,673
Give me your phone.

203
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,391
Of all the bad things I did to you,

204
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,809
I think this was the worst.

205
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,186
Not letting you
save my number under my name.

206
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,943
CHOI HUI-NA

207
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,445
Don't take my calls anymore.

208
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,572
That's the first thing
you should do to be happy.

209
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,247
Hey.

210
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,249
Archery.

211
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,334
Will you go back into it?

212
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,091
Okay.

213
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,844
See you at future competitions.

214
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,696
I wouldn't have cared one bit

215
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,282
even if Gyeon-U
had met Seong-A alone in secret.

216
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,744
That's how much I missed her.

217
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,584
-You bought some.
-Do you need flowers?

218
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,710
We bought ours already.

219
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,421
That concludes
the 76th graduation ceremony

220
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,715
of Hwamok High School.

221
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:29,799
One, two, three.

222
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,427
Dad, take it in portrait mode,
not landscape mode.

223
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,554
Come here. Let's take one together.

224
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,307
-We graduated!
-We graduated!

225
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:39,893
And...

226
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,521
We'd longed
for the graduation day to come.

227
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,148
One, two, three.

228
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,609
Let's take one more.

229
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,112
"I want to attend
my high school graduation ceremony

230
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,697
and college entrance ceremony."

231
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:56,618
"I want to take a photo
with a flower bouquet."

232
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,747
This was Seong-A's wish.

233
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,339
Stand up. Let's take a photo.

234
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,601
Take it with this.

235
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,603
In landscape mode.

236
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,737
One, two, three.

237
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:33,822
Wait.

238
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,323
Hold this up a bit higher.

239
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,700
About here. She's a bit taller than that.

240
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,495
-No, this is the right height.
-It's not.

241
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,746
One, two--

242
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,583
You're just clueless.
She's taller than this. Hold it up.

243
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,627
She's not this tall. Your memory must be…

244
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,795
She's this tall.

245
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,056
Down here. This is about it.

246
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,016
This is too low.

247
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,519
I think it should be a little higher.

248
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,522
I'll take the photo for you.

249
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,941
I don't know. It's somewhere here.

250
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,901
She's taking the photo.

251
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,361
Give me that.

252
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,616
On three, okay?

253
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,664
One.

254
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,626
Two.

255
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,006
Three.

256
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,331
Seong-A. Wait.

257
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,458
I'll come to you now.

258
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,380
Long time no see.

259
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,390
It seems I still scare you.

260
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,855
The deities have left.

261
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,151
"The deities

262
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:18,861
have left?"

263
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,365
A shrine ends up like this
without its owner.

264
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,327
Items that are no longer used
soon become worn down

265
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,162
and break.

266
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,375
Fairy God…

267
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,294
left her shaman completely.

268
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,714
That means…

269
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,051
the shaman is dead.

270
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,225
No.

271
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,269
Seong-A isn't dead.

272
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,354
You're right.

273
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,648
She isn't dead.

274
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,360
That's why I find it odd.

275
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,489
What are you trying to say?

276
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,118
We were once connected
through the Unify Spell.

277
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,287
So when she dies,

278
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,122
you and I are bound to know.

279
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,543
She'll appear in our dreams all in white

280
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,128
to say a final goodbye.

281
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,257
But something's off.

282
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,760
Her patron deity is gone,

283
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,095
but she isn't dead.

284
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,515
The evil spirit that's stuck to her…

285
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,103
must be pulling something sly.

286
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,608
How can we find Seong-A--

287
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,526
We must find her as soon as possible…

288
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,114
before she starts harming people.

289
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,160
She'll do what?

290
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,662
Seong-A will harm people?

291
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,373
She's not like you!

292
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,005
I wasn't like that from the start, either.

293
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,969
This won't work.

294
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,597
I should find something else.

295
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,758
Hey, kid.

296
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,802
Handsome, you idiot!

297
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,304
You're asking for divine punishment!

298
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:53,933
Darn it.

299
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,562
It feels like I'm suffering one anyway.

300
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,608
Okay, stop. I get it, fine.

301
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:03,860
Point taken.

302
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,098
Wrap one around the arrow
before you shoot.

303
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,766
You might be able to get ghosts.

304
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,061
Thank you. I'll use these to find Seong-A.

305
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,105
Whatever. Don't say another word. Just go.

306
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,233
Okay. I'll bring Seong-A
with me next time.

307
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,276
Just go.

308
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,301
He came as you said,
and I did as you asked.

309
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,429
I'll pay for the amulets.

310
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,890
If he comes back,

311
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:17,850
give him more.

312
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,810
It's not about the money.
Is this even right?

313
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,854
Won't Handsome end up in danger too?

314
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,481
I didn't put him up to this.

315
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,567
This is all him. You saw yourself too.

316
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,695
He has to do something, anything.

317
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,950
Okay. I'll call you back.

318
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,968
May I ask

319
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,761
what you're doing?

320
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:01,602
Sure.

321
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:03,688
We're family.

322
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,982
Why keep secrets?

323
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,034
The more evil you do,
the stronger the evil deity becomes.

324
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,788
I've spent more than a year
looking for Heaven and Earth Fairy,

325
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,582
and I couldn't find a trace of her.

326
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,963
The moment I thought I'd found her,
she did something evil and got away.

327
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,467
Her acts of evil…

328
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,181
drove the Fairy God away from her.

329
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,522
But we still have that boy.

330
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,525
The boy the evil spirit resided in.

331
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,986
The spirit's energy still lingers in him.

332
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,447
Despite the evil spirit's departure

333
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,741
and his lack of shamanic powers,

334
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,243
he can still see and hear ghosts.

335
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,078
And…

336
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,372
communicate with them.

337
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,127
Perhaps…

338
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,757
we may still have a shot
at finding Heaven and Earth Fairy

339
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,176
by using that unbreakable tie.

340
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:24,018
Gyeon-U would definitely help.

341
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:28,022
You could tell him the truth
and ask for his help.

342
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,066
Why go to all this trouble?

343
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,118
I'll kill her when I find her.

344
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,705
Would he still cooperate?

345
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,500
What?

346
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,668
To exorcise the evil deity,

347
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,337
Heaven and Earth Fairy

348
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,422
has to die.

349
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,858
Do you know this shaman?

350
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,447
Looks like you do.

351
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:02,741
So…

352
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,286
how about you tell me everything you know?

353
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,169
I must find ghosts without faces

354
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,880
that want to serve the evil deity?

355
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,303
Faceless Ghosts?

356
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,346
You need to be rough with them.

357
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,641
They literally have no faces.

358
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,477
So

359
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,438
the one who gives them a face
becomes their master.

360
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,223
I got you a new face.

361
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,682
Now I'm your master.

362
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:10,809
Where is this girl?

363
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,400
MAP OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

364
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,947
YEONCHEON-GUN, CHEORWON-GUN

365
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,227

NONE IN INJE
DON'T GIVE UP, I'LL SAVE HER THIS TIME

369
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,373
Gyeon-U, you little punk.

370
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,375
Listen, you.

371
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,294
Don't you have anything to say to me?

372
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:20,963
I'm sorry.

373
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,590
Tell me.

374
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:27,469
How come you haven't come to train
in the past two months?

375
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,681
You think you're all that
because you keep winning gold?

376
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,809
And why do you keep getting caught

377
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,186
by the police
for shooting arrows in the mountains?

378
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,813
In the middle of the night too.

379
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:46,989
Come on.

380
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:48,991
This is it.

381
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,534
Talk to me.

382
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,577
Tell me.

383
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,372
I need to know what's going on
to cover for you.

384
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,876
Come on, Gyeon-U.

385
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:03,922
If you keep this up,
the Archery Association will penalize you.

386
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,136
Coach.

387
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,095
Yes.

388
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,682
Can you forget a girl who left

389
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,728
after promising to return no matter what?

390
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,066
The first kiss

391
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,027
can't and shouldn't be a goodbye, right?

392
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,613
So how could she…

393
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,075
not even appear in my dreams?

394
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,375
I can see the world she'd see.

395
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,085
I don't get

396
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,003
just how…

397
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,550
she kept a smile on her face
while seeing all this daily.

398
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,887
Had I known,

399
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,517
I wouldn't have told her I didn't like her
forcing herself to smile.

400
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,900
To be honest, her smile was lovely.

401
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,696
I get it.

402
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,116
All that's happened
is that a girl left you,

403
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:15,536
but the whole world
has turned gray, hasn't it?

404
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,579
Right?

405
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,417
That's love for you.

406
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,085
Love.

407
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:28,215
That's what love does to you.

408
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,080
I'm your master now.

409
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:03,041
Repeat exactly what you told that boy,

410
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,002
word for word.

411
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,409
I pray you will find your way to paradise

412
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,703
and be reborn as a person in this world.

413
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,040
Three, two, one.

414
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,252
Three, two, one.

415
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,963
Three, two, one.

416
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,381
Three, two...

417
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:33,882
one.

418
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,494
You all

419
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,914
must move on to a better place.

420
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,257
Why waste time and energy
to console a whopping 100 souls…

421
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,724
when you can die and be done with it
after one entreaty to the King of Hell?

422
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,235
Hey.

423
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,237
Stay out of my way.

424
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,698
Or I'll kill you.

425
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,161
You're basically a ghost now.

426
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,548
Let's go.

427
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,508
Hey.

428
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,802
Let me go. Let go of me!

429
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,596
Would you let go if you were me?

430
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,683
I don't want to hurt you. Let go.

431
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,268
Enough with the show.

432
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,313
Come with me quietly.

433
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,364
Go! Go on, Seong-A!

434
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,449
No!

435
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,537
Stop! No!

436
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,958
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you?

437
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,806
I'm risking an expulsion
from the Archery Association.

438
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,035
That was our last chance to catch her.

439
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,874
Do you even realize
what you unleashed into the world?

440
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,586
If you hadn't tried to turn
Bong-su into an evil deity,

441
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,923
-I wouldn't have had to--
-That's why I'm trying to correct it all!

442
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,845
Seong-A…

443
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,305
Seong-A wouldn't have resorted

444
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,474
to such harsh ways.

445
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,561
She would've found a way…

446
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,106
that wouldn't be so hurtful.

447
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,442
So…

448
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,696
you should find another way,
just like she would.

449
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,993
I feel so sorry for you.

450
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,956
An exorcism is now the only way to…

451
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:56,918
No.

452
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,921
Even that's not an option now

453
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,592
since we've lost all means to catch her.

454
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,478
Gyeon-U.

455
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,356
If she comes to see you,

456
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:21,943
it will be to kill you.

457
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,782
By any chance,

458
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,285
if you run into her, run away.

459
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,288
Run away and call me.

460
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,084
That's the only way you'll live.

461
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,132
As for the interview…

462
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,049
2 YEARS LATER

463
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:27,884
…we'll only ask the questions
we sent you earlier.

464
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:31,179
So there's no need to be nervous.

465
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,142
Hello, I'm Bae Gyeon-U.

466
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,059
BAE GYEON-U
RECURVE, JANGAN CITY HALL

467
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,185
Say a bit more.

468
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,147
So I shoot with a recurve bow.

469
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,607
I'm happy.

470
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,359
I'm over the moon.

471
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,031
He's terrible at interviews, isn't he?

472
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,117
Dude, lower that hand. Come on.

473
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,451
Hand down.

474
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,536
INTRODUCE YOURSELF

475
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,453
That's it.

476
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,538
Okay, great.

477
00:40:56,621 --> 00:41:00,458
Is winning gold at the Olympics
your dream, then?

478
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,294
WHAT'S YOUR DREAM?

479
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,797
Winning the gold medal
at the Olympic Games is my goal.

480
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,633
My dream is something else.

481
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:09,718
My dream

482
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,680
is to see my first love again.

483
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:18,351
This interview has become
all sweet and romantic all of a sudden.

484
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,230
If you had to choose between winning gold
and your first love,

485
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,565
what would you choose?

486
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,233
My first love.

487
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,527
A video message?

488
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,490
I miss you…

489
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:35,994
Seong-A.

490
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,539
Punk.

491
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,666
No holding back, huh?

492
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,070
-Stop right there!
-Wait, Ji-ho.

493
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,364
-Come on.
-Stop it. What are you doing?

494
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,531
I'm sorry, Ji-ho.

495
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,575
I'm so sorry. I mean that.

496
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,336
11TH HANRAGI ARCHERY COMPETITION

497
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,852
My goodness. Will you knock first?

498
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,813
What are you doing here?

499
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:46,606
This is my home.

500
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,443
You should've called to say you'd come.

501
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,285
This is my place,
but I should call you before coming here?

502
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,997
Did you come here planning to move in?

503
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,291
Yeah. You don't mind, do you?

504
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,126
I do mind.

505
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,210
Oh, right.

506
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,379
Will you have dinner at home?

507
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,673
I'm not sure.

508
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15,093
Come home in time for dinner.
I'll cook something nice.

509
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,345
Fix this if you don't have anything to do.

510
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,556
See you. Rest up.

511
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,391
See you later.

512
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,150
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,321
She passed away?

514
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:36,865
Okay.

515
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:38,908
I'll come over.

516
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,256
The elder shaman prayed for you both

517
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,175
until the day she passed.

518
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,017
The deities

519
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,102
will protect both you and Seong-A.

520
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,729
Consider yourself

521
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:11,316
as fragile as glass
and be careful for the time being.

522
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,442
Can you do that?

523
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,278
I'll try.

524
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,867
Rather than leaving it all alone
in Lady Fairy's room,

525
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,496
I thought it would be better
to have you keep it.

526
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,874
Okay. I'll take good care of it.

527
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,801
I'm sure she's fine.

528
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,641
She must be, right?

529
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,478
Take all the time you need.

530
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:49,521
Yes, ma'am.

531
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,072
PARK SEONG-A
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

532
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:05,847
What a shame.

533
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:07,891
If this were the Joseon Period,

534
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,059
the king would build a monument
to praise your devotion.

535
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,854
Would it be something else
since you're a man?

536
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:17,901
You haven't changed one bit.
That's good to see.

537
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,987
-Are you being sarcastic?
-You started it.

538
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,993
Did you have any dreams?

539
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:31,998
No.

540
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,544
There was a slight pause.
That's suspicious.

541
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:41,007
You said if I see her in my dreams
that would mean she's dead.

542
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,592
That's the best-case scenario.

543
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,094
Then we can just collect her body.

544
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,182
Glare at me all you want,

545
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,226
but your ally now is me, not her.

546
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,355
If she appears in a dream,
ask where she is.

547
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:58,316
We must collect her body
and cleanse the area.

548
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,070
If you see her in real life,
run away and don't look back.

549
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:03,947
And call me.

550
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,743
What if I don't want to call you?

551
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,162
Gyeon-U.

552
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:14,707
You've never called me
for your own good anyway.

553
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,918
Don't call if you don't want to.

554
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,796
I'm sure you'll love joining
your grandmother sooner.

555
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,521
I'm back.

556
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,273
That was quick. I won't be long.

557
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:39,816
I won't eat.

558
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,901
But it's spicy stir-fried pork.

559
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:58,668
Did you have

560
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:00,753
any dreams?

561
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:10,972
If she appears in a dream,

562
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:12,765
ask where she is.

563
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:14,892
Seong-A's dream.

564
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,896
A dream that has Seong-A in it.

565
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:26,529
There's something
I didn't tell Yeomhwa earlier.

566
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,991
I've been having

567
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:31,993
this dream.

568
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:38,666
I'm here again.

569
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,225
A 12th-grade classroom
without a class number.

570
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,777
CLASS MOTTO
LET'S GET INTO A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE

571
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,111
A weird class motto.

572
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,462
Ji-ho and I are in the same class.

573
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,674
We were in different classes
in 12th grade, though.

574
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:34,972
PARK SEONG-A

575
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:40,061
Seong-A.

576
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,815
Are you doing okay?

577
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,038
So this is

578
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:02,875
what the classroom looks like
from your seat.

579
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:16,848
That's a nice drawing.

580
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:29,944
Gyeon-U.

581
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,197
Hey, Gyeon-U. Wake up.

582
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,660
Are you a newborn? You dozed off already?

583
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,662
Get up. It's time for dinner.

584
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,039
Have you ever experienced

585
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:44,709
having a dream

586
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,961
that doesn't feel like yours?

587
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,046
As if…

588
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,550
you were in someone else's dream.

589
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:57,054
My dear friend has reached
new heights of nonsense.

590
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,016
I think

591
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,561
I end up in Seong-A's dream sometimes.

592
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:08,566
I have dreams of Seong-A

593
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:11,110
that doesn't have her in it.

594
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,829
For goodness' sake.

595
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,164
What the heck?

596
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,958
Why do you keep hiding? Just go meet him.

597
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,795
What if I do and end up hurting him?

598
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:33,549
We're in a dream.
What harm could you possibly do?

599
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:36,427
A dream's a dream because you can do
whatever you want in it.

600
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:38,888
And if anyone were to harm him,
it would be me, not you.

601
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,225
We never know.

602
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:46,229
Gyeon-U and Ji-ho
seem to be living together, right?

603
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,523
They must still be close.

604
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:50,149
That's great.

605
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,152
Who cares if they're close or not?

606
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,407
Is it because Gyeon-U sat here?

607
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:00,451
The seat's warm.

608
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,912
By the way,

609
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,706
why did he have to sit in your chair?

610
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,166
What a weirdo.

611
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:10,670
Bong-su.

612
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:15,508
This is good enough for me.

613
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,261
Seeing him from time to time like this
is more than enough.

614
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,853
Did you draw that?

615
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,522
That's pretty good.

616
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:37,071
You were drawing it
until a short while ago.

617
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,127
That's right.

618
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,631
I should finish it.

619
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,229
How do you know if it's a dream
about her if she's not in it?

620
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:11,522
I just do.

621
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,441
I can

622
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:15,526
just tell.

623
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:24,493
That drawing

624
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,830
of the seaside seemed familiar.

625
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,502
We were just talking about your dream.
What do you mean, seaside?

626
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,796
I've seen that seaside…

627
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,633
That seaside…

628
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,018
FLOWER MASTER'S SHRINE

629
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,230
You want me

630
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,191
to curse him?

631
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,826
I may be great at making
effective amulets, but I can't do this.

632
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,161
I can't. I won't.

633
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,830
This is Bae Gyeon-U.

634
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,749
Young and handsome,
Heaven and Earth Fairy's first love.

635
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:16,879
Exactly.

636
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,049
I hate his guts.

637
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:22,635
Do it yourself if you must.
You're powerful.

638
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:23,719
I'm too powerful.

639
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:26,180
If I curse him, he'll die.

640
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,562
Anyway, where's Heaven and Earth Fairy?
Why are you out here?

641
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,857
If I tell you, will you curse him for me?

642
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,443
I shouldn't even bother.

643
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,904
Darn it. I knew you wouldn't help.

644
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,073
I'm off.

645
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,032
Already?

646
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:48,744
It's bad for you if I stay too long.
Do you want to die an early death?

647
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:51,414
You've become much cruder
since we last met.

648
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,377
How's finding your name going?

649
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,213
Darn you.
I'd have crossed over if I'd found it

650
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,798
instead of coming to see you.

651
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,551
You're so annoying.

652
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,678
Whatever. I'm getting out of here.

653
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,055
Looking at your ugly mug
disgusts me every moment.

654
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,516
You're crazy.
It's not like I asked you to come.

655
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,977
Hello? Are you in, Flower Master?

656
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,936
Speak of the devil.

657
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:14,854
Are you in?

658
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,022
Sure, hang on!

659
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,024
Wait a minute!

660
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:18,941
Hey, you. Come here.

661
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,360
-Get in here.
-No, wait.

662
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:23,696
Won't I die in here?
Don't you know of Crown Prince Sado?

663
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,281
I don't know. Shut up and get inside.

664
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,782
-Hurry.
-Damn it.

665
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:27,867
Hang on!

666
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,411
Oh, dear.

667
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:35,916
Come on in!

668
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,149
Save yourself energy.

669
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,526
We need the deity to come back.

670
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:04,695
Until then,

671
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:08,949
the shrine will only become eerier,
no matter how hard you clean it.

672
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,410
I know that.

673
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,579
But it bothers me

674
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,374
to just let it be.

675
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,091
You put in so much effort and work.

676
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,885
I hope the deity returns quickly.

677
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:40,856
It seems the elder shaman
prayed for your little one

678
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,775
until the day she passed.

679
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:45,528
The old hag.

680
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,990
Did she think I'd thank her for it?

681
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:53,661
It seems you are feeling thankful, though.

682
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,918
What are those?

683
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,297
These are the items

684
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,550
belonging to people

685
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:10,219
the elder shaman prayed for until the end.

686
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:17,601
This is Lady Fairy's.

687
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,771
Maybe not.

688
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,815
She used it for the Human Amulet spell,

689
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,025
so maybe I should say
it belongs to Gyeon-U.

690
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,575
If that's the case,

691
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,910
you should give it to Gyeon-U.

692
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,796
That way, we can reconnect

693
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,882
the ties that have been broken.

694
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:50,843
What?

695
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:55,639
Never mind. I was distracted for a second.

696
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:05,733
She said if Seong-A
appears in my dream dressed in white,

697
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,235
it means she's dead.

698
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,946
I was also told

699
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:14,241
that because we were once bound
by a strong spell,

700
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,786
I should see it in a dream
if anything bad happened to her.

701
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,956
Of course.
The dead would visit you in a dream.

702
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,833
Damn it, it's suffocating in here.

703
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:24,793
I might actually die.

704
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:27,463
But I'm positive

705
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,589
that Seong-A's fine.

706
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,009
That's what my gut tells me.

707
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,428
I know it sounds weird,

708
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,764
but it feels like she's close by.

709
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,098
Even now,

710
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,517
I feel like she's right next to me.

711
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,479
Really?

712
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,607
Oh, and whenever I have a dream,

713
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,609
I can sense Seong-A's presence.

714
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,152
Very strongly, too.

715
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:52,947
When the heck will he leave?

716
00:58:58,494 --> 00:58:59,912
What was that sound?

717
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,080
Wait, what?

718
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,874
What noise? I didn't hear anything.

719
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,672
There's no one else in that dream,

720
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:11,882
and I don't see her.

721
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,928
But it feels like Seong-A is there.

722
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,810
-There's something in there.
-In there?

723
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,853
There's nothing in there. Nothing at all.

724
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,272
This is what you heard.

725
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:28,440
-I think there is something.
-No, hey. There's nothing.

726
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:30,359
-Oh, screw it.
-There's something in…

727
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,366
You're a talker, aren't you?

728
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:38,951
Seong-A.

729
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:46,792
Seong-A.

730
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,635
That rascal.

731
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,515
Hey!

732
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:03,559
Hey, wait up.

733
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:04,935
Dang it.

734
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:06,353
Hey!

735
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:08,689
Hey, you.

736
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,858
Stop running.

737
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:17,072
Darn it. I don't know anymore.

738
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,723
Damn, I can't move over.

739
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,769
"Damn"?

740
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:52,691
Seong-A…

741
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,069
Hey.

742
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:57,988
I'm obviously not her.

743
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,785
Her spirit vessel is cracking.

744
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,745
Shamanistic practice's
all about equivalent exchange.

745
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:48,539
When one life withers,

746
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,749
another blooms.

747
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,334
Die in the shaman's place.

748
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:54,128
I'm begging you.

749
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,462
What do I have to do?

750
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:57,381
By the time you wake up,

751
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,341
it will all be over.

752
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,010
It's not fair
that I'm the only one to die.

753
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,471
What makes you think
you're the only one to die today?

754
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:05,889
Where is Yeomhwa?

755
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:08,559
I'll help you cross over without pain.

756
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:10,727
You shouldn't be around me.

757
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:11,645
Goodbye.
