1
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,531
Let go.

2
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:13,908
Let go of me!

3
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,287
Release me. Let go!

4
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,915
-I understand your sorrows.
-Let me go.

5
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,333
-But we must do this.
-Let go.

6
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,709
You'll die otherwise, Yeomhwa.

7
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:24,919
Let go of me.

8
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,630
Let me go. Untie me, please.

9
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,673
Untie me.

10
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,509
Release me.

11
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,385
Let me go.

12
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,223
Let go of me.

13
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:38,808
Let go.

14
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,811
Let me go.

15
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,194
Come to me.

16
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,906
Darling baby, come to me.

17
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,283
My dear baby.

18
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,370
Come back to mommy.

19
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,373
Come to mommy.

20
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,545
-Come to mommy.
-What on earth are you doing?

21
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,341
No! No, don't do that.

22
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,344
-No one should've held that ritual then,
-Mom.

23
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,762
-including you.
-Please don't.

24
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,472
-It had to be stopped.
-Mom!

25
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,850
Give my baby back to me, Mom.

26
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,269
Please.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,189
You brought a coffin.

28
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,942
You hadn't bought a single shoe

29
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,487
or even swaddling clothes for my baby,

30
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,573
but you bought…

31
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,870
and brought a pretty coffin
that was just the right fit

32
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,746
for my baby!

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,709
It wasn't because I resented you
for leaving me, your spirit-mother.

34
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,504
Even a mother has to let her child go
after they have passed away.

35
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,008
The moment you turn the child into a deity
to keep them with you,

36
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:58,137
the bond between you two
turns into an ill karmic bond.

37
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,017
You'd only become a fraud shaman
by serving the wrong patron deity.

38
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,852
But what about the baby?

39
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,646
A ghost that dares pretend to be a deity

40
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,190
receives divine punishment.

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,526
They can't cross over.

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,486
They have to wander forever in limbo.

43
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,323
How could you do that to your child

44
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,241
just to save yourself from loneliness?

45
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,327
No!

46
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,579
You're wrong!

47
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,750
I could have found it.

48
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,293
I…

49
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,379
I could've found a way!

50
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,214
I could have…

51
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,054
I would've managed to protect my child,

52
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,264
whatever it took.

53
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,642
You couldn't have.

54
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,560
There's no way you could've done it!

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,231
Even I struggle to keep you safe.

56
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,192
There's no way
you could've protected your child.

57
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,032
Don't dig your heels in and let it go.

58
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,410
Ma'am.

59
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,162
Help me tie another knot.

60
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,246
Don't do it.

61
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,165
Stop.

62
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,250
Stop it.

63
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,836
Stop it.

64
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,547
Stop. Don't do it.

65
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,341
Hello.

66
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,719
I'll now begin Group Two's presentation
for the Life and Ethics class.

67
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,097
I'm Cho Hye-ri, the presenter.

68
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,645
Our group…

69
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,648
We can go ahead with your deal
starting tomorrow.

70
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,108
Let's keep him inside at school today.

71
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,818
I can't trust Bong-su.

72
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,194
Won't he get angry?

73
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,154
That's all the more reason
to keep him inside.

74
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,823
-We humans have dignity…
-Okay.

75
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:44,702
…because we have free will and autonomy.

76
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,829
As rational beings,

77
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,790
we set up rules and follow them,

78
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,793
-making us unique…
-How long will you stay like that?

79
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,713
-We have our reasons.
-Like what?

80
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,589
It's complicated.
I'll explain after class.

81
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,716
Go back to your seat.

82
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,137
-Hey.
-Don't. Return to your seat.

83
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,265
-Go back.
-Just go back to your seat.

84
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,517
According to Kant's personalism…

85
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,354
Kant…

86
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,857
-Hey.
-Kant argued…

87
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,108
Kant…

88
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,902
Well, Kant claimed…

89
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,072
HUMAN = MEANS X, PURPOSE O

90
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,783
Kant's personalism states

91
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,785
that humans should not be treated
as a means to an end

92
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,787
but as an end in themselves,

93
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,831
emphasizing human dignity.

94
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:00,903
Done.

95
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,707
One day…

96
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,504
you'll bitterly regret
performing that rite for me.

97
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,838
Regretting is…

98
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,758
what you'll be doing starting now.

99
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,054
Flower Master,
drop the drumstick and come here.

100
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,186
Put her in the prayer room.

101
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,314
You won't kick her out?

102
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,441
Why would I kick her out?

103
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,277
I must get paid for my troubles.

104
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,696
Do you know how expensive
my curse-cleansing rites are?

105
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,907
You're talking about money right now?

106
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,326
You have my utter respect.

107
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,500
How much do you want?

108
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,418
You won't pay with money.

109
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,129
Pay with your devotion.

110
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,676
"Devotion"?

111
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,304
Devotion, huh?

112
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,394
You're always on about devotion.

113
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,603
I see it now.

114
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,274
You want your pathetic faux-mom role back.
Am I right?

115
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,736
Listen, General Dongcheon.

116
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,239
The mom who abandoned me…

117
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,534
At least I'm her flesh and blood.

118
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,328
But what are you to me?

119
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,414
Spirit-mother?

120
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,417
That's someone who helps another
receive and serve a deity.

121
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,836
And I ditched my patron deity long ago.

122
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,506
So you're nothing to me now. Just…

123
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,800
Just take my money.

124
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,722
It must be nice to be rich.

125
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,265
You abandoned me.

126
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,064
You gave up on me.

127
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,775
You ditched me for being unclean.

128
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,653
Why would you take me back
and use your energy on me?

129
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,996
You found my stand-in long ago.

130
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,749
You're plain despicable.

131
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,003
When will you abandon her?

132
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,757
She's at the age
where she'd start to disobey you.

133
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,175
That's too harsh.

134
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,676
Ma'am.

135
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,178
Do you want to make a bet

136
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,349
on whether dear General Dongcheon
abandons her or not?

137
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:49,947
Does it have to be you two?

138
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,783
What about me?
I was Gyeon-U's Human Amulet too.

139
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,868
Would you do it if you could?

140
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,662
-You bet.
-Ji-ho--

141
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,580
I don't like seeing you two holding hands.

142
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,624
People might think you're dating.

143
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,794
Wait. Are you dating?

144
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:04,962
No.

145
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,005
We're not dating. Absolutely not.

146
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,051
Did you have to say "absolutely not"?

147
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,769
We're in a dangerous situation
where Bong-su comes and goes.

148
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,272
Whether we're dating
or not isn't important now.

149
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,190
Of course, it is.

150
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,985
To be honest, I think it's important too.

151
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,619
Actually, I like Seong-A.

152
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,292
Your dog, the white dog.

153
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,502
She's always by your side,
keeping you safe.

154
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,503
No.

155
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,013
BOK-I

156
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:01,977
Thanks for earlier.

157
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,104
You're actually thanking me?

158
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,690
Did an alien take over your body?

159
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,984
You're hopeless.

160
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,697
I hated working with you, and I hope
we never work together again.

161
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,326
That's what I wanted too.

162
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,786
I'll give you a farewell gift.

163
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,165
No, thanks.

164
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,459
Just accept it!

165
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,627
I was always bothered by your messy hair.

166
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,004
Can you lose this ghost look?

167
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,173
I get a jump scare whenever I see you.

168
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,174
Not my business.

169
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,052
Keep still. I'll make you look pretty.

170
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,179
The other side too, like this.

171
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,891
This actually suits you. Let me just…

172
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,727
Let me see.

173
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,313
You look pretty.

174
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,024
-Bok-i is by your side.
-You look so adorable.

175
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,609
-By your side.
-This is amazing.

176
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,861
By your side.

177
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,197
By your side…

178
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,366
You look lovely.

179
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,454
Here. Let me fix this.

180
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,207
If I make them match like this…

181
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,226
Bok-i!

182
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,732
It was you.

183
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,494
Are you crazy?

184
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,331
You're the crazy one here.

185
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,668
It's so annoying.

186
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,170
Why is my only friend such a mess?

187
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,840
I should've chosen a lonely life
without friends.

188
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,468
You're a hot mess.
Why's your nose still up in the air?

189
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,179
Lie low and stay here, for goodness' sake.

190
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,643
I don't intend to leave.

191
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,315
-What?
-The evil spirit's right here.

192
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,443
So why would I leave?
It'd be a waste of energy.

193
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,488
What was all that fuss about, then?

194
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,033
It's what I always do.

195
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,494
Pushing her limits.

196
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,746
Like a test.

197
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,793
You're a beast.

198
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,837
You can't call yourself human.

199
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,842
Man-sik.

200
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,180
You shouldn't hold

201
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,433
someone's hand so recklessly.

202
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,188
But once you do, you must be
even more careful before letting it go.

203
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,483
I'll let go of your hand now.

204
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:56,860
Okay.

205
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,863
I really will do it.

206
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,199
Okay.

207
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,366
For real.

208
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,161
Okay. I'll…

209
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,038
I'll be back.

210
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,209
Okay.

211
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,422
Darn you, Shaman.

212
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,673
I almost pooped myself!

213
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,342
You might as well just go in with me!

214
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,676
Sorry.

215
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,387
Oh, my goodness.

216
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,516
Hey, you! This is the men's room!

217
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,309
A girl shouldn't be here. Get out!

218
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,519
Get lost, will you?

219
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,603
A girl?

220
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,231
There's no one else.
What are you talking about?

221
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,525
Right there. You don't see her?

222
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:38,860
Well, I guess

223
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,738
you've only managed to stay sane
because you can't see ghosts.

224
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,038
I can't write with my left hand.

225
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,748
Sorry.

226
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,055
My name is Bae Gyeon-U, ma'am.

227
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,812
Thank you.

228
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,708
-Isn't that too tight?
-It's to make sure it doesn't get loose.

229
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,922
Actually, I like Seong-A.

230
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,842
Like you said, liking her
made me play dirty.

231
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,512
To be honest, if I could have my way,

232
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,723
I'd ask her to be my girlfriend right now.

233
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,516
But I'm a threat for now,

234
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,353
so I'll find a way
other than physical touch.

235
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,646
But until then,

236
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,815
I'll hold your hand tight.

237
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,113
I won't ever let go.

238
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,950
He wasn't playing dirty at all.

239
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,119
He was so cool.

240
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,665
Not bad, Bae Gyeon-U.

241
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:04,923
Gyeon-U.

242
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,341
Yeah?

243
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,762
Don't you think
we can unwrap the bandage now?

244
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,055
What?

245
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,556
Oh, sure.

246
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,517
My hand is so clammy.

247
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,020
Your hand must be tired
from holding mine all day long.

248
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,272
No. I don't usually sweat much.

249
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,483
It's because I'm nervous.

250
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,115
-Let's undo the bandage.
-Okay.

251
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,541
You must've been surprised
to hear that I like you.

252
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,502
No, I wasn't.

253
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,422
I was just happy.

254
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,302
So tell me.

255
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,929
When did you start thinking I'm pretty?

256
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,764
What?

257
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,391
That's how it starts, right?

258
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,226
You keep looking at the girl
because she's pretty

259
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,728
and then fall for her.

260
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,314
I don't know. What about you?

261
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,276
You answered a question with a question.
That's sneaky.

262
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,612
But I already have an answer prepared.

263
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,240
It was from the start.

264
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,241
"The start"?

265
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,993
Yeah, from the start.

266
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,539
The day
you walked into my shrine upside-down.

267
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,710
I fell for you at first sight

268
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,254
because you were so handsome.

269
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,425
So you fell for my looks?

270
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,509
Yeah.

271
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,595
That's silly.

272
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,599
And then you said

273
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,101
that you'd stand by others.

274
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,313
That you'd stand in silence

275
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,190
next to a crying person.

276
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,319
That seemed like the best way

277
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,614
to console someone you don't know.

278
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,617
It's the kindest, warmest way.

279
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,662
That was a valuable lesson
I learned from you that day.

280
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,875
That's why you stayed by my side

281
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,503
even though I kept pushing you away.

282
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:14,886
I remember now.

283
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,348
You know,

284
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,517
the day

285
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,770
you patted me on my head.

286
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,396
We were on the rooftop.

287
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:30,693
That day,

288
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,320
I found you…

289
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:35,865
really pretty.

290
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,300
Hey!

291
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,637
Hey.

292
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,764
Ji-ho, are you okay?

293
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:42,807
Are you all right?

294
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,311
Seong-A.

295
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,319
There's something I must tell you.

296
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,534
I like you.

297
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,036
What?

298
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,054
DO-YEON = BOK-I

299
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,142
Could you sit a little further from me?

300
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,062
Why? Are you afraid of me?

301
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,732
Or am I sitting so close to you

302
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,735
that you feel uncomfortable?

303
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,195
No, it's not that.

304
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,573
You reek of cigarettes.

305
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,909
I have asthma, you see.

306
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:44,827
What?

307
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,123
So you're sick…

308
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,335
because I smoke?

309
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,922
You could say that.

310
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,816
I won't smoke again until the day I die.

311
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,235
So none of you can smoke either!

312
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,238
If I catch any of you smoking,
you're dead meat!

313
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,659
You're the only smoker here.

314
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,408
Jeez.

315
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,118
It's damn so loud, Beom.

316
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,494
Just take the call.

317
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,288
Oh, sorry.

318
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,498
I don't take calls from unknown numbers.

319
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,459
BEST FRIEND

320
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,046
Maeng Ju-seung.

321
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,088
Oh, he picked up.

322
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,548
Hey, hold on.

323
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,927
Hey, Beom. It's me.

324
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,222
We parted in such a hurry yesterday
that I couldn't get your number.

325
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,641
We hadn't met in a while
since middle school.

326
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,435
You know I missed you, don't you?

327
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,855
The other number is mine, so save it.

328
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,065
Give it to me, quick.

329
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,149
Okay, bye.

330
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,194
Hey, Beom.

331
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,945
You're studying, right?

332
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,114
Study hard. Good luck.

333
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,581
Did you see how he took my call?

334
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,458
We're the best of friends.

335
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,877
You really are the best of friends.

336
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,297
You transferred to Pyeongtan High School?

337
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,674
Hit me up if you have questions
about the neighborhood.

338
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:06,052
I know this area inside-out.

339
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,304
I'm good. I just needed Beom's number.

340
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,942
I don't know when it started.

341
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,486
But after Gyeon-U
transferred to our school

342
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,488
and you started crushing on Gyeon-U,

343
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,823
it became clear to me

344
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,242
that I'd already fallen for you.

345
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,036
I'm sorry.

346
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,038
I had no idea.

347
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,792
If I think about it,
I became Gyeon-U's friend

348
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,045
and became his Human Amulet
all because of you.

349
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:44,257
I like you, and your first love might die.

350
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,092
If he were to die,

351
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,052
you would be devastated.

352
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,345
He's your first love.

353
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,434
So I helped you protect your first love
and ended up making a fool of myself.

354
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,854
You and Gyeon-U hold hands,

355
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,648
and I just have to watch.

356
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,733
Hey.

357
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,319
You're not a fool. Why would you say that?

358
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,946
I know I'm late.

359
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,657
I know I'm being
so uncool and pathetic too.

360
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,118
But Seong-A.

361
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,329
Do you know what drives me crazy the most?

362
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,666
What is it?

363
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,796
The fact that even now…

364
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,177
you have to be holding Gyeon-U's hand.

365
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,140
Sorry. I…

366
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,102
I have no choice. Bong-su possessed me.

367
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,063
Sorry. I haven't exorcised
Bong-su just yet.

368
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,148
I'm really sorry.

369
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,860
Who confesses their love
in front of their rival?

370
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,196
Is this even a confession?

371
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,488
Isn't this an exorcism?

372
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,616
And you still think I'm not a fool?

373
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:54,911
I'm sorry.

374
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,251
Seong-A. Don't reject me yet.

375
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,421
I was too busy fighting Gyeon-U's fate

376
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,381
that I never got to fight him for you.

377
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,258
I can't give up like this just yet.

378
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,344
Even if I get rejected,

379
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,221
I want it to be
after Bong-su or Bong-pal is gone.

380
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,347
Okay?

381
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,391
Then…

382
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,268
First of all,

383
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,729
thanks for telling me
about your precious feelings.

384
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,857
I mean it when I say this.

385
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,318
It's more than I deserve.

386
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,737
Don't be so nice.

387
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,572
I'll fall for you even more.

388
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,824
Yeah, don't be so nice.

389
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,911
Can't you just pretend you're not there?

390
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,704
Fine.

391
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,915
Here's a suggestion.

392
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,503
Let's keep our first loves
on hold for now.

393
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:49,090
Once we get rid of Bong-su
and everything's back to normal,

394
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,342
-let's talk again then.
-Okay.

395
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,135
-Okay?
-Sounds good.

396
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,972
Good. Shall we all get up?

397
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,349
Gyeon-U has to pack his things.

398
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,729
Hey, Shaman. Give me just ten seconds.

399
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,440
You, partner. You're not a fool.

400
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,401
You're not a fool.
You're a massive pushover.

401
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,528
I just couldn't stand your pathetic tale.

402
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,113
Dude, don't insult fools, okay?

403
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:20,204
No, Ji-ho. You know that wasn't me.

404
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,122
Let go of his hand.

405
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,499
-Wait. That wasn't Gyeon-U.
-Please calm down, Ji-ho.

406
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,835
-What did you just say?
-Calm down. That wasn't me.

407
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,837
-Come out!
-Ji-ho, don't.

408
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,755
Hey! You're absolutely a pushover!

409
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,132
What's so great about her anyway?

410
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,383
Hey, stop it!

411
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:35,094
Ji-ho, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

412
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,649
Darn it.

413
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,818
You perished like this.

414
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,237
My precious treasure number one.

415
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,573
Hey, are you okay?

416
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,745
It feels like my heart
is being ripped apart.

417
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,457
Thanks, Ji-ho. And I'm sorry.

418
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,421
-Seong-A, what about yours?
-Mine?

419
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,717
It's completely unharmed.

420
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:17,928
Sorry.

421
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,889
Don't be.

422
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,600
My love for Gyeon-U
wasn't as strong as yours.

423
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,019
Gyeon-U.

424
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,896
I'll love you even more now.

425
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,607
Thanks.

426
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,109
Shall we pack up and go?

427
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,570
Yeah, let's hurry.

428
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,613
Let's go.

429
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,490
Wait. Stop.

430
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,953
Do you two hold hands in bed too?

431
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,331
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

432
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,500
Doesn't it make it hard to fall asleep?

433
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,002
-How so?
-Not really.

434
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,005
No. It's not hard at all.

435
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,257
Why would it…

436
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,301
ever be hard?

437
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,851
Ji-ho, that shrewd punk.

438
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,896
I should get rid of Bong-su soon.

439
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,483
This is pure torture.

440
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:25,996
What the…

441
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,420
Her sleeping habit is

442
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,296
too dangerous.

443
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:37,800
Hang on.

444
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,731
JIN SOJU

445
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,859
Allow me just one bottle.

446
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,903
This is the best when you're frustrated.

447
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,850
When a person gets drunk,

448
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,811
they want to be honest.

449
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,361
Someone told me

450
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,072
that parents and children

451
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,409
are bound to break each other's hearts.

452
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,289
Parents break their children's hearts,

453
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,792
and children do the same
to their parents' hearts.

454
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,254
And they do so without realizing it.

455
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,967
You might not have birthed them,

456
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,386
but if they break your heart…

457
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,682
that means they're yours.

458
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,995
Ghosts are strongest
during the Hour of the Ox.

459
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,917
She will make a move
to meet with the evil spirit.

460
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,387
HOUR OF THE OX: 1:30 A.M. TO 3:30 A.M.
THE HOURS OF GHOSTS

461
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,664
Shaman.

462
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,375
When you're living with a ghost,

463
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,294
you should never sleep
during the Hour of the Ox.

464
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:19,920
Okay?

465
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,172
You idiot.

466
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,427
You're sleeping like a baby.

467
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,366
This is real.

468
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,508
If I touch you,
I'll turn into Gyeon-U, right?

469
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,678
You really are

470
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,097
something special.

471
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:29,782
Can I speak to you?

472
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,661
How diligent.

473
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,792
You're staying a while in him,
unlike the other offerings.

474
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,044
Usually, they lose their minds

475
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,879
as soon as I possess them.

476
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,714
But this kid is fine.

477
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:49,093
Maybe it's because of all his misfortune.
His body is pretty unique.

478
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:55,557
Please start preparing
to be my patron deity.

479
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,102
The longer you stay in a human body,

480
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,438
the more real the pain of death feels
when you leave it.

481
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:05,693
This amulet will ease the pain of death.

482
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,410
Have you died before?

483
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,162
Do you even know the pain?

484
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,124
I have been in pain

485
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,917
that was as bad as death.

486
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,335
Bullshit.

487
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,504
That's different.

488
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,346
Is it?

489
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,933
When shall I do the rite to receive you?

490
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,852
Oh, that?

491
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,229
Don't do it.
I'll stay in this body for a while.

492
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,815
How long do you mean?

493
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,819
I don't know.

494
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,612
About ten years at least?

495
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,115
You can't do that.

496
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,200
Then how about

497
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,410
20 years?

498
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:05,335
You know it's more fun
to bully the mean ones

499
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,337
than it is to bully nice ones, right?

500
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,007
Mean ones don't just give in.

501
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,426
They fight desperately.

502
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:17,181
And watching that is real good fun.

503
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,683
I wonder

504
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,186
where you would rank
among all the mean ones

505
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,689
that I've met so far.

506
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,154
You're number one.

507
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,826
You're the worst.

508
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,372
Do you want to vanish for good?

509
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,753
Look at you
showing your true colors right away.

510
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,339
You'll perish if you don't come to me now.

511
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,300
Come on.

512
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,303
I didn't say I won't come to you. I will.

513
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,554
But you see,

514
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:58,889
I don't want to now.

515
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,151
Do you know

516
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,363
if the "hwa" in Yeomhwa's name
means "flower"?

517
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,033
Her "hwa" means "ripe and beautiful."

518
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,284
Why do you ask?

519
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,913
Because she's screwed
like a plucked flower.

520
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,836
Why glare when I used nice words?

521
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,295
Flowers are…

522
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,468
She's such a nuisance.

523
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,611
"Book on the Secrets of Thwarting Evil"?

524
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,239
Goodness.

525
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,409
So she's reading this?
I guess she's a shaman after all.

526
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,712
What's this?

527
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,714
"The third day, the Hour of the Ox."

528
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:17,509
This means "day," not "ox."
She got the character wrong.

529
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,597
You need to be way prettier
to make up for your lack of brains.

530
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,098
Shall we say…

531
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,643
about twice as pretty?

532
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,815
Let's have a look.

533
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,109
What does this book say?

534
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,946
Did you enjoy the show?

535
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:40,657
Darn it.

536
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,786
What are you all doing there?

537
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,414
It looks like you'll be around
for ten more years.

538
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:51,084
You'll have to use up all your savings
to pay rent to me.

539
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,377
That's too bad.

540
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,758
I had my doubts,
but I didn't think it'd be this bad.

541
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,553
What do you think you're doing?

542
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:12,940
I had particularly horrible nightmares

543
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,525
over the last few nights.

544
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,154
Heaven and Earth Fairy
canceled all her appointments

545
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,656
and closed her shrine temporarily.

546
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,617
And it got harder to reach Dongcheon.

547
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,120
So I assumed
something must be going on here.

548
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,166
But turns out, you were creating problems
instead of handling them.

549
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,294
Big Sister. Please calm down
and hear me out--

550
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,004
I should have stabbed you in the neck

551
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,090
and not the eyes, shouldn't I?

552
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,384
Then you would've gone to the other side

553
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,512
where you could rest in peace
without having to see all this.

554
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,180
You'd be at peace.

555
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,725
-Oh, you can't see anything now either.
-Shut your mouth.

556
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,854
What's all this noise?

557
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,524
My child!

558
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,526
Why are you holding a ghost's hand?

559
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,902
Let go immediately.

560
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,698
Great Aunt. Gyeon-U isn't a ghost.

561
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,782
He is a ghost!

562
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:05,742
He's a deadly one, at that!

563
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,786
Get lost this instant!

564
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,497
This isn't a spirit you can handle.

565
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,665
Get away from him.

566
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,208
Let go of his hand.

567
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,085
You'll die if you don't let go.

568
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,086
Let go, or you'll die!

569
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,380
-Great Aunt.
-Let go, I tell you!

570
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,007
I don't want to. I won't.

571
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,216
Seong-A!

572
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,427
How dare you…

573
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,056
Who's this hag of a shaman?

574
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,271
Stay away!

575
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,939
Or I'll snap her neck.

576
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,399
You evil spirit!

577
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,777
How much evil did you commit
that everything's so dark?

578
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:41,987
You're in pitch-black darkness!

579
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,364
Ghosts with countless grudges.

580
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,450
-Some wish death, and some don't.
-That hurts. Hey!

581
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,285
-If you wish death, face me.
-Stop.

582
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,453
If you don't, run from me.

583
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,539
As the Head Ghost Hunter of the heavens,
I wield the Dragon Sword to defeat you.

584
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,833
-I told you to stop.
-A single blow shall do wonders!

585
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,918
Stop it. I said stop it!

586
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,754
-You little…
-Bong-su, no!

587
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,344
No?

588
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,346
Why not?

589
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,183
She tried to kill me, but I should stop?

590
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,893
Why can't I hurt her back?

591
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,311
You just can't.

592
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,231
Don't come closer. Don't move.

593
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,484
I told you not to move.

594
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,277
This isn't who you are.

595
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,862
Don't do this.

596
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,197
Hey.

597
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,448
The mountains shall shatter…

598
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,824
-Big Sister!
-Gyeon-U.

599
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,660
Great Aunt.

600
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:34,122
I apologize. I'll take care of it.

601
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,040
I'm sorry.

602
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,418
Get him. You can't let him get away.

603
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,968
What are you doing? Step aside.

604
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,221
What friend would let their friend

605
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,306
jump into a blazing fire?

606
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,892
A spirit that knocked out the elder shaman

607
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,228
can easily kill you where you stand, girl.

608
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,197
I wasn't going to go this far.

609
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,615
But I have to. Bong-su is too vicious.

610
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,158
What are you doing?

611
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,912
Seong-A. Listen carefully.

612
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,456
On my signal, let go of my hand,
go outside, and call me.

613
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,584
Wait outside
until Bong-su promises not to hurt anyone.

614
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,461
Don't you dare open the door before then.

615
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,380
And keep calling me, okay?

616
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:24,297
Here.

617
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,011
Sorry. I want to explain what I'm doing,
but if I do, Bong-su will catch on.

618
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,763
Just trust me.

619
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,849
I have a plan.

620
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:36,935
Big Sister.

621
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,315
My recitation of the sacred text
chasing away evil

622
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,860
should've given him unbearable pain

623
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,820
in all parts of his body

624
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,197
starting from the ears,
eyes, mouth, and nose.

625
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:50,407
But in his case,

626
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,034
only his ears hurt.

627
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:56,746
I've never seen something so menacing
in all 70 years of my life.

628
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,543
On three, let go of my hand and get out.

629
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,253
-Don't turn around.
-Okay.

630
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,546
One.

631
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,463
-Two.
-Two.

632
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:07,340
-Three.
-Three.

633
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,975
What the heck are they plotting?

634
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,643
BAE GYEON-U

635
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:23,732
What's that?

636
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,234
Stop it.

637
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,195
Hey! Stop it!

638
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,322
Stop! That's enough!

639
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,573
Turn it off, quick!

640
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,408
Don't do this. Stop!

641
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,993
Stop it!

642
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,037
Turn it off now!

643
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,038
Stop!

644
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,292
Don't do it!

645
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,460
Stop it, damn it!

646
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:00,894
Hey, Bong-su.

647
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,229
Are you okay?

648
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,148
Stop it!

649
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,036
Bong-su.

650
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,038
Promise you won't do it again.

651
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,209
Promise you won't harm a person again!

652
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,219
Okay.

653
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,096
I won't.

654
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,349
I won't harm people from now on.

655
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:41,977
Say, "I'm sorry."

656
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,063
I'm sorry.

657
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:59,744
I've figured out how to handle Bong-su.

658
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,205
I'll do my best to keep him under control.

659
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,710
And if I think Seong-A will be in danger,

660
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,170
I'll tell you right away.

661
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:15,302
Your ears still hurt, don't they?

662
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:19,389
Yes.

663
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:21,099
That's yeongcheong.

664
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,976
Your ears have opened.

665
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,563
From now on, you will hear ghosts.

666
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,982
Hearing them isn't too bad.

667
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,026
You can still live among people.

668
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,155
Ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.

669
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,866
Ghosts take over your senses
in that order.

670
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,453
Yeongcheong. You will hear ghosts.

671
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,413
Yeongan. You will see ghosts.

672
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,665
Yeongseol.
You will share your tongue with them.

673
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:49,252
Yeongbi. You will smell ghosts.

674
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:51,671
Once you see ghosts,

675
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:53,590
the world you live in changes.

676
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,091
Start sharing their language,

677
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:58,136
and you will end up living
how the ghosts want you to.

678
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,055
Once you're able to smell them,

679
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,265
there's no turning back.

680
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:04,934
You become that ghost

681
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,354
and that ghost becomes you.

682
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,857
Whenever you sense a change in your body,

683
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,485
you must alert us.

684
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,113
Okay. I'll remember that.

685
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,074
Good.

686
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,495
Great Aunt. Can I ask for a favor?

687
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,164
-A favor?
-Yes.

688
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,166
I'm a shaman,

689
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,628
so I can hear, see,
speak with, and smell ghosts.

690
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,048
But you don't call me a ghost.

691
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,550
Gyeon-U can only hear ghosts,

692
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,594
and he's the one
who managed to subdue Bong-su--

693
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,970
I'm sorry

694
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,515
for calling you a deadly ghost.

695
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,558
I shouldn't have done that.

696
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,268
I apologize.

697
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,815
That's exactly what I wanted.

698
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,276
Please don't worry about it. It's okay.

699
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,319
I really don't mind.

700
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:01,324
I've been wanting to ask.

701
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:02,867
What are you doing here?

702
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:07,414
Oh, you met each other,
but you don't know each other's history?

703
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,957
No, Yeomhwa knows yours.

704
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,126
But you're rude as hell,
so you won't say hi, will you?

705
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,545
Heaven and Earth Fairy,
say hi to her first.

706
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,296
She's your spirit-sister…

707
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,424
No, they cut ties,
so she's your ex-spirit-sister.

708
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,428
Introducing Yeomhwa,
General Dongcheon's spirit-daughter.

709
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,432
She's doing all she can to stick around

710
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:28,101
and receive the evil spirit
in the young and handsome teen's body

711
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,019
as her patron deity,

712
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,479
but you don't have to mind her.

713
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:32,981
She's no more than a withering flower.

714
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,899
She's so screwed.

715
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:38,695
Yeomhwa. Why don't you take it as a sign
and change the "hwa" in your name

716
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,738
to the character that means "flower"?

717
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:42,073
Shut your mouth.

718
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,701
It's unbelievable.

719
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,453
A talking flower!

720
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,623
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

721
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:54,127
For how long were you going to
shoulder the burden alone?

722
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,879
I'm so ashamed that I have no words.

723
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:59,799
I'd like you to call me from now on.

724
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:02,552
Dongcheon isn't thick-skinned enough
to ask for help,

725
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:05,305
so she'll keep it to herself
and struggle alone.

726
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,264
Okay, ma'am.

727
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,432
Leave it.

728
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,185
I'll try to handle it on my own from here.

729
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,104
The law of equivalent exchange
is at the root of our profession.

730
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,023
You have just one life,

731
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,858
but you have two lives to protect.

732
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,652
Don't listen to her. I'm more senior.

733
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:21,696
Of course.

734
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:23,531
Go back inside, both.

735
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,200
No need to see me out.

736
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:28,786
Bong-su.

737
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,625
I can't say I'm sorry.

738
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,129
But I will make you this promise.

739
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:40,590
If you don't do anything,

740
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:42,425
I won't either.

741
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,350
That hurts.

742
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,396
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Yeah.

743
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,650
It's like he cried with this whole body.

744
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,278
You rarely say you're not fine.

745
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:04,906
Wait, Gyeon-U.

746
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:10,119
Bong-su.

747
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:11,829
He promised.

748
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:15,375
You almost killed Great Aunt.
You don't have the right to sulk.

749
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,334
Let it go.

750
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,006
I'll keep holding Gyeon-U's hand
at school, then.

751
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,633
I won't lend you his body.

752
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,428
Promise.

753
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,023
What do you want to do with his body
at school anyway?

754
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:44,779
There's something I must find.

755
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,536
You said you were looking for a name.

756
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,455
Why not go to the teachers' office
and look through old yearbooks?

757
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,125
Would I search for a name here

758
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,294
if it were in a yearbook?

759
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,091
You.

760
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,427
You need to become three times prettier.

761
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,804
Double the looks
won't get you anywhere, dummy.

762
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,557
The world would only go easy on you
if you were three times as pretty.

763
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:14,309
What?

764
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,899
Hey, it's time for archery practice.

765
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,652
You promised, remember?

766
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,872
Your upper body
shouldn't be stiff and tense.

767
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,666
Your legs should prop you up.
Relax as you draw the bow.

768
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,960
You should be relaxed to score high.

769
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:50,303
Gyeon-U.

770
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,055
This gesture.

771
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,641
Why do you do that?

772
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,145
It's a routine. It's a habit of sorts.

773
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,356
Does the routine help?

774
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,316
It's more like

775
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:07,570
I do it without thinking,
like how you breathe without thinking.

776
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,990
Hey, you punk.

777
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,243
The competition's around the corner.
Get a hold of yourself.

778
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,204
Who said you could date during training?

779
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,374
Since when do we shoot in pairs?

780
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,958
If you want to work in pairs,

781
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,669
switch to pair skating.

782
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,587
Coach. Nice one.

783
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,340
-Sir.
-What?

784
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:31,552
In that case…

785
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,639
Go ahead.

786
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,767
Coach. Are you stupid?

787
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,193
Oh, nice shot.

788
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,653
I knew it.

789
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,613
You talented thing.

790
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,448
Are you all stupid?

791
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,451
Try again.

792
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,287
HANRAGI

793
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,414
D-7

794
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:14,262
HANRAGI
D-6

795
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,864
HANRAGI
D-5

796
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:49,672
Hey.

797
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:52,383
Why are you using hanja in your notes?

798
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:54,719
Because this is easier.

799
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,494
MEMORIAL STONE WITH NAMES
OF STUDENT SOLDIERS MOVED TO YUWOL PARK

800
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,250
They moved it.

801
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,135
How moist.

802
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,971
It reminds me
of being whipped with minari.

803
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,766
Are you having fun playing with kids?

804
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:48,981
Yeah.

805
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:50,817
It's fun.

806
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,242
It's about time you came to your senses.

807
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,538
If you stay in his body,

808
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,040
you might perish.

809
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,134
What if I do?

810
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:18,928
Do you have a way out?

811
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:20,805
Hey.

812
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,642
You can't be a shaman
without me as your patron deity.

813
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,853
Did you forget we're bound by a spell?

814
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,731
So be nice to me, okay?

815
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,901
Guard me and look after me.

816
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:46,289
What should we do?

817
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:49,834
The competition is just around the corner

818
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:53,462
but I can't find a way
to separate you and Gyeon-U.

819
00:52:55,298 --> 00:52:56,716
Come here. Let's have a look.

820
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,012
What are you doing?

821
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:06,100
You look a little prettier,
or maybe you don't.

822
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,561
What does that mean?

823
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:10,646
You idiot.

824
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:14,859
What good will staring at an open book do
when you can't read any of this?

825
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,906
This is about Human Amulets.
I know this part.

826
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,616
Do you? Then read this line.

827
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,492
What does it say?

828
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,081
It's not important.

829
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,167
You say that because
you don't know what it says.

830
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,126
Learn hanja, will you?

831
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,129
"Eokmae," how to suppress ghosts.

832
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,008
"Eokmae"?

833
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,682
You can't be a shaman
without me as your patron deity.

834
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,601
Did you forget we're bound by a spell?

835
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,403
I wished for hell.

836
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,698
I vowed to be with you

837
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,285
when you end up in hell.

838
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,830
I made a wholehearted wish.

839
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:12,083
How dare you…

840
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,338
use that against me?

841
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,300
He knows I can't break free from him.

842
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,513
I can't break free from him.

843
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,479
I can't break free from him.

844
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,947
I can't break free.

845
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,324
I can't escape.

846
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:50,413
I have no choice but to get closer.

847
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:55,001
I can get closer to him
than anyone in the world.

848
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,781
"Eokmae," how to suppress ghosts.

849
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:27,575
From the moment roosters clucks at dawn

850
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,952
to the moment when the sun rises
over the horizon the next day…

851
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:31,412
In other words, for exactly one day,

852
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,290
two people can share their fortune

853
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,292
by becoming each other's Human Amulet.

854
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:40,463
What if we do that every day?
Then you can never get out.

855
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,801
It can be done just once in a lifetime.

856
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:06,822
It's done.

857
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,169
Gyeon-U.

858
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,521
Bong-su can't show himself
until this time tomorrow.

859
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,231
But just to be sure…

860
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,443
take this lip balm…

861
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,707
Shall I put it on for you?

862
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:02,336
No, I can do that myself.

863
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,421
Okay. You do that.

864
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:12,721
HANRAGI
D-DAY

865
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,480
11TH HANRAGI ARCHERY COMPETITION

866
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,538
JOONGHYUN HIGH SCHOOL

867
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,749
Lose the glare, Joonghyun High.

868
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:42,668
Are you the coach?

869
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:43,627
I'm in 10th grade.

870
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,338
Do they have two coaches?

871
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,469
Would you look at this?

872
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:53,721
My gosh.

873
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,307
They assigned us the worst spot.

874
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,440
Are you okay?

875
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,319
Of course I'm okay.

876
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,738
Will you assemble my bow for me, then?

877
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:14,992
Give it to me.

878
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,202
Thank you.

879
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,212
There's this thing called
Unify Spell, Newly-Dead.

880
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,506
You use it when you want to
become one with someone.

881
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:32,593
We're connected by the evil spirit.

882
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,054
What do you think will happen to you

883
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,389
if you receive my ill energy?

884
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,976
You'll beg to be killed,

885
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,103
don't you think?

886
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,858
The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,
and moon will bring silence and light.

887
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:51,695
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

888
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,280
It's all done.

889
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,740
Thank you.

890
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,179
Before we begin

891
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:20,182
the high school women's 70m competition,

892
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,226
we'll open up the short course
for 20 minutes.

893
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,187
Sir, I don't think I can do it.

894
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:26,605
Don't sweat it. Feel free to bomb.

895
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:29,108
Hey, stay strong.

896
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,859
I'm in 12th grade.

897
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:33,404
Good luck, ma'am.

898
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,699
Bo-eun, enough fooling around.
Let's go shoot some arrows.

899
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,785
-Good luck to you too, ma'am.
-Dude, I'm in 11th grade.

900
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:44,123
Instead of "ma'am," call them "senior,"

901
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:45,499
sir.

902
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,091
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

903
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:06,854
The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,
and moon will bring silence and light.

904
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,732
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

905
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:10,941
Gyeon-U.

906
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:12,693
Gyeon-U!

907
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:16,447
Hey. Seong-A.

908
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,240
Good luck, Gyeon-U.

909
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,415
-What?
-Can I…

910
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,292
Go. Be quick.

911
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:31,003
Get her to pat your back
and give you some good energy.

912
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,963
-Go on. Hurry.
-Okay.

913
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:37,092
You made it.

914
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:38,802
How about a high-five?

915
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,013
Okay.

916
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,014
Here.

917
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:43,599
There.

918
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,658
What should I do?

919
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,954
What's wrong?
Do you think you can't win gold?

920
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,206
Are you that nervous?

921
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,922
The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,
and moon will bring silence and light.

922
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,590
May my spirit become one with the ghost's

923
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,176
and may our wills become one.

924
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,638
The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,
and moon will bring silence and light.

925
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:25,599
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

926
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:29,186
Ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.

927
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,105
Ghosts take over your senses
in that order.

928
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:34,441
Yeongcheong. You will hear ghosts.

929
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,527
Yeongan. You will see ghosts.

930
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:42,574
Seong-A.

931
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,159
My eyes

932
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,328
have opened.

933
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:40,299
I will curse you.

934
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:43,135
I'm with her right now,
and you're in the mirror.

935
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:45,137
Do I have to choose one or the other?

936
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:46,555
Bong-su.

937
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,931
I want to stay by your side.

938
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,226
I merged my energy with his
with a Unify Spell.

939
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:54,146
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you hide it from me?

940
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,063
I thought

941
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,899
it was my fault too.

942
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,442
It's okay if we're apart.

943
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:02,946
There's usually just one reason
a ghost wants to befriend a person.

944
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,114
This is…

945
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:05,991
Who is it? Who is counter-cursing me?

946
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:07,910
Something went wrong.

947
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:10,579
Listen carefully, Handsome.
There will be a lot of pain.

948
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,331
Will I die?

949
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:18,921
