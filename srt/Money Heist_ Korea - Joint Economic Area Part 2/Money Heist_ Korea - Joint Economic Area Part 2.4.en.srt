1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,054
TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE INCIDENT

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,514
THE HIDDEN DIVORCE STORY

3
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,934
Right now, his lawyers are
just trying to drag us into a dogfight.

4
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,937
If we get caught up in it,
we're going to lose.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,149
Can't we submit a rebuttal article
that says it's all a lie?

6
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,985
My daughter is getting stressed at school.

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:31,281
Honestly, I think it would be helpful
to have her grandmother testify.

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,117
We can't just keep pushing back the trial.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,953
Uh... I'm asking just in case,

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,857
but are there any health problems

11
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,915
that your mother is dealing with
at this moment.

12
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:41,999
There aren't.

13
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,878
Why do you ask me that?

14
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,047
Huh. That's a relief.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,799
The lawyers on the other side have
requested her medical records,

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,217
trying to drum something up.

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,929
They're trying to invalidate her ability
to testify any way they can.

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,074
It's just proof that they're nervous.

19
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,476
Oh shit. Seriously?

20
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,559
Hello?

21
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,689
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,026
Listen, I'll call you later.

23
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,362
Are you all right?

24
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,034
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

25
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,577
Yes.

26
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,747
My car... Agh!

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,668
So... Uh...

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,379
You should probably see a doctor,
just in case.

29
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,841
No, I'm fine. Give me your card.
I'll call my insurance.

30
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,801
Right.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,141
It may be dangerous to drive it
in that condition.

32
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,684
You might wanna call a tow.

33
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,105
Well, thank you so much
or your concern, but I'm okay, though.

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,107
Um...

35
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,321
Do you want some coffee?

36
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,409
Uh, is asking you that too old-fashioned?

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,081
There's a new café
that just opened over there.

38
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,958
The coffee there is really good.

39
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,708
Hmm?

40
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,462
Are you flirting with me?

41
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,883
Just making a sale.

42
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,391
CAFE BELLA CIAO

43
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,533
You have a very strange way
of attracting customer.

44
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,451
Uh, yeah, well...

45
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,997
To be honest,
it hasn't officially opened yet.

46
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,125
And I've never done this before.

47
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,541
But I kind of thought that I'd never
see you again if I just let you leave...

48
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,716
Do you like coffee?

49
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,851
Got any alcohol?

50
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,436
What?

51
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,021
Do you have any alcohol?

52
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,816
I mean, I can't drive my car anymore,

53
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,778
and I happen to need a drinking buddy.

54
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,656
Ow! That's hot.

55
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,366
Two months before the operation,

56
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,869
the Professor deliberately
approached Inspector Seon

57
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,537
under the guise of coincidence.

58
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,416
She was exhausted by the lawsuit
about the custody of her daughter,

59
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,960
which was a hot topic among the press.

60
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,131
Maybe all she wanted
was to laugh and talk to someone

61
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,008
who didn't know anything about her.

62
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,932
But the Professor, who already knew
a lot about the Inspector,

63
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,809
was able to dig
right into the cracks of her heart.

64
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,107
And at that point, he was finally ready
to drag the Inspector into his plan.

65
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,869
Leaving without saying goodbye?

66
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,654
I'm actually still married.

67
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,449
Although, I am in the middle of a divorce.

68
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,870
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,374
This wasn't my intention coming here.

70
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,921
There's just been so much
on my mind. I wasn't thinking.

71
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,886
Aren't I awful?

72
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,808
Don't worry about it.

73
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,936
This was my intention
when I brought you here.

74
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,900
I guess it went as planned?

75
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,194
This is just the beginning.

76
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,489
I have a lot of things
I want to do with you, Woojin.

77
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,073
What kinda things?

78
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,371
Let me see. Hmm...

79
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,041
You like traveling?

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,169
That's a little cliché.

81
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,045
Where would we go?

82
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,549
Vladivostok,
on the Trans-Siberian railway,

83
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,011
which has a train
that'll go through Moscow to Kyiv.

84
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,054
Really?

85
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,058
But doesn't that take a week or something?

86
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,228
It does, then we'll get there,
and we'll change trains,

87
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,022
and take that one to Kherson.

88
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,775
And where would that be?

89
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,736
It's a small port city
in southern Ukraine.

90
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,988
I hear it's a beautiful place.

91
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,493
If you really wanna go there, though,
wouldn't taking a plane be a bit faster?

92
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,163
It might a long time,
but traveling by train is romantic.

93
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,794
I'm sorry, that doesn't really...

94
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,213
sound romantic.

95
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,925
I'll call you later.

96
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,807
I mean, there are people who are fine
at the scene of a car accident,

97
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,351
but end up pretending
they have neck pain later.

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,069
I didn't get to taste the coffee today,

99
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,530
but I'll come back when I have time.

100
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:30,116
PARK SUNHO

101
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,493
Why did it have to happen then?

102
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,163
If the Inspector hadn't collapsed
from exhaustion,

103
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,375
and if the Professor hadn't gone out there
to clean up the headquarters,

104
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,794
they would probably
never have seen each other again

105
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,671
for the rest of their lives.

106
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,840
And that's what should have happened.

107
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,842
Woojin! Woojin!

108
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,303
Wake up.

109
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,263
Woojin! Woojin!

110
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,348
Come on, wake up!

111
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:37,974
Hey, Woojin!

112
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,448
MONEY HEIST: KOREA - JOINT ECONOMIC AREA

113
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,952
While it has now been determined
that their accusations are untrue,

114
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,830
experts believe the fact that the suspects
made these false statements

115
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,582
points to the idea that it was intended

116
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,167
to impede the Inter-Korean
Economic Cooperation Summit.

117
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,587
It was expected that the leading
presidential candidate

118
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,964
Congressman Kim Sangman,
who is heading the summit,

119
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,466
would experience a drop
in approval ratings,

120
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,070
but opinion polls still show
strong support for the Congressman.

121
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,971
The Inter-Korean...

122
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,266
Well, looks like we won't have to worry
about public opinion.

123
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,393
I thought the South Korean press
would be different,

124
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,896
but it appears that it shares
quite a few similarities with our own.

125
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,982
Of course, they need to be easy on us,

126
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,985
considering how much we spend
on advertising through them.

127
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,029
If we can get the people on the inside,

128
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,741
then it'll only be a matter of time
before we can get the ones on the outside.

129
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,995
All we need to do now is simply
brand them all as terrorists,

130
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,248
and find a way to get rid
of them all before the summit.

131
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,334
But there could be a backlash to that.

132
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,711
Our hands are all tied now anyway,

133
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,464
so we could just
take care of it after the summit, right?

134
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,090
Concerned for your approval ratings?

135
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,494
If the summit doesn't take place,

136
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,219
both of our political careers
will be decimated, and you and I...

137
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,596
Be quiet for a second.

138
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,520
Our aim is to return the stolen future
of the unified Koreas

139
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,316
back into the hands of the people
who are the real owners of this land.

140
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,279
Listen, the people outside the Mint
are determined to hide our true intentions

141
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,115
and cover the reasons
for our actions up with lies.

142
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,410
Maybe they're afraid to be
exposed as the real thieves.

143
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,625
Then I'll give the people
of North and South Korea

144
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,837
an opportunity to make a choice between us
and the real thieves out there

145
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,589
who don't care about

146
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,758
the safety of these hostages.

147
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,136
At 3:00 p.m. tomorrow,

148
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,431
we promise you that we will be releasing

149
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,975
some of the hostages.

150
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,602
It will all be over tomorrow?

151
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,648
Stop this broadcast right now!

152
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,210
The live broadcast has been stopped,
but those you are watching

153
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,361
- seem to be sharing the footage.
- Stop it!

154
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,780
And check all the comments too!
Shut this all down!

155
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,366
Ah shit.

156
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,868
Ah, yes, Congressman.

157
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,414
We're on it right now.
We're handling it as we speak.

158
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,417
We're aware that
their communication equipment broke,

159
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,876
so this could be their method

160
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,795
of signaling to their people
on the outside.

161
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,006
Yes, of course, sir, but still, we're
thoroughly monitoring everything now...

162
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,591
No, listen, I mean...

163
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,636
that you should prevent them from
pulling bullshit stunts like this.

164
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,055
Can't you just cut off
the network or something?

165
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,391
No. That would only serve to
cut off our network as well.

166
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,704
And we believe that releasing the hostages
could be very advantageous for us, so...

167
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,479
Listen to me, I'll be the judge of that.

168
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,399
So just shut those bastards the hell up!

169
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,069
Well, I guess they beat us to it.

170
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,073
Getting rid of them before the summit
just got harder.

171
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,161
Why don't we just consider
postponing the summit?

172
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,247
Congressman, are you joking?

173
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,184
If we do that, then we might as well hold
a press conference

174
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,878
to tell them that
everything those bastards said was true.

175
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,130
- No, that's just...
- Business...

176
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,507
is all about the timing.

177
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,926
You think you'll have another chance
to be president?

178
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,597
Or that there'll be another
development boom in North Korea? Come on!

179
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,768
You need to pull yourself together.

180
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,687
The summit will proceed as scheduled
in three days, no matter what.

181
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,111
So find a way to stop them,
and do it quickly.

182
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,031
That's the whole reason you two are here!

183
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,962
So if the hostages don't listen to us

184
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,340
and keep holding out
the way they're doing now,

185
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,783
then should we should try
to win them over with money, yeah?

186
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,096
I mean, the Professor told us that,
so it makes sense to me.

187
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,600
But I don't really understand
why we're letting the others go.

188
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,061
They won't really be of
any help if they stay here,

189
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,064
and it'll be important to make
the hostages choosing to stay believe us.

190
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,148
That's one reason for it,

191
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,442
but the most important thing
is getting Tokyo back here.

192
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,568
- Huh?
- What?

193
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,737
Come on, she risked her life
on the way out of here,

194
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,280
and you want her to do more?

195
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,615
I already talked to Tokyo.

196
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:49,078
From the beginning, it was Tokyo's mission
to meet the Professor and come back.

197
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,579
- What?
- Okay, but wait...

198
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,390
There are snipers
all over the place out there.

199
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,917
And that's why we're going to use
the release of the hostages.

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,670
If she's mixed in with the hostages,
they can't shoot her easily.

201
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,004
He has a point.

202
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,216
Hey, I think we should just
do what we originally planned.

203
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,979
Why do we need
to do something so dangerous

204
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,570
when our escape route is almost complete.

205
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,181
If things were going according to plan,
we wouldn't have lost communication.

206
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:13,185
Now that Tokyo's explained the situation,
the Professor will have new plans.

207
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,314
There's only one way we'll know
what those plans are.

208
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,236
Congressman
Kim Sangman's approval rating

209
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,196
with respect
to the next presidential election

210
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,674
is expected to drop
by more than 10 percent.

211
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,698
NEGOTIATION 'COMMENCEMENT'
MOSCOW'S SUDDEN BEHAVIOR

212
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,941
Experts say that the progression of the
Mint incident and how it is being handled

213
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,372
will not only affect
the economic cooperation summit,

214
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,215
but also the upcoming
presidential elections.

215
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,893
JEON YONGSU'S INTERVENTION
TOKYO ARREST "RESCUE"

216
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,771
Experts believe this is due to the fact
that the suspects inside the Mint

217
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,115
announced on their live stream
that they would be releasing

218
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,841
some of the hostages shortly.

219
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,885
The suspects are justifying their actions,

220
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,137
saying that this is
more than a simple heist,

221
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,306
and that the true goal
of the entire incident

222
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,308
is for the suspects
to expose the corruption

223
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:57,146
of certain parties involved in the
Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Summit.

224
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,523
People have reacted
to the topic of corruption...

225
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,777
The Professor analyzed the Mint's
rapidly changing situation all night.

226
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,781
And he came to the conclusion that
there was going to be a major upheaval

227
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,658
that could devastate his plan.

228
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:16,998
I'm changing our plan.

229
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,918
What are you talking about?

230
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,253
The escape route
will be completed in a few days.

231
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,839
Don't we just need to wait
until the day of the summit?

232
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,965
Can't afford to do that.

233
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,444
Didn't you hear how they talked about it
on the news said last night?

234
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,261
Public opinion is on our side,

235
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,805
and it's not like they can
just infiltrate the Mint.

236
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,226
We can ride on the tiger's back,
but we can't make it go the way we want.

237
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:41,106
Having public opinion on our side
was a prerequisite for escape,

238
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,026
but things are changing
more rapidly than I expected.

239
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,279
So did you find a solution?

240
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,908
- It won't be easy.
- That's okay.

241
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,661
I'll deliver the message.

242
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,829
Please do.

243
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,249
If we don't let them know
of the change in plans,

244
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,919
they might not be able to survive,

245
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,380
let alone escape.

246
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,434
The suspects who are occupying
the Mint announced via live stream

247
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,813
they will be releasing
some of the hostages at 3:00 p.m. today.

248
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,648
There are many different speculations

249
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,442
as to why the suspects have
come to this determination,

250
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,088
and it is still unclear
whether or not the suspects have done this

251
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,552
to strengthen their existing claims,

252
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,383
or if there are other reasons
behind the decision.

253
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,407
Hey, Mom.

254
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,201
Are you awake now, honey?

255
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,912
How did I end up here?

256
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,038
Fatigue.

257
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,166
I'm just glad it wasn't worse.

258
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,961
When you're working this hard already,
you need to be careful.

259
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,256
You ended up passing out
on the street.

260
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,723
But who... who brought me here, though?

261
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:00,686
We only knew to come because
we got a call from the hospital.

262
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,489
The nurse said
someone brought you in

263
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,773
when they found you
on the street unconscious.

264
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,693
But there wasn't anyone with you
when we got here.

265
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,489
Woojin, come on, wake up!

266
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,950
Hey, Woojin!

267
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,126
So we're really giving them
three billion won if they stay here?

268
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,835
We are.

269
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,881
But what if the hostages

270
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,717
don't care about the money at all and say,

271
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,011
"Fuck it, I just get out
of this place right now"?

272
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,596
Then what are we supposed to do?

273
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,265
That's not going to happen.

274
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,810
You'll see how cunning
people get when money is on the line.

275
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,729
They'll stay here.

276
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,401
Do you think that they're really
going to let us go?

277
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,820
I mean, they even broadcasted it.

278
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,734
Do you really think
they are gonna pay us if we stay?

279
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,910
Mr. Park, so you'll stay if it's true?

280
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,747
I mean, three billion is a lot of money.

281
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,874
Not to mention,
it would be pretty life-changing.

282
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,919
And also, the money they're printing
all belongs to the bad guys.

283
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,545
You out of your mind?

284
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,591
Have you forgotten that those bad guys
are the ones who sign our paychecks?

285
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,179
I mean, three billion isn't even enough

286
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,782
to raise an eyebrow when you're
the director of the Mint, is it?

287
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,391
Of course it isn't.

288
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,310
Only three billion?

289
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,649
Okay,
the time has come to decide.

290
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,735
Have all of you made up your minds
about what you want?

291
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,117
I'm sure it's not
an easy decision, hmm?

292
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,250
Uh, since you've given us all a choice,

293
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,545
may I have a moment to express
my own opinion as Director of the Mint?

294
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,547
Yes, go ahead.

295
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,760
People, there's no need to think it over!

296
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,638
This is obviously a trick.
These asshole thieves...

297
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,769
Don't fall for it!

298
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,314
Why the hell would these criminals
give us all that money?

299
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,442
They're just trying
to take advantage of us.

300
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,362
You think so? You sure about that?

301
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,780
What can we do

302
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,741
if they lie to us

303
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,119
and making us help them without paying?

304
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,832
And when we get released,
you know what'll happen?

305
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,751
We're going to be fired by the Mint

306
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,754
for cooperating with these criminals!

307
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:38,218
Whether you leave now or sometime later,
won't you get fired either way?

308
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,222
What?

309
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,474
I mean, look back
at everything you've done so far.

310
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,853
There have been so many times where you
put people in danger to save yourself.

311
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,398
Wait. What are you talking about?
When was that?

312
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,482
Oh!

313
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,028
I guess the people who got out
said that already.

314
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,952
Hey! Does that matter?
All this is a trick, okay?

315
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Helsinki!

316
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,247
Go ahead, bring it.

317
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,387
Whoa. Do you think
they'd really let us take this?

318
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,431
Okay, take a look.

319
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,267
We're not lying
when we tell you we're going to pay you!

320
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,787
If anyone wants to take it,
you can just go ahead and take it.

321
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,891
- Wait, really?
- Seriously?

322
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,938
But what's the point?

323
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,149
If we make it out of here,

324
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,902
you know what, the police are
just going to take the money back.

325
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,363
Well, yes, that's right.

326
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,949
We'll need to find a better way
to deliver the money.

327
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,451
We already have a method in mind.

328
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,453
We can...

329
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,290
I guess I can't tell you, though.

330
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,751
If the hostages who get released
snitch about the plan,

331
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,836
the police are going to take
all this money.

332
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,172
And if you still don't believe us,

333
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,591
we're going to give it to you
however you want.

334
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,969
As my director friend said,

335
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,224
if you do choose to work with us,
you'll be fired from your current job.

336
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,725
But three billion won

337
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,603
is enough money to start a brand-new life.

338
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:20,028
Okay. Starting now, we're gonna be having
one-on-one meetings with everyone.

339
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,864
So think about it carefully.

340
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,706
Three billion each?

341
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,083
If it's ten people, that's 30 billion.

342
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,336
The hostages' cooperation will be
the most crucial thing.

343
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,780
Especially when we're near escape.

344
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,715
We really need to use money?

345
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,718
In movies, sometimes people
are stuck in a life or death situation,

346
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,095
gradually they all get real close
to each together.

347
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,723
You know what I mean? Huh?
You know what that is called?

348
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,850
Stockholm syndrome.

349
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,019
Oh, I think I've seen that movie.

350
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,437
No, you haven't.

351
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,481
Shit. What is that?
Is it a mental illness or what?

352
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,734
I mean, yeah, it's kind of like that.

353
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,737
What it is, is a psychological condition

354
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,323
that makes a hostage
identify with their captor.

355
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,283
- Huh?
- Whoa.

356
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,951
Oh.

357
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,872
- You know stuff like that?
- I heard someone mention it in jail.

358
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,332
Oh.

359
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,792
Of course, some hostages
might feel that way,

360
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,713
but if the hostage situation gets longer,
it'll be harder to control.

361
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,425
- Something unexpected could happen.
- What kind of something?

362
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,303
The hostages could
rise up, revolt, and escape.

363
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,721
Oh, come on, you little shit.

364
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,621
Do you think they're gonna be
like Bruce Willis or what, huh?

365
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,850
Die Hard.

366
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,935
That's right.

367
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,271
That is possible, though.

368
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,899
That's right,
and if something like that happens,

369
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,610
the remaining hostages
will no longer be afraid of us anymore.

370
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,988
And also, if they go on strike, we won't
be able to print enough money on time.

371
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,240
Well, clearly that can never happen, okay?

372
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,909
Oh, but wait...

373
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,453
How do we know it'll work
in that situation?

374
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,413
Like, giving them three billion won? Huh?

375
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,123
Think about it.

376
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,294
If a hostage chooses the three billion
instead of freedom,

377
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,922
from then on,
they'll be rooting for us to succeed.

378
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,343
And they'll be desperate,
because they want the three billion.

379
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,304
Then they'll become accomplices.

380
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,055
That's right.

381
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,810
Please don't be nervous.
You can say what's on your mind.

382
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,231
Are you, uh, really going to let me go
without any strings attached?

383
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,607
Uh-huh.

384
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,276
What, you think
we're all out to trick you?

385
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,695
I mean, if there is a condition,

386
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,198
it's that if you decide to leave now,

387
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,158
you're gonna be broke.

388
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,703
Let's hear it then.

389
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,374
Are you still itching to leave
after hearing what I said back there?

390
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,253
Uh... So I thought about it, and then you...

391
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,423
said you'd give me that money in advance?

392
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,759
- And if I did?
- Well, that three billion...

393
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,345
Why don't we hide it
somewhere in the Mint?

394
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,597
They'd never even think
that we'd hide it here.

395
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,516
There's a place only I know.

396
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,518
I have something to ask you.

397
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,644
What is it?

398
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,398
You're leaving?

399
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,612
- Can you tell me your name?
- Huh?

400
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,781
My name?

401
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:15,954
Oh. I mean, I'm sorry,
but you know I can't tell you that.

402
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,669
Too bad that Tokyo is gone.
Didn't you two catch feelings?

403
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,422
Ah. It was just one-sided.

404
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,840
Just shut the fuck up.

405
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,967
So what are you going to do now?

406
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,345
So I actually have
a choice this time, I guess?

407
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,429
That's new.

408
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,933
God, how did you end up
with your job, you dumbass?

409
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,895
I'm sure you thought it was a smart move,

410
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,898
but do you really think
the cops wouldn't find it?

411
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,817
When all of this is over,
the Mint will become a crime scene.

412
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,045
And the cops are going to
search every nook and cranny.

413
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,907
So I'll answer you right away.

414
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,202
I don't need to think about it.
I'm going to stay here.

415
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,286
You are?

416
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,914
I haven't even said a word yet.

417
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,832
Well, if you still don't believe us,

418
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,752
we'll just go ahead and let you out.

419
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,630
No, just hold on a sec.

420
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,508
Tell me, what's the method
you have in mind?

421
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,092
Please let me know what it is.

422
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,886
Honestly,

423
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,015
I don't have any choice.
I really need to stay in here.

424
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,599
Well, yeah.

425
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,559
You saw it too.

426
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,271
The guys out there
are completely fucking crazy

427
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,355
and don't care either way
if you're in here or not.

428
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,111
It's Taeksu.

429
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,532
Oh Taeksu.

430
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,245
Taeksu...

431
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,000
I don't really want the money, but I...

432
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,127
I wanna stay.

433
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,963
I want to be with you, Taeksu.

434
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,893
I'm embarrassed to admit,

435
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,398
but I'm doing my job more efficiently
and happily than I have in my entire life.

436
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:11,778
Honestly, the truth is that you're far and
away the best boss that I've ever had.

437
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,949
My director friend, only for you,

438
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,201
I'll tell you this in advance. Hmm?

439
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,953
When everything eventually dies down,

440
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,956
a box will arrive at your house,
so watch out for it.

441
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,501
It'll come quietly, no one's gonna know.

442
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,310
Okay.

443
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,936
Time to decide now.

444
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,315
- Three billion?
- Or do you pick freedom?

445
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,700
Freedom to the left.

446
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,452
And money to the right.

447
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,520
Director.

448
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,104
It's this way.

449
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,492
Anne, what are you...

450
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,621
What's with you people?

451
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,831
Didn't you say
we could leave if we wanted to?

452
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,793
- It's okay, I said that I would stay here.
- Huh?

453
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:55,632
Okay. For the friends who chose freedom,
you'll be able to leave

454
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,760
in just a moment,
the time we promised that you could.

455
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,055
Those who decide to stay,
will move over to the Mint's machines.

456
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,016
We'll have a blast printing money,

457
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,062
and talking about all the fun ways
you'll be spending your three billion won.

458
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,064
Follow me.

459
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,734
Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

460
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,861
Sorry, I misread the time.

461
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,072
Yun Misun is...

462
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,118
...going to stay.

463
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,620
Okay, over there.

464
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,592
Dad, hey, what?

465
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,010
Hey, wait.

466
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,721
Wait, hey, stop. Wait.

467
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,764
Dad, stop. What's wrong with you?

468
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,268
What's going on with you and her?

469
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,436
What do you mean?

470
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,816
Look me in the eyes and tell me the truth.

471
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,321
Dad.

472
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,783
The thing is,

473
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,453
I love that woman.

474
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,536
What?

475
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,540
Come on, if we get out of here,

476
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,334
we'll have all the money we want.

477
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,338
And Misun and I will take care of you
and we'll all live happy lives.

478
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,216
And you'll get a grandkid...

479
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,012
Are you crazy?

480
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,972
That girl's our hostage! God!

481
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,265
Yeah, and so what?

482
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,393
We're in love, so what's the big problem?

483
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,561
In love?

484
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:35,231
This is Stockholm syndrome. Remember?

485
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,026
Don't be an idiot, Dad.

486
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,612
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

487
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,155
Come on, Dad, just drop it.

488
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,783
What do you know? I mean, seriously.

489
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,999
What did she say? She said
she doesn't need the money, didn't she?

490
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,917
I'm sure.

491
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,796
She said that she doesn't need money
or any of that,

492
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,757
because all she needs
is your love. Is that right?

493
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,096
Your mom said that as well.

494
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,517
What do you mean?

495
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,524
I never...

496
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,027
told you about
how your mother and I met, did I?

497
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,072
Your mother was a teller

498
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,408
at the bank that I went to rob.

499
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,827
Huh?

500
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,456
Just like this woman,

501
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,503
your mom said she didn't need money,
she didn't need anything else,

502
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,338
that we should just run away together.

503
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,132
We both thought it was love too.

504
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,845
But then,
as soon as she gave birth to you,

505
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,473
she said to let her go.

506
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,188
Please.

507
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,356
Please, Son,

508
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,569
don't turn out like me, okay? Please!

509
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:08,908
Denver wanted to respond,
but he instinctively knew

510
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:14,289
that criticizing his father's past
was only denying his own present.

511
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,292
Shit! This is fucked!

512
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,339
So, it goes in right here.

513
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,677
Then over through here,
and this is where it gets printed.

514
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,058
Okay! We have to work even harder
to make up for lost time, right?

515
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,394
Hey, you there!

516
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,771
Don't just stand there.
You better get back to work!

517
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,609
Nothing's free in this world, okay?
Can't you see how hard I work?

518
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,152
Hustle, guys!

519
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,364
Come on, everyone, you need to help.

520
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,950
Go on, get to work!

521
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,494
Earn the money you'll take!

522
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,582
Isn't it beautiful?

523
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,294
You can't help but admire it, right?

524
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,090
Why did you stay?

525
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,302
I don't think it's because you need money.

526
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,848
You know, I'm not really sure myself.

527
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,515
What?

528
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,437
I think I just wanted to see
how everything ends up here.

529
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,710
You collapsed in
the street, but you're already discharged?

530
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,235
Don't you need to rest more?

531
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,528
No, it's fine.

532
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,073
So about the announcement
the suspects made...

533
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,134
the fact that
they had to make a scene like that...

534
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,720
Don't worry, we'll take care
of things here, you take a break.

535
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,162
I already put you on leave.

536
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,873
Come on, Chief.

537
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,793
Agh!

538
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,588
Fine, I'll drop it.

539
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,597
Hello there,
where can I take you?

540
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,565
Are you closing your café?

541
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,195
Woojin.

542
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,370
So you were the one
who took me to the hospital?

543
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,664
I'm glad you were discharged so soon.

544
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,840
The case about the Mint
is out of hands now.

545
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,177
I really missed you.

546
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,304
And I regret how I handled things.

547
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,850
With everything going on with the case,
I wasn't in my right mind.

548
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,521
Inside information was being leaked,
and then Captain Cha disappeared.

549
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,274
I'm not here to make excuses.

550
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,027
I just...

551
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,203
I'm sorry for hurting you.

552
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,045
My feelings for you are real, though.

553
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,552
Even if I don't get to see you again,
I just wanted to say that.

554
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,604
I'll leave now.

555
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,735
Woojin.

556
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,137
No matter how perfect a plan is,

557
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,764
it doesn't always go
exactly as calculated.

558
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,433
The Professor was well aware of that.

559
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,978
Because plans are carried out

560
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:51,107
by imperfect human beings who are driven
by their conflicting emotions.

561
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,486
But what he didn't know was that

562
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,574
he could be driven
by the same kind of emotions as well.

563
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,621
Now that I'm taking some time off work,
do you want to go on a vacation?

564
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,999
Remember when we first met,

565
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,084
and you asked me
to travel by train with you?

566
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,379
Back then, uh,
the city you wanted to go was...

567
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,172
Where was it again?

568
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,549
It was called...

569
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,509
Mmm.

570
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,094
Kherson.

571
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,596
Ah.

572
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,113
It's a port city where
the Black Sea and the Dnipro River meet.

573
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,658
What is it that makes you want
to go there, of all places?

574
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,368
When I was younger,

575
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,663
my father first heard of it
from an acquaintance who'd visited,

576
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,208
and afterwards,
it became his lifelong wish

577
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,712
that one day, our whole family
could live there together.

578
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,255
Your father?

579
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,346
This might be the first time
I've ever heard about your family.

580
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,604
I don't really love to talk about it.

581
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,817
Partially because in his final years,
he forgot all about Kherson.

582
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,613
He had it pretty rough
until the day he died.

583
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,033
Was it dementia that your father had?

584
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,034
Yes.

585
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,622
Yes, my father had dementia too.

586
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,884
I guess I have to go.

587
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,720
So much to do
to close up the café.

588
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,266
So, are we going to
take that trip to Kherson?

589
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:53,312
When he first mentioned going
to Kherson, he didn't really mean it.

590
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,651
But in that moment, the Professor
sincerely wanted to go there with her.

591
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,405
Even though he had to disappear
in just a few days.

592
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,572
Okay.

593
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,868
When I close the café, let's go there.

594
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,886
I mean, who cares about Fuckholm
or Stockholm syndrome

595
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,347
or whatever that dumb bullshit is called.

596
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,445
What are you doing standing there?

597
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,782
Nothing.

598
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,953
Your dad told you

599
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,998
to leave that Misun girl, didn't he?

600
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,085
Wait, how... how'd you know?

601
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,669
Your face says it all.

602
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:12,391
Do you think she's got
that Stockholm thing like my dad?

603
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,602
Not sure.

604
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,563
Whatever is going on in her mind,
whatever you both feel,

605
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,275
isn't it all right as long as you're sure
that you won't regret it?

606
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,699
Berlin.

607
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,204
I heard that you brought that girl out
of the concentration camp with you.

608
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,414
Is that true? Seoul, right?

609
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,918
And she followed you out too,
didn't she? Huh?

610
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,253
Then doesn't that mean
you two love each other?

611
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,837
Doesn't it?

612
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,136
Well, I regret it now.

613
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:52,972
Huh?

614
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,941
Shit...

615
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,042
Why are you even here?

616
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,296
What are you talking about?

617
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,007
Aren't you a wealthy
Pyongyang university graduate?

618
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,718
You're putting on a Seoul accent,

619
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,637
but the way you talk gives it away.

620
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,138
Does it?

621
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,436
I guess it isn't very easy
to erase the past.

622
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,230
How did you end up falling in
with those guys?

623
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,731
That's a long story.

624
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,276
If you wanted,

625
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,321
you could have lived
a very comfortable life.

626
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,580
If you regret it though,
it's still not too late.

627
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,833
- Even now, if you'll help me...
- What? You'll erase my past?

628
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,044
You'll give me a new life,
something like that?

629
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,964
Sorry, but...

630
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,593
I'm already living a new life.

631
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,263
And I like it a lot.

632
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,519
I'll just take this.

633
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,272
Good luck getting out of those handcuffs.

634
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,982
I'm punishing you now.

635
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,122
Where have you been for so long?

636
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,582
I had to handle something.

637
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,710
If you're ready, shall we go?

638
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:49,673
Wait. Hold on.

639
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,010
Take this.

640
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,304
It's medicine.

641
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,223
Give it to Berlin, please.

642
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,186
And if Berlin is gonna try
to do something stupid...

643
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,856
Don't worry, I'm going to grab him
by the neck and drag him out.

644
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,859
Let's go.

645
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,244
THE HOUSE OF PAPER IS OURS

646
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,828
Our lives are greater than paper!

647
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,205
MAKE THEM PAY!
REVEAL THE TRUTH!

648
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,999
We want the truth!
Tell us the truth!

649
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,173
MAKE THEM PAY!
REVEAL THE TRUTH!

650
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,817
What is going on in there?

651
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:37,054
A few questions!
We have a right to know what's going on!

652
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,099
I just want to see my daughter.

653
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,518
My daughter is trapped in there.

654
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,937
Stop pushing. Stop pushing.

655
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,020
- What's going on right now?
- What are you doing?

656
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,738
Why the hell is it so loud out there?

657
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,448
We've set a perimeter of 100 meters,

658
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,284
but it's difficult
to keep it under control.

659
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,495
It's hard to stop the reporters,
and protestors, and hostages' families.

660
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,291
Why do you think they publicly announced
their plan to release the hostages?

661
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,334
They're clearly aiming for propaganda.

662
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,087
Do you have any idea
how complicated things got

663
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,214
after the last stunt they pulled on us?

664
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,175
I don't know what it is
these people are up to,

665
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,928
but we can't let them play us anymore.

666
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,272
There shouldn't be
any part of this situation

667
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,142
that we can't actively control.
Do I make myself clear?

668
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,769
Yes.

669
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,689
Set up a tight perimeter
so that no one is closer

670
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,525
than 300 meters of the Mint. All right?

671
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,820
Right. But what about the reporters?

672
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,158
Start with all of the streamers
and YouTubers.

673
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,784
Get rid of them first.

674
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,997
And, uh, only the news outlets
on this list can stay.

675
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,499
They won't go live, and with all of them,

676
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,918
we've discussed the direction
of the reporting.

677
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,086
Yes.

678
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,226
Yes, my father had dementia too.

679
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,154
"...had dementia too."

680
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,550
Get that!
This is a very important moment for us.

681
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,968
They've got more troops.

682
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,970
They didn't figure out our plan, did they?

683
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,054
No.

684
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,820
They're scared
of what the public will say.

685
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,894
This makes things
much harder for us.

686
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,116
It's not looking good for us out there.

687
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,119
There need to be a ton of people
for us to have an opening.

688
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,453
But they got rid of them.

689
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,790
Shit. We need to stop this now,
before it's too late.

690
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,085
They've doubled the force out there
and completely blocked any access.

691
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,379
Tokyo trying to come back now,

692
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,297
that would be a suicide mission.

693
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,592
Hey, I don't think we can
release the hostages.

694
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,677
No, we have to.

695
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,805
But why? Is it because of public opinion?

696
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,099
I already told you,
our survival depends on it.

697
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,476
Did the Professor say that?

698
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,855
Are you sure it's not part
of your crazy plan for revolution?

699
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,524
Berlin!

700
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,777
Don't make a fool of yourself.
You sound ridiculous.

701
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,822
What does a South Korean rich kid
know about anything?

702
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,825
Do you think Tokyo will give up on us
if we don't release the hostages?

703
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,161
She'll risk her life to come back. Why?

704
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,829
For all of us here.

705
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,123
Backing out?

706
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,168
That's what will get Tokyo killed.
Do you get that, you little asshole?

707
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,256
Hey! If anything bad happens
to Tokyo today,

708
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,177
I will kill you myself, got that?

709
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,141
Yeah, that's great.
I'm looking forward to it, kid.

710
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,852
Shit.

711
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,693
Hold on. Ahh! Ow!

712
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,321
You...

713
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,406
You should leave now.

714
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,367
What?

715
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,919
Just get out of here!

716
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,673
Why are you saying this out of nowhere?

717
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,052
Leave now, and live a normal life.

718
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,845
Don't regret this later.

719
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,639
I won't regret it.

720
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,600
And it doesn't matter
if I regret it later or not.

721
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:56,396
The reason I decided to stay with you
is completely my choice.

722
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,610
Hey, get a hold of yourself.

723
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,569
I'm a criminal.

724
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,366
My dad was in and out of prison
for theft my entire life, so...

725
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,466
I never learned how to do anything else.

726
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,195
I'm just an asshole
who only knows how to fight people.

727
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,083
Trusting a guy like me
and choosing to stay here...

728
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,418
Does that make any sense? Huh?

729
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,172
Why are you doing this?

730
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,301
Ah shit, seriously.

731
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,845
Fuck! I've explained it to you,

732
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,347
so why can't you just take a hint
and get out of here?

733
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,058
Why don't you fucking get it?

734
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,648
Taeksu, please.

735
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,693
Get out of here.

736
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,320
I don't care about you anymore.

737
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,429
After you were dating that old guy,

738
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,701
I thought we both just wanted
some meaningless fun.

739
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,828
- What?
- Oh, come on.

740
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,957
Oh, what, are you just pretending
to be clueless because of the money?

741
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,167
Then I'll send you three billion won...

742
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,388
I don't need that money.

743
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,807
You son of a bitch.

744
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,938
What are you doing?
Time's up, everyone.

745
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,525
Hostages who are going to leave,
gather in the lobby.

746
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,455
Ah shit.

747
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,291
Oh, goddamn it!

748
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,210
Tokyo.

749
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,797
- You hear me?
- Yes.

750
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,132
I'm all ready now.

751
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,967
To be honest, this operation

752
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,970
isn't going to be easy.

753
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,716
If you fail by any chance...

754
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,642
I'm captured or even killed.

755
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,603
I know all that.

756
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,397
This might be too much of a burden. Sorry.

757
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,791
Professor.

758
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,794
I only have one question to ask.

759
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,128
Go on.

760
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,923
The promise you made me back then
is still good, right?

761
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,507
Of course it is.

762
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,009
Okay, fine then.

763
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,388
Let's go ahead and do it.

764
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,750
Shit.

765
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:08,879
It's okay.

766
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,484
As promised, with no strings attached,

767
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,030
we're sending 15 hostages
back into their family's arms right now.

768
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,741
I'm thankful for the patience
our hostages have shown,

769
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,327
and all of their hard work.

770
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,496
We are standing
hundreds of meters away

771
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,831
from entrance to the Mint,

772
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,834
but as you can see,
except for some particular media outlets,

773
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,378
it's impossible
to approach or ask questions.

774
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,255
In response
to these very difficult measures

775
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,631
the authorities said...

776
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,592
The North and the South...

777
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,929
Huh, why is it lagging? Shit.

778
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,097
What's wrong?

779
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,141
- Wait. What's wrong?
- Everything's been cut off.

780
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,263
I don't understand.

781
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,352
Hey, what's going on in there?

782
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,021
Hey, come here and cover that side.

783
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,888
- It's ridiculous!
- Excuse me?

784
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,448
All nearby radio stations
and networks have been shut down.

785
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,491
He doesn't want to talk
now that the microphone is gone, does he?

786
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,954
Look at their faces,
they're so flustered.

787
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,256
It's time to go home now.

788
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,933
Uh, let's go.

789
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,197
You all did well.

790
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,825
Just take it slow and watch your step.

791
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,602
Come out!

792
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:36,862
Go, now!

793
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,944
What is that?

794
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,214
- I think it might be an accomplice.
- What...

795
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,449
You're just going to watch?
Fire! Fire! Fire right now!

796
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,718
Then what about the hostages...

797
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,460
Sniper, sniper, what are you doing?
Shoot! Shoot, now!

798
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,507
- It's a sniper!
- Covering fire!

799
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,641
Are you crazy? Shit!

800
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,145
Close it!

801
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,439
Going! Rio, get in!

802
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,275
Inside!

803
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,999
Hey, watch out!

804
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,922
Close the door!

805
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,929
That was awesome!

806
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,529
Aah!

807
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,446
Goodness.

808
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,823
Wow, welcome back.

809
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:45,907
Welcome back.

810
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,075
Yes, welcome.

811
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,161
Welcome back. Come on.

812
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,579
This way, yes.

813
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,415
Come on, now.

814
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,796
You did pretty good, huh?

815
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,383
Hey, hey, did you get hurt?

816
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,844
I mean, you almost died just now.

817
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,178
But I didn't die.

818
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,059
Right.

819
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,687
Oh, babe, I missed you so much.

820
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,025
You did it!

821
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,108
Berlin.

822
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,238
How did you get this?

823
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,490
Some girl told me
that I should bring it to you.

824
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,454
Why...

825
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,124
Aah.

826
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,934
Apologize to your dad.

827
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,518
Huh?

828
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:57,937
Why should I?

829
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,522
He's still your dad.

830
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,606
Yeah, no way.

831
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,042
I mean, in a few days,
he'll come back around

832
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,502
like he always does,

833
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,212
and says sorry and everything.

834
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,841
And then, once we talk,
I know that it'll all be fine.

835
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,510
Don't worry about it at all.

836
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,593
Honestly.

837
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,721
When it comes to my dad and I,

838
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,807
we're always like this.

839
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,825
What is this about? Hmm?

840
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,708
Come on, tell me what's going on?

841
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,502
WOOJIN WORKS AT GYEONGGI POLICE AGENCY

842
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,422
Mom, so, about that café owner.

843
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,466
Oh. That man that you've been seeing?

844
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,094
- Yeah.
- Of course. What, now?

845
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,056
Mom, think. Have you ever met that man?

846
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,934
I'm not sure.

847
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:21,020
About a month ago,
when he dropped you off here,

848
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,897
I think I saw him
for a quick second there.

849
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,341
Please think carefully, Mom. Okay?

850
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,580
I think I...

851
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,499
I think I called you.

852
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,711
What? What do you mean, huh?

853
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,254
I think I saw...

854
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,465
that man there.

855
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,684
And that's why I called you.

856
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,144
You mean you saw him here?

857
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,938
Did he come to see me? Hmm?

858
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,482
I don't know.

859
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,334
- What's wrong, Mom? Huh?
- I just don't know.

860
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,277
Mom, Mom, when was that?

861
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,154
When was that?

862
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,865
- Can you remember what happened?
- I don't know.

863
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,825
All right. All right. It's all right.

864
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,286
- I don't know.
- It's all right. It's all right.

865
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,370
One second.

866
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:29,506
PROSECUTOR LEE MINHO
CHA MOOHYUK

867
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,553
CHA MOOHYUK

868
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,785
This may not be
the best time to bring this up, but...

869
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,205
When did you start seeing
that man, Park Sunho?

870
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,088
You think they targeted me?

871
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,175
Why were you eavesdropping on my call?

872
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,430
Woojin, let me...

873
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,598
I'll only need a minute!

874
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,684
Hey, Sunho. What is this...

875
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,103
Oh, Woojin, here. It's your mother.

876
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,273
What was on the menu
this morning?

877
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,527
Sandwiches.

878
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,910
Over here.

879
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,334
I think that we've found it.

880
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,254
Okay.

881
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,858
Those bastards...

882
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,180
Okay,
that was great work, everyone.

883
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,711
We're... We're almost there now.

884
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:27,975
Wait a minute.

885
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,622
- That fucker!
- Fuck!

886
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,680
Fucker!

887
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,694
Go that way!

888
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,035
This must be what
Captain Cha Moohyuk found that day.

889
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,465
"Name."

890
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,175
PERSONAL INFORMATION

891
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,258
"Song...

892
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,471
Sunho."

893
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,306
SPECIAL NOTE

894
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,058
"Deletion of Resident Registration
due to death."

895
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,192
"The aforementioned person's
data was registered

896
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:03,780
in accordance with article 19
of the North Korean Refugee Act."

897
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:08,743
"He and his father, Song Minhyeok
defected from North Korea."

898
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,796
"His mother and brother

899
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,881
were reported missing

900
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,675
during the journey."

901
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:39,750
Cha!

902
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,299
Is that man okay?

903
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,600
Sorry.

904
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:56,851
Where's Moscow, though?

905
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,435
What?

906
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,314
I have no idea.
I'll tell him whatever this is later.

907
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,940
So, go on.

908
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,861
The summit is happening
sooner than expected.

909
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,155
- So they're moving it up?
- Mm-hmm.

910
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,448
By how much?

911
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,742
If the Professor's prediction is right,

912
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,787
we need to...

913
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,874
get out of here by tomorrow.
