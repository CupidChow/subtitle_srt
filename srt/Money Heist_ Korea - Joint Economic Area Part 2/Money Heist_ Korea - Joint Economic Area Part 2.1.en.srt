1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,303
- Hey!
- That looks so good.

2
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,477
Looks good, doesn't it?

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,314
- Can I give you one?
- Of course.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,738
During the Cold War
between the North and South,

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,033
saying the name Cha Moohyuk
to a double agent

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,368
was the same
as mentioning the grim reaper.

7
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,546
He's heading for the Chinese Embassy.
Block the street.

8
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,486
Shit.

9
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:13,865
Ah shit.

10
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,875
You two wait here. I'll handle him myself.

11
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,176
I didn't train you to be like this.

12
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,345
Looks like you've had it too easy lately

13
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,514
'cause you, my friend,
have lost your edge.

14
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,559
Oh God. Spare me.

15
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,646
So those are your final words?
Seriously, man?

16
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,279
The Korean divide is over.

17
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,119
What did you say just now?

18
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,997
I heard the higher-ups
have already made their decision.

19
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,541
Those bastards...

20
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,919
they think they can treat us like we're
nothing but cannon fodder!

21
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,387
I was going to make it quick,

22
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,265
but unfortunately for you,
I've changed my mind.

23
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,792
But as everyone knows by now,
what the double agent said was the truth.

24
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,589
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA,
MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY

25
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,552
From now on, it'll be like
our department never existed.

26
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,390
So, sir, what will my next mission be?

27
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,019
Mission? You'll be lucky
to be a security guard.

28
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,817
No, thank you, sir.

29
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,408
What Moohyuk was looking at
were the flames of a new era.

30
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,747
And in them, he saw everything he had
dedicated his life to become ash.

31
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,054
MONEY HEIST: KOREA - JOINT ECONOMIC AREA

32
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,243
Hello there, sir.

33
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,085
- Who...
- Do you remember me?

34
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,463
We met when you ran into our tent
at the Mint.

35
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,132
Oh. Yeah.

36
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,509
You must be Woojin's colleague.

37
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,386
My name is Cha Moohyuk.

38
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,452
Where is Captain Cha?

39
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,847
One of the North Korean agents said
he went out last night...

40
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,099
- ...to investigate something.
- What was he investigating?

41
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,333
I'm not sure.

42
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,170
Why did you call us in at this hour?
What's going on?

43
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,714
Take a look at this.

44
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,801
What's that?
I can't see well without my glasses.

45
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,681
- Is that...
- That's a scrap from a bill.

46
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,017
That's right. It's money.

47
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,564
They're not just stealing
they're printing all the money right now.

48
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,240
Inspector Seon told me a lot about you.

49
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,034
Did she? Really?

50
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,120
Yes, she said she comes here often.

51
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,872
I've been meaning to check it out,

52
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,375
and on my way home,
I happened to see you walking in,

53
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,709
so I thought, "Why not?"

54
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,213
Well, um, we're, uh, not officially open.

55
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,551
Am I bothering you?

56
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,470
I'm sorry. I'm just starving.

57
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,555
No, don't... don't worry.

58
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,475
You're Woojin's colleague,
so you're a special guest.

59
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,521
So, uh... Mmm...

60
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,692
What should I make?

61
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,069
SEON WOOJIN

62
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,114
Uh...

63
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,751
Nothing?

64
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,379
Nothing.

65
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,592
So, then the hostage slipped something
in your pocket to tell us

66
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,385
that those criminals are printing money.

67
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,928
But how is that possible?

68
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,907
Can anyone print money
if they use the equipment inside the Mint?

69
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,475
Serial numbers.

70
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,852
Why would they print the money
if we're able to track it?

71
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,645
They have a hacker on their side,

72
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,356
so I wouldn't be surprised
if they had a mint expert in there too.

73
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,901
I don't know how they're doing it.

74
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,906
But looking back, it's obvious now
why they seemed like they were...

75
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,491
trying to buy time, right?

76
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,412
What's important is
that if printing money is their goal,

77
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,749
then we need to
completely change our strategy.

78
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,167
Inspector, wait a minute.

79
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,294
Even if you're right
about what they're doing,

80
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,880
we can't take care of this problem
by ourselves.

81
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,131
We'll run it up the flagpole.

82
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,091
Let's go check with the Mint first

83
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,677
to see if they can use the machine
to print and use the money.

84
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,805
Fine, then I'll check how much
electricity they're using in the Mint.

85
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,059
Okay! I'll go let them know right now
and get us confirmation.

86
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,436
Get ready to move
once we receive an order.

87
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,062
Sir.

88
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,690
I can't believe all those bastards.

89
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,045
They must have been enjoying themselves
smelling all the new cash.

90
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,237
Let them be.

91
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,907
Their party will be over soon.

92
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,959
Mmm.

93
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,087
Mmm.

94
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,675
Wow, you must really
have been hungry, Mr. Cha.

95
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,760
Oh yeah. Man, it's so good.

96
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,598
Why haven't you opened your restaurant
when it's been over two months?

97
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,350
The place would be packed.

98
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,504
To be honest,
I didn't do enough market research.

99
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,822
I've been told that my coffee
is too bitter

100
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,074
compared to what
the North Koreans are used to.

101
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,177
Oh, you mean Sambok, right?

102
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,370
It's very similar
to South Korean instant coffee.

103
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,621
Yeah.

104
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,458
So I'll go back to the drawing board
to come up with a new menu and theme.

105
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,004
Oh, um,
where's the toilet, by the way?

106
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,880
Oh, the bathroom?

107
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,757
Uh, you can find it over there.

108
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,751
The bathroom isn't this way.

109
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,670
Uh, you're right.

110
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,298
So, what is this room for?

111
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,050
It's personal space.

112
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Oh.

113
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,390
What's this? What's under here?

114
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,688
Only an embarrassing hobby
for a middle-aged man.

115
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,273
Let's go back.

116
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,024
Yeah.

117
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,066
Korean Crime Scene
Investigation at the JEA.

118
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,860
This is Captain Cha Moohyuk from
the Joint Task Force on the Mint case.

119
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,362
I need you to run a fingerprint for me.

120
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,264
We can, if it's a reported case.

121
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,933
Please, it's urgent.
Do me a favor, would you?

122
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,066
Is that your grandson? He's adorable.
He looks about three months old.

123
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,194
How did you know that?

124
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,946
So, you have kids of your own?

125
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,533
I'm not a mother!

126
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,826
Take a good look.

127
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,246
There isn't a single mom out there
who has this figure.

128
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,876
Hmm.

129
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,465
Don't worry. You'll get out of here
and you'll be seeing them again.

130
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,591
You think so?

131
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,760
Trust me, I wouldn't lie about it to you.

132
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,063
♪ Let's go, oh, goodness ♪

133
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,150
♪ To the land of happiness ♪

134
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,735
♪ Everyone ♪

135
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,155
♪ Everyone... ♪

136
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,200
You got drunk and cried all night
'cause you missed your mommy, remember?

137
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,827
No, I didn't.

138
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,787
You better stop making shit up.

139
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,455
Hey, hurry up and get in, okay?

140
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,082
Hey.

141
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,796
You're the new security guard, right?

142
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,381
How's are you doin'?

143
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,425
Whatcha doing there?

144
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,093
Reading a book?

145
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,889
You were supposed to be on guard duty
but don't worry...

146
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,056
I was covering for you.

147
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,644
Are you sure you didn't come here
because you miss the leader's chair?

148
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,062
It sure is comfortable.

149
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,899
And you know what?

150
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,109
I prefer the floor.

151
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,084
I'm so glad we evacuated.

152
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,671
Do the police even care
if something happens to us?

153
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,590
Who knows?

154
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,010
You think they planned
to rescue us in the first place?

155
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,223
But more than that,

156
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,145
I get how the Director knew,
but how did that little girl find out?

157
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,606
What?

158
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,442
How did she find out

159
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,403
that Special Agent Park was
carrying out a secret mission.

160
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,907
How did that little girl find out
before us? Think about it.

161
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,162
He probably informed her
that he was coming.

162
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,958
She's the daughter

163
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,502
of the US ambassador.

164
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,837
So she's a VIP.

165
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,381
How can you be so sure?

166
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,592
She was the one who told us
we needed to evacuate the hostages.

167
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,636
Maybe she did out of a change of heart.

168
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,264
So they don't care
whether we rot in here

169
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,725
as long as the VIPs make it out alive?

170
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,477
All right, all right, that's enough.

171
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,358
With the hostage standoff

172
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,735
at the Unified Mint
on the Korean Peninsula,

173
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,698
the world's attention is focused on how
the South and North Korean governments

174
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,781
will resolve it.

175
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,452
Some voices in the foreign media
have questioned whether the responses

176
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,871
from the two countries
have been insufficient so far...

177
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,914
Ambassador... We should...

178
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,670
My daughter has been
in that damn Mint for days now!

179
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,505
Ambassador, we have to stay calm.

180
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,925
You're a father too! Would you stay calm
if your daughter was a hostage?

181
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,468
I completely understand.

182
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,596
That's why I'm here to make sure
the police don't endanger the lives...

183
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,682
Not another word, Sangman! Shut it!

184
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,935
If even a single hair
on my Anne gets hurt,

185
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,146
you can forget
about your Inter-Korean Summit!

186
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,440
Ambassador. I'm confused.

187
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,567
The Summit has nothing to do
with this situation.

188
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,113
Sangman, you know that the director of
the CIA and I were classmates at Brown.

189
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,781
Well, he's informed me

190
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,367
that you and Mr. Oh have placed
major investments on the summit

191
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,578
and expect to cash in big.
Is this correct?

192
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,663
- That's non-sense...
- Enough!

193
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,373
You can tell Mr. Oh

194
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,003
that if anything happens to my daughter,
he won't get to see any of it, okay?

195
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,314
So he's really pissed off?

196
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,983
Using force isn't an option now, is it?

197
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,611
You know...

198
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,573
I have a lot of connections as well,
and I just heard a very strange rumor.

199
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,160
According to my sources,

200
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,913
these scumbags are printing
their own money inside the Mint.

201
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,248
What? But how is that even...

202
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,625
Do you know

203
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,586
how much of my own time and money I put

204
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,215
in developing the empty fields
and barren mountains of North Korea?

205
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,385
And do you know how many won I've spent
so that you can become President?

206
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,221
If I lose that money,

207
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,265
you can forget about
our business arrangement, okay?

208
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,813
But you saw how the US Ambassador reacted.

209
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,273
It's not like we can use force recklessly.

210
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,526
I don't get what's so difficult.

211
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,954
As long as we rescue his daughter,
there won't be any problems, right?

212
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,594
I checked the Mint's electricity use,

213
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,680
and it's obvious
that they're using the printers.

214
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,931
Okay.

215
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,141
What did they say, though?

216
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,184
Uh, well, I made a report,

217
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,312
and they're discussing
how to handle it since this is important.

218
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,524
What?

219
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,694
And the serial numbers?
Is it possible to track them?

220
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,281
They told me
they were looking into that too.

221
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,452
Do they want us to do our jobs or not?

222
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,080
So, um, listen.

223
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,667
They want us to stop wiretapping the Mint.
Those were direct orders from them.

224
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,462
Wait, are you being serious?

225
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,548
Why do they want us to stop?

226
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,386
A lot of civil complaints.
Just do what they said.

227
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,847
Wait, this doesn't make any sense.

228
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,808
Why are they stopping us
when this case is so important?

229
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,311
Inspector. Outside.

230
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,631
This is a message to those petty criminals

231
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,944
who've seized the Mint.

232
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:02,910
I, Kim Sangman, as a citizen
and assemblyman of the Republic of Korea,

233
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,037
am giving you all a strict warning.

234
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,123
As we are at a time of unification

235
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,168
where both North and South Korea plan
for harmony and growth,

236
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:15,631
history will no longer
tolerate such acts of terrorism.

237
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,383
They only promote violence and conflict.

238
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,427
Return the hostages.

239
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,929
Let them go home...

240
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,889
home to their families and loved ones.

241
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:28,352
If any one of you there sympathizes
with any of the families gathered here,

242
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,687
then I say to you, take action.

243
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,105
And to anyone

244
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,025
among the criminals who
cooperate to resolve this,

245
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,654
as the leader of this party,
I will speak with the President

246
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,658
to guarantee full immunity
for those who help end this crisis.

247
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,993
If you are willing to do so,

248
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,578
please reach out to me.

249
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,139
Record it!

250
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,915
I vow to help you.

251
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,709
Get going! Get back! Stop pushing!

252
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,877
Mr. Kim Sangman!

253
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,420
Where are you, Captain Cha?

254
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,130
Kim Sangman has stopped the wiretapping.

255
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,214
and is trying
to persuade the robbers to cooperate.

256
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,759
Please hurry back.

257
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,322
CAPTAIN CHA, WHERE ARE YOU?
KIM SANGMAN STOPPED THE WIRETAPPING

258
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,184
Well, shit.

259
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,936
I mean, who'd even buy that crap?

260
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,897
He should've given us his number
if he wanted us to call him, right?

261
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,357
You're right.

262
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,819
Maybe they planted something
in the hostages' phones.

263
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,032
Oh. That makes sense.

264
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,495
Those sons of bitches must think they're
so clever by trying to mess with us, huh?

265
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,831
They're idiots.

266
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,292
You're the idiot.

267
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,672
Yeah.

268
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,925
Yeah, we saw it
because it was crazy outside.

269
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,554
But none of us care though.

270
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,222
Is that why you called?

271
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,142
Are you still intercepting
Moohyuk's phone calls and texts?

272
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,060
Mm-hmm. I have been. Why?

273
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,104
I need you to do something.

274
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,812
You okay?

275
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,856
Yeah?

276
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,902
Weren't they your parents?

277
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,864
On the TV just now?

278
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,913
- Did the Professor tell you?
- No.

279
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,748
It was all over your face.

280
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,716
Why? Are you worried
I'm gonna betray you guys?

281
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
I'm not.

282
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,429
You said that you'd buy an island
with the money.

283
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,609
- Where are you going?
- Gotta take a leak.

284
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,006
"I'll stay in here!"

285
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,633
And the Academy Award goes to...

286
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,719
I know. I heard her teacher
talking to some of the others.

287
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,639
Apparently, when the policeman came in,
he looked for her first.

288
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,474
If you think about it,

289
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,060
we're held here because
we're in the same class with her.

290
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,438
You're right. Ugh, I hate her.

291
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,608
Don't worry about them.

292
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,367
Thank you.

293
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,787
By the way,

294
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,039
you'd call me your friend,
am I right, Anne?

295
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,377
If the police sneak in again
to try to get you out of here,

296
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,671
do you think you could take me with you?

297
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,548
I really want to go home.

298
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,507
Of course. I will give you my word.

299
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,053
But first, there's something
you need to do for us.

300
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,622
I'LL HELP YOU ESCAPE
MEET ME IN BASEMENT AT 1PM

301
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,123
COME ALONE DON'T BE LATE

302
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:54,261
"Assemblyman Kim Sangman to the rescue
instead of our incompetent police."

303
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,972
"The true presidential candidate"?

304
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,768
No wonder he was being so irrational.

305
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,145
I see. So this was his plan.

306
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,313
Oh no.

307
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,818
If he's decided to be this reckless,

308
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,237
there's definitely something else.

309
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:19,578
- Any word from the Ministry?
- Yes. They just got back to me, but...

310
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,661
But?

311
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,460
According to the Ministry's
annual minting plan,

312
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,833
the bills do have serial numbers.

313
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,419
So they won't be able to print
or use any money as they like.

314
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,421
Usually, that's the case.

315
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,048
"Usually"? Are there exceptions?

316
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,925
There's an extra amount

317
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,845
scheduled to be printed
depending on the results of the summit,

318
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,680
but that amount was...

319
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,223
4,000,000,000,000 WON

320
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,267
No way. How many zeros are there?

321
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,024
I'm saying, the police can't be trusted.

322
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,861
So now we have to find a way
to get ourselves out of here.

323
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,738
Yeah, well,

324
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,074
but we really can't do anything
right now, no?

325
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,161
Come to think of it,

326
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,581
you knew what would happen,
that there'd be all this chaos.

327
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,000
Why didn't you do anything to stop them?

328
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,336
I did. I told them it was dangerous.

329
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,681
Guess what?
Nobody bothered to listen to me.

330
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,674
Go ask that cop. Go.

331
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,718
He'll say
that I'm telling you guys the truth.

332
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,179
I can't, I don't know where he is.

333
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,972
You dumb son of a bitch.

334
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,099
What? Hey, Choi.

335
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,478
- What'd you say, huh? You bastard!
- Hey!

336
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,146
What is goin' on?

337
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,610
This isn't just a couple billion.

338
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,434
We're talking four trillion won,
with unknown serial numbers,

339
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,145
which has already been allocated
for reunification,

340
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,106
not for distribution.

341
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,084
Meaning those bastards can print
all the money they want

342
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,109
and we can't trace it.

343
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,612
But you knew that.
That's why you keep trying to interfere.

344
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,866
First the divorce, now this.
Do you enjoy dragging things out?

345
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,414
It's okay, you'll thank me later.
Thanks to me, this will end soon.

346
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,211
Did someone in the Mint contact you
after the broadcast?

347
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,965
Don't worry.
Just go and pick up the pieces.

348
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,426
You should have used force
when they seized the Mint.

349
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,137
What's the point in negotiating
when the Summit's coming up!

350
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,681
"Pick up the pieces"? What do you mean?

351
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,517
- We can't just force our way in.
- What? Why not, huh?

352
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,227
Because of what? The hostages?

353
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,397
It's all because of that US ambassador's
bitch of a daughter, right?

354
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,615
Did you tell one of them
to sneak Anne out?

355
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,535
We'll see.

356
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:11,458
And if they did, it's not like our
inept police will make a move right away.

357
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,501
If it's not...

358
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,633
No way. You're insane!

359
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,968
Call it off right now!

360
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,433
If you grant me full custody of Mina,
then I'll reconsider it.

361
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,548
Connect me with the Professor
through this phone.

362
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,883
Yes, right now.

363
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,586
Why the sudden call?

364
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,268
There's been a few incidents,

365
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,271
and though we're on opposing sides,
we do have one thing in common.

366
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,855
What?

367
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,778
- That we don't want casualties?
- Yes.

368
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,488
Listen to me very carefully.

369
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,700
You have a traitor among your ranks.

370
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,246
I don't know who the traitor is,

371
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,582
but they're going to kill Anne.

372
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,960
- Shit!
- Shit!

373
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,398
Where is Anne?

374
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,401
Has anyone seen Anne?

375
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,484
Shit.

376
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:04,821
Find her.

377
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,329
Oh shit.

378
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,290
Where did that little brat go? Shit!

379
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,710
What? You mean someone seriously
believed that guy's bullshit?

380
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,753
That's not what's important right now.

381
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,423
We need to focus on finding
that Anne girl first.

382
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,426
Stay. Keep an eye on them
while we go look.

383
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,509
Let's go.

384
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,388
Oh shit. Unbelievable, man.

385
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,973
Something's happened.

386
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,976
Yeah. I heard that it's the police.

387
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,478
Those guys might still be
trying to save the girl.

388
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,822
Anne's gone missing. We need help.

389
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,581
Where is she?

390
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,427
I can't find her.
Did you see anything on the cameras?

391
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,639
I found something.
This footage is from 20 minutes ago.

392
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,975
They took a bomb from the supply room.

393
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,852
A bomb?

394
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,021
Who the hell is that?

395
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,494
Find out where they went. Track them down.

396
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,655
Hold on. Right here.

397
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,615
The camera angle is weird.

398
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,075
Rewind the footage.

399
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,542
They set up the bomb inside the vault.

400
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,796
Shit.

401
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,468
- Do we have any updates?
- No, not yet.

402
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,495
Are you insane? Why did you
give them that information, huh?

403
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,123
Then what? And leave her to die?

404
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,001
She dies, and they'll hold you accountable
with the rest of us.

405
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,599
No. No.

406
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,747
- Was that an explosion?
- Whoa! Did you hear that?

407
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,522
Hey, shut it, all of you!

408
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,351
Did anyone else hear that noise?

409
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,373
Is she here?

410
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,127
- What's going on?
- Did something happen to Anne?

411
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,254
I don't know anything!
So go back to your places!

412
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,131
- I said go back now!
- We need answers.

413
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,015
But what if
something happened to her?

414
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,594
Anne!

415
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,514
Are you okay?

416
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,767
What happened?

417
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,187
Anne, are you all right?

418
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,356
- You're not hurt, are you?
- Where have you been?

419
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,149
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

420
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,628
Someone gave her a note saying
they'd help her escape

421
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,278
and told her to meet them at the vault.

422
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,492
And Helsinki found this mask
in front of the exhibition hall.

423
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,703
I kept my eye on them,
but I looked away, and she was gone.

424
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,834
The footage. You weren't able
to find out who it was?

425
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,294
They used the cameras' blind spots
when they moved.

426
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,672
I couldn't track them.

427
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,969
After all, if it was one of us,
they'd have to know every camera.

428
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,472
What the fuck, you guys?

429
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,765
Which one of you is it? Huh?

430
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,435
The one who gets worked up
is always the most suspicious

431
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,436
What?

432
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,149
- It's you, right?
- That's enough, son!

433
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,318
We should be glad no one died.

434
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,990
Ugh, shit.

435
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,576
It was clear
that one of us was the traitor.

436
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,580
As our suspicions about one another grew,

437
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:10,459
the hostages began to band together
around Anne who had returned.

438
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,255
You... You had a chance
to escape, but you didn't go?

439
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,341
No, I did go.

440
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,220
Because I couldn't stand being here
so I just wanted to go.

441
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,056
But then I didn't feel good
about going alone,

442
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,766
leaving you all trapped in here.

443
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,604
And you didn't notice anything suspicious
on the way there?

444
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,023
Just stop it.

445
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,443
I was worried about
what would happen to everyone.

446
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,279
I didn't want to put you all in danger,
just because I escaped.

447
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,825
It's all just embarrassing.

448
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,120
You're right, Anne.

449
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,122
It's embarrassing, right?

450
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,459
We should be working together
at a time like this.

451
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,770
We can't divide ourselves
like the North and South used to.

452
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,629
Now's not the time.

453
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,088
And it appears like the police

454
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,217
are more interested in ending
the situation than ensuring our safety.

455
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,278
Our captors said they'd keep us safe
if we cooperated,

456
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,137
but after this,
we can't trust them anymore.

457
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,972
Well, yes...

458
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,475
You're saying
all the right things, ideally.

459
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,436
Realistically, we can't just band
together and cause an uprising, right?

460
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,854
What can we do?

461
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,899
We only have our bare hands
and they've got assault rifles.

462
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,779
Right. At least nobody got hurt,
so we should all be relieved by that.

463
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,830
I'm glad you're back.

464
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,171
Wait, there's another reason
why I came back.

465
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,132
I know where the guards are.

466
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,801
They're downstairs.

467
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,928
The North Korean officer too.

468
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
What?

469
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:57,024
Professor? We detected a major tremor.
What happened in there?

470
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,401
It was nothing.

471
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,027
Anne is safe.

472
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,698
That's good to hear.

473
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,534
So is everyone else safe as well?

474
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,578
Everyone is safe because of you.
Thank you.

475
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,084
Does... Does that mean we can
trust each other now?

476
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,336
Yes.

477
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,131
And I mean that.

478
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,049
Then don't you think it's about time

479
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,051
that we discuss
what it is you're really after?

480
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:29,015
I've never seen you
and I don't know what you sound like,

481
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,474
but you know something?

482
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,727
I'm like you, Professor.

483
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,439
I do think we could have been friends
under different circumstances.

484
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,259
And now that we trust each other,

485
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,359
tell me what you're really after

486
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,611
and I promise
we won't pull any more tricks.

487
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,490
We can prevent the worst outcome
if we start an actual negotiation.

488
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,414
I don't understand what you mean.

489
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,005
Is that really
how you want to play this?

490
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,341
Fine, then I'll tell you
what we already know.

491
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:04,967
You're not in there.

492
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,471
You're outside, watching how
everything's playing out,

493
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,056
pretending to negotiate with us.

494
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,476
When in reality
you're going to stab us in the back.

495
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,770
Did you like thinking
you're the smart one?

496
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,148
Just stop wasting my time

497
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,734
and instead, do something about
that Kim Sangman.

498
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,236
I don't like someone else butting in.

499
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,537
You should know why
he keeps getting involved,

500
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,240
unless I gave you too much credit.

501
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,327
I'm going to ask you again.

502
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,662
This could be the last time I do,

503
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,540
so you better think carefully
before answering.

504
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,124
Tell me

505
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,587
what do you really want from this?

506
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,217
Let me make it real clear.

507
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,887
All I'm trying to do is make a fortune.

508
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,599
With no one getting hurt in the process.

509
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,522
Okay, then.

510
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,911
Okay. Back to work.

511
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,373
- Start wiretapping them again.
- Yes, ma'am.

512
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,875
What did you say?
We can't. They ordered us to stop...

513
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,253
- I'm not taking their orders anymore.
- What?

514
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,272
All they want is to end this quickly
because of a summit.

515
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,576
They don't care if someone dies.

516
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,967
Those bastards are in there
printing money.

517
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,094
They're making as much as
four trillion won.

518
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,680
And you know how they're able to do that?

519
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,474
Because the summit was preparing
to issue that money

520
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,184
for the reunification fund.

521
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,130
How did they find out about that?

522
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,665
Do they have some kind of
political agenda we don't know about?

523
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,982
We don't know.

524
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,985
But what we do know is that our job is
to stop them from taking any money

525
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,070
and to rescue every hostage in there.

526
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,741
I won't tolerate
their interference anymore.

527
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,368
Do I make myself clear?

528
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,416
All right. So what's your plan?

529
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,295
We can't rescue the hostages, but we can...

530
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,965
stop them from printing money.

531
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,218
We'll cut off

532
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
the electricity.

533
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,869
Are you sure
you checked everything thoroughly?

534
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,706
What, the surveillance?

535
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,167
You can check it yourself
if you don't trust me.

536
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,628
When that Kim Sangman
was talking shit on TV,

537
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,131
surrounded by the hostages' families,
I had a compelling thought...

538
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,257
"Are Rio's parents there?"

539
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,760
When were you planning to tell us?

540
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,683
Well...

541
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,144
I told him not to say anything.

542
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,318
Everyone's already suspicious
of one another

543
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,041
and I don't want things to get fucked up.

544
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,661
That was before we got a traitor
among the ranks.

545
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,384
Don't you think it's reasonable for us
to doubt everyone's motives?

546
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,921
It's a good idea, Inspector Seon,

547
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,049
but since it's a major facility,
we will need approval.

548
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,802
What if Kim Sangman or the Professor
hears about this?

549
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,053
Inspector Seon.

550
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,847
I checked the call log
from when we stopped wiretapping,

551
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,808
and someone on the outside
contacted a hostage.

552
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,060
It must've been
Kim Sangman and the traitor.

553
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,770
Was it a phone call?

554
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,647
No. Just texts.

555
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,607
But they're a little strange.

556
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,612
KIM SANGMAN IS TRYING TO CONTACT
THE ROBBERS. FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTS.

557
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,407
So... who's the sender?

558
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,951
It's... Captain Cha Moohyuk.

559
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,202
- What?
- Wait. What?

560
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,330
You mean Captain Cha's a mole
for those bastards?

561
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,540
Where is he now?

562
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,501
JEA POLICE STATION

563
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,385
He's inside the JEA Police Station.

564
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,297
He's about to be removed
from the Task Force

565
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,965
so he's digging for information there?

566
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,181
I've been busy messing with
Cha Moohyuk's phone, like, all day long.

567
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,182
And so what?

568
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,978
I was planting the fake texts
just like the Professor asked me to.

569
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:30,190
On top of that, I also had to stop him
from contacting the Inspector.

570
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,275
Look, check it out.

571
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,207
KCSI
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

572
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,335
What happened to the analysis I asked for?

573
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,420
We gathered some samples

574
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,922
and we're analyzing it right now,
but that takes time.

575
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,342
Can't you do it faster? It's quite urgent.

576
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,844
Sounds like you've seen
too many police shows.

577
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,282
Look, the result doesn't just pop up
right when you put it in the database.

578
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,950
From dozens of all the similar patterns...

579
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,143
Look, I know what the suspect looks like.

580
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,896
- Come on, I only need to see if it's him...
- Look, man...

581
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,774
There's a protocol. I can't do that.

582
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,401
Wait. Do me this favor. I need to know.

583
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,070
I'm sorry, I can't.

584
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,947
Hey there, fellas.

585
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,201
Are you Captain Cha Moohyuk
from the Ministry of State Security?

586
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,620
What's this about?

587
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,706
I'm with the JEA Police Security Division.
I'm Detective Lee.

588
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,804
What are you doing?

589
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:45,933
There's evidence that you've been
leaking information to the criminals,

590
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,518
the ones who seized the Mint.

591
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,395
What's that?

592
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,698
Cha Moohyuk!

593
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,700
You're only making things worse
for yourself.

594
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,909
Open up!

595
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,413
CAPTAIN CHA
CRAFTING KNIFE

596
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,415
Open up!

597
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,965
Open up!

598
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,012
I said, open up!

599
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,850
I gave Rio a secret task

600
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,060
since there's a chance
there's a traitor among you.

601
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,854
So you mean to say...

602
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,893
that you ordered a traitor
to create another traitor.

603
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,947
Like Rio said,
Cha Moohyuk has started to suspect me.

604
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,699
That's really funny.

605
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,201
You wanna stop talking shit, or what?

606
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,824
This little brat didn't want
to be a doctor,

607
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,081
so he left that life and joined our heist.

608
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,435
But as soon as things get hectic,
it's too much to handle.

609
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,002
He's been hitting on Tokyo,

610
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,463
but she's not interested in him at all,

611
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:01,675
and that's when his parents
were on television.

612
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,262
So you got scared and wanted to run away.

613
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,347
Ain't that right?

614
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,058
I said, shut your damn mouth.

615
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,896
Come on. You know Rio was the one
who saved me

616
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,397
when I tried to open the vault.

617
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,401
Maybe he wanted to be a real man,
and save the woman he loves, right?

618
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,405
Shit. You're driving me fucking nuts, man.

619
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,449
So what? You think you're not suspicious?

620
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,326
Wanna look into everyone's alibis?

621
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,786
That's enough.

622
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,370
Listen up.

623
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,654
Yes, it's true
that there's a traitor in there with you.

624
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,291
And we need to find them quickly.

625
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,795
But if we start suspecting each other
because of that one person,

626
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,839
the chaos will only grow out of control.

627
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,383
For now, Tokyo will handle this,
so do as she says.

628
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,385
I still have to wrap things up
with Cha Moohyuk.

629
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,681
Hey! Stop!

630
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,810
The person you are trying
to reach is not available.

631
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,771
Please leave a message after the tone.

632
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,942
Park Sunho is the Professor.

633
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,780
I'll tell you the details
when we meet in person.

634
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,699
I'm going to your house right now.

635
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,881
Still nothing? He's the mole for sure.

636
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,716
It can't be.

637
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,135
Ma'am.

638
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,805
Captain Cha ran away.

639
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,431
Ran away?

640
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,115
I knew there was something off about him

641
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,060
as soon as he said he used to be a spy.

642
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,728
Hold on a second.

643
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,981
This doesn't make any sense.

644
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:42,024
Yesterday, he told me there was someone
he suspected of being the Professor

645
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,529
Why do you think he said that?
He lied to you to avoid suspicion.

646
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,155
Just think about it.

647
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,414
I'm planning to track him down.

648
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,666
When did you start seeing
that man, Park Sunho?

649
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,210
Wait.

650
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,714
I need to leave to check something.

651
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,842
- Prepare the operation while I'm gone.
- Yes, ma'am.

652
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,485
Okay, dinner cooking staff.
Get over here now!

653
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,871
Excuse me.

654
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,290
What is it?
You're not on the cooking staff.

655
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,876
I'm filling in for someone
on the cooking staff

656
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,669
because she's quite sick today.

657
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,963
It's not a big deal if I come, right?

658
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,007
I just wanted
to distract myself, you know.

659
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,633
Hmm.

660
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,093
Fine. Come on.

661
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,803
Let's go.

662
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,638
You son of a...

663
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,786
If she told her daughter
about what she saw the Professor do,

664
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,370
it will all be over.

665
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,165
Even if he didn't want to,

666
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,876
he knew there was only one way
to solve this problem.

667
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,387
Hello? Woojin, are you there?

668
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,639
Mom, what is it?

669
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,184
Mom.

670
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,020
Mom?

671
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,271
Yeah?

672
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,358
Who are you?

673
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:11,942
Mom!

674
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,363
Woojin, hi.

675
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,782
I'm sorry, did I call you?

676
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,951
I took the pills.

677
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,889
I didn't know your mother
was sick. What did the doctors say?

678
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,457
Just aging, you know.

679
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,711
Well,
thanks to my scatter brain,

680
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,005
I get to listen
to my busy daughter's voice

681
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,090
before she can come home.

682
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:38,011
Everything's okay, don't worry.
Remember not to overwork yourself.

683
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,194
He got lucky.

684
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,031
In the end, the Professor
couldn't shoot Woojin's mother,

685
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,827
and he was terrified that
his feelings for Woojin

686
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,329
could be the catalyst
that'd ruin the operation.

687
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:08,667
CHARGING STATION

688
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,308
CHARGING STATION

689
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,333
What's up? Are you spacing out?

690
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,420
Well, uh...

691
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,505
Come here. Come here.

692
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:59,801
If there was a traitor,
who do you think it could be?

693
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,469
'Cause I don't know, Dad.

694
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,221
Is this because of earlier?

695
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,850
Nairobi, she must have been
busy running the machines.

696
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,061
Helsinki and Oslo, they're too big.

697
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,232
And also, they were both
guarding the hostages when it happened.

698
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,985
Ah shit. Who is it?

699
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,863
Stop with the nonsense.
Pay attention.

700
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,080
I don't know what it is, but something's
distracting those two for sure.

701
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,248
I think now's our chance.

702
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,167
You should rest.

703
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,794
It's fine.

704
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,380
Is all this food for the hostages?

705
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,467
It's for the guards,
so you should put bigger portions.

706
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,093
Oslo's going to take them.

707
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,708
Thanks to Anne,
we know where they are.

708
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,359
I think we should turn the tides.

709
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,259
Let's say we contact the guards
and that police officer. Then what?

710
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,974
Really? You really have to go now?

711
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,310
If you're just trying to avoid work,
I'll make sure you die slowly.

712
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,062
I swear it's true.

713
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,315
My doctor said I have
irritable bowel syndrome, you know?

714
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,984
I... I'm serious.

715
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,836
Ugh! That's disgusting.

716
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,112
You can't get caught this time.

717
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,525
We're counting on you, Director.

718
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,698
Oh shit, this is fucking killing me.

719
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,977
The security cameras
caught the traitor at this specific time.

720
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:59,564
Rio, you weren't
in the Director's office then, right?

721
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,441
Don't you ever have to piss or shit?

722
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,650
Check this.

723
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,237
Oslo leaves to go back and forth between
the exhibition hall and the basement.

724
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,782
Shit. I don't see Denver or Nairobi?

725
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,826
We're not machines,
you know, we're human beings, huh?

726
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,496
So we're not allowed to step out at all?
Is that it?

727
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,625
Rio's right, so you should calm down and...

728
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,918
Let's think about it this way.

729
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,379
Rio can see everyone's movements
from right here,

730
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,757
and when he saw he had an opportunity,
this little rat did what little rats do.

731
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,844
Besides, he's the one who knows most
about the Mint's blind spots.

732
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,722
Just fucking stop.

733
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,100
Hey. Why didn't you
tell me you were coming here?

734
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,978
I just wanted to see you.

735
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,440
So where were you?
I've been waiting awhile.

736
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,777
Uh, something urgent came up
so I had to go.

737
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,737
"Something urgent"?

738
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,655
Which was?

739
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,659
Uh...

740
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,203
Is something wrong?

741
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,954
What happened to you?

742
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,959
I was just thinking about it,

743
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:47,130
and how you know quite a bit about me,
but I don't really know you.

744
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,301
Doesn't it seem strange though?
How I barely know you?

745
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,972
You don't like talking about yourself?

746
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,811
Um, let's go inside, huh?

747
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,699
- Woojin.
- Don't you dare move.

748
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,493
Don't ask any questions.

749
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,453
We're going upstairs.

750
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,042
Can you at least tell me
why you're doing this?

751
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,295
Why did you... approach me two months ago?

752
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,546
What do you mean "why"?

753
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,381
Forget it. Just go. Go!

754
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,701
Open it.

755
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,290
Do you really need to do this?

756
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,626
Show me what
you're hiding in there. Open it.

757
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,671
Open it now!

758
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,577
Are you happy now?

759
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,663
I'm sorry.

760
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:45,498
I can explain.

761
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,833
Uh...

762
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,505
One of my colleagues is wanted

763
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,217
for suspicion of leaking official secrets.

764
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,678
But he isn't the kind of person
who would do that.

765
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,264
And the last thing he told me about was...

766
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,434
about you. So I just thought that... that...

767
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,019
You thought that I was a criminal.

768
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,314
Did you think I was one of them?

769
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,399
Sunho, I don't think...

770
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,860
Woojin. What we had...

771
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,194
is over now.

772
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,366
- Sunho.
- Please leave.

773
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,161
Just go.

774
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,541
You know the way out.

775
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,438
The Professor had already decided
to end things with the Inspector.

776
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,149
even before she barged
into the restaurant.

777
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,402
But he never expected
that it would shatter his heart like this.

778
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,946
Now that Cha Moohyuk was gone,

779
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,158
Inspector Seon became a more crucial part
of our operation...

780
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,785
PARK SUNHO

781
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:07,288
...but the Professor concluded
that she'd gradually become his weakness.

782
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,581
NAM DONGCHUL

783
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,918
And as a result,
he had terrible price to pay.

784
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,001
Yeah.

785
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,222
We're ready to go, ma'am.

786
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:17,757
Okay.

787
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,402
I said it's not me!
Just leave me alone!

788
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:39,945
Rio.

789
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,448
What? So you don't trust me either?

790
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,325
I trust you.

791
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,328
Then why are you letting that crazy
son of a bitch frame me as a traitor?

792
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,080
You have to calm down.

793
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,249
This is exactly what they want right now.

794
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,000
"Calm down"?

795
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,711
Calm down, my ass.

796
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:55,794
Rio.

797
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:57,922
What?

798
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:01,300
Wow. You can always tell who's guilty
'cause they always put on a show.

799
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,177
Ah, shit!

800
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:07,432
Nairobi. Come join us.

801
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,392
What's going on?

802
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,854
We don't know much about your relationship
with your family,

803
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:13,937
but humor me.

804
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,149
I want you to imagine
that your parents were on TV.

805
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,859
How would you feel?

806
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,110
Well,

807
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,739
money's more important to me.

808
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,854
And I don't have a family to begin with.

809
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,954
Exactly. We came all the way here
to risk our lives for money, right?

810
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,831
Well, you two can go and fuck yourselves.

811
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,251
You're one foul-mouthed son of a bitch,
aren't you?

812
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,544
Think about it.

813
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,547
You're the only one
who doesn't really need the money, huh?

814
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,508
Also, you have a family
you can go back to.

815
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,677
That's right. To be honest,

816
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,638
I got a little choked up
when I saw my dad's face.

817
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,683
Because the dad I knew he'd never
go on TV for me,

818
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,967
even if someone forced him to.

819
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,019
But what?

820
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,706
You think I'd betray my colleagues
and kill Anne because I saw him?

821
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,398
I'd rather kill myself instead!

822
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,318
Fuck off! I'm done with your shit!

823
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,572
Then stop telling lies, and just die.

824
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,283
That's enough, Berlin.

825
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:12,954
Man.

826
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:17,126
Those folks upstairs are at it again,
always over nothing.

827
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,295
They'll figure out who it is soon enough.

828
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,464
We just gotta focus on the job.

829
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,132
Yeah, you got a point.

830
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,594
I'm gonna take some water
to the guys in the basement.

831
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,970
I guess they ran out.

832
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,766
Hey, hey, just do it tomorrow.

833
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,936
We don't want them peeing
in the middle of the night. Trust me.

834
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,021
Come on, they're all cooped up.

835
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:39,232
They're in such a tiny space
I feel bad for them.

836
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,150
- Jeez.
- I'll be right back.

837
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,535
Man!

838
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:59,210
I already knew that he'd be too soft
to be a part of a heist.

839
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,422
What are you doing?

840
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,939
Oh. No!

841
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,609
Drop the gun now.

842
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,861
Rio, you can still come clean.

843
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,906
But if you don't want to,
Tokyo will die instead.

844
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,200
It's ready, ma'am.

845
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,338
Attention, all units.

846
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,467
Cut off all electricity at the Mint.

847
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:31,552
Right now.

848
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,598
You shit...
