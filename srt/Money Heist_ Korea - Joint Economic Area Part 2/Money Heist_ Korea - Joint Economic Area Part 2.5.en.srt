1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,515
Faking a hostage situation there
will give us nine days to print the money

2
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,600
and dig our escape route.

3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,769
Once Moscow secures the route, I mean.

4
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:24,065
But I'm not sure if I can dig
a path like that all by myself, you know.

5
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,986
It'll be possible. The mercenaries
will dig from the outside too.

6
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,780
But, wait.
How do we move the money?

7
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,949
Four trillion won is a lot of cash.

8
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,745
We'll use the sewer system.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,956
If we use those rubber boats,
it should take two hours.

10
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,335
This is our exit.

11
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,173
If you go there, a disguised truck
will be waiting for you at the hideout.

12
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,883
Move the money onto the truck

13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,551
and we vanish.

14
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,845
But this isn't some magic trick, though.

15
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,807
The police will be hunting us down from
the second we step foot outside the Mint.

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:02,312
That's why it's on the same day
as the Inter-Korean Summit.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,318
Exactly ten days into the heist,
the summit will be held near our base

18
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,737
at the Pyeonghwa Hotel.

19
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,156
Does that mean security
will be even worse?

20
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,282
Yes.

21
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,286
Politicians from both the North and South

22
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,747
are putting everything on the line
for this summit.

23
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,342
By then, the people would know
that the real robbers

24
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,635
are the politicians, not us.

25
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,428
So they'll flood Pyeonghwa Square.

26
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,557
Then, chaos ensues.

27
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,406
TAEDONG RIVER BEER

28
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,627
TAEDONG RIVER BEER

29
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,469
You ready?

30
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,627
They took weapons!

31
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,822
AGAINST OPPORTUNISTS WHO STEAL MONEY

32
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,848
Don't stop fighting!

33
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,040
THE HOUSE OF PAPER
IS OURS

34
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,672
Punish Kim Sangman!
Punish Jeon Yongsu!

35
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,549
Be gone! Be gone!

36
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,551
Traitor! Kim Sangman!

37
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,929
Traitor! Jeon Yongsu!

38
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,722
Be gone! Be gone!

39
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,942
But Oslo's dead already.

40
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,085
Helsinki! Helsinki!

41
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,505
Helsinki!

42
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,507
No!

43
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,175
Guns!

44
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,469
Fuck!

45
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,304
Hurry!

46
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,388
Here!

47
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,917
- Berlin!
- Berlin!

48
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,852
Berlin!

49
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,896
Rio! Get it together!

50
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,356
Let's go! Get back!

51
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,907
Dad!

52
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:56,045
No!

53
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,207
Situation is under control.

54
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,019
No! No! No!

55
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,020
No!

56
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,419
MONEY HEIST: KOREA - JOINT ECONOMIC AREA

57
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,798
Rio.

58
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,928
You listening?

59
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,013
Yeah.

60
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:17,603
Mmm. I know you're a bit nervous
now that the summit's been moved,

61
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,274
because that means we need to escape
even earlier than we originally thought.

62
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,735
We've been printing
a lot of money.

63
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,696
But the escape route isn't ready yet.

64
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,240
Exactly. Will this work?

65
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,702
Can't we just stay in here
and forget the summit?

66
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,328
No, we can't.

67
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,165
Once the summit is over,
they'll come after us in here,

68
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,209
because we'll be
the police's top priority then.

69
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,128
Everyone got it?

70
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,130
So tomorrow...

71
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,872
...we need to get out of here.

72
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,718
We'll have to hurry.

73
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,179
Let's try to make use
of the remaining hostages.

74
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,766
The escape route isn't done,
so I'll send most of the hostages there.

75
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,603
This is important,
so tell Moscow the plan.

76
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,604
Will do.

77
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,855
Mmm.

78
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,409
Uh...

79
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,994
Hey, Tokyo, hold on.

80
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,288
So the, uh...

81
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:22,835
The Professor just decided to move
the date based on assumptions, right?

82
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,919
Okay, so?

83
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,925
Professor didn't even expect

84
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,219
the cut in communications or Oslo's death.

85
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,639
Think about it.
How does the Professor know

86
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,767
that the summit will be moved
without any evidence at all?

87
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,061
The Professor is not a prophet, but...

88
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,522
He's our leader.

89
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,733
Okay, but...

90
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:50,780
if that leader is trying to hide something
from the rest of his followers,

91
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,156
is he trustworthy?

92
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,452
Do you know why Berlin came here
despite his illness?

93
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,456
It turns out that
he and the Professor are brothers.

94
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,875
The Professor made us hide our real names,

95
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,127
but hid the fact
that he's Berlin's brother.

96
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,090
Tokyo, did you know about this?

97
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,300
I just found out too.

98
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:23,854
So, Berlin is from a concentration camp,
and the Professor, from the North.

99
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,942
I don't really know what their whole
grand plan is in all of this heist thing,

100
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,361
but I know it's not about the money.

101
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,531
I bet those two won't even care at all
if they died doing this.

102
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,326
Just because somebody is willing
to risk their life,

103
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,246
that doesn't mean
that they welcome death.

104
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,501
It just means they'll do whatever it takes
to make their dream a reality.

105
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,130
Hmm?

106
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,476
Sorry.

107
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,772
I just don't have any idea
what that goal is,

108
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,609
but I'm not interested in this.

109
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,696
Rio.

110
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,038
Dad, are you here?

111
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,914
Dad, where...

112
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,503
Oh God! Dad!

113
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,048
- The strongest men go with Helsinki.
- Right here.

114
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,049
Rio!

115
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,425
Rio, where are you?

116
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,803
Someone get Rio down here!

117
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,014
Rio, hurry it up now!

118
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,515
- Rio!
- Jeez, what?

119
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,018
Rio, fucker! Get down here!

120
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,853
Dad! Dad, are you okay?

121
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,729
What's this?

122
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,607
Rio, help us.
You... You have to do something.

123
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,609
What are we gonna do?

124
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,195
Get his clothes off.

125
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,697
- Don't just stand there. Get first aid!
- Okay.

126
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,241
- Don't move.
- I'm okay.

127
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,577
- Be careful.
- Careful.

128
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,287
Those damn fucking bastards!

129
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
Please. Quickly!

130
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,419
As we approached
to the start of the final act,

131
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,881
unexpected events
were throwing our success into question.

132
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,927
Inside the Mint, Moscow was dying.

133
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,471
Hey, sir. Wake up!

134
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,114
- Sir!
- Hey, man, are you okay?

135
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,103
And outside the Mint, Cha Moohyuk,
who knew where the hideout is,

136
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,938
was out of the Professor's hands.

137
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,061
Call an ambulance!

138
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,995
On top of that, the Inspector
discovered the Professor's identity.

139
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,749
The Professor's plan,
which had seemed so perfect,

140
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,711
was beginning to shatter
into a million pieces.

141
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,643
They needed more people
to print money,

142
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,307
so they offered their hostages
three billion won each.

143
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,727
The Mint's director fell for it also.

144
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,370
But how they'll actually pay them is...

145
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,604
The money is just bait.

146
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,940
The hostages wouldn't obey them anymore,

147
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,276
so the robbers just threw it out there.

148
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,448
But they're still so determined
to keep holding out.

149
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,200
The summit is in two days from now.

150
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,578
Can't we just force our way in?

151
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,539
They did let a lot
of the hostages go free,

152
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:32,084
and the rest decided to stay voluntarily,
so for now, we can't.

153
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,878
The public opinion favors them too.

154
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,317
It's Song Jungho!

155
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,091
Yes?

156
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,219
So what is it now?

157
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,228
Let's go.

158
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,983
Don't stop.

159
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Stop now.

160
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,869
Listen! We let the hostages go,
as we promised.

161
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,872
But your snipers shot at us,
and because of that...

162
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,874
someone here has been injured!

163
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,375
This's ridiculous.

164
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,961
Tell them they didn't
release them peacefully

165
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,380
and that we just acted accordingly.

166
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,384
That happened because
you didn't release them peacefully

167
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,094
like you had promised!

168
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,138
I'm not here for your bullshit!

169
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,558
We ask that you send a medical team
to treat him right now.

170
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,268
What do we do?

171
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:35,064
Let's just tell him to send
the injured man to us for any treatment.

172
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:41,028
Send us the injured man
and we can take care of him!

173
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,114
Those fucking sons of bitches!

174
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,535
Let's go.

175
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,163
Slowly. Back up slowly.

176
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,630
Do you think they'll actually
send him to us, though?

177
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,090
Who knows?

178
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,300
It might be another game to buy time.

179
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,262
But if the injured person
is a hostage, what...

180
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,015
It doesn't matter.

181
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,144
- Get the car!
- Wait. Where are you going?

182
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,856
Just wait here.

183
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,330
The floor where Cha Moohyuk is
is heavily guarded, ma'am.

184
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,623
There's no way in.

185
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,673
I'm not sure how much Cha Moohyuk knows,

186
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,675
but he knows this location at least.

187
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,137
If he tells the police,
our operation is through.

188
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,264
But he might not wake up
for a while, though.

189
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,393
We just can't proceed
with that big of a risk.

190
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,562
Then...

191
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,732
What if we use the Inspector?

192
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,651
We can't.

193
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,653
It won't work.

194
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:09,491
Why? But she's one of the only cards
that we have left.

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,209
Hi, Woojin.

196
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,462
Hi, are you at the café?

197
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,256
Uh, yeah. What's up?

198
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,758
Well, the thing is,

199
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,137
my colleague was in an accident,
so I was on my way to the hospital,

200
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,056
but my car won't start.

201
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,770
I'm near the café,
so I was wondering if you're not too busy...

202
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,688
I'll be right there.

203
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,233
Just give me a few minutes. Okay?

204
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,266
I did everything that I can, but...

205
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,561
So, now what?

206
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,606
Huh?

207
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,620
Fuck! We can't even get in touch
with the Professor.

208
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,374
This can't be happening.

209
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,215
I know it's tough,
but focus on the operation.

210
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,553
We have to do what we can
to escape before the summit ends.

211
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,763
That way, we can save Moscow

212
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,308
and our plan will succeed as well.

213
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,185
It's all over.

214
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,313
What is?

215
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,607
Hey, let's be real here.

216
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,276
The Professor's grand plan,

217
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
it has already failed.

218
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,782
That bastard.
What the fuck is he going on about?

219
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,744
Hey, Berlin.
Why don't you go ahead and tell them?

220
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,413
Then I'll tell them.

221
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,541
Professor is Berlin's brother.

222
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,462
They're both from the North
and pretended to be from here.

223
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,630
Getting the public opinion on our side?

224
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,383
Making them believe
we are revolutionaries?

225
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,428
Was that really for our sake?

226
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,095
Then what was it for?

227
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,224
Yeah, revolution? Revenge?

228
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,477
Why the fuck should I care about that?

229
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,814
Those commie bastards might be okay
with dying for that shit,

230
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,399
but then count me out.

231
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,401
Don't you all feel the same?

232
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,903
Rio.

233
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:58,410
Hey, Helsinki. Remember Oslo, who
always followed the Professor's word, huh?

234
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,163
What happened to him now?

235
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,999
Huh? And you, Nairobi?

236
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,044
You wanna see your son again.

237
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,505
Will it be at your funeral?

238
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,259
What about you, Denver, you dumbass?

239
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,430
You wanna save your dad,
then send him out of here right now.

240
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,602
Getting treatment in jail
is way better than dying here, right?

241
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,443
You know what? I'm leaving.

242
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,570
'Cause even if my share is small,

243
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,740
I won't blindly follow
the Professor's plan to an early grave.

244
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,617
And neither should all of you here.

245
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,539
- Fuck this shit!
- Rio!

246
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,376
Is everything he just said true, huh?

247
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,380
We hid the fact that we're brothers,

248
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,257
but what Rio said is false.

249
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,425
Just be honest with me right now!

250
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,470
What about leaving
on the day of the summit?

251
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,140
Is it really just to help escape?

252
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,810
Hey, Helsinki.

253
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,230
Dad, Dad, Dad,
you need to get up. Okay?

254
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,107
Just for a bit. We'll get you out of here.

255
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,109
I'm not going to leave here.

256
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,862
You're not going to leave, huh?

257
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:19,032
Rather just stay in this place and die?

258
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,828
If I die, it'll be here.

259
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,497
I'm not going back to jail.

260
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,916
Dad, please. Please.

261
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,669
Just will you listen to me? Please!

262
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,006
Everyone, look here.

263
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,051
We're just wasting our time here
right now.

264
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,222
The tunnel needs to be dug
for you to escape.

265
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,808
There's not much left to dig.

266
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,604
I'll try to hang on in here, okay?

267
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,401
Moscow's right. We only have one day.

268
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,989
Then we'll know if the Professor
was right, whether we like it or not.

269
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,326
Wouldn't it be better
to work toward escaping

270
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,369
rather than just standing around here?

271
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,955
I'll be okay.

272
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,124
Okay.

273
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,253
Misun.

274
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,841
While I'm digging,

275
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,428
will you take care of Dad?

276
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,013
- You will?
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,893
Helsinki.

278
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,731
Stop wasting your energy
on Berlin, and come with me right now.

279
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,692
We have to finish the tunnel
if we wanna get out alive!

280
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,028
Hurry up, damn it!

281
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,541
I'll be right here with you.

282
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:56,296
To be completely honest,
Berlin and I were just as anxious as Rio.

283
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,840
All we could do was believe

284
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,177
that the Professor's assumption
about the summit was correct.

285
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,248
KIM SANGMAN APPROVAL RATINGS DROP

286
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,904
The presidential election and the summit
are in a state of crisis,

287
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,725
and you have an answer for it?

288
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,271
We'll push up the summit
to tomorrow instead.

289
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,855
Wait, what are you talking about?

290
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,732
The summit isn't some party.

291
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,567
- You can't just change...
- Hold it.

292
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,361
Go on.

293
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,530
We're on edge right now
because we're worried

294
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,741
that things might go wrong
before the signing.

295
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,911
But all of the negotiations
have been settled,

296
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,621
all we need to do is sign it.

297
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,957
It's just one day early.

298
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:36,044
If we can sign additional bailouts
to North Korean companies...

299
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,715
Then we can enter the Mint without
any fear of the public turning on us.

300
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,435
With the disgraceful situation
that continues to unfold at the Mint,

301
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,021
the anxiety of the public is on the rise.

302
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,573
Things ultimately became
even more uncertain,

303
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,783
thanks to the loss of communication.

304
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,600
Thus, the North and South

305
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,102
agreed to make the summit happen
as soon as we possible can.

306
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,023
And with that...

307
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,569
...we've decided to move
the summit forward by a day.

308
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,654
Sir, you still have not given an answer

309
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,458
regarding the information provided
by the robbers from the other day.

310
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,160
Does this have anything to do
with the robbers' allegation?

311
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,243
Congressman!

312
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,475
Hurry, get in.

313
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,438
Sorry, it look me so long.
I couldn't find my keys.

314
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,440
That's it.

315
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,486
I thought for a minute
that maybe I should've taken a taxi.

316
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,028
Ah.

317
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,739
I'm so sorry.

318
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,411
So, where is your colleague
being treated right now?

319
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,996
It's Osung Hospital.

320
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,344
You know him too, right?

321
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,304
Captain Cha Moohyuk.

322
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,101
When you came by the TF that time.

323
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,396
Ah.

324
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,442
How are his injuries now?

325
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,444
I haven't gotten the chance
to see him yet.

326
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,781
But I've heard that
he hasn't really woken up yet.

327
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,214
Where's Misun right now?

328
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,469
I mean, she came back voluntarily.
She should be working like us.

329
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,264
She's taking care of Moscow
because he is injured.

330
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,643
She's part of the team now, isn't she, eh?

331
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,146
It's a family matter, that's why.

332
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,985
Just stop running your old mouth
and get back to printing.

333
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,032
Maybe you should stop running your mouth.

334
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,369
Instead, take this and run with your legs.

335
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,453
Uh...

336
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,499
That bitch.

337
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,968
So, just hang in there and Taeksu...

338
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,348
I mean, Denver will help you
get out of here.

339
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,312
I know that you may not really, well...

340
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,230
like me.

341
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,569
Where's your hometown, dear?

342
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,071
It's Kaesong.

343
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,823
You went to school there. Correct?

344
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,619
Why would a smart, young lady like you

345
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,746
choose someone like him?

346
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,212
I feel like I've never really

347
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,258
done something by choice
throughout my entire life.

348
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,888
It was because of my parents
that I ended up going to college.

349
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,390
Dating was the same.

350
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,687
When the Director said he really liked me,

351
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,149
I dated him because I thought
that my parents would like for me

352
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,776
to be with a powerful man,

353
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,905
even though he was lying
about getting a divorce.

354
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,949
I wasn't really that sad at all.

355
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,160
Then I happened to meet your son and...

356
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,081
despite how immature and clumsy he seemed,

357
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,875
he was so sincere.

358
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,045
So, for the first time in my life,

359
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,966
I followed my heart and chose him.

360
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,302
And I'm so glad that I did.

361
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,178
At your age,

362
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,890
it's possible to feel that way.

363
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,146
But once you start to look all around you,

364
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,359
there are a lot of guys just like him.

365
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,238
You should have just left already.

366
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,741
Why on earth did you come back?

367
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,827
I thought I would die without him.

368
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,706
But when I see him now,

369
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,666
I feel like I'm alive.

370
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,252
You feel that way now.

371
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:16,885
But sooner or later,
he'll go back to his old ways, and then...

372
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,682
you won't even be able to leave him

373
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,312
because you'll be a criminal too.

374
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,610
I know that I might regret it.

375
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:40,784
But if I just let go of your son
and go on living the way I used to,

376
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,537
I'll regret that as well.

377
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,641
You go in. I'll wait right here.

378
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,975
Thanks so much.

379
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,883
Why don't you just come in with me?
I don't think it'll take too much time.

380
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,761
Oh, yeah.

381
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,348
Why not? Might as well.

382
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,243
They're going in.

383
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,582
Copy that.

384
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,500
Right.

385
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:03,176
He disappeared when he was pursued
for leaking inside information.

386
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,096
I never imagined he'd show up
looking like this, though.

387
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,432
So, what happened to him?

388
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,519
Something must have happened to him
when he was running away from someone.

389
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,438
It's not the police.

390
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,067
I believe it must be them.

391
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,737
You mean the robbers?

392
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,240
Maybe they went after him
because he knew things

393
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,659
that he shouldn't.

394
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,916
After Captain Cha Moohyuk wakes up,

395
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,483
we'll be able to know what they are.

396
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,226
When do you think
he'll wake up?

397
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,970
Don't know.

398
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,764
Do you mind waiting here for a second?

399
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,016
I have to go speak with the doctor.

400
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,602
Go ahead.

401
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,115
Backup standby.

402
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,398
Copy that.

403
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,717
If I don't make it back,
continue the plan without me.

404
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,011
What are you saying right now?

405
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,346
If he talks now,
everything we worked for is over.

406
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,391
In a hospital full of police,

407
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,769
it won't be easy to silence him for good,

408
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,606
but making it out will be even harder.

409
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,067
But what's the point of all of this
if you end up getting caught?

410
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,153
If it means the success of our plan,

411
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,449
then I accept rotting in prison forever.

412
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,159
It's worth it.

413
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,687
What did they say?

414
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,488
It'll take him few more days at least
before recovering

415
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,449
and regaining his consciousness.

416
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,121
The doctor doesn't even know he can
ever speak again.

417
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,665
Oh Jesus.

418
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,253
I want nothing more than to capture

419
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,297
the people who did this
to Captain Cha right away.

420
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:52,011
But I was moved from the TF
so I can't do anything.

421
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,514
There is nothing I can do now.

422
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,795
There's no need to worry.

423
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,610
Captain Cha Moohyuk...

424
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,197
I'm sure he'll be just fine.

425
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,638
Are you sure

426
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,027
you don't want me to give you a ride home?

427
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,145
I'm fine. The chief is coming here soon,
and I'd like to speak with him.

428
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,375
Was that really the Professor?

429
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,464
Then why didn't you stop him, huh?

430
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,010
We have to catch the whole group
to stop his operations.

431
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,889
He's been toying with the police and me
this whole time.

432
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,683
He thinks we're in the palm of his hand.

433
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,106
And I'm going to show him
just how wrong he is.

434
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm on my way.

435
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,613
Cha Moohyuk's in a coma right now.

436
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,991
Looks like he's going to the summit.

437
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,975
Do you think his goal is terrorism?

438
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,995
We'll know soon enough.

439
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,123
You call the station
and have them send backup.

440
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,207
Okay, got it.

441
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,805
Take a break, will you?

442
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,809
If you keep this up, you'll be dead
before your father is, okay?

443
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,023
How about you get rid of all this dirt?

444
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,629
He just pulled over.
That must be his hideout, right?

445
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,634
Block off all potential escape routes.

446
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,534
Damn.

447
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,832
He's not here.

448
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,919
Suspect missing,

449
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,046
He seems to have entered the building.

450
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,716
His group may be inside,
so everyone be careful.

451
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,243
Over here!

452
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,147
I'm on my way.

453
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,065
FIVE MINUTES EARLIER

454
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,508
Cha Moohyuk's in a coma right now.

455
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,528
We put a GPS tracker
on the Inspector's car, right?

456
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,239
We did. But why?

457
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,782
She's heading to our hideout.

458
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,662
Oh God.

459
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,604
I'm telling you, he's the Professor!

460
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,440
So you're saying he extracted
valuable information from you, right?

461
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,067
What happened to Moohyuk?

462
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,404
I don't know, but he may have been
attacked by his men.

463
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,741
Okay, and you could've caught him
just now, but you missed him, right?

464
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,411
That's because I wanted
to catch the whole group...

465
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,745
You left the TF!

466
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,999
You should've just left this up to us.
You said...

467
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,504
You said you've been dating him.

468
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,172
This is very serious.

469
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,301
Do you think
I just let him go like that on purpose?

470
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,553
You can explain all that later.

471
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,264
But just know for now
that you'll be suspended.

472
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,578
So, she had her suspicions too?

473
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,707
Get rid of any evidence
related to the Inspector.

474
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,042
But you know that already.

475
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,087
Anyway, Sangman announced

476
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,089
they've decided
to push up the summit by a day.

477
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,762
I guess we should

478
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,347
hurry, then.

479
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,066
Didn't you say that you'll find
your own way out?

480
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,611
Well, I still need this hole
to get out, you know?

481
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,251
Hey, I'll take over.

482
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,544
You're back, huh?

483
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,628
Yep.

484
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,926
Hey, dude, do you even know how to dig?

485
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,262
No, I don't, but I have to.

486
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:57,603
Do you really think
that the Professor will get us killed?

487
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,147
I don't know.

488
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,359
All I do know is
that I don't trust that guy.

489
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,989
Neither should you. Don't just assume
that the Professor will help you.

490
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,825
Once the tunnel is dug,

491
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,660
take your dad
and get out of here, you know?

492
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,454
The people here are so naive.

493
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:24,046
When Tokyo said
there were changes made to the plan,

494
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,509
I could picture how we'd escape here
in my head, like a movie.

495
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,719
And?

496
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,600
We got killed at the end. All of us.

497
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,153
Hey, Rio.

498
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,029
You should,

499
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,907
once we're done in here,

500
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,869
get out first.

501
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:03,377
You're the youngest
out of all of us here, so...

502
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,256
And you have a family.

503
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,800
And what about you, man?

504
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,137
Shit...

505
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:17,349
Well, I have to take care
of my dad, you know.

506
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,187
And if he ever finds out
I'm leaving the rest behind,

507
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,272
that old man will probably kick my ass.

508
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,652
Now it's my turn.

509
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,616
These kids with no military training
not knowing how to shovel.

510
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,552
You think it's the same? Huh?

511
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,639
Being killed by bullets
or your father's fists?

512
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:00,893
Together we live, apart we die. Huh?

513
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,394
You never heard of that before?

514
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,525
Hey, do you even know
who first came up with that saying?

515
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,692
Goddamn.

516
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,489
Yi Sun-sin. He said that, right?

517
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,951
It's Rhee Syngman.

518
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,662
He said that before he just ran away.

519
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,458
"He who seeks death shall live,
and who seeks life shall die."

520
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,585
This's what General Yi Sun-sin said, man.

521
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,921
That quote's good. Huh?

522
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,926
If you want to die,
then you'll wind up alive.

523
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:38,764
And if you want to live, fuck it, you die!
Goddamn it! God!

524
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,401
Hey!

525
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,111
Huh?

526
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,988
Did you hear that?

527
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,449
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

528
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,243
Who are you?

529
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,327
Can you hear me?

530
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,955
Yes! You're almost here!

531
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,583
Ah, shit.

532
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,543
Oh God.

533
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,336
We fucking did it.

534
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,547
Wait a minute. Hold on.

535
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,674
Hey! Hey, hey!

536
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,719
Listen to me, guys.
Moscow's badly injured.

537
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,430
His condition's critical.

538
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,764
Don't worry!

539
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,101
We'll be ready to treat our boy
as soon as he's through.

540
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,689
- Yes!
- Yes! Thanks a lot!

541
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,457
POLICE STATION JURISDICTION MAP

542
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,427
I thought you had to return that thing.

543
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,638
Why don't you take a break?

544
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,020
This is where Captain Cha was injured.

545
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,858
The Professor headed this way
when leaving the hospital.

546
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,906
That must mean their hideout
is somewhere between

547
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,283
here, and here.

548
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:28,082
Oh wow. That new mall
is over there, I think. It's nice.

549
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,626
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,130
They must have
good surveillance cameras, then.

551
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,346
Uh, wait, you're leaving?

552
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,473
But Mina will be home soon.

553
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,599
You two should eat.

554
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,104
Please take care of yourself, then.

555
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,941
You're the head of the family,
remember that.

556
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,411
Wait. Please stay with me, Moscow.

557
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,580
Please, you have to.

558
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,541
Moscow!

559
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,212
Go get Denver, right now.

560
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:17,922
Hurry.

561
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,851
We're through!

562
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,269
What? Really?

563
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,979
Oh my God!

564
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,315
Yeah!

565
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,110
- We're going to live now!
- Yeah!

566
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,987
- Taeksu!
- We're through!

567
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,197
- Yeah!
- Misun, hey, come over here.

568
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,451
Shit.

569
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,623
Misun, look right there. See there?

570
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,419
We reached the other side.
We're going to live now.

571
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,800
You should go now.

572
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,488
I'm sorry.

573
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,865
So are you awake now?

574
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,033
My dear.

575
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:33,415
Sorry for everything.

576
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,378
You said that our... our Taeksu...

577
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,799
...would end up like me, right?

578
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,138
I worked my ass off

579
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,433
to remit just that.

580
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,394
Not quite.

581
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,565
Taeksu grew up well.

582
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,484
Dependable and strong-willed.

583
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,238
You think so?

584
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,322
Mm-hmm.

585
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,450
I didn't raise him wrong, then?

586
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:10,994
Who he is now

587
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,288
is because of you.

588
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,290
Thank you, my dear.

589
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,800
Dad, Dad, Dad! What's wrong, huh?

590
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,510
Come on, answer me.

591
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:30,180
Dad, Dad, Dad, I'm here for you. See?

592
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,182
I'm here. Look at me, Dad.

593
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,562
- Dad.
- Move. Move.

594
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,106
Rio, do something.

595
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,858
Shit. Dad!

596
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,820
Rio, you bastard. Do something, right now!

597
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,201
Why are you

598
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,538
crying like that, Son?

599
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,081
Dad.

600
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,167
Are you awake now?

601
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,251
Yeah.

602
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:04,590
Dad, I just dug the whole thing.

603
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,927
You did?

604
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,011
Yeah.

605
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,264
Good job.

606
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,310
Now we just... we just have to
get out of here. Yeah?

607
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,355
Then go.

608
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,275
Taeksu.

609
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,776
When you get out...

610
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,197
with Misun...

611
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,117
be good to her. Okay?

612
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,622
If you ever break her heart,

613
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,668
I will kick your ass.

614
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,671
All right, I won't, Dad.

615
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,264
I love you.

616
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,647
I love... I love... I love you too, Dad.

617
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,398
I love you.

618
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:07,527
So just hang in there and wake up, okay?

619
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,992
In my entire life of digging and digging,

620
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,204
I've never truly had this much fun.

621
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,124
Thanks to all of you.

622
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,462
Thank you all for treating

623
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,881
this old man

624
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,217
and his son Taeksu like...

625
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,637
your family.

626
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,392
I know this is late, but...

627
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,812
I am...

628
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,023
Oh Mansik.

629
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,945
Oh... Man...

630
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,073
...sik.

631
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,116
D-D-Dad.

632
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,117
Dad.

633
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,121
Dad. What's wrong, huh?

634
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,709
Dad. Dad. Open your eyes, huh? Please.

635
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,045
Don't close your eyes. Please.

636
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,257
Dad. Wake up, please, Dad!

637
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,260
I dug the hole for you.

638
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,433
We...
We just had to get out of here.

639
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,393
Dad...

640
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,606
What do we do? What do we...

641
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,110
Dad.

642
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,926
What's going on?

643
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,469
You paying tribute?

644
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,888
Cheongmyung's idea.

645
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,766
He said it would save electricity too.

646
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,244
I can do this alone.

647
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,870
You should rest.

648
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,163
No.

649
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,085
My old man hated to see me

650
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,379
slacking off.

651
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:20,137
I'm gonna get out of here
and live a happy life forever,

652
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,306
just like my dad wanted.

653
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,591
To be honest, that was the very first
person I've ever seen die.

654
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,677
And I wonder how come
Moscow looked so calm?

655
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,307
Everyone would still be alive
if we never met the Professor.

656
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,017
Why was he so peaceful?

657
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,062
The day I met the Professor,

658
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,901
my friend,
who I used to rob loan sharks with,

659
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,278
was murdered right in front of me.

660
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,699
I'll never forget the face she made
when her life slipped away.

661
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,161
I never wanted to see
that kind of face again.

662
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,581
That's why I decided to work
for the Professor.

663
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,510
So, how did you meet her
in the first place?

664
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,503
She was the first friend I made
after moving to South Korea.

665
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,131
I was a restaurant server

666
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,635
and I happened to see
her gulping down leftovers there.

667
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,680
She saw me staring,
and then she offered me some.

668
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,725
That's friendship right there.

669
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,938
- Was she from North Korea?
- Like me?

670
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,733
No. She was South Korean.

671
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:06,076
Ever since my father's death,
I've lived solely as a South Korean.

672
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:10,455
In a world where money is key, I sold
anything and everything I could.

673
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,707
And the last thing I sold

674
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,627
was my conscience as a scholar.

675
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,713
Our group will provide capital,
and you, Professor,

676
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,799
will develop an economic cooperation plan.

677
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,469
Your work will be the key
for the reunification of the Peninsula.

678
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,265
But my plan
to accelerate unification

679
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,558
was just a means of making them money.

680
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,854
This land has become a battlefield
for capitalistic gains.

681
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,320
How a normal girl who loved K-pop
turned to dangerous robbery,

682
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,698
and how your friend died like that,

683
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,367
is undoubtedly all my fault.

684
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,413
This is all because of those bastards.

685
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,874
The real robbers out there.

686
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,209
We still have time now

687
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,423
and a chance to reclaim the future
they took from us.

688
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,721
Okay. I understand why you joined him.

689
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,974
But do you really
want to risk your life like this for that?

690
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,019
I mean, is it really worth
dodging all those bullets?

691
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,482
That's not the only reason
I risked my life to get back in the Mint.

692
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,735
Then, why then?

693
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,071
You and I are on very different paths.

694
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,284
Where we come from,
we were raised quite differently.

695
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:33,955
But like Moscow said,
it's like we've become family, you know?

696
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,832
I'm sure that the Professor would...

697
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,876
Uh, sorry to interrupt you.

698
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,463
I have to keep digging now.

699
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,840
Denver's going to be pissed.

700
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,470
I'll see you later then, okay?

701
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:50,764
Hmm?

702
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,073
You know, when I first met you all,

703
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,368
I really couldn't stand any of you guys.

704
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,451
That's ditto.

705
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,042
Our reasons for joining
and why we need the money

706
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,460
differs between us all.

707
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,963
But now that I'm at this point,

708
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,759
I don't really care about that anymore.

709
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,053
You guys are super cool.

710
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,140
What I meant was...

711
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,308
It's fine.

712
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,937
You don't have to launch
into some big speech.

713
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,020
Right, Rio?

714
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,982
Shit.

715
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,110
Okay.

716
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,156
No matter what it was
that brought each of us here,

717
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,201
today, we're all
getting out of here, together.

718
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,957
All right. Let's get moving now.

719
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,758
We're live in front of Pyeonghwa Hotel

720
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,053
where the Inter-Korean
Economic Cooperation Summit is being held.

721
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,140
A large crowd has gathered
to celebrate Kim Sangman's success...

722
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,224
KIM SANGMAN IS THE ANSWER

723
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,244
...cheering for the unification
of the Korean peninsula

724
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,229
and the economic development
that was promised to come along with it.

725
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,276
THE HOUSE OF PAPER IS OURS

726
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,529
UNIFICATION IS NOT A MEANS OF MAKING MONEY

727
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,740
- Kim Sangman!
- Kim Sangman!

728
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,036
There are many protestors in the crowd
who stand with the Mint robbers

729
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,830
and they're determined
to ask the officials

730
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,665
for an immediate end
to the economic summit.

731
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,393
AGAINST OPPORTUNISTS
WHO STEAL UNIFICATION FUNDS

732
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,561
BETRAYER KIM SANGMAN
BETRAYER JEON YONGSU OUT!

733
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,712
Song Sunho?

734
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,922
That's the Professor?

735
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,427
I think he organized this plan
after faking his own suicide.

736
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,887
I knew it.

737
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,055
How amusing.

738
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,308
What do you think we should do
about the Mint, then?

739
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:02,270
The summit will finish
after I write the signature.

740
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,147
Once it's over, force your way in.

741
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,153
Understood, sir.

742
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,572
And,

743
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:19,412
the goal of this mission isn't arrest,
but to terminate them.

744
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:32,217
There he is! Congressman...

745
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:45,563
Yeah, the square looks as expected.

746
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,564
All right.

747
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,108
I'll be down.

748
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,569
I...

749
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:11,256
What? You thought
you could play me until the end?

750
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:16,219
This whole place is surrounded,
so don't do anything stupid.

751
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,140
You chased me here,
but you don't arrest me.

752
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,768
Is there something I can enlighten you on?

753
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,275
Don't you move.

754
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,527
What do you want to know?

755
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,530
The way you radicalized the public...

756
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,158
was that just a ruse?

757
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,120
To escape here amid the chaos
in the streets?

758
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,705
Is that all it was?

759
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,630
It's easy to be blind
when you follow what you see.

760
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:57,051
What's important is
your sense in direction.

761
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,053
That's how you know where to go.

762
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,514
You say any more of your bullshit

763
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,058
and I'll put a bullet
right through your head now.

764
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,145
You're actually right.

765
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,106
We plan on escaping

766
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,817
amid the chaos.

767
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,736
So, the unification stuff...

768
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,946
was all bullshit?

769
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,575
Everything we found in your hideout,

770
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,037
what Berlin was saying
to the cameras, all of those?

771
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,163
No.

772
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,417
That's the real reason I started this
to begin with.

773
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,544
What?

774
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,256
My father lived in the North
as a construction worker.

775
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,593
He was selected for a top secret mission.

776
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,429
To shut down rusty tunnels
after the Cold War.

777
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:45,933
He did shut down every tunnel
following his orders,

778
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,810
every single tunnel, except one.

779
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,523
Jungho's illness had gotten worse,

780
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,109
and he couldn't be treated in the North.

781
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:58,488
But before long, the party found out
what my father did, so...

782
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,115
You were split up
while defecting across Amnok River?

783
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,285
I know all this.

784
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,413
What I say next is important.

785
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,333
To get Jungho out of the camp,
we needed money.

786
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,211
So, my father was committing a robbery

787
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,672
and he was killed.

788
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,633
You think you're the only one
with a story like that?

789
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,093
That's the whole point!

790
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,846
Back then, I thought the tragedy
was due to the division of the countries.

791
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,974
But even now, tragedies are
being repeated over and over!

792
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,059
Why?

793
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:32,605
Because of those greedy bastards
who sold the future of this country!

794
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,107
Stop with that bullshit now!

795
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,109
The summit that's happening
over there right now

796
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,528
is not about unification
or economic cooperation!

797
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:42,281
Those thieves are trying
to take advantage of the popularity

798
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,950
for a fat load of cash!

799
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,953
You sure about that?

800
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,329
What's the evidence?

801
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,540
Capitalism revolves around profit.

802
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:53,384
So if unification guarantees that profit,
they'll speed up the process

803
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,420
so conglomerates can maximize profits,

804
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,672
giving them exactly what they want!

805
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,216
How am I so sure of that?

806
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,970
Because I came up with that plan for them.

807
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,265
What?

808
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,392
Chairman Oh Jaeyun of Osung

809
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,479
and the politician he supported.

810
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,274
Oh God...

811
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:20,027
Yeah, that politician
is your ex-husband, Kim Sangman.

812
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,615
I'm going to let the whole world know
who the real robbers are.

813
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,534
By taking what's rightfully ours!

814
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,619
But you'll be a robber just like them!

815
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,079
Once I got out,

816
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,249
I was planning on throwing my share
of the money in the middle of the city.

817
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,918
And once people check
the serial numbers on those bills,

818
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,421
they'll realize
what we said was the truth.

819
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,256
Unfortunately, that'll never happen.

820
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,012
If I get arrested,

821
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,056
Kim Sangman will make sure I'm dead.

822
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,643
Didn't you come here alone
because you knew that?

823
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,188
Even if I die,

824
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,107
let the world know
how the robbers were able to print

825
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,152
that much money at the Mint
all by themselves,

826
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,072
and what kind of money it is.

827
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,660
You have to.

828
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,539
That's the truth?

829
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,875
Because I don't want to lie

830
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,711
to you any more than I have.

831
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,839
My feelings for you have...

832
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,300
have always been real, though.

833
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,930
Cut that shit out.

834
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,600
You just wanted to use me
for your plan from the start!

835
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,519
At first, I did.

836
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,688
And I should have stuck to it.

837
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,652
I just could not do that.

838
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,122
Sorry.
