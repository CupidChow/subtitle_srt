JOINT ECONOMIC AREA

2
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,182
Everyone.

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,895
I'm sure sitting through
these meetings wasn't easy,

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,896
so thank you.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,565
- What?
- Huh?

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,609
You know, you sound like
a professor on the last day of classes.

7
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:28,944
And I am.

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,073
Our D-Day has been set.

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,616
- Huh?
- For real?

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,494
My God! Then we need to party, you guys!

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,764
Let's get drunk and call it a day.

12
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,419
- Yes! Let's do it!
- Let's get hammered!

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Cheers!

♪ Remove the veil... ♪

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,531
Hey, Moscow, what is that song
that you're always singing?

16
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,785
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just some stupid old song.

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,746
Oh yeah. I think My dad always sings
the exact same song.

18
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,955
Come on, sing it.

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,957
Oh, please, come on.

20
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,667
I'm way too embarrassed.

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,795
Come on.
We want to hear Moscow sing, don't we?

22
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,006
- Sing the song!
- Are you sure?

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,634
Sing the song! Sing the song!

24
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,677
Okay, I'm really going to sing.

25
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,262
Whoo!

26
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,556
- Okay, okay, come on.
- Whoo!

You seem sober.

40
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,347
It's okay to let loose on a day like this.

41
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,934
Right, but the two of us
drinking alone isn't a very good idea.

42
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,270
Just one more drink.

43
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,774
Come on, you know
that we've been stuck here for months.

44
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,402
And you're lonely too.

45
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,284
We can get drunk
once the operation's over.

46
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,083
When was the last time
you slept with a woman?

47
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,920
No talking about personal lives, remember?

48
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,590
Actually,
I'm not interested in talking either.

49
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,884
Actions speak louder than words.

50
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,138
Okay.

51
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:44,973
Have a good night.

52
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,231
Let's just have one more drink.

53
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,943
What?

54
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,488
Hey, Tokyo, I just...

55
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,782
That's just...

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,344
Oh man, I...

57
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,584
- Uh...
- Guess we're both rejects. Wanna drink?

58
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,213
Ugh. I'm not in the mood for that.

59
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,261
Hey!

60
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,596
Let's have some fun, okay?

61
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,306
Hey, Berlin!

62
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,976
Come out here right now! Drink with me.

63
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,229
Denver! Moscow!

64
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,315
One more drink! Come on!
Let's drink a little!

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,863
You just gotta stick with me
starting tomorrow,

66
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,991
once we're finally inside the Mint.
You got it?

67
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:43,992
Got it.

68
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,875
You better listen
to the Professor.

69
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,413
Looks like this is where
all the booze hounds are.

70
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,417
You think this is enough for you?

71
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,461
What is that?

72
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,931
Hey!

73
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,995
- Hey!
- Come on. You just can't...

74
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,022
This isn't liquor. This is, like,
just pure alcohol.

75
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,691
It makes the South Korean stuff
taste like water.

76
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,109
Shit.

77
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,615
So you're from
the same orphanage,

78
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,744
and you're practically brothers,
even though you both look different.

79
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,371
We did whatever we could to survive,

80
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,248
and it wasn't too easy.

81
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,960
- And then Myungtae said...
- Hey! Sh!

82
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,505
Helsinki said

83
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,384
that we should join a gang
and make some real money, so we did.

84
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,013
- But we made a mess before we left.
- Hold on. I'm sorry, but...

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,432
Your name is Myungtae?

86
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,438
So cute.

87
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,608
Shit! Way to keep a secret, you fat idiot!

88
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,569
Sorry, man.

89
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,280
So then, why did you leave the gang?

90
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,079
Well, that moron wanted to find
his mother who abandoned him

91
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,414
and went to the South.

92
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,751
Did you find your mom then?

93
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,629
I did, but they wouldn't...

94
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,006
Come on, stop that right now.

95
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,424
Stop crying, dumbass.

96
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,095
They just wouldn't let me go,
so that I couldn't see her.

97
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,471
Who did?

98
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,933
Helsinki or...?

99
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,937
They said if we tried to leave,

100
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,814
we wouldn't get out
with our heads attached.

101
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,607
So we cut their throats first.

102
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,444
We got out of the gang,

103
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,364
by then, we had no idea
where his mother went.

104
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,201
I don't know why you look for her.

105
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,205
Huh?

106
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,794
Why are you crying?

107
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,171
Because I miss my son.

108
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,135
Wait. You have a son? How old is he?

109
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,140
Probably as big as you now.

110
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,517
What?

111
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,815
You little...

112
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,905
You, I guess
you definitely are a con-artist, huh?

113
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,283
What are you doing,
trying to trick us? Huh?

114
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,576
So you just...

115
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,370
Shit, man.

116
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,498
There's no way you have a son
anything like this big boy!

117
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,334
And what about you, huh?

118
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,675
What's this?

119
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,759
All personnel.

120
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,637
Anticipate emergencies
in all your respective positions.

121
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,228
All this time
we haven't really negotiated with them

122
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,065
because they were just buying time
so that they could print money in there.

123
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,235
But soon they're going to realize
that the real negotiation

124
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,237
is beginning now.

125
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,286
Let's move!

126
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,329
Go.

127
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,052
MONEY HEIST: KOREA - JOINT ECONOMIC AREA

128
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,978
Hey! Why'd the power go out?

129
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,230
Hey!

130
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,276
Where are you guys? Is anyone upstairs?

131
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,871
Berlin.

132
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,623
Did you do this too?

133
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,252
If I had the skills to do something
like this, you'd be dead, asshole!

134
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,797
Everyone stay together. Keep quiet.

135
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,800
What happened just now?
The blackout wasn't part of the plan.

136
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,384
What plan?

137
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,971
What do you mean by that?

138
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,556
We're getting out of here.

139
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,682
Pull yourself together.

140
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,394
Think of your family
who are waiting for you at home.

141
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,271
We're going to move together as one,

142
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,940
so don't do anything stupid
and follow me, okay?

143
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,194
Uh, we should...

144
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,654
We don't have any time for this.

145
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,992
Helsinki! Head over to the hostages first.

146
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,214
What happened?

147
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,300
Man, why did...

148
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,596
Did it work?

149
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,642
Task Force must've cut off the power.
It'll be much easier to escape now.

150
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,120
- But what about the other guys?
- They're waiting at the entrance.

151
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
I'll take care
of the one guarding the door

152
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,648
and you should all get moving.

153
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,417
What is everybody doing right now, huh?

154
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,765
- Get out! Hurry!
- Let's go! Follow me!

155
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,809
Let's move!

156
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,144
Come on! Come on!

157
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,029
I'll go turn on
the emergency power system.

158
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,032
Rio, guard the Director's office.
Go to the exhibition hall.

159
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,658
Hurry, you two!

160
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,129
How did you get in here?

161
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,464
What did you do to Oslo?

162
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,553
Shut up and stop fighting
if you don't want to die too.

163
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,514
Come on, this way. Over here.

164
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,640
Quick, come on!

165
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,269
Don't fall behind. Keep running.

166
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,812
Hurry!

167
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,480
It's us! It's us!

168
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,065
Keep going this way.

169
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,984
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

170
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,527
Keep running. Go, go, go!

171
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,654
What's going on? Seriously.

172
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,739
Careful, careful.

173
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,282
Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

174
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,866
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

175
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,119
- Hey, who's that?
- Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

176
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,662
Shit, you scared me.

177
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,748
What happened in the basement?

178
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,875
Can't see anything.
It's way too dark. Shit!

179
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,152
- Get down.
- It's okay.

180
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,927
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

181
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,013
- Come this way!
- Go! Go!

182
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,890
- Hurry up! Keep going.
- Shit.

183
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,058
Faster! Hurry!

184
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,894
Hey! Let's go! Now!

185
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,521
Come on, let's hurry.

186
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,024
Come on!

187
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,881
- Helsinki!
- Helsinki!

188
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,092
Helsinki!

189
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,136
- Be careful. Watch out!
- I can't see anything!

190
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,356
This way, come on.

191
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,445
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

192
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,964
- Let's hurry.
- Come on.

193
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,073
Shit.

194
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,033
- What? Power's back on?
- Who's that?

195
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,119
No, that piece of shit!

196
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,872
Helsinki! Helsinki!
What the hell happened to him?

197
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,333
- Hey, get up.
- Helsinki!

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,377
Fucking sons of bitches.

199
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,003
It's okay.

200
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,137
Professor?

201
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,807
We're totally fucked.
What are we supposed to do?

202
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,975
Just calm down.

203
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,981
I think I know where they're headed now.

204
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,655
Helsinki. What happened to you?

205
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,366
Yeah, try to get up. Yeah, here.

206
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,620
Are you going to be all right, huh?

207
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,711
Sangyeon!

208
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,423
Helsinki, where are you going?

209
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,276
- Hey!
- It's the loading dock.

210
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,594
I think the hostages are escaping
through the back door!

211
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,846
The loading dock?

212
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,969
- This way, Dad, let's go.
- Okay!

213
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,975
Shit!

214
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,069
Come on. This way.
Over here. Quick, come on.

215
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,530
Don't fall behind.

216
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,741
Hurry. Hurry.

217
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,953
Come on. Come on, this way.

218
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,706
- Over here.
- Keep running. Go, go, go.

219
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,874
Let's go.

220
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,209
Keep moving forward.
Come on, let's go!

221
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,757
Come on. Let's go.

222
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,722
Did you see something?

223
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,099
- Can we get out this way?
- What?

224
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,435
What? What are you waiting for, huh?

225
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,561
Take a look at this.

226
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,481
What is that? Is that a bomb?

227
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,983
Oh shit. What do we do?

228
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,210
- What?
- What's that?

229
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,072
Move aside!

230
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,548
Are you insane?
Do you want to fucking die? Shit!

231
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,884
If this blows up, all of us are dead!

232
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,271
You better drop the gun
before I blow your head off, asshole.

233
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,856
Drop it right now!

234
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,859
Hands on your head, everyone! Hands up!

235
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,070
Sit down!

236
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,280
If you put down
anything that's in your hands

237
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,991
and go back to your assigned places,

238
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,159
nobody's going to get hurt today.

239
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,869
So drop your guns.

240
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,458
Sit down!

241
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,592
I think the situation's under control.

242
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,095
- I'll call you back once it calms down.
- Okay.

243
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,400
What?

244
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,236
You better drop it.

245
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,412
You call the headquarters. Do it now!

246
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,920
You motherfucker.

247
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,929
This is Park Chulwoo, SOU Unit 1.

248
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,141
The hostages are escaping right now.
Please provide assistance.

249
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,436
Send in the police
to distract the robbers.

250
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,605
I'll take the hostages to the rooftop.

251
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,734
Where are the hostages right now?

252
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,511
Is this the place
where you contact the Professor?

253
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,850
Where's Park Chulwoo,
that asshole from the SOU?

254
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,145
Shit.

255
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,104
Park Chulwoo!

256
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,488
Uh... What's that noise?

257
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,782
Shit.

258
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,578
Get down!

259
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,916
Get down! Get down!

260
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,669
Get down! Get down now!

261
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,946
Everyone, get down!

262
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,490
Get down if you don't want to get shot!

263
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,128
I can't hold out any longer!

264
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,048
You have to! They can't get closer
because of the hostages!

265
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,053
Hey, Moscow!

266
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,181
Take it!

267
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,329
Oh God. What now?

268
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,457
I'm out of bullets!

269
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,936
Die, you fucking bastards!

270
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,649
Push! Push!

271
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,527
Push! Hey, Berlin!
Come over here and help!

272
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,654
Push!

273
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,367
What are you doing, Dad?
Get over here and help.

274
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,583
Huh?

275
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,371
We can't go in any further.

276
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,850
It's our one chance to save them.

277
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,351
Please buy us some more time.

278
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,820
- Hurry up.
- Go! Go!

279
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,714
Look at them!
Look at those bastards running away.

280
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,049
- Tokyo!
- Nairobi, you okay?

281
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,220
Hey! The hostages!

282
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,198
- Huh?
- The rooftop!

283
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,542
That must have been
their real escape route from the start!

284
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,518
- Shit.
- Denver! Go!

285
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,898
This way.

286
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,067
Faster! Come on, let's go! Hurry!

287
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,694
Let's go! Faster!

288
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,862
- This way!
- Hurry!

289
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:44,945
Come on!

290
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,406
Come on!

291
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,203
Motherfuckers!

292
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,123
Get down! Don't move!

293
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,002
- Freeze!
- Keep going. Come on!

294
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,670
Hurry up! Don't stop!

295
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,838
Let's go! Let's go!

296
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,632
- This way!
- Come on!

297
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,676
Shit!

298
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,097
Hey! Hey! What're you doing? Come on!

299
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,183
Hey, you! You fucking bastard! Stop!

300
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,434
Shit!

301
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,371
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Get back down here.

302
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,521
Quick!

303
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,523
Let's go!

304
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,027
We're here! Send someone!

305
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,029
Help us!

306
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,330
Hurry up, this way!

307
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,457
This way, come on.

308
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,543
This way! Come on! Come on!

309
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,961
- Come faster!
- Hurry up!

310
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,796
Please! We're here!

311
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,755
Help us!

312
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,552
Denver!

313
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,220
You okay up there?

314
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,346
I'll be downstairs.

315
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,807
- Nairobi!
- Down, let's go!

316
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,934
Take them downstairs.

317
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,644
- Get down!
- Shit.

318
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,187
Shit.

319
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,193
Just get out.

320
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,738
I told you, just get out! Shit!

321
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,241
Just go!

322
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,926
Come on! Please! Up here!

323
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,679
What? Did they get out?

324
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,481
Let's send the kids and women first.

325
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,567
Help us! Help us! We need help!

326
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,902
Move! Move!

327
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,863
Help us!

328
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,746
What are you doing? Stop that!

329
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,451
Hey! What are you waiting for?
You'll get us all killed.

330
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,538
Help us! Help us!

331
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,414
Help!

332
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,417
We're stuck up here!

333
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,880
Hey! Stop!

334
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,467
Stop!

335
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,550
Pull me up.

336
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,976
Hey! Hey! What's going on?

337
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,602
Help!

338
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,272
Pull me up, you bastard! Pull me up!

339
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,612
What do we do?

340
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,489
We have no choice. Let's jump.

341
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,074
Hurry up. Let's go.

342
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,408
Let's go! Hurry!

343
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,953
Hurry! Let's go, come on!

344
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,460
Hey, pull me up!

345
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,004
No!

346
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,089
Hurry up!

347
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,178
Pull me up!

348
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,572
- You should go first.
- Come on!

349
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,265
No way. I'll go after you.

350
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,516
Go. Hurry.

351
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,102
You said you wanted to go home.
Just jump, okay?

352
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,187
I... I can't. I'm afraid of heights.

353
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,487
- Where?
- Look up.

354
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,081
Please! Over here! Please!

355
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,333
Right over here. Right over here.

356
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,087
Step aside.

357
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,274
Stop, you motherfuckers!

358
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,284
Hey, Berlin!

359
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,161
You goddamn asshole!

360
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,830
- Hey!
- Pull us up!

361
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,916
Help me! Come on!

362
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,585
Hey!

363
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,720
- Let me down! Piece of shit!
- Just stay still!

364
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,547
Are you all right?

365
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,311
We want to hear your story.
Can we ask what happened?

366
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,105
Twenty-nine hostages escaped.

367
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,983
This is almost half the total number
of hostages.

368
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,611
There were gunshots heard
during the escape,

369
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,906
but no police officers or hostages
were reported to have sustained injuries

370
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,115
from the gunfire.

371
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,370
The police announced that
all the hostages who escaped are now safe

372
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,374
and they will be shortly interviewed
to cooperate with the police investigation

373
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,376
following a brief medical examination.

374
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,671
Do you have anything to tell us
about how many suspects are in there?

375
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,216
How does it feel
to finally be free after six entire days?

376
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,110
- What happened inside the Mint?
- One comment, please.

377
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,053
- Push closer in.
- Are the hostages all safe?

378
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,156
I'm just worried about the people
who are still trapped.

379
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,991
Did you see
any of the suspects' faces?

380
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,335
Please tell us. What was it like?

381
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,851
Please just say something.

382
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,938
It's regrettable that
not all hostages could escape tonight.

383
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,733
But we will not give up.
We will negotiate...

384
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,977
"WE WILL RESCUE ALL HOSTAGES"

385
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,195
...and we promise that we'll make sure

386
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,907
to do everything in our power
to bring every single hostage home.

387
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,869
I cannot disclose the details,
but we have a great amount of intel

388
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,330
about all the suspects
that are inside the Mint,

389
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,874
and we'll be using it
to target their weaknesses.

390
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,876
To bring all of this to a peaceful...

391
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,134
No, no, let me make this clear.

392
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,177
The suspects need to realize this soon.

393
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,638
You have no choice

394
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,766
but to surrender.

395
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,456
I think it's good enough.

396
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,876
Hey, Dad! Hey, Dad!

397
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,128
What is it? What's wrong this time?

398
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,506
Well, uh...

399
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,688
What happened to him? Huh?

400
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,107
Hey! Hey! Oslo.

401
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,320
- Why are you stopping? Huh?
- Oslo!

402
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,113
You have to save him!

403
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,907
You just have to save him!

404
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,993
I'm so sorry. He lost too much blood.

405
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,704
Give him my blood.

406
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,832
Just use all of it!
I don't even care, okay?

407
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,001
Please save him, Rio!

408
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,879
I need you to save him!

409
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,714
Please, save him!

410
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,925
Fuck this!

411
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,045
Let's take him with us
when we leave.

412
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,340
And find a sunny place to bury him.

413
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,895
You idiot.

414
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,356
You haven't found your mother yet.

415
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,900
You can't leave like this.

416
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,403
You said you'd make a lot of money...

417
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,324
...so that you could
buy your mother a house.

418
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,638
Why is everyone here depressed?

419
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,017
What? You really don't know?

420
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,644
After what happened just now,

421
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,104
those assholes will take it out
on the rest of us.

422
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,106
We're completely screwed here.

423
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,150
Come on, it's not all bad.

424
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,862
I mean, look, almost half us
got out of this place tonight.

425
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,693
I guess
you're seeing the glass half full.

426
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,620
But you should just
shut your mouth and lay low,

427
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,327
and maybe all of us should do that.

428
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,455
What difference would it make
if I just shut up and rolled over?

429
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,959
If they decide they want to kill us,
they're going to do it

430
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,752
even if we beg them not to.

431
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,713
The Vice Director, and the policeman,
and my classmates.

432
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,401
Dozens of people who actually know
what it's actually like in here escaped,

433
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,969
and can tell the cops about it.

434
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,388
We completely ruined the plans
that these criminals made.

435
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,473
And I'm sure that now they're well aware

436
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,059
that all of us
are capable of cornering them too.

437
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,229
So I really don't think we failed.

438
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,813
I think we won.

439
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,340
I'll make it short.

440
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,677
If anything even remotely like this
ever happens again,

441
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,762
we cannot guarantee your safety.

442
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,433
You got that?

443
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,610
Because there are less of you,

444
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,196
the teams are going to
have to be rearranged.

445
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,742
What's left of the minting team,
go over this way.

446
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,160
Kitchen team, this way.

447
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,954
And the rest of you all need to follow me.

448
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,343
Why are you standing there?

449
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,471
You need to move it. Come on!

450
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,015
Move your asses right now! Go on!

451
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,144
Don't you dare try
to test my patience!

452
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,396
Oslo died, thanks to all of you!

453
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,316
Oslo is dead, and it's because of you!

454
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,904
Move. Right now!

455
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,135
Cut it out.

456
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,011
Stop that.

457
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,596
Stop that!

458
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,646
That's enough.

459
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,752
I could see in their eyes

460
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,255
that they were making
a very clear statement,

461
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,882
that they weren't going
to obey us anymore.

462
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,635
If they don't cooperate with us,

463
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,530
we're not gonna be able
to print money anymore.

464
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,764
The emergency electricity won't last.

465
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,932
Two, three days, tops.

466
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,977
The runaways must have
told the police everything already.

467
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,938
What did the Professor say
to do in a situation like this?

468
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,023
He never mentioned something like this.

469
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,692
Then what are we supposed to do?

470
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,570
Everything's a mess,
and we can't even contact the Professor.

471
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,322
Jesus fucking Christ.

472
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,033
- Tokyo. What should we do now?
- Goddamn it.

473
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,703
- Tokyo.
- I don't know, okay?

474
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,912
Stop bugging me.

475
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,623
But we can't just sit here.

476
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,458
Let's get to work.

477
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,961
Denver, help Moscow dig the tunnel.

478
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,630
The rest of you,
go run the printing machines with Nairobi.

479
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,757
- And I'll watch the hostages.
- Okay.

480
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,217
No, before we do that,

481
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,137
we should find the traitor.

482
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,764
What the hell is wrong
with this asshole?

483
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,184
Just stop hiding and come out, coward.

484
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,396
- Shit.
- If it isn't you, then who is it?

485
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,190
Dude, stop. Come on, stop it!

486
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,983
- Is it you?
- Jesus.

487
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,068
You and that fucking bitch?

488
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,445
What does that mean? Huh?

489
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,530
You crazy asshole!

490
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,700
You have completely lost it!
You little fucker!

491
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,943
- Do you want a piece of this?
- Stop it! Stop!

492
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,121
- Huh? You son of a bitch!
- Hey, stop it!

493
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,040
- That's enough!
- Shit.

494
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,336
Everything we do will be in vain
if there's a traitor among us!

495
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,420
You know that!

496
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,548
And if it wasn't for that rat,
Oslo would still be with us!

497
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,468
They distracted us to the point
where we didn't even notice

498
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,054
that the hostages are planning
and making their escape!

499
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:03,971
You know that!

500
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,767
I'll track them down on my own
and just kill them myself.

501
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,060
Is it you?

502
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,020
- Or is it you?
- Jesus.

503
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,289
- Hey, shit!
- Or you?

504
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,606
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You?

505
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,150
You? Is it you?

506
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,071
What the hell is wrong with him?

507
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,239
Hey, what's wrong?

508
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,531
- Berlin!
- What is it?

509
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,384
- Oh God.
- What's going on?

510
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,952
Oh God, what's happening?

511
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,035
- Hey!
- Berlin!

512
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,847
- What's wrong with him?
- Berlin!

513
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,999
Oh God! Oh God!

514
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,380
If any one of you there
sympathizes with any of the families here,

515
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,297
take action.

516
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,968
And to anyone among the criminals
who cooperate to resolve this.

517
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,096
As the leader of this party,
I will speak with the President

518
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,391
to guarantee full immunity
for those who'll help end this crisis.

519
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,811
So the kid
doesn't know anything, right?

520
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,562
He can't know about this.

521
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,607
Of course not,
I will give you my word.

522
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,194
But first, there's something
you need to do for us.

523
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,196
Then where's the kid?

524
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,032
Don't worry about him.
He's under our protection.

525
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,660
If anything at all happens
to that boy, I swear...

526
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,132
I'm going to kill you.

527
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,302
You understand?

528
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,097
I'm sorry,
but you're in no position to bargain.

529
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,225
If you don't get the job done,
or if you tell anyone about it,

530
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,936
the son you gave up
for your trashy, sordid life,

531
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,772
is someone you'll never see again.

532
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,763
What are you thinking?

533
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,641
Nairobi was worried about her son,
and she was overwhelmed with guilt

534
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,977
so she had to keep
her thoughts to herself.

535
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,981
The situation inside the Mint
was headed for the worst case scenario,

536
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,567
but we had no plan going forward,

537
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,362
and no way to inform the Professor
of anything.

538
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,449
The old me would've just trusted
the Professor to take care of things,

539
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,951
but I couldn't anymore.

540
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,204
All our communication has been cut off.

541
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,457
And what could he possibly do
from the outside?

542
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,343
We're in trouble.

543
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,598
The hostages, they've revolted.

544
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,017
More than half got out.

545
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,603
The communication
with the Mint has been cut off.

546
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,939
Should we execute the operation sooner?

547
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,316
No, we should still aim

548
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,503
for the day of the summit,
like we originally planned.

549
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,196
To do that, we need to know
what's going on inside.

550
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,614
What about the cop then?

551
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,286
Take care of her instead of me.

552
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,995
As for the rest...

553
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,218
At the same time, the Task Force
was accumulating all the information

554
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,014
they could possibly get about us
from the hostages that escaped.

555
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,393
And the Inspector finally got her hands
on a piece of information about us...

556
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,352
HELSINKI
DENVER

557
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,705
...that even we weren't aware of.

558
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,647
PROFESSOR

559
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,191
Uh...

560
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,111
I almost forgot in all that chaos.

561
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,113
I took this in case it's important.

562
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,906
What is this?

563
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,925
It was hidden in the Director's office.

564
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,661
I believe it belongs
to one of the suspects in there.

565
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,548
What's the matter with him?

566
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,592
Is he sick or something?

567
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,096
Why are you sweating so much?

568
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,224
Because I'm terminally ill.

569
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:02,478
There's a bottle of medicine hidden
in a bookshelf in the Director's office.

570
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,480
Could you try to get it for me?

571
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,234
He said he was terminally ill
and needed drugs.

572
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,317
What?

573
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,030
I just thought
that he was lying about that.

574
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,953
Shit. It must be here somewhere.

575
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,915
Where is it?

576
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,834
Is this it?

577
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:26,918
What?

578
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,051
Wait, what? What is that for?

579
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,846
Oh shit.

580
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,210
"Huntington's disease"?

581
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,976
It's a rare, hereditary
neurodegenerative disease.

582
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,271
If it's hereditary, is it incurable?

583
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,689
There is no cure.

584
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,608
The medication can
only relieve its symptoms.

585
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:54,029
Basically, what's happening is,
his brain cells are dying.

586
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,367
And symptoms usually begin after 30.

587
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,662
So he probably already had them
when he was in the prison camp.

588
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,902
I'm sure they didn't give him
any proper medicine.

589
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,960
It must've made a place like that
a lot more miserable.

590
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,547
Well, fuck, man. Wow.
I just thought that he'd gone crazy.

591
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,299
But I guess he's crazy sick.

592
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,304
So is it possible that he could
just, like, die out of nowhere?

593
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,265
Well, the symptoms progress pretty slowly,

594
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,310
but there's no medicine here.

595
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,062
What do we do?

596
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,399
Let's isolate him for now,
until he's back to stable condition.

597
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:03,307
So are you ready to tell me about
the people who tried to escape with you?

598
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,232
I guess we'll try a different game.

599
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,850
So I hear that you're terminally ill.

600
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,147
You're basically a corpse
without this, aren't you?

601
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,202
We won't even need to get
his filthy sweat and blood on our hands.

602
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,913
We don't need to torture him ourselves.

603
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,958
Because you know I'll make you

604
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,001
beg me to kill you.

605
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,984
So, wait, this means
that one of them is dying.

606
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,527
Yes.

607
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,864
Well then, what would be the use
of having this money?

608
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,993
Well, what if they had another goal?

609
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,454
Other than money?
What could it be?

610
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,913
The summit.

611
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,457
We didn't even know that the plan

612
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,700
was for four trillion won
to be printed for the summit.

613
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,004
So you think their real agenda

614
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,923
is to ruin
inter-Korean economic cooperation?

615
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,341
I think it's possible.

616
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,094
Ma'am, take a look at this.

617
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,262
JEON YONGSU

618
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,056
The director of the camp
where Berlin was locked up was...

619
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,349
Uh, Jeon Yongsu?

620
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,811
- You mean, the "Jeon Yongsu"?
- Yes.

621
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,980
He's here for the summit
as the North representative.

622
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,899
What?

623
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,734
So maybe it is connected.

624
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:26,700
You said Huntington's disease
is very rare, right?

625
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,578
Yes. Only a few cases in Korea.

626
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,831
Investigate distribution channels
for this medicine.

627
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,041
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,061
- Sure. But why?
- There could be more suspects,

629
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,171
who are outside of the Mint
like the Professor.

630
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,757
If they do have some kind
of a political agenda,

631
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,425
it's not gonna be so simple.

632
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,594
We cannot permanently stop them

633
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,554
just by cutting off power
and locking them up.

634
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,681
We need to track their movements

635
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,726
and find out their real agenda
and what they're planning.

636
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,830
Today, for the third
inter-Korean cooperation summit,

637
00:46:55,896 --> 00:47:00,275
the North's representative, Jeon Yongsu
arrived at Incheon International.

638
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,486
Thank you
for your very warm welcome.

639
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,072
I am confident
that this time we will accomplish

640
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,950
the peaceful reunification
with economic prosperity

641
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,577
finally assured for the two Koreas.

642
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,465
Let's have a drink with the chairman
after the luncheon later.

643
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,885
More importantly,
are things at the Mint under control?

644
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,473
It's not like they can quietly slip out
and carry all that money somewhere.

645
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,893
When the deal is sealed at the summit,
the money will be ours anyway.

646
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,438
We should actually thank them
for saving us time printing the money.

647
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,912
I'll go in, okay?

648
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,432
You okay?

649
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,309
Yeah, I'm fine.

650
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:20,355
- Rio just told me you have a rare disease.
- Hmm.

651
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,692
Now I don't have to hide
my trembling hands, I guess.

652
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,370
Why didn't you tell us?

653
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,373
You're not hiding anything?

654
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,877
Why did you join this thing?

655
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,879
You need money to cure it?

656
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,548
I'd have already stolen the cure
if there was one.

657
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,218
If you are not here for the money,
then what?

658
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,307
I have a feeling you're not here
for the money either, are you?

659
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,104
Look at this.
When my hand first started to shake,

660
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,025
I used to think
it was probably just malnutrition.

661
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,779
Because there were a lot of guys
with shaky hands like me in the camp.

662
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,699
A long time after the symptoms developed,
I found out that this disease...

663
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,788
was the reason that my parents tried
to flee North Korea in the first place.

664
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,626
My parents decided that they needed
to find a way to leave the North

665
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,712
to try to cure their sick little boy.

666
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,256
Well, the result was terrible.

667
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:33,637
I got locked up in a prison camp
with no medication and barely any food.

668
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,807
And it just made the symptoms worse.
What a sick joke.

669
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,061
You wanna know why I joined this gig?

670
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,146
Why are you suddenly curious?

671
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,024
Are you afraid that I'm going to go crazy?

672
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,861
No, it's not that. I just...

673
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,074
It doesn't even matter
why I came to the Mint.

674
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,077
The important thing is
that I bet my life on this heist.

675
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,203
And what about you?

676
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,165
Yeah, I did too.

677
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,960
But I have no idea what we should do now.

678
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,422
It seemed like out of all of us,
you trusted the Professor

679
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,799
more than anyone else here.

680
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,344
The communication is cut off
and the Professor's outside.

681
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,806
So what could he possibly do
in a situation like this?

682
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,892
It'd be better for us
to find another way without him.

683
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,228
Now you want to change the plans?

684
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,231
But you obeyed him like a dog
this whole time.

685
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,483
And now you can't trust him, huh?

686
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,611
You know what?

687
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,617
The more loyal the dog,
the crazier it behaves

688
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,328
when it senses its owner
is in a state of crisis.

689
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,623
Why? Because it's like
the sky has fallen for the dog.

690
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,137
Hey, what the fuck are you doing, Berlin?

691
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,513
This bitch here is the traitor.

692
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,058
- I'm not.
- What the hell are you talking about, huh?

693
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,935
The only one I didn't even think
to doubt from the very start.

694
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,064
Hey, just calm down. You're not
in your right mind right now, okay?

695
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,708
You lied to us,
and earned everyone's trust

696
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,412
so you could sneak around as a spy, right?

697
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,401
Shit.

698
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,695
Come on, put that down right now.

699
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:16,156
Or I'll have no choice but to shoot you!

700
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,741
Shit.

701
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,913
Hey, Helsinki, stop Berlin. Do something.

702
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,539
Helsinki.

703
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,208
- Tokyo killed Oslo.
- What?

704
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,335
Don't listen to a thing
that crazy asshole says.

705
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,837
I swear, it wasn't me, Helsinki.
It wasn't!

706
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,799
I trust the Professor, even now.

707
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,051
And I made a promise to him

708
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:39,262
that if anything crazy
and unexpected happened,

709
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,265
that the person
whose orders I'd follow is Berlin.

710
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,226
Put the gun down.

711
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,187
- Drop it right now! Put it away!
- Hey, come on, not you too!

712
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,325
Mom, where's the hair dryer?

713
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,619
Come here. I'll dry your hair for you.

714
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,041
Oh, about that man, Woojin.

715
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,002
The man who owns that café.

716
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,130
Uh, what?

717
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,924
Well, it's just that
I know there was something

718
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,801
that I really wanted to tell you.

719
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,095
But I didn't write it down.

720
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:24,558
And I'm sure that it had something to do
with that man who owns the café,

721
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,767
but I'm forgetting now.

722
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,020
You don't have to remember, Mom.

723
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,398
He and I broke up.

724
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,870
PARK SUNHO

725
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,993
STOP BY WHEN YOU HAVE TIME.
I'LL BUY YOU A SANDWICH.

726
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:52,919
SERGEANT NAM DONGCHUL

727
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,046
What?

728
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,930
Inspector, I got
the medicine purchase record.

729
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,385
Usually, it's prescribed
and purchased from one place.

730
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,387
But someone recently made a bulk purchase.

731
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,681
And the prescription was forged as well.

732
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,600
Where was it?

733
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,953
A pharmacy near
university hospital in Gangwon.

734
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,539
I surveilled and followed the car,
but it disappeared near a mountain.

735
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,857
There's nothing really there
other than a rundown resort

736
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,234
that's out of business.

737
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,402
A resort?

738
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,660
That can potentially be
where their hideout is.

739
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,575
- Think the Professor is there?
- He could be.

740
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,641
I'm gonna head over there right now.

741
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,537
- Please send backup.
- Yes, ma'am.

742
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,300
Get me the Professor.

743
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,429
The Inspector got a phone call
and left in a hurry.

744
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,266
Not towards HQ.

745
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,479
I put a tracker on her car.
You should check it.

746
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,372
Okay, so now,

747
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,626
we'll all get the pleasure of getting to
play a really fun game, all right?

748
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,675
Hey, gather everyone together right now.

749
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,962
Guys, come on, go that way.

750
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,605
You, follow me. Rest of you, follow me.

751
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,716
Go that way once we leave. Let's go.

752
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,551
Run!

753
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,283
Go check over there too.

754
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,535
Detective Lee, go in.

755
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,536
Yes, sir.

756
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,704
Over there. Go.

757
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,331
Come on. Come on.

758
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,385
They aren't here.

759
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,304
Not here!

760
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,973
Nothing here either.

761
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,352
- Call forensics.
- Yes.

762
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,355
I found something!

763
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,868
It's this way.

764
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,085
LET'S LIBERATE THE KOREAN PENINSULA

765
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,045
Come on, take a look at this too.

766
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,782
We don't have time for this.
What is this about? Huh?

767
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,866
What's going on?

768
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,953
By the way, what happened with Berlin?
Is he okay?

769
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,079
You'll see.

770
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,756
What? What the...

771
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,259
What? What the hell are you doing?

772
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,094
I'm avenging Oslo.

773
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,471
One of these fuckers is the traitor.

774
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,389
What?

775
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,349
Just look into my eyes.

776
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,351
See if I'm crazy or not.

777
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,478
If you don't confession out of you,

778
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,772
I'm gonna banish you both from here.

779
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,818
Huh?

780
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,780
Shit!

781
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,744
Hey!

782
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,955
Okay, yeah, you're right, I'm the traitor.

783
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,583
- I'm the fucking traitor, okay?
- What do you mean?

784
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,293
Is that right?

785
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,655
Look! The door just opened.

786
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,346
What is this?

787
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,681
Why did that gate open?

788
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,933
- It's open!
- Get that!

789
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,347
Oh my gosh.
We need to get closer. Come on!

790
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,359
I killed him!

791
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,843
- He's just a little coward!
- Stop! Don't hurt him!

792
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,491
Berlin, you know he's not capable
of any of that!

793
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,242
He doesn't have the balls to betray us.

794
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,994
- So come on!
- Yeah, yeah, he's right.

795
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:22,081
You have to know that he's only
saying that to try and save Tokyo.

796
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,165
Come on!

797
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,666
I do know that.

798
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,294
Right, he's not a traitor.

799
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,212
I killed him!

800
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,380
Shut your stupid mouth, you fucking idiot!

801
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,509
That means the traitor has be...

802
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,178
Tokyo then.

803
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,554
- What?
- What?

804
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,102
Yeah.

805
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,189
Oh, oh, oh!

806
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,235
Tokyo!

807
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:51,087
We'll only know the real circumstances
of what just occurred

808
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,880
after the police questions the suspect.

809
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,173
Someone else is coming out!

810
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,301
- Hurry!
- Someone's coming out.

811
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,429
Is that Anne?

812
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,223
Go on.

813
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,313
Read it.

814
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,731
Read it now!

815
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,763
"Bring us the former warden..."

816
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,170
Read it loudly!

817
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,867
"Bring us the former warden of
Gaecheon Detention Camp 14,

818
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,453
a man who performed inhumane abuse
and torture."

819
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,414
"Bring Jeon Yongsu here."

820
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,626
Since we've come to this,

821
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,086
I demand to see that bastard before I die.

822
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,464
If the warden doesn't show up here, I...

823
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,508
I swear, I'll rip this bitch into pieces!

824
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,553
It looked like
the heist had turned

825
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,972
into a personal revenge mission
for Berlin,

826
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,058
who seemed crazier by the second.

827
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,103
The situation really was headed
for the worst case scenario,

828
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,274
if Berlin was truly as insane
as he appeared to be.

- Dad really loved that song.
- He did.

841
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,851
I sang along with him
not even knowing what it meant.

842
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,770
It turned out that it was
a South Korean song.

843
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,233
Tomorrow's the day.

844
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,401
Let's have a toast.

845
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,448
A toast to the unfulfilled wish
of our father.

846
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,033
And to the reunited brothers.

847
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,129
I'll follow your orders, but please,

848
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,340
if worst comes to worst, save yourself.
Run away.

849
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,302
That will never happen.

850
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:49,682
My plan, it's already prepared
for the worst of the worst.
