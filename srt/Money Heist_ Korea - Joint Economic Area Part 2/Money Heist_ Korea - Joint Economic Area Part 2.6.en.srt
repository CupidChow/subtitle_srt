1
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,800
CENTRAL MILITARY COMMITTEE
ORDER NO.385

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,049
You're home.

3
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:55,430
Listen, I have somewhere I need to go.

4
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,099
I'll be staying the night
and be back tomorrow.

5
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,185
You'll be fine on your own, right, Son?

6
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,268
Again?

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,521
Where are you going this time?

8
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,608
Don't worry about it.
I'm going to make money.

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,987
But you make money every day.
You need more?

10
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,791
Don't you miss your brother? Huh?

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,002
We need to get as much money as we can
to bring him home.

12
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,253
We need a lot of it.

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,174
Okay.

14
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,717
Then go ahead.

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,601
But, Dad, wait.

16
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,479
Where does all the money get made?

17
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,695
Uh, there's a big factory
where the government prints out money.

18
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,908
All the money we use,
all of it is made in that building.

19
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:01,121
Well, then, I don't understand why they
can't print lots and lots of money there.

20
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,706
There would be no poor people

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,543
and we would be able
to eat anything we wanted.

22
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,962
They're all so stupid.

23
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,134
You're right about that.

24
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,594
I'll be back.

25
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,678
One of the men involved
in the bank robbery

26
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,302
was a man in his 40s who was shot
by police and died at the scene.

27
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,415
This man, Song,
was a North Korean defector,

28
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,658
with a high-ranking government position
in North Korea.

29
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,419
It's presumed that he committed this crime

30
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,505
because he was never able to adjust
to South Korean society

31
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,674
after first defecting here two years ago.

32
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,490
MONEY HEIST: KOREA - JOINT ECONOMIC AREA

33
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,557
We're almost done.

34
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,934
Is something wrong?

35
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
No.

36
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,730
Let's just dig.

37
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,317
- Hey, I can do it.
- Okay.

38
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,589
Professor! Shit!

39
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,009
Are you there? Huh?

40
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,594
- Are you there?
- Denver. Over here!

41
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,489
- Yeah, I can hear you!
- You hear me?

42
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,390
- Oh shit! Come on!
- Denver!

43
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,599
We're here!

44
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,362
Keep going,
we're nearly there.

45
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,353
Come on. A little more.

46
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,957
- Hey, Professor?
- Hey, Denver! Hey!

47
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,508
- Hey, Denver! Denver!
- Professor! Professor!

48
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,218
- Denver! Denver!
- Professor!

49
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,139
- Professor! It's been so long. So long.
- You did it.

50
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,685
You did so well!

51
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,447
Uh, this... this... this is, um...

52
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,530
I'm...

53
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,740
Uh, she...

54
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,539
Stockholm's my name.

55
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,491
You did great.

56
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,038
Your son is okay. Hmm?

57
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,538
Thanks a lot.

58
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,586
Rio.

59
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,672
You've been good?

60
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeah, I've been good.

61
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,931
Okay, so, it's this way.

62
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,319
We were all
so full of hope in there,

63
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,363
but on the outside,

64
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,825
the Professor's worst fear
was coming true at that very moment.

65
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,967
2026 KOREAN PENINSULA
INTER-KOREAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION SUMMIT

66
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,558
The details of the agreement are the same
as what you looked at before.

67
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,272
Now all that's left to be done
is getting rid of those thieves

68
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,815
and getting hold of the money.

69
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,859
Special Operations Unit's on standby.

70
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,154
Since we're already on this subject,
now that the summit is over,

71
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,957
there's nothing left that could
cause issues in the future, is there?

72
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,990
Of course not.

73
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,494
We'll kill them on the spot,
every last one of them.

74
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,010
Uh, yes.

75
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,722
I understand.

76
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,692
You okay?

77
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,902
Yeah, I'm fine.

78
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,322
When we get out of here,
I won't see you again, will I?

79
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,490
What do...

80
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,245
Don't do anything
like this again, you know?

81
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,872
Just live a peaceful life
with your family.

82
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,502
Make sure you go see him.

83
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,131
Go see your son.

84
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,051
Misun,

85
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,805
let's forget about everything that
happened here and just start fresh. Huh?

86
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,560
No way.
I'm not going to leave with you.

87
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,980
Hey, come on,
you're really planning on joining him?

88
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,607
The three billion
will give you a much better life.

89
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,568
Why do you have to do this?

90
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,446
You made a choice when you decided
to stay behind at the Mint.

91
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,782
And so, I made my choice as well.

92
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,421
Time to go.

93
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,508
Enter the Mint
and wipe out every thief in there!

94
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,218
- Move now!
- Yes, sir!

95
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,308
Here.

96
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,188
Finishing the tunnel
for the escape route,

97
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,148
wasn't the end but the beginning.

98
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,712
It took longer than we'd expected
to move such a massive amount of money

99
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,363
to the hideout
through the underground sewer system.

100
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,368
And after we had finally moved
all of the money,

101
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,370
we still had to seal off the escape route

102
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,331
to prevent the cops from pursuing us.

103
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,178
We're ready for entry.

104
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,838
What are you going to do
when you get out of here?

105
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,621
Just gonna keep a low profile.

106
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,591
And then what?

107
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,803
You're really going to be a revolutionary?

108
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,721
Not sure.

109
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,518
Guess it depends on
if I make it out of here alive.

110
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,271
Making it to the other side
of this whole thing in one piece,

111
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,897
that's my one and only wish.

112
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,481
Um,

113
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,194
if that wish comes true,
will you grant me my wish, then?

114
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,778
What?

115
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,282
To go live on an island with me?

116
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,243
I mean, so, uh...

117
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,120
As you may know,

118
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,082
I joined this
for some pretty childish reasons.

119
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,170
I wanted to ruin my fucking life
as some kind of revenge on my parents.

120
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,385
But now, I think maybe it's time
to retire from that shit.

121
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,764
I don't get what kind of world you want.

122
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,850
Even with this brilliant brain of mine,

123
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,643
I don't understand what your dreams are.

124
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,229
But I do want to see it.

125
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,899
It doesn't have to be paradise.

126
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,902
Whether it's a blazing pit

127
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,862
or even hell,

128
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,865
I'll be with you.

129
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,076
Are you a poet now or something?

130
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,915
Shit. I thought that would work.

131
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,001
"A" for effort.

132
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,696
Tokyo!

133
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,581
We have to stall them here
as long as we can!

134
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,148
Forward! Now!

135
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,699
Forward!

136
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,808
- Fuck! These assholes are already...
- Hurry up, Tokyo and Rio are in danger!

137
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,875
We have to hold them off! Let's go!

138
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,920
Hey! Everyone, take cover!
You know where to go, right?

139
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,130
We do.

140
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,923
Then come on now. Go already!

141
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,467
Taeksu.

142
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,429
The underground waterway.

143
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,514
Hurry to it,
and I'll be there with you soon.

144
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,350
Don't worry about me, okay?

145
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,317
Cover me!

146
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,869
Fuck. Shit! Fuck!

147
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,003
- Cover me!
- It's dangerous now!

148
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,047
Goddamn it!

149
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,403
Tokyo!

150
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,704
Yah!

151
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,425
Tokyo! Tokyo! Hey!
Hey, Tokyo, come on! Wake up!

152
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,053
Tokyo!

153
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,891
Tokyo!

154
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,741
Tokyo!

155
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,161
Hey, Tokyo. Tokyo, wake up!

156
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,205
Die, you fucking bastards!

157
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,292
Charge!

158
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,135
Just stay down, you motherfucker.

159
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,763
Helsinki, come on, you can't do this.

160
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,098
- Okay?
- Let go!

161
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,850
Helsinki, come on! Stop this!

162
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,478
You son of a bitch,
I'll blow your fucking head off!

163
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,896
You bastard!

164
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,439
- Fuck you!
- Helsinki!

165
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,567
I know how you feel. I do.

166
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,444
Hey!

167
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,450
Helsinki! Get over there and help them
hold them back! Come on now!

168
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,327
I can handle it here!

169
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,162
Ahh!

170
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,290
Tokyo, please, wake up.

171
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,086
Tokyo!

172
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,596
Tokyo!

173
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,933
Let's hurry
and get the hell out of here. Okay?

174
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,103
You guys cut the romance and help us!
Come on!

175
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,250
The hole must be done by now.
Hang in there, a little more!

176
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,108
I'm here now!

177
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,988
Hey! Motherfuckers!

178
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,776
What the hell was that?

179
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,912
Go back. Now!

180
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,336
They're early. We were wrong.

181
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,380
Hurry, they can't hold them off for long.

182
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,142
Don't move a muscle.

183
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,936
The next bullet's going to be fatal.

184
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,719
Hey, you sons of bitches!

185
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,898
Hang in there, you guys!

186
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,619
- Kim Sangman!
- Kim Sangman!

187
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,954
KIM SANGMAN IS THE ANSWER

188
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,872
Could you please comment?

189
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,958
THE HOUSE OF PAPER IS OURS

190
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,210
WE'RE AGAINST FAKE ECONOMIC COOPERATION!

191
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,256
Kim Sangman! Kim Sangman!

192
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,346
Come out!

193
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,056
Hey, you son of a bitch!

194
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,029
I don't care if you kill them all.
Get those bastards.

195
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,712
They have tear gas!

196
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,262
Hey, watch out!

197
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,935
Everyone, take cover!

198
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,188
We can't do this anymore.
We have to go.

199
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,899
We did all we could. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go!

200
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,659
Forward.

201
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,060
They must have gone underground.

202
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,895
Follow me!

203
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,343
There's an underground tunnel.

204
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,854
I'm going in.

205
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,497
Nobody move!

206
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,875
I'll shoot if you move!

207
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,835
D-D-Don't shoot.

208
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,253
We're just hostages!

209
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,679
Everyone, take off your masks!

210
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,897
This underground tunnel,
it's definitely blocked.

211
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,861
Be careful.

212
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,573
Come on! Down, guys! Hurry!

213
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,116
Hey, Rio.

214
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,535
It's done!

215
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,661
Good. Come on.

216
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,378
Hey!

217
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,216
Hey, hey, hurry down there!
I need to blow up this thing!

218
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,013
Here.

219
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,563
Open this now!

220
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,704
- Who's left back there?
- Nairobi, Helsinki, Berlin.

221
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,852
They'll come after they activate
the bomb for the escape route.

222
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,793
Get moving.

223
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,795
I'll go and make sure the truck's ready.

224
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,425
Okay, come on.

225
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,624
Are you crazy?

226
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,836
I'm on police business.
I need to borrow your phone, okay?

227
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,922
Yes. Hello?

228
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,300
Wait. What hideout?
What are talking about now?

229
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,946
- How did you find it?
- That's not important.

230
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,431
They're planning on escaping here
through their hideout.

231
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,433
- Send people over.
- What location?

232
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,601
- Near the Pyeonghwa Hotel.
- What?

233
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,270
So it's close to the summit?

234
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,815
They might be bold,
but I don't think they're that reckless.

235
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,360
But that's their plan. They're planning
on escaping amid the chaos.

236
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,745
Inspector Seon
is completely right.

237
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,997
Cha Moohyuk here.

238
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,876
You're okay, aren't you?

239
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,210
I sent people that way.

240
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,463
They'll arrive shortly. Be on standby.

241
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,590
We don't have the time to just wait.

242
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,125
What...

243
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,711
Why isn't this working?

244
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,422
Is something wrong? Let me see.

245
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,678
Oh shit. Something must have gone wrong
while we moved the money.

246
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,185
What's wrong?
They'll barge in here any second now!

247
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,395
The bomb isn't working!

248
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,193
We can fix it, right?

249
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,362
Be quiet a second. Shit!

250
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,239
If this thing doesn't blow,
we're all fucked!

251
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,782
They'll be right behind us!

252
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,870
We'll all be caught at this rate.
I'll try to stop them somehow.

253
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,342
What are you doing?

254
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,844
You crazy?

255
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,972
I waited for my father.

256
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,559
Even in the prison camp, I waited.

257
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,394
Thinking that he would come for me.

258
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,814
Your son will be waiting as well.
You have to survive for him.

259
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,358
Don't be crazy,
I can't just leave you here!

260
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,236
All of us are just born to die anyway.

261
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,697
It's only a matter of how soon you go.

262
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,659
You fucking asshole.
Just come with us, huh?

263
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,997
Hey, Helsinki!
What are you doing down there?

264
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,041
Come on! Come on down right now!

265
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:01,210
We have to go now! Get down, right now!

266
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,587
We have to go!

267
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,926
Let's go! Come on!

268
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,994
- This way.
- Check on the hostages.

269
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,687
- And contact the embassy.
- Yes.

270
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,313
- And the hideout?
- It's surrounded.

271
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,276
Go now.

272
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,956
There's no one here.

273
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,875
Found the tunnel.
Going in now.

274
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,210
Go in.

275
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,474
Yeah? How close are you?

276
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,559
Almost there now.

277
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,396
Wait a minute.

278
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,065
There are cops all around the hideout.

279
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,859
Are you sure?

280
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,193
TAEDONGGANG BEER

281
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,862
We can't go in right now.

282
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,616
Okay, then.

283
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,910
I'll be in touch later.

284
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,855
I'm sorry, I need to call you back.

285
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,978
It's me.

286
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,569
Berlin.

287
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,030
I know they're going to hear me
if I use the phone,

288
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,884
but they're right here anyway,
so I guess there's no reason to hide it.

289
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,660
And I thought that I should say
my final goodbye.

290
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,583
The detonator is broken, so I have to
stay behind and block them myself.

291
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,709
Don't do it, Berlin!

292
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,793
Please don't.

293
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,129
Is he planning to blow himself up?

294
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,422
It's all over now.

295
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,216
What do you mean, "It's all over"? Huh?

296
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,259
They found the hideout.

297
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,305
And the route is blocked.

298
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,057
There's no point in...

299
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,309
the operation

300
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,270
anymore.

301
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,397
I'm sorry.

302
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,947
Well, this is an interesting turn
of events.

303
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,156
Berlin.

304
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,206
Where's Berlin?

305
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,167
The detonator was broken, so he had to...

306
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,544
I'll be back, okay?

307
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,627
Ah shit!

308
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,004
Stay right here!

309
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,550
If you go now,
Berlin will have died for nothing at all.

310
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,761
Don't you dare fucking say that!
Who said I'll let him die.

311
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,973
We're almost through to the vault.

312
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,416
- They're almost through to the vault.
- No need to wait for anything else.

313
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,859
Tell them to go in now.

314
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:53,942
Go in now.

315
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,871
Out of the way!

316
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,459
Stop! Stop! I told you that it's all over!

317
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:16,382
If we just give up now, then what about
Oslo and Moscow who died for this?

318
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:20,887
Never forget about the lives of those
poor people who trusted you till the end.

319
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,804
Jungho.

320
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,557
Even when I was alone
in the dark waters of Amnok River,

321
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,644
or almost beaten to death
in the prison camp,

322
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,772
somehow, I really wasn't afraid to die.

323
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,026
But I'm feeling pretty scared right now.

324
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,153
Jungho! Jungho!

325
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,573
I wanted to stand by your side out there
and call you by your real name.

326
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,282
Don't do this.

327
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,913
Even though the search was long,
you did eventually find me.

328
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,165
So you'll be able
to find the answer again.

329
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,917
I'm going to go.

330
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,961
I'll be waiting for you with Father.

331
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,632
You take your time.

332
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,716
Brother.

333
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,177
Jungho...

334
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,180
Please, no!

335
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,740
Cover me now!

336
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,273
Song Jungho!

337
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,800
Go! Go, go, go!

338
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,803
What the fuck are you doing
all the way back here, you crazy bitch?

339
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,305
What am I?

340
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,391
Who saved your life
at the prison camp? This crazy bitch.

341
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,519
You're not allowed to die
without my permission.

342
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,070
Hey, look at me now.

343
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,490
At this rate,
all our comrades will die, not just us.

344
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,869
Go now! Leave me your gun.

345
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,662
Just go on, okay?

346
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,874
If you really insist on dying here,
I'm not going to stop you.

347
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,752
But I will too. I'm staying with you.

348
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,591
I dragged you into this whole mess here.

349
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,052
I'm really sorry.

350
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,512
I never once regretted it.

351
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,690
They've got a bomb!

352
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,786
Yes, well, don't you worry...
Yes, we'll do that. Right.

353
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,832
So how are things looking?

354
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,166
If you go over that way like this,
the exit's right here.

355
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,503
Yes?

356
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,587
It's Song Sunho.

357
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,592
It's been a while.

358
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,011
Hmm.

359
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,305
Never thought
you'd really be the Professor.

360
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,142
Why do this? Is it
a belated atonement for your crimes?

361
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,020
Tell me, to what do I owe this call?

362
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,812
What?

363
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,107
You're yourself in?

364
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,734
Yes, I am.

365
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,279
On one condition.

366
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,573
You can shut me up,

367
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,617
or you can kill me if you want.

368
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,660
Do whatever.

369
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,247
Take back the money.

370
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,834
Please...

371
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,630
just let the others in my group live.

372
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,907
Are you there?

373
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,306
You trace that?

374
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,435
No, but he can't have gone very far.

375
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,771
Don't let any single one of them escape.

376
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,314
Not one.

377
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,398
Yes, sir.

378
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,400
What are you doing?

379
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,112
Berlin...

380
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,906
...just died.

381
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,615
I know.

382
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,077
I can't lose all of you too.

383
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,580
This whole plan was my idea, so...

384
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,167
...now if ends with just me...

385
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,502
Come on.

386
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,962
Come on!

387
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,964
- Just get a grip!
- Tokyo...

388
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,717
Didn't I tell you?

389
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,679
I can't see someone I care about...

390
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,599
...die ever again. You got it?

391
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,311
Get up.

392
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,063
Come on. Let's go!

393
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,924
What is that?

394
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,788
Berlin blew himself up,
the escape tunnel is blocked.

395
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,992
We have to pursue them
through a different route, sir.

396
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,506
Professor.

397
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,301
The hideout's been found.

398
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,095
They're gonna be coming in soon.

399
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,847
What do we do now?

400
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,558
The Professor found a way.

401
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,228
This is the only thing left

402
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,106
for us to try.

403
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,089
I'm Inspector Seon Woojin, all right?

404
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,467
I... I heard an explosion right over there.

405
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,928
You can catch them if you just...

406
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,014
- What are you doing?
- We've got her, sir.

407
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,018
She's likely in collusion
with the thieves.

408
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,355
Have her moved out here,
and go after the rest of them.

409
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,145
God, this map is like looking
at a spider's web.

410
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,479
It doesn't matter.

411
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,858
Because the city infrastructure
is independent and not connected

412
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,484
to any neighboring area...

413
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,862
No matter how they try to escape,

414
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,657
we seal it off right here,
and they're trapped like rats.

415
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,366
Mmm.

416
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,828
Now, here and here.

417
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,664
We have people following their trail.

418
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,375
If we close in from here,
we'll be able to catch them all.

419
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,712
Then do it.

420
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,301
What the hell is this about?

421
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:09,975
Weren't you suspended under suspicion
of collusion and leaking information?

422
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,935
You should have been under investigation.

423
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,355
But you're moving independently out of
your jurisdiction without reporting it.

424
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,400
- Sure you don't have another motive.
- What do you mean?

425
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,277
Who knows?

426
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,863
It could be that you've come to
sympathize with that bastard

427
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,466
after all the time you spent with him.

428
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,242
Hmm. Only you two would know that.

429
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:31,205
Shut up! I know why you carried out
the plan to suppress them all.

430
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,541
You'll kill them
to stop them from talking.

431
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,335
Isn't that why you dragged me here too?

432
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,253
Those people are terrorists!

433
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,839
The JEA is a symbol of peace,
and we have to keep it safe

434
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,549
from the dangerous extremists.

435
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,968
You're just afraid
that the summit could expose

436
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,762
what you and Jeon Yongsu are upto,

437
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:50,599
and then, maybe everyone would finally
understand who's behind all of it.

438
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,685
Hmm.

439
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,105
Not only were you under him,

440
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:01,652
you're also under a spell
of his unhinged beliefs, huh?

441
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,697
It's a bomb.
We've found a bomb!

442
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,242
- There's a bomb!
- I think that this is a bomb.

443
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,953
Search Team Two.
We found explosives.

444
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,598
- Explosives were found!
- We found a bomb!

445
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,832
Search Team Four,
there's one here too.

446
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,253
Explosives found!
South of Pyeonghwa Square.

447
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,255
One over here, too.

448
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,261
There are lots of explosives
underground near Pyeonghwa Square.

449
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,387
What should we do?

450
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,990
Attention, all units,
stand by until further notice.

451
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,433
So this is what they were after
this whole time.

452
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:34,935
Huh?

453
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,354
If bombs go off at Pyeonghwa Square
near a huge crowd,

454
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,691
the whole area would be in total chaos
with death and injuries.

455
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,652
These assholes are gonna try
to get away during all that!

456
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,571
They can't.

457
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,780
No, there's no way.

458
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,050
The Professor and the robbers have stuck
to their principle

459
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,594
of not killing people this whole time.

460
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,995
Their principle, my ass.

461
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,416
They just faked a noble cause
to buy themselves time to print the bills.

462
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,417
But they aren't...

463
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,962
If they really had some noble cause
like that, why'd they set up the bombs?

464
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,714
Why'd they let you live?

465
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,632
Just a distraction tactic.

466
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,836
Don't you get that they played you
until the very end?

467
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,031
You're wrong.

468
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,616
Get her out of here.

469
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,076
She's in the way.

470
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,835
- Take her to the station.
- Come on, Chief.

471
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,630
No, please! Chief!

472
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,017
So I think we should
probably evacuate the civilians

473
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,393
out of Pyeonghwa Square.

474
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,564
What if we do that and those bastards
blend in with the crowd and escape?

475
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,317
Huh?

476
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,949
Kim Sangman!

477
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,992
- And the summit!
- Cancel now!

478
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,095
- Traitor exploiters!
- We're against it!

479
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,330
Kim Sangman!

480
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,374
- The summit!
- Cancel now!

481
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,137
UNIFICATION IS NOT A MEANS OF MAKING MONEY

482
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,889
Seal off the area surrounding
Pyeonghwa Square completely,

483
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,755
so not a single rat can escape.

484
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,466
BETRAYER KIM SANGMAN OUT!
BETRAYER JEON YONGSU OUT!

485
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,941
If the bombs go off,
there will be a lot of casualties.

486
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,664
The bombs can just be disarmed.

487
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:54,866
We're not gonna give those criminals
any chance to escape the Pyeonghwa Square.

488
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,537
And if the bombs have to go off,

489
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,999
their little escape route
will become their mass grave.

490
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:06,003
Do you mean the deaths
of all the bank robbers

491
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,463
are more important
than the lives of civilians and cops?

492
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,757
Your Ministry of State Security

493
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,926
feels the same way I do.

494
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,211
- What do you think you're doing?
- I just need a second.

495
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,508
You were completely right.

496
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:57,095
Congressman Kim wants nothing more than
to kill every single one of the suspects

497
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,680
and cover it all up.

498
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,809
I need you to help me.

499
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,645
I think I know
where all of them are headed.

500
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,275
Are you saying they won't use the bombs?

501
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,819
It just seems
more and more unlikely, though.

502
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,196
But on what grounds?

503
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,740
Personal emotions?

504
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,287
I'm not sure, but I just...

505
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,083
I don't think there's
enough time to disarm the bombs!

506
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,046
Currently, the police are sealing off
the Square without any explanation.

507
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,672
They're holding not only the protestors,
but regular citizens as well.

508
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,860
As we mentioned before,
citizens are gathering in Pyeonghwa Square

509
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,428
as the large protest
is finally commencing.

510
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,806
Protestors are criticizing politicians...

511
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,099
This is the chief.

512
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,851
You need to evacuate
the civilians in the Square, immediately.

513
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,229
What? What do you...

514
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,065
You want to keep your badge, or what?
Keep them sealed off!

515
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,779
This is the chief! I repeat!

516
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:59,366
I'll take full responsibility
for everything that happens from now on.

517
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,744
Evacuate all the civilians
that are in the Square, right now!

518
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,832
Get moving, people!

519
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,916
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,431
Move!

521
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,646
- What is it?
- What is going on?

522
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,322
What... What's that?

523
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,348
What is that?

524
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,688
- What is that?
- Is that a pig?

525
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,901
Huh? What is that?

526
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,341
Look over there.
Take a picture, real quick.

527
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,792
Unidentified bills
are falling from the sky.

528
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,581
It's a m-m-money bomb.

529
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,797
The explosive sounds
that occurred in quick succession

530
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,841
near Pyeonghwa Square just moments ago,

531
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:06,261
turned out to be a stunt orchestrated
by the Mint's robbers.

532
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:10,056
Here, at the scene of the incident,
a flurry of new bills have been scattered

533
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,976
from the giant balloons
that have been spotted around the area.

534
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,146
The police currently seem to have
given up control of the situation.

535
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:20,233
Our reports indicate that the suspects
have already escaped the Mint

536
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,986
and had managed to get
the police off their trail.

537
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,283
ROBBERS ESCAPE THE MINT
BILLS SCATTERED AROUND PEACE SQUARE

538
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,391
- Underground tunnel?
- The Professor said.

539
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,976
There's a place
only his father knew about.

540
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,313
I looked into that back when I was a spy,

541
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,792
but they were all closed off
and there weren't any of them left.

542
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,651
Well, officially, there aren't any.

543
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,320
But he says one is still there, though.

544
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,072
Even if there is still one,

545
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,652
where would they go
with all that money in the North?

546
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,749
The train.

547
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,044
The underground tunnels next to the JEA.

548
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,337
Is one near a train station?

549
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,589
It's time to leave.

550
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,969
Don't move!

551
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,221
Inspector, I think I know of a place.

552
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,580
KHABAROVSK KAESONG

553
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,320
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

554
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,216
Captain!

555
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,681
Jungho?

556
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,284
It's Berlin.

557
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,734
You've got Seon Woojin
on your mind, right?

558
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,403
How'd you know?

559
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,947
I learned the hard way
from this operation.

560
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,786
Whether it's robbery or a revolution,
ultimately it is all just done by people.

561
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:28,541
But you know what? Maybe...
Maybe she's already on her way here now.

562
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:31,878
Maybe.

563
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,797
She's no ordinary woman.

564
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,008
Are you worried
that she's gonna come here?

565
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,427
Or...

566
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,679
worried that she won't?

567
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,058
I'm not that sure.

568
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:52,982
Okay, we should go now.

569
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,609
Hmm.

570
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,673
Freeze right there!

571
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,061
Stop the train!

572
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,941
What I said earlier...

573
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,528
I truly meant all of it.

574
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,698
Okay then, stop the train right now!

575
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:46,411
You can just kill me,
but you can't arrest me.

576
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,578
No way.

577
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,207
I'm going to get you
and all of your robbers

578
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,500
and I'll put you on the stand.

579
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,668
For what?

580
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,254
Telling people
they own these scraps of paper

581
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,965
that are printed at the Mint

582
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,677
and not the rich and the politicians
who want to treat reunification

583
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,764
as a means to just make money?

584
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,432
Or is it...

585
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,060
because I lied to you?

586
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,398
If you want to have me convicted,

587
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,318
you should choose now.

588
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,482
The robbers, consisting
of North and South Korean criminals,

589
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:42,860
have vanished into thin air
with a large sum of money.

590
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,322
Their escape was like
the finale of a grand magic act.

591
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:52,119
The thieves scattered cash
worth 0.3 billion dollars over the Square,

592
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:55,581
which was crowded because of the summit.

593
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,501
This caused a huge commotion,

594
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:03,589
but the robbers were able
to avoid the police.

595
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,915
What we did both inside
and outside of the Mint

596
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,542
broke out all over the world,

597
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,003
thanks to YouTube, social media,
and the foreign press.

598
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,465
Why were the Mint robbers able to print
four trillion won

599
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,134
without any repercussions?

600
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,304
It was believed that the third round
of summit was really an attempt

601
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,890
to print large-scale funding
to rescue conglomerate companies

602
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,058
that participated
in developing North Korea

603
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,603
under the pretext of economic cooperation.

604
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,187
And upon checking the serial numbers

605
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,391
of the money that was scattered
over Pyeonghwa Square,

606
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,317
this has turned out to be true.

607
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,651
I, Kim Sangman,

608
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,778
did my part, and everything I could,

609
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,489
to bring success
to the North Korean development project.

610
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:14,035
And all the additional funding that
was required was rightfully determined

611
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:17,455
by the Special Committee of economic
cooperation, following legal procedures.

612
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,749
In the face of this presidential election,

613
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,392
which will be a turning point in the...

614
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,002
Just like they always have,

615
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,504
the people with power
leverage their authority

616
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,923
to conceal their crimes.

617
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,676
But the people came out to the Square
to shine a light in the darkness.

618
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:36,140
Everyone was wearing our masks,
North and South Koreans alike.

619
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:39,185
THE HOUSE OF PAPER IS OURS

620
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,978
FORMER LEADER JEON YONGSU MISSING

621
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,822
WAS HE REALLY SENT
TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMP?

622
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,149
SEOUL HIGH PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

623
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,906
Congressman,
do you have time for an interview?

624
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,450
Congressman! Please give us a comment.

625
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,413
Are the Congressman's allegations true?

626
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:04,251
The quote, "The house of paper
belongs to the people,"

627
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,587
was gradually becoming reality.

628
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,053
Just be honest with us, okay?

629
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,056
I mean, a person can be persuaded
by money.

630
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:21,185
You've checked all of my bank records.
You froze my account.

631
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,230
- So, what money?
- Hey, Woojin.

632
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,942
A year ago, we started this together.

633
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,653
Aren't you tired of seeing my face?

634
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:53,843
WANTED SUSPECT OF MINT ROBBERY
SONG SUNHO

635
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,137
You're still here.

636
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:04,854
- You quit smoking?
- Yeah, she kept telling me to.

637
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,521
You seeing someone?

638
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,399
Yeah, uh...

639
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,949
So this is why
you just came running up to me.

640
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,784
Yeah, that's right.

641
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:22,413
- Oh. The bride...
- She's from North Korea.

642
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,458
I met her after the case,
when I was dispatched.

643
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,375
Great.

644
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:29,753
Good for you.

645
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,882
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

646
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,401
PLEASE JOIN US AS WE JOIN OUR FAMILIES.

647
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,305
That's beautiful.

648
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:44,727
Ah, I'm sorry, I thought
the least I could do is tell you, so...

649
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,353
Why are you sorry for?

650
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:49,273
Well, your divorce suit
is finally over now,

651
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,692
but the internal investigation

652
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,403
and the state compensation lawsuit
are a lot, right?

653
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,115
Don't worry. It'll work itself out.

654
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,826
Inspector Seon.

655
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,500
DH LAW FIRM
LAWYER SON SUNJOON

656
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,752
What in the world
does a foreign law firm want from me?

657
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,506
You must know
that the Mint case is quite famous.

658
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,926
It'll be our pleasure to represent you.

659
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:21,138
I appreciate the thought, but I don't have
the money right now to hire someone...

660
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,892
Ah. Don't worry.
We were hired by someone else to help you.

661
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,685
Then who hired you?

662
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,939
I can't give you
any information about the client.

663
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,581
What are you looking for?

664
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,917
It's just an old postcard I had.

665
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,341
Ah.

666
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:03,305
Well, here.
I found it all crumpled up there.

667
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,767
And I really didn't think
that it was trash.

668
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,747
Excuse me, sir.

669
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,332
Is there a café nearby?

670
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:13,751
You know, coffee?

671
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,754
I don't speak English.

672
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,880
Sorry.

673
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:28,432
Actually, there's one
that just opened up nearby.

674
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:30,935
The coffee there

675
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,687
is excellent.

676
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,537
Want some coffee?

677
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,457
Strange way to do business.

678
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:57,544
What do you have up your sleeve this time?

679
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:59,587
Not sure.

680
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:04,635
To be honest, I have
a pretty incredible plan.

681
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:06,929
Want to hear it out?

682
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,226
In the history of crime,

683
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,271
it'll go down as a revolution.

684
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,388
I've worked my fingers to the bone
for this ungrateful family,

685
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,140
and they won't even come out.

686
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,852
Hey, man, you can't move it like that.

687
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,771
- Be gentle with that.
- Okay.

688
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,982
Hey, what is this? That one isn't mine.

689
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,026
Hey, man!

690
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,570
Huh? I just brought it down
from the living room.

691
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:48,739
And I'm telling you
it isn't mine.

692
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,032
God, it's heavy.

693
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,951
Load this inside.

694
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,578
Well, I hope you have a nice life.

695
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:11,053
