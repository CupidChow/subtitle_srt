VLADIVOSTOK

2
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,871
Did you, uh, call me over here?

3
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,706
We're comrades.

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,002
I'm Song Sunho.

5
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,628
Comrades, huh?

6
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,049
How did you hear about us?

7
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,301
Internet.

8
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,727
I like you, man.

9
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,107
Uh, so why did you want to see me, huh?

10
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,410
I need to buy a weapon.

11
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,581
But I need to speak with your boss first.

12
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,170
Well, that's me.

13
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,253
Not you.

14
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,382
I need to speak with Song Jungho.

15
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,803
I'd like to see him face-to-face.

16
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,885
Bastard...

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,191
Why are you looking for him?

18
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,778
Are you a cop?

19
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,990
I need to see him.

20
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,326
No, no. No. No.

21
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,472
I'll ask you one last time.

22
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,766
How do you know Song Jungho?

23
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,271
We're brothers, that's why.

24
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,320
You're fucking insane.

25
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,632
Hey! Hey!

26
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,635
Repeat what you just said.

27
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,887
Yeah, say it to my face.

28
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,020
Jungho.

29
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,607
It's you, right, Jungho?

30
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,485
It's been so long.

31
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,322
You're grown up.

32
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,992
Wow.

33
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,917
Sh! Come now.

34
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,696
- Mom.
- Follow your father and brother.

35
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,324
Come on, Mom. Come on.
Hurry up. We can't be left behind.

36
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,866
Go now.

37
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,416
Hide!

38
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,461
Stop them!
Don't let them get away!

39
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,519
Jungho! Mom!

40
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,479
No!

41
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,399
Jungho!

42
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,113
Mom! Mom!

43
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,241
Mom! Mom!

44
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,410
Mom!

45
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,465
Why did you come looking for me?

46
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,512
Were you expecting
some emotional family reunion?

47
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,810
I don't even remember Dad's face.

48
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,442
I don't want to blame you.

49
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,736
That's what you had to do to survive.

50
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,370
After 25 years in hell,
that's one thing I learned.

51
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,833
Father...

52
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,005
was killed...

53
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,717
by money.

54
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,385
Ha.

55
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,638
Did he get scammed or something?

56
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,224
In order to get you out of the...

57
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,309
concentration camp,

58
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,148
we needed more than we could make
in a lifetime.

59
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,984
So Father...

60
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:49,033
was shot by a cop trying to rob bank.

61
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,777
What is this?

62
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,904
The plan Father couldn't finish.

63
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,740
And I want you to help me.

64
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,985
MONEY HEIST: KOREA - JOINT ECONOMIC AREA

65
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,364
If Warden Jeon Yongsu
doesn't show up here tonight,

66
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,866
I swear, I'll rip this bitch to pieces!

67
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,454
Get me Warden Jeon Yongsu!

68
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,498
Or else this bitch is gonna die.

69
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,749
You got that?

70
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,585
Get me Warden Jeon Yongsu!

71
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,629
By 8:00 p.m. sharp!

72
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,422
You better hurry!

73
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,841
8:00 p.m. tonight, all right?

74
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,554
THE MINT HOSTAGE SITUATION LIVE

75
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,724
Didn't you say this would be resolved?

76
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,775
LIBERATE THE KOREAN PENINSULA
LET'S RECLAIM THE UNITY

77
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,799
- Search the area.
- Yes, sir.

78
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,306
Ma'am, take a look at this.

79
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,725
LET'S REGAIN THE UNIFICATION
STOLEN BY THE CAPITALISTS!

80
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,306
KIM SANGMAN POLITICIAN
HUSBAND OF SEON WOOJIN

81
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,078
NORTH-SOUTH JOINT TASK FORCE
FOR SITUATION AT THE MINT

82
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,204
Over here too.

83
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,876
"Change the direction of the reunification
by stopping the summit"?

84
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,960
UNIFICATION REVOLUTION

85
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,172
It's just like you said,
they weren't after money at all.

86
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,177
LET'S LIBERATE THE KOREAN PENINSULA

87
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
Something's wrong.

88
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,816
It's a bomb!

89
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,155
There's another! There's a bomb in here.

90
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,658
- Evacuate.
- Yes, sir!

91
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,286
Ma'am, we need to leave.

92
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,287
Let's go.

93
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,914
Shit. I almost died a bachelor just now.

94
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,003
Yes.

95
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,925
Song Jungho he said?

96
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,719
Berlin is acting crazy right now.

97
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,306
That damn disease
got to his fucking brain, I'm sure of it.

98
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,392
- What do we do?
- Relax.

99
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,310
Berlin is totally fine.

100
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,270
What?

101
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,356
I think I know Berlin's motive.

102
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,610
Let's talk later. I'm on my way.

103
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,654
So you need to start preparing.

104
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,864
Search team!

105
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,031
Move out!

106
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,207
Wow.

107
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,295
Everything is starting to make sense now.

108
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,467
So this was their plan all along.

109
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,429
They took hostages at the Mint,
keeping the attention on them.

110
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,974
But their ultimate plan was
to ruin the summit.

111
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,019
Are they planning an attack?

112
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,521
Wait, are they...

113
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,691
Something's wrong.

114
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,319
They would've
blown the place up beforehand

115
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,905
if they wanted to hide the evidence

116
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,616
and keep us from learning
their actual plan.

117
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,743
But the bomb,

118
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,121
it exploded after we went in
and found everything.

119
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,042
Honestly, the fact that they left behind
such a crucial clue is making me think...

120
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,669
They showed us their plan on purpose?

121
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,923
And Song Jungho,

122
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,842
he threw one of his own under the bus.

123
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,928
Called for Jeon Yongsu.

124
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,225
They're suddenly doing things
that draw attention.

125
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,102
Right when they lost their way
of communication with the Professor.

126
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,521
It's the opposite.

127
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,441
Because they lost communications
he got reckless.

128
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,443
If only you saw him that day.

129
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,654
The guy's a complete nutcase.

130
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,162
We'll know soon enough.

131
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,134
Real name, Lee Hongdan.

132
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,431
Seems here you have
quite the impressive rap sheet.

133
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,811
If you cooperate with us,
we might be able to reduce your sentence.

134
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,690
If you can help us
resolve the hostage situation

135
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,316
before 8:00 p.m. by any chance,

136
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,363
you'll be seen as a hero,
who saved the lives of dozens of people.

137
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,326
And then, we may even be able
to cut your sentence by half.

138
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,872
How long is half a life sentence?

139
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,000
50 years?

140
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,209
40 years?

141
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,718
We found your hideout.

142
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,930
There was a lot of incriminating evidence
found in there.

143
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,767
"Let's regain the unity stolen
by the capitalists."

144
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,730
"Liberate Korea through revolution."

145
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,066
Seems to me, that you all robbed the Mint

146
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:06,363
not for money,
but to incite a political revolution.

147
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,451
What the fuck are you going on about?

148
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,706
I came to South Korea
to escape from shit like revolutions.

149
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,167
I learned that this country
is built on money.

150
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,838
So I agreed to join their group
in order to make a lot of it, that's all.

151
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,425
So you were just in it for the money,

152
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,766
but it was quite different
for others, I guess?

153
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,930
Those motherfuckers took advantage of me.

154
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,431
Did you stir up conflict?

155
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,059
Is that why they kicked you out?

156
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,397
That Berlin fucker framed me as a spy.

157
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,318
Maybe he went crazy
because of his illness.

158
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,112
- Huntington's disease?
- Yeah, that.

159
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,949
Maybe he ran out of his pills,

160
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,326
because he just started
acting crazy and shit.

161
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,204
He started shooting people,

162
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,748
and kept calling me a traitor, you know.

163
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,500
That crazy bastard.

164
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,545
What?

165
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,298
What? Can I help you, bitch?

166
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,636
Bring them in!

167
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,187
What are you doing?

168
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,147
What are you doing?

169
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,567
I need to verify
the credibility of your statement.

170
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,737
No big deal.

171
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,286
Let's start over.

172
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,710
So tell me, why did they kick you out?

173
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,797
Ah, you were framed as a spy, correct?

174
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,426
Right.

175
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,052
And Berlin went crazy.

176
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,139
That's why you were kicked out.

177
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Correct?

178
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,644
Are you fucking deaf or something?

179
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,688
I already told you all this just now.

180
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,024
Let's talk about the Professor.

181
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,943
Who is the Professor?

182
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,742
Have you met him before?

183
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,788
You think that I really know who he is?

184
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,291
You've met him before.

185
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,757
So you really wanna know?

186
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,179
I'll talk.

187
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,849
The Professor has...

188
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,769
two eyes,

189
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,521
with two ears...

190
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,317
...and most importantly,

191
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,277
one single mouth.

192
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,737
Okay.

193
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,949
You're not going to cooperate.

194
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,995
Treat me like this
and expect me to cooperate with you?

195
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,458
Leave and come back with a deal
I might actually say yes to.

196
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,419
Then I'll make sure
to tell you what you want.

197
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,005
A deal you'd agree to?

198
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,298
Fine.

199
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,842
Hmm.

200
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,804
But are you sure?

201
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,264
They really kicked you out of there?

202
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,856
Yes! I'm a victim too.

203
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,151
Why won't you listen? I'm a victim too!

204
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,695
Stop! Let go!

205
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,115
This is a warning.

206
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,784
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

207
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,370
Let go! Let go!

208
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,390
What are you looking at, you bastards?

209
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,291
Back off! Get out of here!

210
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,377
We can't transfer her now.

211
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,671
There's definitely something.
We need to interrogate...

212
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,354
How can we do that when she's like that?

213
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,676
What if she had done serious
that would have hurt you just now?

214
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,845
- Yes, but...
- There are reporters here.

215
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,556
Let's just detain her for now,
get her to calm down a bit,

216
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,516
and then we can interrogate her, yeah?

217
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,581
- Ms. Hongdan!
- Get off!

218
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,190
Quick! Before they leave.

219
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,108
Fuck!

220
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,735
Ms. Hongdan! We still have
questions for her!

221
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,529
Fuck all of you!

222
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,407
Get those cameras out of my face!

223
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,324
Get off!

224
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,246
Ms. Hongdan
is being taken away.

225
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,544
That means the traitor has to be...

226
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,128
Tokyo, then.

227
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,300
Yeah.

228
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,304
Tokyo!

229
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,224
- Tokyo!
- No!

230
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,774
What?

231
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,401
I'm the traitor.

232
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,779
It was me.

233
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,829
Is it really true?

234
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,919
Why did you do it?

235
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,504
Why?

236
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,675
Of all the people,
how could you betray us like this?

237
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,094
I'm sorry.

238
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,014
I have a son, okay?

239
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,726
When he was born,

240
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,396
I sent him away
because I was taken to prison.

241
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
A son?

242
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,400
So what you said before...

243
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,487
Kim Sangman took my son,
I didn't have a choice.

244
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,490
I'm sorry.

245
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,160
It worked, right?

246
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,955
See?

247
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,815
- I told you it would work.
- What's going on? Huh?

248
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,335
Did you plan all of this?

249
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,464
Stop it.

250
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,891
That's enough.

251
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,937
If anyone of you were in Nairobi's shoes,

252
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,399
you would've done the same thing,
don't you think?

253
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,697
About your son, though...

254
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,866
I'll make sure to find a way to help.

255
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,162
I was going to leave anyway.

256
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,082
We're going to send Tokyo
out of the Mint now,

257
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,750
pretending we had kicked her out.

258
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,753
If you leave,
the police will catch you right away.

259
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,464
- The Professor will get her out.
- How can he?

260
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,591
That's not easy to do,
even for the Professor.

261
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,303
Now that our communication's been severed,

262
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,263
we need to find the Professor.

263
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:50,434
Tokyo will be dispatched,
and inform him of the current situation.

264
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,602
And that includes Nairobi's son.

265
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,897
No, this won't work.
It's way too dangerous.

266
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,900
It's like we're sending Tokyo
on a suicide mission!

267
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,861
That's why I agreed to it.

268
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,322
I mean, it's something
that one of us has to do anyways.

269
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,656
Tokyo...

270
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,999
The suspect was escorted
to a tightly secure detention center

271
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,543
and will be subject
to further investigation.

272
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:23,008
Meanwhile, wanted criminal
and fellow suspect, Song Jungho,

273
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,969
requested to have a private conversation
with Jeon Yongsu,

274
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,557
and there is speculation that he is
somehow involved in recent incidents.

275
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,142
Seroquel?

276
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,269
Not that it'll help much.

277
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,898
...suspect Lee Hongdan in order
to receive more intel on the story.

278
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,983
Unfortunately, we were unable to...

279
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,278
Why didn't you tell me
your plan in advance?

280
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,030
You didn't really trust me, did you?

281
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,617
I knew it wasn't you, from the very start.

282
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,665
But I needed it to seem real
for the others.

283
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,794
And your pleas to spare Tokyo's life?

284
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,880
I know that was real.

285
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,471
Will Tokyo be okay, though?

286
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,474
Trust her. She's stronger than anyone.

287
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,148
But what if...

288
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,735
the Professor doesn't realize
what we're doing?

289
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:28,365
To be honest,
this gamble may not work at all.

290
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,449
That's right.

291
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,957
I bet my life on this.

292
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,170
And I'm sure that the Professor
will understand this.

293
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,027
So how does this thing work?

294
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,030
There are no operators.

295
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,659
We should print the money together
from now on.

296
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,122
Uh...

297
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,252
It's printed in three stages and...

298
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,595
I'll run the machine
and do the inspection here.

299
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,104
You can move the sheets...

300
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,522
Oslo...

301
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,860
wouldn't blame you for what you did.

302
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,533
I don't blame you either.

303
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,151
How much longer?

304
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,779
We'll be there in ten, sir.

305
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,436
- What's going on?
- Sorry.

306
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,046
A car came out of nowhere.
I'll check it out.

307
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,215
Everyone's armed!

308
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,886
HQ, this is convoy 137.

309
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,973
We're under attack! We need backup! HQ!

310
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,976
This is HQ.
We can't hear you. Please repeat!

311
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,769
- HQ! HQ!
- What's happening?

312
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,413
- It's a bomb!
- Bomb?

313
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,107
They've planted explosives!

314
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,236
What's going on? Tell me!

315
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,115
- We're going to die!
- Calm down!

316
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,617
We have to get out!

317
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,834
Get down!

318
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,183
Yes.

319
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,478
What was that?

320
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,440
Understood.

321
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,817
They said the convoy didn't come.

322
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,652
- Still?
- The radio?

323
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,529
It was suddenly disconnected.

324
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,197
What the hell is going on now?

325
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,490
So the convoy

326
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,659
was definitely attacked.

327
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,995
What? By who?

328
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,957
The Professor couldn't have done it alone.

329
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,293
Which means
they have a trained armed group

330
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,087
capable of robbing an armor truck
and escort vehicles as well.

331
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,423
You're saying there are more of them?

332
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,439
Drop the gun!

333
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,691
Put the gun down
if you want to live.

334
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,198
Fuck.

335
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,993
Okay, okay, okay, don't shoot.

336
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,372
Drop your guns or I'll shoot.

337
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,624
- Shoot me.
- Drop your guns or I'll shoot.

338
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,833
Then shoot me.

339
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,877
Shoot!

340
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,631
Looks like you have no choice.
We're not dropping the guns.

341
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,759
And then, you're going to die.

342
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,514
You okay?
Are you in love with her already?

343
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,933
You want to die with her?

344
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,610
Come on!

345
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,115
Get down!

346
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,075
Did the Professor tell you about us?

347
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,995
Yeah, but I didn't think he could do this.

348
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,210
Why weren't you come inside the Mint?

349
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,296
Because our boss is Berlin.

350
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,591
Nice to meet you, I'm Seoul.

351
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,928
Jesus Christ, what in the world
is happening here?

352
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,390
They're an anti-government
terrorist group.

353
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,934
You... What are you doing here?

354
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:52,355
So, this case will be transferred
to the South Korean Counterterrorism Unit.

355
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,900
Everyone but the person in charge,
please leave.

356
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,527
What do you mean?

357
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,364
I've seen the evidence from their hideout.

358
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,868
It's clear that the robbers are terrorist
organization with a political agenda.

359
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,370
We can't drag this on.

360
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,914
The fate of Korea depends on this.

361
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,000
The higher-ups won't just stand and watch.

362
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,422
Yes, Commissioner.

363
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,341
So, what's your plan?

364
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,429
Oh no...

365
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:29,058
I have to say, I happen to have
quite a bit of history with Song Jungho.

366
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:34,689
Do you know what you must not do
in hostage situations?

367
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,984
Negotiate by bringing them
the person they want.

368
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,029
They could completely lose control!

369
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,114
That's exactly what we're planning on.

370
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,077
While Mr. Jeon Yongsu
gets their attention,

371
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,455
the Counterterrorism Unit
will come in from behind.

372
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,708
They'll what?
The hostages will be in danger!

373
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,501
Can you

374
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,213
remove her, please.

375
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,053
Come on! Come on!

376
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,099
We can't do anything about this now.

377
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,187
Go home and get some rest.

378
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,689
Whatever happens here,
at least, it will be over.

379
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,857
You think so?

380
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,446
What if it was their plan all along

381
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,990
to release Hongdan
and bring in Jeon Yongsu?

382
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,369
I don't think so.
They couldn't even contact the Professor.

383
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,871
It means those bastards inside
aren't stupid.

384
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,791
Just think about it.

385
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,751
Huh?

386
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,005
We just received word
back from the convoy.

387
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,091
They said it's true
that they were attacked.

388
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,762
So they really did send her out
on purpose.

389
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,684
But why?

390
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,728
To contact the Professor,

391
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,982
or maybe there's something that
they couldn't do from inside the Mint?

392
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,151
Maybe it's because of the traitor.
If it isn't...

393
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,903
Uh...

394
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,991
What I mean is that I mean...

395
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,285
- Oh, out with it.
- Yeah.

396
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,121
Give us a sec.

397
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,002
I don't really know
what Kim Sangman did to coax them,

398
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,838
but one of the robbers
was emboldened to kill Anne.

399
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,921
And?

400
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,092
Why would they kill someone
when they could reduce their sentence?

401
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,344
Right.

402
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:34,851
Then Kim Sangman could be holding
the robbers' weak spot over them?

403
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,395
Did they send Hongdan to do it?

404
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,153
Tokyo, you did great.

405
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,448
Did you look into what I told you before?

406
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,701
There's a villa in Songsanri
under a fake name.

407
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,162
It's secluded,
and makes for a perfect hideout.

408
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,583
If he's hiding Nairobi's kid,
he would probably be there then.

409
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,253
There's not much time before
Berlin has a meeting with Jeon Yongsu.

410
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:09,052
1 HOUR 40 MINUTES BEFORE THE MEETING

411
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,220
The arrested suspect
in the Mint robbery

412
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,240
escaped with help from accomplices
during the police escort.

413
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,933
HOSTAGE PRISONER ESCAPE FROM THE MINT

414
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,977
Wow, it's nice to see Tokyo
even like this.

415
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,022
Yeah? You like her that much?

416
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,566
Didn't I already tell you not to worry?

417
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,113
Was she saved by those hired mercenaries?

418
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,701
They're reliable.

419
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,372
How do you know?
We don't know anything about them.

420
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,624
I know them well.

421
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,086
Those people would follow me
even into the depths of hell.

422
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,797
What? You mean the mercenaries...

423
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,633
They're working for you?

424
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,766
Damn.

425
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,437
Maybe we shouldn't have acted out at all.

426
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,857
What are you talking about now?

427
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,319
Didn't you hear what he just said?
He asked for a politician!

428
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,321
He's gone insane now!

429
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,408
If things don't go their way,
this bastard might drag us down with him.

430
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,166
I'm hungry.

431
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,585
Hey, Mr. Park,

432
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,672
you think we should ask them
if we can run the cafeteria ourselves?

433
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,185
Well, since we can't
run the cafeteria,

434
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,021
here's something small.

435
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
We found these.

436
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,650
Potatoes.

437
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,613
You don't want to work
but you still want food?

438
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,448
Hey, quit it.

439
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,493
What's wrong? Now you can eat.

440
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,081
There's nothing for you, you damn weasel.

441
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,500
Aren't you all hungry? Huh?

442
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,711
You need to eat something,
even if we're fighting.

443
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,920
Come on.

444
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,175
All right. Come on.

445
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,150
You two are just like
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

446
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,403
Pull yourself together and eat something.

447
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,831
- Mr. Park.
- Yes.

448
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:48,127
The Mint hostage crisis is speculated
to be politically motivated.

449
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,922
Yes, according to
an anonymous police official,

450
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,007
there were clues left
at the robbers' hideout

451
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,885
suggesting that the Mint hostage crisis
is not just a robbery...

452
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,886
It's here and here.

453
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,807
...but an elaborate scheme
inspired by a political agenda.

454
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,392
The fact Song Jungho summoned Jeon Yongsu,

455
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,770
North Korea's
head of economic cooperation,

456
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,563
reinforces this idea.

457
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,817
What was the reason
he demanded to see Jeon Yongsu?

458
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,152
It would seem
to involve his prior service

459
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,196
as the warden of a concentration camp.

460
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,757
But this was long before...

461
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,159
We've arranged for you to have an exit
if things look too dangerous.

462
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,370
It won't be needed.

463
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,958
Wouldn't it be better
for the operation if I buy you more time?

464
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,519
...the North Korean leadership

465
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,771
through the first and second round
of economic cooperation talks.

466
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,796
30 MINUTES LEFT

467
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,548
In the meantime, Jeon Yongsu...

468
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,716
Yeah. What did you find?

469
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,719
I looked into the people
that Kim Sangman took in,

470
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,003
and a few people weren't related
to the hostages at all.

471
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,723
Who are they?

472
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,393
They're family members
of the identified robbers,

473
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,019
including Sim Youngmun's son,

474
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,605
but after the broadcast,
he hasn't been returned.

475
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,191
So he's threatening her with her child?

476
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,734
Where would he be detained, though?

477
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,366
I know exactly
where he'd do something like that.

478
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,076
You know for sure?

479
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,829
I lived with that man for many years.

480
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:12,879
10 MINUTES BEFORE THE MEETING

481
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,697
Who are you people?

482
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
Us?

483
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,909
Well,

484
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,744
who do you think?

485
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,914
I know at least four of you

486
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:53,628
have to be heavily armed
with AK-105s and such.

487
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,463
You knew just from the sound?

488
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,217
Well done.

489
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,469
Are you going to start
an uprising or something?

490
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,597
Uprising?

491
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,369
What's the hold up?

492
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,080
We had to take a few detours.

493
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,456
But we're here.

494
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,844
The kid's up there.

495
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,557
Security looks tight.

496
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,351
Don't have much time.

497
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,812
We also have to
follow the Professor's rules.

498
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,564
They're rubber.

499
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,323
Never met
such a stubborn man before.

500
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,992
Except Berlin.

501
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,161
Clear?

502
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,748
Let's go.

503
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,734
Okay, time's up. Let's go.

504
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,227
MEETING TIME

505
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,591
JEON YONGSU ARRIVES AT THE MINT
NEGOTIATES WITH THE ROBBERS

506
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,623
JEON YONGSU ARRIVES AT THE MINT
NEGOTIATES WITH THE ROBBERS

507
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,418
It's been a long time.

508
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,130
Is that so?

509
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,591
Not for me.

510
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,928
Because even after I escaped
from your concentration camp,

511
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,680
you haunted my nightmares
every single day.

512
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,725
Now it's my turn to be your nightmare.

513
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,828
Let's go.

514
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,417
You bastard!

515
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,755
You fucker!

516
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:45,961
Shit!

517
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,787
Let's go. Now!

518
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,019
Are you all right?

519
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,273
Yes.
I think it's all been cleared now.

520
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,626
So tonight I will take
that ugly mask off of you.

521
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,921
Will that change anything?
Revealing my past?

522
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,758
Look at your situation.

523
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,676
Look around you.

524
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,929
I heard the electricity was cut.

525
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,265
So, doesn't that mean it's over?

526
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,479
Why don't we leave
and call this off together?

527
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,647
Tell them all

528
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,566
the terrible things that you did to us

529
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,402
back at Camp 14.

530
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,948
I merely carried out the duties
that my country assigned me.

531
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,411
Duties?

532
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,121
You starved, tortured,

533
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,458
and killed us like stray dogs.

534
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,211
Was that also in your assignment?
Answer me now.

535
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,589
All right!

536
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,426
Let's say I did those things!

537
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,554
But haven't I already
paid the full price for that?

538
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,351
You already got
your cruel revenge against me?

539
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,310
What?

540
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,188
My daughter was working there
as a camp medic.

541
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,065
You raped her,

542
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,776
and then burned her alive!

543
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,694
Really?

544
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,382
HOSTAGE SONG JUNGHO
DEMANDS TO 'REVEAL JEON YONGSU'S PAST''

545
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,157
How could he do such a thing?

546
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,010
JEON YONGSU ARRIVES AT THE MINT
NEGOTIATES WITH THE ROBBERS

547
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,327
Good, he's doing great.

548
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,162
Isn't he going too far?

549
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:11,083
- What if Jungho goes ballistic and kills...
- It's a necessary sacrifice.

550
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,294
No one will say anything
when the situation is over.

551
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,757
Why? Because people want to see a hero.

552
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,929
The media will be focussing

553
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,432
on your achievements and call you a hero.

554
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,649
- What is this?
- Is it true?

555
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,382
- VIEWERS ARE INCREASING
- IS SOMEONE SPREADING THIS?

556
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,675
THERE ARE SO MANY VIEWERS HERE...

557
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,784
THIS IS MORE EXCITING
THAN THE HOSTAGE NEWS

558
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,512
- WHAT SHOW IS THIS?
- THEY'RE HEADING UPSTAIRS

559
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,829
ROBBERS INFILTRATED A BUILDING

560
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,747
IS THERE ANYONE UPSTAIRS?

561
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,998
- THIS IS INTENSE
- IT'S CRAZY

562
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,059
- FUCK, THAT SCARED ME
- THAT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME

563
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,710
WHY ARE THE MINT ROBBERS HERE?

564
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,627
GUN?

565
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,755
- IS THIS A REAL SITUATION?
- NO, IT'S NOT, IDIOT

566
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,757
- HEADSHOT
- IS THIS REAL LIFE?

567
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,550
- NICE AIM
- IS THIS REAL?

568
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,677
IS THIS LIVE?

569
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,283
THE ACTION IS DOPE
FPS QUALITY IS REALISTIC

570
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,467
LOOK AT THAT HIT SATISFACTION

571
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,602
I KNOW THIS! IT'S TIME CRISIS

572
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,914
- THAT MAN JUST DID A HUNTER STEP
- THIS IS CRAZY

573
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,191
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE MINT

574
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,108
THERE'S MORE UPSTAIRS

575
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,544
I'M SURE THEY ARE
SOUTH KOREAN SECURITY GUARDS

576
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,171
- GOD, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU
- THEY'RE COMING LIKE A HERD OF DOGS

577
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,964
- THE CAMERA MOVEMENT IS DOPE
- SHE'S A SOUND-PLAY PROFESSIONAL

578
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,549
- MOVE YOUR FACE, MISTER
- SHOCK AND AWE, LOSERS

579
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,009
- THIS IS LIKE A MOVIE
- IT'S BROADCASTING LIVE

580
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,353
- STOP, CRAZY BASTARDS
- WHAT A MESS

581
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,203
SHOULD WE BE WATCHING THIS? HE SEEMS DEAD

582
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,722
AREN'T THEY THE HOSTAGE ROBBERS IN MASKS?

583
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,580
- THAT'S DOPE
- DID THEY GET RID OF THEM?

584
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,457
I DON'T THINK SHE'S FROM THE SOUTH

585
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,185
- IT DIDN'T END YET
- IS THAT THE BOSS'S ROOM?

586
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,644
WHO'S THAT KID? ARE THEY RESCUING HIM?

587
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,308
- HOSTAGE RESCUE MISSION COMPLETED!
- I THINK THE BOY WAS KIDNAPPED

588
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,512
Dongchul.

589
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,640
Send backup over here, right now!

590
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,353
Who are you?

591
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,979
I'm your mom's friend.

592
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,650
Your mom is very worried about you.

593
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,193
Wanna see her?

594
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,045
Just when I thought
it was too easy.

595
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,672
Do not move.

596
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,090
We rescued this child.

597
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,052
I know, but this still won't
make you heroes.

598
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,061
It's okay.

599
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,188
She's a police officer.

600
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,651
If you go with her, she'll protect you
from all the scary people around here.

601
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,819
What?

602
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,696
She's a really nice lady.

603
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:47,947
Right?

604
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,328
She's right.

605
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,747
I'm not a mean lady.

606
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,417
Come with me.

607
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,710
Okay?

608
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,264
Stay right there!

609
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,266
You won't shoot us in front of a kid.

610
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,727
So don't make me have to shoot.

611
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,271
Sangman's dogs are going to wake up soon.

612
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,481
You should take the kid.

613
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,696
Of course...

614
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,323
JEON YONGSU 'ATONEMENT FOR THE PAST'

615
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,701
...the treatment of the prisoners
within those camps was repulsive.

616
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,288
People were starving both inside
and outside of the camps at that time.

617
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,208
It was all my fault, but...

618
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,544
I had already paid for those crimes.

619
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,255
My stepdaughter,

620
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,259
she was the most important thing to me.

621
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,720
And she's gone because of my crimes.

622
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,139
Cut the shit already.

623
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,191
You need to see this, sir.

624
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,801
We didn't want it to come to this,
but a child was taken from us.

625
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,385
MINT ROBBERY SUSPECT
LIVE VIDEO OBTAINED

626
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,996
One of our children
was threatened with death.

627
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:05,168
Fortunately, as you've all just seen,
the child has been rescued.

628
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,337
and handed over safely to the police.

629
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,924
And what Jeon Yongsu has been saying

630
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,927
has all been a lie.

631
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,762
How do we know?

MINT ROBBERY SUSPECT
LIVE VIDEO OBTAINED

633
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,401
Because his very important stepdaughter...

634
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,821
is right here in front of you.

635
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,657
He'd raped me since I was a child,

636
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,745
and made me work at the camp
to keep me by his side.

637
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,126
Even when he would
kill and torture prisoners just for fun,

638
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,088
no one was bold enough to defy him.

639
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,884
Except for Song Jungho.

640
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,095
Song Jungho wasn't afraid of him.

641
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,432
When I fell in love with him...

642

MINT ROBBERY SUSPECT
LIVE VIDEO OBTAINED

643
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,269
...Jeon Yongsu tried to kill us both,

644
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,148
so Song Jungho started a riot to save us.

645
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,400
And now,

646
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,111
Jeon Yongsu's here for the summit...

647
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,406
...like he's some kinda preacher of peace.

648
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,992
So who roped him into it?

649
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,202
The leader

650
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:25,707
of the Unified Future Party,
and Korean Economic Cooperation,

651
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,542
Congressman Kim Sangman.

652
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,380
He's the son of a bitch
who stole Nairobi's son,

653
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,673
and ordered her to kill Anne.

654
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,925
That's not true.

655
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,885
Well, uh, sir, what do we do?

656
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,054
Shut that down, now!

657
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,305
Shut that down!

658
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,602
What is it though,

659
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,647
that they think they'll get
out of killing this little girl?

660
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,650
Will Korea be reunified?

661
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,861
Will there be an age of peace
between the North and the South?

662
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,945
No.

663
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,865
They don't care about that sorta thing.

664
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,659
All that this summit was,

665
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:04,621
was a ploy for them
to get even richer than they already are.

666
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,039
Oh my God.

667
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,084
Look at it.

668
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,752
What even is money?

669
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,255
It's just a stack of paper.

670
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:16,049
You can make
as much of it as you want in the Mint.

671
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,135
And if the ones who decide

672
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:21,972
how much paper to print
are no better than robbers,

673
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,641
shouldn't they be stopped?

674
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:29,146
Because this house of paper
should to the people.

675
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,150
LIVE IN FRONT OF THE MINT

676
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,651
We're more important than money.

677
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,838
- Now...
- What's that?

678
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,489
...who are the real robbers

679
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,617
and who are the real owners?

680
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,920
But, sir,
we'd like to speak with you further.

681
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,093
Sir, we'd like an answer!

682
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:08,518
Jeon Yongsoo does not appear
to be responding to any further questions.

683
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,271
Well done, Berlin!

684
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,773
You did great.

685
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,782
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Berlin.

686
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,686
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?

687
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,245
How long does Berlin have?

688
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,496
Don't know.

689
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,708
Did he go to the Mint
to find a resting place?

690
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,710
If that's really his plan then...

691
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,881
I'll kill him before he dies.

692
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,012
Congressman Sangman claims
that the robber's speech was false,

693
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,376
and that he was only taking measures
to protect the child.

694
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,101
I knew he'd say that.

695
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,396
If Sim Youngmun testifies,
he'll play dumb.

696
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,777
Okay, I'm on my way. Talk to you later.

697
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,028
Sounds good.

698
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,405
Ma'am.

699
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,366
Yes?

700
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,036
Are my Mom's friends bad people?

701
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,122
Is she bad too?

702
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,799
Okay, time's up.

703
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,549
Let's go.

704
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,723
Don't be scared.

705
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,937
Berlin planned all of this, actually.

706
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,481
Why did he do that, though?
Why did he rope me in?

707
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,024
Soon you'll find out.

708
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,610
Whatever happens,

709
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,029
I promise, you won't get hurt.

710
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,992
Then the bomb that went off to kill me...

711
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,869
Was that him?

712
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,583
Truthfully, I did that one.

713
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,419
I had no choice.

714
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,089
Kim Sangman threatened me.

715
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,842
You're lying.

716
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,220
I don't trust anything

717
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,681
you all say.

718
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,687
Hey. Here's your food.

719
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,275
Ah, dammit!

720
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,484
Potatoes again?

721
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,778
So, is there nothing else back there?

722
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,031
Don't like it, then don't eat.

723
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,656
Uh...

724
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,327
It's better than going hungry.

725
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,662
Are you coming?

726
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,831
You have to eat.

727
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,794
Here. Share this with her.

728
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,004
Uh, thank you.

729
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,631
Okay, let's eat.

730
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,219
Was it because of your son?

731
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:55,226
I was so glad
that you didn't run away from us all.

732
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,353
Thank you.

733
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,690
For staying strong.

734
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,116
Okay, let's eat.

735
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,133
What are you doing, guys?

736
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,094
Leave some for the others, huh?

737
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,112
What?

738
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:49,947
I'm in pain.

739
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,490
What?

740
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,415
I don't think it's infected.

741
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,417
Does it hurt?

742
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,836
That's not what
I was referring to, though.

743
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,965
What then?

744
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,467
What are you talking about?

745
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,970
Why do you keep avoiding me?

746
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:16,808
I never did.

747
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,605
I could have left, you know.

748
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,608
But I chose not to.

749
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,612
What? Are you crazy?

750
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,450
Yes, maybe I am.

751
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,256
What's going on here?

752
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,717
Oh, I'm just, uh, treating her.

753
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,969
Her wound is a little infected.

754
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,637
I'm almost...

755
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,515
It's your father.
I'll take care of her for now.

756
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,185
- So go find him.
- Okay, I got it.

757
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,155
The boy's at the orphanage.

758
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,326
Send some police to guard that place.

759
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,914
Sure. Well, Kim Sangman
won't be able to do anything now.

760
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,541
So now what?

761
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,462
What?

762
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,508
- We stay out of it?
- Of course.

763
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,093
We're ordered to do so.

764
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,677
But, ma'am...

765
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,725
We let Lee Hongdan escape...

766
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,103
...the Professor's still out there,

767
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,731
and we've been played
by literally everyone.

768
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,860
I'm partially to blame too.

769
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,246
Well, if that's the case,
then go home and relax a little.

770
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,123
You deserve it.

771
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:05,999
All right.

772
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,587
Take it easy, then.

773
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:45,957
By the way,

774
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,461
we're all in it for the money, right?

775
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,173
Because what you said on camera
made me think you're not.

776
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,259
Did it really?

777
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,887
What I did was all part of the plan.

778
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,181
The plan? What plan, though?

779
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,520
"This house of paper
belongs to the people?"

780
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,856
What the hell is all that bullshit?

781
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,028
We're still stuck here,
getting shot at and risking our lives

782
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,779
just to print this damn money.

783
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,656
How does that belong to the people?

784
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,783
Hmm. Well, that...

785
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,827
I'm not interested in your plan.

786
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,453
Rio.

787
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,458
I don't know the reason why
you came in here, risking your life,

788
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,084
but don't force us into it.

789
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,671
This could ruin the Professor's process.

790
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,181
It's for my brother.

791
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,350
Brother?

792
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,228
The reason I came here, risking my life,

793
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,856
is to make sure
my brother's plan is a success.

794
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,442
Are you saying the Professor is your...

795
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,153
Making this look like a revolution

796
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,906
is all part of his plan.

797
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,534
Activists?

798
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,911
Can we really do that, though?

799
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,997
If we're seen as political activists,

800
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,916
it'll open the way for escape.

801
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,000
Hmm?

802
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,502
The authorities will panic

803
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,171
and be convinced
that our goal is to stop the summit.

804
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,091
If the mercenaries
make their presence known,

805
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,344
the authorities can't
rule out the possibility

806
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,347
of armed forces attempting
an act of terror at the summit.

807
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,518
Kim Sangman and his party
will somehow manipulate the media

808
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,228
and try to hide the truth.

809
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:35,692
But the people who know the truth
will follow us, believe in us.

810
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,492
If that happens successfully,
then the final stage is set.

811
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,919
That's the plan
I'm helping my brother accomplish.

812
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,170
Wait, but, then

813
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,674
why have you been hiding the fact
that he's your brother?

814
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,468
I told him we should hide it.

815
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,055
If we hadn't, the Professor's identity
would've been revealed

816
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,515
when Nairobi betrayed us.

817
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,480
What are you two doing there?

818
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,482
The hostages are ready.

819
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,236
Hostages? Is that what she said?

820
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,702
We should go get ready
for Tokyo's return.

821
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,079
Wh... What did you just say?

822
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,674
If anyone wants to get out of here,

823
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,301
I'll let you leave.

824
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,886
But...

825
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:50,391
for the hostages
who stay and help us, in return,

826
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,435
we'll give you

827
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,896
three billion won each.

828
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,273
- Three billion won?
- Are you kidding?

829
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,500
I'd be rich.

830
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,651
I can't believe it.
Three billion won?
