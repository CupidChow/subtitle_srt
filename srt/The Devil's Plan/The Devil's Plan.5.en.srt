1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,841
Joon-bin.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,635
Is it down there?

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,721
Is that mine?

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,515
Is that Piece mine?

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,516
Where is it?

6
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,477
-Next to ORBIT. Whose Piece is that?
-Let me see.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,562
This is mine.

8
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,023
-Oh, it's yours?
-Really? Mine is gone.

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,899
-It's gone?
-Has anyone seen a pouch?

10
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,818
Where is it? Did you leave it back there?

11
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,486
Maybe you left it.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,739
-Why don't you pack your stuff?
-Shouldn't you leave?

13
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,699
Do you need help packing?

14
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,159
Where's my Piece?

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,875
It's gone.

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,961
Nice, I found it.

17
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,380
I found it.

18
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,799
Dong-jae got excited that I might leave.

19
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,719
Come here.

20
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,639
Here you go.

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,854
Survive again tomorrow.

22
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,273
{\an8}Considering how the game went,

23
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,901
{\an8}Joon-bin and I strategized
and coordinated our efforts

24
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,527
{\an8}<i>during the game.</i>

25
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,530
{\an8}Honestly, ORBIT finishing second
wasn't part of the plan.

26
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,699
{\an8}I did ask him for a Piece.

27
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,493
Can I say something?

28
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,703
-Give me one Piece.
-Of course.

29
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,914
I knew he would give me one,

30
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,540
so I just accepted it.

31
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,667
I had no reason to refuse.

32
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,419
-I worked hard today.
-You did.

33
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,171
I helped ORBIT win.

34
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,882
Dong-jae, you have
three Pieces now, right?

35
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,133
Yeah, because Seok-jin gave me one.

36
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,635
-So three, right?
-He gave one?

37
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,470
-Three, three, and two.
-Right.

38
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,387
-Three.
-Three?

39
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,681
Coincidentally,
you three have the most Pieces.

40
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,974
-Right.
-Right.

41
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,811
-They're still the top dogs.
-I hate how you said "coincidentally."

42
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,103
Once Joon-bin goes to bed,

43
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,981
he'll be like, "I'm going to kill them."

44
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,275
Let's have
a fun and peaceful game tomorrow.

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,944
-I'm so excited.
-I had a great time today.

46
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,403
-I had fun.
-It was fun.

47
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,446
Good job.

48
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,572
-Good night.
-Good night.

49
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,032
-Good night. Goodbye.
-Good night.

50
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,742
-Good night.
-Good night.

51
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,952
-Goodbye.
-Good night.

52
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,869
Bye.

53
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,793
Let's do our best tomorrow.

54
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,711
-Let's play well.
-But...

55
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,216
I'll show you all
a different side of me tomorrow.

56
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,552
I'll come up with a plan
if there needs to be one.

57
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,765
If you like what you hear from me,

58
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,100
then join me.

59
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,810
All right. Sounds good.

60
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,228
The thing about me is,

61
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,021
I never abandon my teammates.

62
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,439
-We can do it.
-Let's do well.

63
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,400
-Let's do our best.
-Seriously.

64
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,778
-Good night.
-Let's play well tomorrow.

65
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,530
-Okay.
-Whatever the game may be.

66
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,614
Bye.

67
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,783
-When I wake up...
-I'm so glad you're back!

68
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,701
Goodness.

69
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,328
I'm so happy you're back.

70
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,872
I'm so happy I'm back too.

71
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,916
I'm so glad to have a roommate again.

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,543
I realized this today.

73
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,422
I need to survive however I can

74
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,507
and make you win.

75
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,343
-Where is this coming from?
-You play so well.

76
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,262
Then please support me.

77
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,848
Okay. I'll push you to be the winner.

78
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,891
-Support me.
-Okay.

79
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,268
I'll do my best tomorrow.

80
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,479
I don't care about anyone else
aside from the four of us.

81
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,483
My goal tomorrow
is to help the underdogs survive.

82
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,029
Do you think the two of us can co-exist?

83
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,907
It won't be easy but look at it this way.

84
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,491
I have a different outlook.

85
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,076
If you don't have what it takes,
you should go.

86
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,912
-The underdogs shouldn't remain.
-But listen,

87
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,372
if you only play for yourself,

88
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,082
they won't listen to you.

89
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,877
So help everyone survive?

90
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,961
Yeah.

91
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,173
That sounds hard but just do this.

92
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,050
I get that you want all to survive.

93
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,011
But if it's not possible,
prioritize the four of us.

94
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,430
When we played today's game,

95
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,307
once our teammates and I
crossed the finish line,

96
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,642
<i>I didn't care about the board.</i>

97
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,143
<i>I didn't care who came last.</i>

98
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,147
The reason why I kept watching after that

99
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,941
was to minimize
the number of eliminations.

100
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,400
-I didn't care.
-Right.

101
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,486
-I wanted more eliminations.
-For example...

102
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,655
<i>What if the person
who finished third to last</i>

103
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,573
<i>only had two Pieces?</i>

104
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,116
They would have survived.

105
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,702
-That's why...
-Why save them though?

106
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,787
For what reason?

107
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,331
They might be better off going home.

108
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,959
Didn't we all have a good time today?

109
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,380
16 HOURS LATER

110
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,216
Weren't we supposed to be a team?

111
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,217
What?

112
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,511
We had agreed to work together.

113
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,728
Why cry when they were in the wrong?

114
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,147
Why are they playing
the innocent victim now?

115
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:55,253
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

116
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,603
{\an8}When I woke up, I could smell coffee

117
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,689
<i>and the salad was so fresh.</i>

118
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,734
It felt like I was in heaven.

119
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,495
Which room is it?

120
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,833
Yu-min.

121
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,085
-Good morning.
-Did you sleep well?

122
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,506
Come and drink some hot tea.

123
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,593
The tea tastes amazing. Come on down.

124
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,928
<i>The living area is a hotel
compared to the prison.</i>

125
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,638
It's like a five-star hotel.

126
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,684
<i>I was so relaxed and everything down
to the temperature was great.</i>

127
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,187
I was so happy.

128
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,026
{\an8}PRISON

129
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,657
It's time for breakfast.

130
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,784
Right.

131
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,077
What is it?

132
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,207
-Thank you.
-Careful.

133
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,418
{\an8}I actually slept pretty well.

134
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,544
{\an8}I slept well.

135
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,380
{\an8}SEUNGKWAN
SINGER

136
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,507
Is the food okay?

137
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,108
ORBIT and I are...

138
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,943
We really don't get along.

139
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,112
"I'm a good person
and they're the villains."

140
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,156
I think that'll be his mindset
the whole time.

141
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,034
We're not necessarily the top dogs,

142
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,078
he really convinced everyone
to think that way.

143
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,079
He did.

144
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,332
He kept saying,
"You guys are the top dogs."

145
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,167
Once he did that,

146
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,294
no one wanted to talk to us.

147
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,463
It was eight against four yesterday,
but now it's eight against three.

148
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,714
We're at a bigger disadvantage now.

149
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,676
We need to increase our numbers.

150
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,885
Yu-min and Hye-sung.

151
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,304
<i>They're flexible and in some ways,</i>

152
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,932
-they hold the casting vote.
-Right.

153
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,767
We need to appeal to them

154
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,270
-that we can afford to spend Pieces.
-Right.

155
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,771
-"We can spend them for you."
-Exactly.

156
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,691
We have to remind them that
we can spend Pieces if needed.

157
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,901
We should talk to them.

158
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:28,197
{\an8}First, we need to draw in people
who aren't in the four-person alliance.

159
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,368
<i>By appealing to their emotions,
we might win them over.</i>

160
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,036
Did you sleep well last night?

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,663
-No.
-Did you toss and turn?

162
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,956
Quite a lot.

163
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,749
-Your roommate was gone, right?
-Yeah.

164
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,334
They got bread.

165
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,462
-I guess I felt uneasy.
-Maybe it was the pressure.

166
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,671
I think I felt uneasy.

167
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,964
We should give them our food here.

168
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,799
-They're going to say...
-They'll mention the bread again.

169
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,552
I'm completely different
when playing games.

170
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,805
In reality, I'm quite a complacent person.

171
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,224
That doesn't sound true at all.

172
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,810
I'm ambitious but I also
doubt myself at the same time.

173
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,062
How did you get into poker?

174
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:05,026
Someone on YouTube said
poker is a game for smart people.

175
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,444
I'm not good at poker

176
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,654
{\an8}but I enjoy watching
the World Series of Poker.

177
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,906
{\an8}-Really?
-Yeah.

178
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,073
That's so interesting.

179
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,327
With Guillaume gone,
I didn't think anyone would be into it.

180
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,245
-We should talk more.
-I know some players too.

181
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,706
-I know Daniel Negreanu.
-Really?

182
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,083
-How do you know him?
-He's a legend.

183
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,084
He is.

184
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,003
Should I tell you
how UV rays were discovered?

185
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,046
No.

186
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,884
-That was fast.
-But it's really a fun story though.

187
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,802
You suddenly look tired.

188
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,847
I'd just like to get
some good sleep here for once.

189
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,390
Do you want me
to talk about science before bed?

190
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,725
That seems to work on Joon-bin.

191
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,686
Joon-bin sleeps so well.

192
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,865
Do you need help?

193
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,116
Yes, please.

194
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,118
Sitting would've been better for you.

195
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,955
I know. I wouldn't have drenched my pants.

196
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,872
You did?

197
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,666
-I drenched it entirely.
-I'm sorry.

198
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,460
No, I caused a scene with the water.

199
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,171
-Let me wash my hands.
-You're so thorough.

200
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,217
I can't believe
I'm helping an idol wash his face.

201
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,346
This is the best experience of my life.

202
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,430
The best?

203
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:22,061
I didn't have an opportunity
to talk to him this much before,

204
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,563
<i>so we didn't have much of a bond.</i>

205
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,565
<i>But I think being in prison</i>

206
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,275
has brought us closer.

207
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,443
-This was fun.
-It was.

208
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,153
-It was fun.
-It was fun being here with you.

209
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,781
As fellow inmates,
let's help each other now.

210
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,367
I had a great time here.

211
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,827
I was talking to Kyeong-rim

212
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,873
and she said female contestants
rarely win in survival shows.

213
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,667
So she told me, "I want you to win."

214
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,669
-That's amazing of her to say.
-Yeah.

215
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,589
I want you to help me achieve that goal.

216
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,923
-Of course.
-Yeah.

217
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,467
I feel like we're going to be
the underdogs again though.

218
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,219
-You're right.
-We can't break free

219
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,846
-from being the underdogs.
-Today's target is Seok-jin.

220
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,099
What makes you guys the underdogs?

221
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,853
Simply based on numbers,
my team yesterday was the underdogs.

222
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,438
<i>-Seriously.
-I get that.</i>

223
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,691
And it also depends
on how you define underdogs.

224
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,443
But ultimately,

225
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,486
those who have more Pieces
hold more power.

226
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,906
You should've used your Pieces
to bring people to your side.

227
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,908
But if I didn't have my Pieces yesterday

228
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,660
and didn't use the two during the game,
I would've gotten eliminated.

229
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,621
You wouldn't have been
in that situation to begin with.

230
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,331
-You think so?
-Had you had more allies that is.

231
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,957
-How many did you have?
-Four.

232
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,417
I had four.

233
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,087
You could've used some of them
to bring people to your side.

234
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,007
You don't necessarily have to
give them out as rewards per se.

235
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,259
You could've given them
to make people join you.

236
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,637
{\an8}For now,

237
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,642
{\an8}I think Seok-jin, Dong-jae, and I
will continue to be allies.

238
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,436
<i>But yesterday, it was eight against four</i>

239
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,274
and now it's eight against three,
even if Seok-jin stays with us.

240
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,820
I do think the female contestants
hold the casting votes right now,

241
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:59,408
<i>so we need to bring in
other players onto our side.</i>

242
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,870
I'm here to visit.

243
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,413
Where's Hye-sung?

244
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,250
Come in.

245
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,837
Let's work together.

246
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,341
Honestly, I don't think
there are a lot of players

247
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,512
who would sacrifice themselves
the way Dong-jae and I would.

248
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,556
I think the tides
are going to be against me.

249
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,933
-You think so?
-Yeah.

250
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,184
To be honest,

251
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,354
every single person here thinks

252
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,898
you and See-won's alliance
will remain strong until the end.

253
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,235
ORBIT keeps trying to help the underdogs.

254
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,947
-I think that needs to stop at some point.
-Well, about that...

255
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,409
I wasn't able to change his mind,
but I told him

256
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,619
we should reinforce
our four-person alliance

257
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,955
and let some players go when we have to.

258
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,998
I'd help people survive
if I could afford to.

259
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,291
But if we can't,

260
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,127
-let's just focus on us four.
-Okay.

261
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,128
That's what I think.

262
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,464
What we need to realize is that
since we helped others yesterday,

263
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,050
we don't have any enemies for now.

264
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,470
The reason we can afford to decide
who to bring to our side

265
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,597
is because our actions
on the first two days

266
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,599
-spoke for themselves.
-That's right.

267
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,936
I still stand by helping the underdogs
if and when possible.

268
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,523
And I won't hesitate
to sacrifice any of the three.

269
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,482
-Right.
-That's what I think.

270
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,402
Same here. I have no intention
of helping those three from yesterday.

271
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,611
I consider them our enemies.

272
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,030
-Which three?
-They're still the top dogs.

273
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,449
-Oh, those three.
-For me,

274
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,951
my goal today is to eliminate Seok-jin.

275
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,038
Why target Seok-jin out of the three?

276
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,331
He seems to be their best player.

277
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,127
<i>With him gone,
everything would be in our hands.</i>

278
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,671
He's a great strategist
but also keeps it discreet.

279
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,554
What do we do?

280
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,223
-Why? Is there a problem?
-I think they want to kill us.

281
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,808
-Kill who?
-Us.

282
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,809
-Us three?
-Yeah.

283
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,061
-Their plan
-Yeah?

284
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,647
is to help as many people survive
as possible.

285
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,316
That's the principle they uphold.

286
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,527
We could also be the people
they help survive, right?

287
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,821
-No, they have no reason to help us.
-We're the exception?

288
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,491
They already have their own alliance,

289
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,326
so they want us, the minority, to die.

290
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,162
If we can eliminate Seok-jin,

291
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,164
the four of us could go to the semifinals.

292
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,669
-True.
-Could you give us a moment?

293
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,588
-All right.
-Sorry.

294
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,260
-Those guys...
-They won't let me come in.

295
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,595
I know.

296
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,138
They won't let me come in.

297
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,140
-Who's there?
-ORBIT,

298
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,434
-Joon-bin, and Dong-joo.
-Joon-bin...

299
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,269
-I don't think Dong-joo will join us.
-She won't.

300
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,938
-Neither will Kyeong-rim.
-Really?

301
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,773
-Right now...
-It's just those two.

302
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,690
Right.

303
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,776
-You two should talk to them.
-To who?

304
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,694
-Hye-sung and...
-Okay.

305
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,196
-Hurry, before they go.
-Okay.

306
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,075
-Hi.
-Can I come in?

307
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,535
Yeah, sure.

308
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,245
-Okay.
-Have a seat.

309
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,496
-Okay.
-I'll be outside.

310
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,748
Hye-sung's getting ready.

311
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,667
I talked to See-won already.

312
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,960
What are you thinking?

313
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:56,877
I think...

314
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,671
I might die today.

315
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,005
Why?

316
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,423
The other alliance's stance is...

317
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,343
How pretty are you trying to get?

318
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,221
-Come in.
-Their stance is to kill the minority.

319
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,475
They don't want
the majority to get eliminated.

320
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,395
Don't try to create division.

321
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,230
We're already divided.

322
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,065
-Don't do that. Anything can happen.
-I shouldn't?

323
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,526
Once you do that, it'll stay like that.

324
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,735
I know, but...

325
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:27,116
The idea that it's me,
Dong-jae, and See-won

326
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,662
against the ORBIT-led group
shouldn't be reinforced.

327
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,833
Both of our groups
can easily collapse at any time.

328
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,211
<i>I think we need both groups
to be dissolved first.</i>

329
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,466
-Seok-jin.
-Hey.

330
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,303
I heard you're picky about
who you talk to.

331
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,637
-The rumors spread.
-Well...

332
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,014
-The rumors spread.
-Have a seat.

333
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,975
When I heard
you wouldn't talk to just anyone,

334
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,059
I thought maybe

335
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,313
Dong-jae was being too divisive.

336
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,107
I told him, "You could end up with them.
Anything could happen."

337
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,235
At the end of the day,
all 12 of us are playing for ourselves.

338
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,780
It would be crazy
if I solved this with a minute left to go.

339
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,325
It's way too hard.

340
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,577
We lacked wisdom.

341
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,455
Do we really need wisdom in prison?

342
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,710
Are you letting us out?

343
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,880
-Please let us free.
-He's here.

344
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,715
-Seungkwan and Yeon-woo,
-I missed you.

345
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,925
please return to the game area.

346
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,426
-I missed you.
-Amazing.

347
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,594
We're free!

348
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,679
Please come out.

349
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,181
This damn puzzle.

350
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,559
Why do you think
they didn't give out Pieces yesterday?

351
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,978
I think they're going to
eliminate a lot of players today.

352
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,271
What? Already?

353
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,399
<i>The main match will begin soon.</i>

354
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,027
<i>Please gather in the game area.</i>

355
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,112
Open up!

356
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,282
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

357
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,492
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

358
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,452
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

359
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,453
Hello.

360
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,497
-Hello.
-Hello.

361
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,456
We can do it.

362
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,540
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

363
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,458
Let's go!

364
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,418
Let's go!

365
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,003
Everyone, come here.

366
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,422
He's kneeling already.

367
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,884
Let's welcome them in a circle.

368
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,470
Oh, my.

369
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,265
Did you sleep well?

370
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,518
Well, you guys look good, don't you?

371
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,229
-Yeon-woo!
-What's going on?

372
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,480
-Well done.
-It wasn't too bad.

373
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,898
-Why is everyone glowing?
-You look fine.

374
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,983
Yeon-woo!

375
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,110
-Idols really are different.
-Seriously.

376
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,112
-What are you talking about?
-You look good.

377
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,488
Yeon-woo, how was it?

378
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,532
You know how it is.

379
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,992
-Did you talk a lot?
-We did.

380
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,159
That's all there is to do.

381
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,244
Really?

382
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,872
<i>The third main match
of</i> The Devil's Plan <i>will begin.</i>

383
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,626
<i>With Guillaume's elimination,</i>

384
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,379
<i>eleven players have survived.</i>

385
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,591
<i>Before we begin,</i>

386
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,761
{\an8}<i>here is the current Piece count
of each player.</i>

387
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,558
{\an8}<i>Currently, See-won, Dong-jae,</i>

388
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,186
{\an8}<i>and Seok-jin have the most Pieces.</i>

389
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,731
I guess no one gained any yesterday.

390
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,568
<i>Let me introduce the third main match.</i>

391
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,071
<i>Today's main match is Secret Number.</i>

392
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,157
-Number?
-It's numbers.

393
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,411
<i>In Secret Number,
players make contact with other players</i>

394
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,456
<i>to guess their own unique number.</i>

395
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,083
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

396
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,003
<i>players will enter
the dealer room one by one</i>

397
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:30,966
<i>and draw one card from a set of 100
that are marked from 1 to 100.</i>

398
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,135
<i>Their card will determine their number.</i>

399
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,015
<i>What number a player draws</i>

400
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,685
<i>will not be revealed to anyone,
including the player themselves.</i>

401
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,479
No way.

402
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,772
<i>Once the game begins,</i>

403
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,191
<i>players may gain clues about their number</i>

404
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,235
<i>by making contact with other players.</i>

405
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:56,033
<i>Players may make contact in the two
contact rooms in the game area.</i>

406
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,286
<i>Two players who wish to make contact</i>

407
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,830
<i>must each submit one ticket.</i>

408
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,292
<i>There are a total of four tickets,</i>

409
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,505
<i>including addition, multiplication,
division, and zero tickets.</i>

410
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,299
<i>Players obtain
different types of information</i>

411
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,550
<i>based on the ticket type.</i>

412
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,097
<i>The addition ticket reveals
the sum of the two numbers.</i>

413
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,100
<i>If the sum is larger than 180,</i>

414
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,520
<i>it will be displayed
as a range from 180 to 199.</i>

415
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,896
<i>If the sum is less than 20,</i>

416
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,524
<i>it will be displayed
as a range from 3 to 20.</i>

417
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,150
They're not going to
tell us the exact number?

418
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,195
<i>The multiplication ticket
reveals the last digit</i>

419
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,489
<i>of the product of the two numbers.</i>

420
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,075
Only the last digit? That's harsh.

421
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,619
<i>The division ticket reveals the quotient</i>

422
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,872
<i>of the larger number
divided by the smaller number.</i>

423
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,250
<i>The remainder will be omitted.</i>

424
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,501
So just the quotient.

425
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,253
Oh, so the remainder gets left out.

426
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,715
<i>The zero ticket
reveals the total number of zeroes</i>

427
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,759
<i>between the two numbers.</i>

428
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,136
I see.

429
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:01,181
<i>Once the game begins,
each player will receive</i>

430
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,309
<i>one set of the four tickets.</i>

431
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,770
<i>During the game,</i>

432
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,398
{\an8}<i>players may purchase
one set of tickets with one Piece.</i>

433
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>The game will last for 120 minutes.</i>

434
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,154
<i>Once the game ends,</i>

435
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,949
<i>players must guess their numbers
and submit an answer sheet.</i>

436
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,410
<i>If a player
guesses their number correctly,</i>

437
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,370
<i>they gain five points.</i>

438
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,373
<i>If they guess their number incorrectly,
they lose five points.</i>

439
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,833
You could get it wrong.

440
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,003
<i>Players may also guess
other players' numbers</i>

441
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,547
<i>and earn extra points.</i>

442
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,716
That's the important part.

443
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,343
<i>If they guess
other players' numbers correctly,</i>

444
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,388
<i>they earn one point
for each correct guess.</i>

445
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,223
What if you're wrong?

446
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,394
<i>If incorrect, players lose one point
for each incorrect guess.</i>

447
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,312
No way.

448
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,856
<i>Answers left blank</i>

449
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,357
<i>will not be penalized.</i>

450
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,985
It could be better to leave it blank.

451
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,238
<i>Players who correctly guess
every player's number</i>

452
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,324
<i>earn an additional five points.</i>

453
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,578
<i>Once all the answer sheets are submitted,</i>

454
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,706
<i>each player's points tally
will be calculated.</i>

455
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,502
<i>During this process, if a player's number
was guessed correctly by other players,</i>

456
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,340
<i>that player loses points equivalent
to the number of correct guesses.</i>

457
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,382
No way.

458
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,136
<i>In other words,
a player's final score is determined</i>

459
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,765
<i>by deducting the number of players
that correctly guessed their number</i>

460
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,808
<i>from the points they earned.</i>

461
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,227
Seriously?

462
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,855
<i>Players with a final score
of six or more will win one Piece.</i>

463
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,525
<i>A final score of eleven or more
will win two Pieces.</i>

464
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,654
<i>A final score of sixteen or more
will win three Pieces.</i>

465
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,659
<i>Players with a final score of four or less</i>

466
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,369
<i>will be penalized.</i>

467
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,331
<i>Players with a final score
of four or less will lose one Piece.</i>

468
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:53,543
<i>A final score of negative one or less
will lose two Pieces.</i>

469
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:59,174
<i>The player with the lowest final score
will lose three Pieces.</i>

470
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,676
Seriously?

471
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,010
Using Pieces is out of the question.

472
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,889
<i>If two or more players are tied
with the lowest final score,</i>

473
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,393
<i>the player with the highest final score
chooses one player.</i>

474
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,522
<i>If all players tie
with the same final score,</i>

475
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,108
<i>they must all pay one Piece each.</i>

476
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:21,530
<i>This main match
will also include prison bets.</i>

477
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,489
What?

478
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,074
<i>Players will make bets on</i>

479
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,827
{\an8}<i>the player that will most likely
end the main match</i>

480
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,620
{\an8}<i>with the lowest Piece count,</i>

481
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,333
{\an8}<i>therefore going to prison.</i>

482
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,585
{\an8}<i>Before the game begins,</i>

483
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,547
<i>make your bets on one player who you think</i>

484
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,756
<i>will go to prison.</i>

485
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,052
<i>The prison bet will not require
any Pieces to be paid.</i>

486
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,178
-Nice.
-That's good.

487
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,596
<i>A successful bet</i>

488
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,266
<i>will be rewarded with one Piece.</i>

489
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,183
Wow.

490
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,062
<i>The game will begin in 60 minutes.</i>

491
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,107
<i>Spend this time as you wish.</i>

492
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,901
This game involves elementary-level math

493
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:04,072
with a little bit of politics involved.

494
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,825
I need to find out others' numbers
without revealing mine.

495
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm not sure how to go about this game.
It's so difficult.

496
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,206
The more teammates you have,

497
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,126
the more you'll have to
expose your number.

498
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,170
You got the <i>Problematic Men</i>-look down.

499
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,213
He even has the glasses on.

500
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,883
Well, math is important today, so...

501
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,052
-You look like a young mathematician.
-I'm going to stick with him.

502
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,471
Our mathematicians will be key today.

503
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,514
-Right, Dong-joo majored in math.
-Right.

504
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,809
But the math isn't <i>that</i> complicated.

505
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,103
-If anything, politics is more important.
-Right.

506
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,813
Politics will be important here.

507
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,440
Thankfully,

508
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,693
alliances might not
matter much in this game.

509
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,030
<i>It's a relief
and possibly a chance for me.</i>

510
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,740
Are the rule books here?

511
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,533
-Yeah.
-They're here.

512
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,452
-Thank you.
-I'm going to study for now.

513
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,787
I need to study.

514
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,208
Today, we should...

515
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,543
-This was built for alliances.
-Really?

516
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,170
-This is a game of alliances.
-Really?

517
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,756
It is, but the alliance has to be small.

518
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,382
<i>This is a game of alliances</i>

519
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,968
that's favorable to someone
who has established trust with others.

520
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,262
If you guess your own number...

521
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,597
-It's five points.
-Right.

522
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,809
But you get six points if you guess yours
and someone else's.

523
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,853
If the four of us work together,
the most points we can get is...

524
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,524
I get five then three, so total of eight,

525
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,400
and back to five if you all guess mine.

526
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,363
<i>If players in a trustworthy alliance
gather information</i>

527
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,490
<i>and share numbers with each other,</i>

528
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,244
<i>each player earns five points
no matter the size of the alliance.</i>

529
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,121
<i>According to the rules,</i>

530
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,540
<i>if all players tie
with the same final score,</i>

531
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,251
<i>each player must pay one Piece.</i>

532
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:44,589
<i>In that case, four players will go home
after today's main match.</i>

533
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,510
Here's the thing.

534
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,762
If you guess yours, you get five points.

535
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,099
Ultimately, it's down to
who manages to hide their number

536
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,725
from as many people as possible.

537
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,103
So there's no need for us three
to be together.

538
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,688
-There really isn't.
-Right.

539
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,274
I'm planning on making contact

540
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,359
with like-minded people.

541
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,696
<i>And I'll try to
build trust with them if I can.</i>

542
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,698
-I'm coming in.
-Come in, Dong-jae.

543
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,200
This is really tough.

544
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,535
I wanted to win today.

545
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,537
How do I get 16 points or more?

546
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,831
-Exactly.
-You need to betray everyone.

547
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,749
-Then I'll get eliminated tomorrow.
-Right.

548
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,710
-Study the rules.
-I don't know how to win.

549
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,587
You can't use the tickets on one person.

550
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,255
It has to be different people?

551
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,215
No, you could use them on one person,

552
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,341
but you won't know your number.

553
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,135
-If you do that?
-Yeah.

554
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,929
-You won't know whose number is bigger.
-Right.

555
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,849
<i>Even if two players use all their tickets</i>

556
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,351
<i>to guess the two numbers,</i>

557
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:42,272
<i>they won't know which number</i>

558
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,191
<i>belongs to which player.</i>

559
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,445
To guess your number,
you need to gather everyone's information.

560
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,238
Once you find out

561
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,034
the number of the person next to you,
only then can you find out yours.

562
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,493
That's key.

563
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,788
To know yours,
you need to know the other person's.

564
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,709
-Right.
-That's the problem.

565
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,461
It's a matter of trust then.

566
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:08,340
<i>I can trust a lot of people
and a lot of them trust me,</i>

567
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,300
so I think I'm at a great advantage today.

568
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,095
I guess I really love food.

569
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,643
Going to prison makes you hungry.

570
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,200
Would Dong-jae trust us?

571
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,118
He's the one person you shouldn't trust.

572
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,037
-Okay.
-Dong-jae's out.

573
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,581
You, especially, can't trust him

574
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,875
because you'll get eliminated
if you don't get five points.

575
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,919
If you betray the players

576
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,337
with one piece each,

577
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,131
-they won't have to see them again.
-Right.

578
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,216
So they're easy to betray.

579
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,884
-You have to be careful.
-Okay.

580
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,262
-It's brutal.
-It is.

581
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,305
Can you betray the others?

582
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,600
I have to if I want to win.

583
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,019
We just need to betray one person.

584
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,813
-Then we get six points.
-Right.

585
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,897
That's a sure win.

586
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,233
It's a matter of getting one point.

587
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,150
You're right.

588
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,027
We need to take a point off of someone.

589
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,612
We can't do it to each other.

590
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,156
Who do we go for then?
Should I really go for Dong-jae?

591
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,703
-ORBIT.
-Yeah?

592
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,372
Can you make contact with us too?

593
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:27,168
I'll help you,
but I need to come up with a solution.

594
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,212
This is a matter of equations.

595
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,632
ORBIT and I talked about a lot of things

596
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,260
<i>during our conversation last night.</i>

597
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,805
So I would like to team up with him

598
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,057
and my roommate Yu-min.

599
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,643
You and Yu-min would have to tell me.

600
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,730
-Okay.
-And I'll talk to Joon-bin and...

601
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,357
What if someone gives
the wrong information?

602
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,067
They wouldn't do that. We're allies.

603
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,569
I guess that's true.

604
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,779
So there are six of us, right?

605
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,240
We'd have six people sharing information,

606
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,909
but the problem is the other alliance
has a lot of Pieces.

607
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:04,998
-That's true.
-Yeah, we'd have less information.

608
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,708
You're right.

609
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,460
How many people do you need?

610
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,503
Let me see.

611
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,093
STORAGE ROOM

612
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,137
What's your plan for today?

613
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,140
As you said,
I know alliances are important,

614
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,726
but I'm not sure who to go with.

615
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,064
{\an8}I don't trust
Dong-jae, See-won, and Seok-jin.

616
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,732
{\an8}I just don't.

617
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,484
{\an8}I know what you mean.

618
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,737
-Getting your own number is important.
-Right.

619
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,907
-But you can't let others guess yours.
-That's right.

620
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,286
Try to gather information from people

621
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,954
you've built trust with.

622
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:45,914
But don't expose yours.

623
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,376
Just act as a bridge of information
between people.

624
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,921
You really need to be political
to do well in this game.

625
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,967
-Have you worked anything out?
-Sorry?

626
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,135
Have you worked anything out?

627
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,471
I'm just going around

628
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,640
listening to what people say.

629
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,183
-You are?
-That's what I'm doing.

630
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,520
Are you good, Seungkwan?

631
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,771
-Yeah.
-The cellmates are here.

632
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,231
-Cellmates.
-That's true.

633
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,150
I found a way to guess the numbers.

634
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,528
-We're two pairs of roommates here.
-That's right.

635
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,822
We've got a pair of roommates.

636
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,782
-You're good at math.
-We're roommates.

637
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,866
-Each person...
-So to benefit us,

638
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,620
we need to use all of our tickets.

639
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,997
-We won't need to use Pieces.
-I know.

640
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,375
I'm a bit worried you're involved.

641
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,751
-Me? Why?
-Yeah.

642
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,504
-I think a new...
-You want a new team?

643
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,507
-Working with new people...
-Sounds better?

644
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,092
I think that would be better.

645
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,427
-For me...
-That's my stance.

646
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,928
I respect your opinion.

647
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,764
-We've been working together so much.
-Exactly.

648
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,016
-People think...
-People seem to think

649
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,310
-we're one.
-Exactly.

650
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,854
That's my stance for now.

651
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,564
-I will...
-I'll leave. Good luck.

652
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,441
-You can do it.
-You got this.

653
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,738
<i>I don't think the rules
benefit the other players that much.</i>

654
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,408
To break the other alliance,
I need to force my way in.

655
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,535
If we form a three-person alliance...

656
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,246
If we do form a three-person alliance,

657
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,748
we have to leave out
the people with one Piece.

658
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,833
Honestly, this is what I think.

659
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,712
I think the three of us plus one Piece

660
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,756
-will be enough for the game.
-Right.

661
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,550
I think having one Piece is enough.

662
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,597
Let's all pick our own numbers.

663
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
And run a simulation?

664
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,726
Why don't I pick three numbers
and you guys try calculating?

665
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,561
-You're not going to calculate?
-You pick three numbers.

666
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,854
One person has to decide.

667
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,397
One person is the dealer.

668
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,357
-I'm the worst at math anyway.
-Okay.

669
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,486
-How many Pieces do you have?
-One.

670
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,029
Right, both of you went to prison.

671
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,947
-We did.
-They're my prison juniors.

672
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,324
-They're my juniors.
-Senior!

673
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,408
-They're so good to me.
-You went through a lot.

674
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,993
You all only have a Piece each.

675
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,661
Yeah, just one each.

676
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,206
-Can you do something for me?
-Sure.

677
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,957
From one to nine,

678
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,459
-The chart?
-multiply all the numbers

679
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,836
and write down
the last digit of each product.

680
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,091
Isn't it this?

681
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,761
How did you know?

682
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,012
It has to be this.

683
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,931
How far did you get to solve it?

684
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,141
-I used these three cards.
-Just those?

685
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,935
Is that definite?

686
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,436
No, it's not.

687
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,774
First, it makes sense to use the addition
and multiplication tickets together.

688
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,902
Then use one more to calculate B and C
in order to get A, B, and C, right?

689
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,695
-Yeah, that's why...
-That's why it's three.

690
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,572
That's why we just need three people.

691
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,698
We just need three.

692
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,575
-And one Piece?
-One Piece.

693
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,036
-Then we can all get five points.
-Yeah.

694
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm worried about information leaking.

695
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,419
I just want the three of us
to progress to the next round.

696
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,337
-Really?
-Yeah.

697
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,338
Are you okay with that?

698
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,675
I want to make it up to everyone and
I've been wanting to work with Seungkwan.

699
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,677
We're in danger today.

700
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,388
From her perspective, she's taking us on

701
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,557
when she could work with others.

702
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,976
Yeon-woo, I'm sorry,
but you trust me, right?

703
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,769
-I have no choice but to trust you.
-Really?

704
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,688
You're all I have right now.

705
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,481
-We're desperate.
-I know.

706
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,941
-I know that.
-We are.

707
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,693
<i>The time has expired.</i>

708
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,361
<i>Please return to the main hall.</i>

709
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,698
Joon-bin.

710
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,700
I can't trust you.

711
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,577
-Me?
-Yeah.

712
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,828
Why? Everyone?

713
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,580
-Because...
<i>-First,</i>

714
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:17,750
<i>we will proceed with the prison bets
and then draw the numbers.</i>

715
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,337
<i>Starting with Joon-bin,
please enter the dealer room one by one.</i>

716
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,300
First, we will begin with the prison bet.

717
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,302
Please write their name here.

718
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,723
<i>I wanted to go to prison today,</i>

719
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,766
but I should choose someone
who won't do well.

720
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,352
LEE HYE-SUNG

721
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,062
Please draw your number.

722
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,609
You do the betting right away.

723
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,069
I know who I'm betting on.

724
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,237
Hye-sung.

725
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,782
{\an8}I'm betting on Hye-sung going to prison,

726
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,118
{\an8}-since everyone else has gone already.
-Okay.

727
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,786
-It's based on the odds.
-Right.

728
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,124
{\an8}HYE-SUNG, HYE-SUNG, LEE HYE-SUNG

729
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,461
<i>I'm going to bet on myself.</i>

730
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,212
If I don't go to prison, great.

731
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,964
If I go, I win the bet,
which is also great.

732
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,633
I'm betting on myself.

733
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,092
Hello.

734
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,011
<i>-Joon-bin.
-Joon-bin.</i>

735
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,679
<i>He's been wanting to go.</i>

736
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,223
I'm going to go to prison voluntarily.
I have to go today anyway.

737
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,808
{\an8}KWAK JOON-BIN, JOON-BIN, KWAK JOON-BIN

738
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,185
I think it'll be Dong-jae.

739
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,437
DONG-JAE, DONG-JAE

740
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,649
I don't think Seungkwan will go.

741
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,276
And I need Joon-bin to survive.

742
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,487
{\an8}SUH DONG-JOO

743
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,032
<i>Prison bets and number drawing
have been completed.</i>

744
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,204
{\an8}<i>A set of addition, multiplication,
division, and zero tickets</i>

Thank you.

747
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,961
If two players use this,
do they use one each?

748
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,588
Yeah, they use one each
and submit two tickets in total.

749
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,591
<i>Players who wish to purchase
additional tickets during the game</i>

750
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,636

751

<i>Answer sheets must be submitted

<i>The game will commence
for the next 120 minutes.</i>

753
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,481
Have you worked anything out?

754
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,358
I've talked to Yu-min.

755
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,528
-You have an agreement?
-We agreed to work together.

756
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,655
I haven't really talked to anyone else.

757
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,240
I see. Hye-sung.

758
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,950
Anyone would think that.

759
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,743
Personally,

760
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,204
I'm sure that for this game

761
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,373
a three-person alliance is a sure win.

762
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,624
-Three players?
-Yeah.

763
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,917
You figured it out?

764
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,377
I ran a simulation.

765
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,045
And it worked.

766
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,466
If an alliance has more than three people,

767
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,301
would that be a plus or a minus?

768
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,179
The more people are involved,
the more of a disadvantage it will be.

769
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,305
I say that because

770
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,433
one Piece has to be spent.

771
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,977
That's why you need me. Got it?

772
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,022
<i>I'm going to utilize Hye-sung and Yu-min
as much as I can.</i>

773
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,442
I don't think they will
consider me a threat.

774
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,651
-Joon-bin.
-Yeah?

775
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,403
Seungkwan went over there.

776
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,529
-Where?
-See-won's team.

777
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,406
-Really?
-Yeah.

778
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,658
He's with Yeon-woo and See-won.

779
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,118
I found a new group.

780
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,870
Who's in it?

781
00:33:58,953 --> 00:33:59,829
I can't tell you.

782
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,623
<i>I was going to team up with Joon-bin,</i>

783
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,792
but he's not someone
I can completely trust.

784
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,629
Are you working with anybody?

785
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,298
Just the usual.

786
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,549
How many people?

787
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,633
Our underdog alliance.

788
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,886
-Those who lack Pieces.
-Right.

789
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,179
I'm not in an alliance.

790
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,723
-Aren't you with Dong-jae and See-won?
-Not this time.

791
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,891
Really?

792
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,853
If a situation arises where we

793
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,022
both need to spend a Piece,
would you use yours?

794
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,858
Without Pieces...

795
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,151
{\an8}So you're with them?

796
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,320
{\an8}I'm trying, but...

797
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,696
{\an8}Try to make it happen.

798
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,822
{\an8}Make it happen?

799
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,164
I have a good idea.

800
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,708
You, ORBIT, and I should team up.

801
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:50,588
Seungkwan will give us
Yeon-woo and See-won's numbers.

802
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,673
Then we give our numbers to Seungkwan.

803
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,677
I guarantee you that
Dong-jae is doing the same thing.

804
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,429
<i>That's why he tried to recruit me.</i>

805
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,348
This would get us more than five points.

806
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,392
Will Seungkwan be able to do it?
He had a hard time yesterday.

807
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,686
I'll talk to him and check.

808
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,896
STORAGE ROOM

809
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,067
-We were talking about you.
-But can I really...

810
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,069
-Let me close the door.
-Can I do this?

811
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,321
You can't be on the fence.

812
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,698
-Your role is crucial.
-I know. It's crazy.

813
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,866
What's Seungkwan's plan?

814
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,159
-Who?
-Seungkwan?

815
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,869
I think he's weighing his options.

816
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,123
Right. It seems like
See-won is putting everything on the line.

817
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,542
-Right?
-From her perspective,

818
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,294
<i>we don't have Pieces
so it's not favorable for her,</i>

819
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,255
<i>but she still wanted to team up.</i>

820
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,256
I'm not sure yet.

821
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,222
We're good to go, as per our calculation.

822
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,850
It might not seem like it,
but this is the real alliance.

823
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,935
Dong-jae, Seok-jin, and See-won.

824
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,229
<i>They're looking for someone to sacrifice.</i>

825
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,064
<i>-We need to do the same.
-Right.</i>

826
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,400
-Let's try to cut these people off.
-Okay.

827
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,361
-For this strategy, Seungkwan is key.
-Okay.

828
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,907
-You're not working with me.
-What?

829
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,075
You're not working with me.

830
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,160
You don't want to?

831
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,870
You were already looking elsewhere.

832
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,455
I already found my alliance.
Who do you have?

833
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,874
That's a secret.

834
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,250
Does it have to be a secret?

835
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,002
-You kept yours a secret.
-It wasn't a secret.

836
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,838
When I asked who you were with,
you said it was a secret.

837
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,506
-Come on, that's not what I meant.
-To be honest,

838
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,258
I'm the journalist.

839
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,342
Really?

840
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:20,970
You are?

841
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,931
Kyeong-rim,

842
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,434
Dong-jae, See-won, and Seok-jin

843
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,352
have all split up, right?

844
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,646
But did they really?

845
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,940
-They didn't.
-Exactly.

846
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,109
They're gathering information
from different sources.

847
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,570
They're trying to make
one of their members the winner

848
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,072
so they can share
the three Pieces amongst themselves.

849
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,075
<i>Because Dong-joo and I are roommates,</i>

850
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,997
I want to help her as much as I can.

851
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,124
Yeon-woo, what's your plan?

852
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,251
-She's with See-won.
-But...

853
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,712
You don't trust her completely, do you?

854
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,297
-It's just an agreement.
-See-won said

855
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,634
she'd take care of you because
she wanted to make up for her actions.

856
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,844
-But that's...
-Dong-jae and See-won are together.

857
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,222
-Right.
-I'm worried about that.

858
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,974
There's a big chance you might be used.

859
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:11,812
I did see Dong-jae reject See-won.

860
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,772
That's just for show.

861
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,316
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

862
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,026
On the first day,

863
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,736
<i>I felt so bad for Dong-jae.</i>

864
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,739
<i>I accused him of being a terrorist.</i>

865
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,200
<i>Turns out, he was the fanatic
who teamed up with the terrorists.</i>

866
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,912
By that logic,
you can't trust anyone here then.

867
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,580
Where did my card go?

868
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,127
-See?
-What?

869
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,425
-Have you decided?
-They want to know what your plan is.

870
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,969
They want to know who your target is.

871
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,512
Tell them that the three of us

872
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,347
are trying to get five points.

873
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,557
Who are we really betraying?

874
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,518
-I'll tell you what's going on.
-Okay.

875
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,978
Right now, See-won,

876
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,438
Seok-jin, and Dong-jae
are gathering information

877
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,816
and aiming for first place.

878
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,526
-They're allied?
-Yeah.

879
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,819
They're not.

880
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,445
Has See-won gotten into your head?

881
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,741
See-won won't even look at Dong-jae
when he enters the room.

882
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,703
What else would she do? You're too naive.

883
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,538
-Have I got it wrong?
-Yeah.

884
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,539
You might not know but...

885
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,915
You can be betrayed

886
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,458
five seconds before the end of this game.

887
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,712
Those three
got destroyed yesterday, right?

888
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,463
They're raging inside right now.

889
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,384
-So figure out those two's numbers
-Okay.

890
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,761
-and write them here.
-Okay.

891
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,596
What?

892
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,764
-Is it because I sent you to prison?
-I'm sorry.

893
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,225
-We're planning on how to destroy you.
-Go ahead.

894
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,519
-Please send me to prison.
-I'm sorry.

895
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,770
Goodness.

896
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,816
Aren't you too relaxed?

897
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,861
There's nothing I can do.

898
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,195
Hye-sung and...

899
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,239
Dong-jae is trying to convince Yu-min.

900
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,782
I'm so curious.

901
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,868
Can Dong-jae actually convince them?

902
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,119
They'd be fools to be convinced.

903
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,163
Just trust me this one time.

904
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,497
I can do well.

905
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,833
All right then.

906
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:00,004
What final score are you aiming for?

907
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,756
For now, above five.

908
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,507
But within our group,

909
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,926
we can't get more than five points.

910
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,345
-Is that possible?
-Well...

911
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,013
If the three of us team up,

912
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,723
-could we have different scores?
-What I mean is...

913
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,767
For you to get six or seven points,

914
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,311
you'd need to give
those people information.

915
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,313
I'll figure out how to avoid that.

916
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,774
How can you get their information

917
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,233
without disclosing ours?

918
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,818
I have a different option.

919
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,863
I'm sorry
but I've been watching you three,

920
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,324
and it's like a church member
talking to two non-members,

921
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,493
-teaching them about faith.
-That's true.

922
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,161
-It's like I'm preaching.
-In that case,

923
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,789
-Yeah?
-since you're Catholic, swear an oath.

924
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,540
-All of a sudden?
-Swear you won't betray us.

925
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,793
-That took a turn.
-Let's go do it right now.

926
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,628
-Go swear an oath.
-Let's go. Where do I go?

927
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,046
Michael!

928
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,382
My goodness.

929
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,966
-Dear lord...
-Don't you do this stuff?

930
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,259
The sign of the cross?

931
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,427
Yeah.

932
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,595
Heavenly Father.

933
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,056
Amen.

934
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,103
Dear lord, I stand before you
to make a promise.

935
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,773
I will not betray Hye-sung and Yu-min.

936
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:05,111
-Amen.
-That was moving.

937
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,571
Michael, I'll trust you.

938
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,864
-All right.
-I shall trust you.

939
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,408
-Thank you.
-This is great.

940
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,660
-I trust you completely.
-That's all it took?

941
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,538
-Looking at the current situation,
-Yeah?

942
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,624
I think everyone's trying to use us.

943
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,127
{\an8}They keep saying See-won

944
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,629
will end up using us and betraying us.

945
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,967
I don't know about anybody else,
but I don't think she would betray us.

946
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,635
-You have that feeling?
-Well...

947
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,720
We have to trust our guts on this one.

948
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,809
-Which side are you on?
-Right now,

949
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,144
-You're unsure?
-I'm conflicted.

950
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,854
I'm so conflicted.

951
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,397
What happened to me?

952
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,190
How did I end up like this?

953
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,697
What significance does
making the sign of the cross have

954
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,283
to someone who is religious?

955
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,994
Hye-sung, I even have
a tattoo on my finger.

956
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,955
-I'm Catholic to my bones.
-Michael is the name of an angel, right?

957
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,206
Yeah, he's an archangel.

958
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,500
-Maybe that's why they cast you.
-He's not an ordinary angel.

959
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,710
You're an angel.

960
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,044
That makes sense.

961
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,921
I just realized that I'm an angel.

962
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,631
Which part of you?

963
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,467
-He's Michael.
-I'm Michael.

964
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,676
-Really? Not Beelzebub?
-Yeah.

965
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,219
I'm named after an archangel.

966
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,263
Joon-bin, who are you with?

967
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,264
I'm with ORBIT.

968
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,099
-ORBIT and Dong-joo?
-Yeah.

969
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,476
Which two are left out?

970
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,560
Who's leaving them out?

971
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,687
There are three groups of three,
so it's Seok-jin and someone.

972
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,481
It's Seok-jin and Kyeong-rim

973
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,024
who are left.

974
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,529
I'm lonely.

975
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,578
It's so strange to me

976
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,247
that -Seok-jin is left out.
-Look at it this way.

977
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,665
-Without any plan at that.
-Would he be so relaxed

978
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,917
if he really was in danger?

979
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,168
Help me.

980
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,836
Me? First...

981
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,213
-Seok-jin.
-What's your plan?

982
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,173
-Seok-jin.
-Kyeong-rim and I have no team.

983
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,382
You don't?

984
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,427
I'll figure out Yeon-woo and See-won's...

985
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,472
-I'll figure out their numbers.
-Okay.

986
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,142
Bring two numbers
and your number will go to two people,

987
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,477
Seok-jin and Dong-jae.

988
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:07,316
It's just an assumption that my number
will go to Seok-jin and Dong-jae, right?

989
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,776
There's no way it won't.

990
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,654
Why would Dong-jae suddenly
team up with Hye-sung and Yu-min?

991
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,448
-Maybe he's trying to play it safe.
-If that were the case,

992
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,201
he could've just teamed up
with See-won and Seok-jin.

993
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,537
Maybe they just failed to team up today.

994
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,373
-I think you're underestimating them.
-Am I being...

995
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,290
Really?

996
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,542
Betrayal is guaranteed.

997
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,714
With three people,
you don't need to spend a Piece

998
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,132
to figure out the numbers.

999
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,551
We don't know which number
belongs to who though.

1000
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,804
You're right.

1001
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,223
We need to spend a Piece to find that out.

1002
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,351
<i>While figuring out
how I was going to survive,</i>

1003
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,521
I saw See-won struggling with math.

1004
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,774
What do you think is the best option?

1005
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,860
I don't have a proper team right now,

1006
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,779
so I didn't even start strategizing yet.

1007
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,699
The remaining two members
were Yeon-woo and Seungkwan,

1008
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,702
<i>so I casually asked if I could join them.</i>

1009
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,828
Should we work together?

1010
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,830
What about Seungkwan? Who is he joining?

1011
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,373
I'll tell Yeon-woo

1012
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:09,086
that I'll think about it to the end
and make a decision.

1013
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,588
Yeon-woo is with See-won.

1014
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,214
Here's the thing.

1015
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,425
It's fine that you want to
help Yeon-woo, but...

1016
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,635
-Your number...
-I'd tell her...

1017
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,305
What if she exposes it to someone else?

1018
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,641
I know Yeon-woo's on my side.

1019
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,686
-Should we work together?
-What about Seungkwan? Who is he joining?

1020
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,480
-He's contemplating.
-He is?

1021
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,234
-It's us three then.
-Let's do it.

1022
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,111
-Yeon-woo is trustworthy.
-Let's do it.

1023
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,613
So it's us three.

1024
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,865
-Let's aim for five points to start.
-Okay.

1025
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,951
-We'll think about the rest later.
-Okay.

1026
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,870
-The two of us should go first.
-Okay.

1027
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,123
Yeon-woo.

1028
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,751
They're going in.

1029
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,502
Are you doing something?

1030
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,587
Yeah. Those two are.

1031
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,173
-Oh, those two?
-Yeah.

1032
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,594
This will take some time.

1033
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,387
-In the end, they're together.
-Right.

1034
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,347
Yeon-woo.

1035
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,770
Honestly, you don't really trust
See-won that much, do you?

1036
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,271
Please submit your tickets.

1037
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,023
We would like to know the sum.

1038
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,025
You submitted your addition tickets.

1039
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,611
Joon-bin, Dong-joo, and ORBIT

1040
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,030
-are strong alliances.
-They are.

1041
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:22,785
Did you agree to accept and join
Dong-joo and ORBIT's alliance?

1042
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,244
-I haven't said anything yet.
-You didn't?

1043
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,954
Please view the result.

1044
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,920
Thank you.

1045
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,429
Did you get it?

1046
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,099
Let's put our thinking caps on.

1047
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,937
{\an8}Seven and nine.

1048
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,271
{\an8}-Nine and seven.
-Right.

1049
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,606
{\an8}-Eight and eight. Okay, done.
-Okay.

1050
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,067
{\an8}By multiplying within this range,
we can find our numbers.

1051
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:55,984
{\an8}-Right.
-Let's go.

1052
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,319
Should we go in here?

1053
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,570
Sure, I'm curious.

1054
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,697
Are you not going in?

1055
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,241
Did they already go in?

1056
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,283
Why just the two?

1057
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,453
They teamed up
and they're checking their numbers.

1058
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,038
-Since when?
-Just a moment ago.

1059
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,706
What?

1060
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,749
Did you just stand by and watch?

1061
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,210
-Wait. Come here.
-What's going on?

1062
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,504
Seok-jin and See-won keep going in there.

1063
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,047
-It's their second time.
-You were betrayed.

1064
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,425
See-won and Seok-jin went in there twice.

1065
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,972
Please view the result.

1066
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,565
<i>See-won and Seok-jin's numbers
add up to 66.</i>

1067
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,484
<i>Of the combinations
that lead to a last digit of six,</i>

1068
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,780
<i>only nine and seven lead to a product
that ends with a three.</i>

1069
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:46,452
<i>However, it is still unclear
which number belongs to whom.</i>

1070
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,580
Did See-won not ask you to join them?

1071
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,957
-She did ask.
-Okay.

1072
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,709
But Seok-jin came in and...

1073
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,335
-It became unclear?
-Yeah.

1074
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,713
-Anyways, I was with them,
-You were with them?

1075
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,506
but you weren't there.

1076
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,841
So it's you three now?

1077
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,551
-I think it's us three.
-Right.

1078
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,012
-So you three?
-It feels like it.

1079
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,263
Without me.

1080
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,681
-Right.
-So...

1081
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,849
I should...

1082
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,851
Knock knock.

1083
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,645
Can I not go in?

1084
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,772
-Why?
-For now...

1085
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,107
We'll just have Yeon-woo.

1086
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,026
-I'm sorry.
-Come back later.

1087
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,487
I promise I'll...

1088
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,615
-I guess I wasn't here when I had to be.
-Just come back later.

1089
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:25,699
-I'll try to help you.
-Okay.

1090
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,412
This is interesting.

1091
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,748
We've hit a wall with what we have.

1092
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,126
Then I'll spend a Piece
and find the sum with her.

1093
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,673
I would like to purchase
one set of tickets.

1094
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,925
Here is your set of tickets.

1095
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,551
Thank you.

1096
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,345
Please view the result.

1097
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:53,685
<i>Based on previous calculations,
it can be concluded that the last digit</i>

1098
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,189
<i>of See-won and Yeon-woo's numbers
are nine and four.</i>

1099
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,443
<i>As See-won and Seok-jin's last digits
are nine and seven,</i>

1100
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,863
<i>it can be concluded that
these are the three players' last digits.</i>

1101
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:09,243
<i>Based on the sums derived from
the addition tickets,</i>

1102
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,496
<i>there are six possible combinations.</i>

1103
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,041
-That's right.
-Yeah.

1104
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,459
-In this case,
-For now...

1105
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,585
-I can't help.
-No.

1106
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,128
-It can be the four of us.
-Wait, Seungkwan.

1107
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,046
-Seungkwan.
-It's okay.

1108
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,632
-This could be better.
-You know what I did for an hour?

1109
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,133
-I devised a strategy for four.
-It's okay.

1110
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,720
<i>For two players
to figure out their numbers,</i>

1111
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,430
<i>four contacts are necessary.</i>

1112
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:34,810
<i>If lucky, only three attempts
may be necessary.</i>

1113
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,688
<i>If they can figure out two numbers</i>

1114
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,190
<i>while sparing
at least one pair of tickets,</i>

1115
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,860
<i>the remaining tickets can be used to make
contact with each member of each group</i>

1116
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:49,074
<i>and ultimately help deduce
all four numbers without spending a Piece.</i>

1117
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,827
<i>If they get lucky, that is.</i>

1118
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,537
We'll use three tickets first.

1119
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,163
-Four if necessary.
-Okay.

1120
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,041
-Maybe we kept him too long.
-You did good, Seungkwan.

1121
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,919
Joon-bin, you're being too obvious.

1122
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,754
You think you're a pro, don't you?

1123
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,548
He's getting scolded.

1124
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,094
Wouldn't it be better if we went first?

1125
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,554
-We should use our tickets.
-Us two?

1126
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,139
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1127
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,099
-Let's go now.
-Okay.

1128
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,020
Here's what we'll do.

1129
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:21,273
Yu-min and I will go to the contact room

1130
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,567
and come back and figure out our numbers.

1131
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,235
-We'll use four...
-Can you go with me?

1132
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,528
-With you?
-Yeah.

1133
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,572
Just go with me.

1134
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,825
We'll try to calculate ours first.

1135
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:35,495
-Why?
-Does it matter who goes first?

1136
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,913
-The thing is...
-Does it?

1137
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,707
I want to figure mine out quickly.

1138
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,750
Why?

1139
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,377
I have a feeling I might be left out

1140
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,296
if I don't go with one of you.

1141
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,672
Then why don't you and...

1142
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,550
I'm uneasy because there's two of you

1143
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,593
and then there's me.

1144
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,053
-Okay, I understand.
-But I...

1145
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,722
-You two go then.
-Which tickets do we use then?

1146
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,641
Goodness.

1147
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,143
If you betray us, I'm going to kill you.

1148
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,436
Go ahead.

1149
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,688
-I'm not kidding.
-Go ahead. Seriously.

1150
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,565
-I'll kill you Dong-jae.
-Kill me.

1151
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,983
Okay.

1152
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,151
Will you make contact?

1153
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,110
-Yes.
-Yes.

1154
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,362
Please submit your tickets.

1155
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,571
Let's do addition first.

1156
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,283
{\an8}We'll go by alpha and omega.

1157
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,160
{\an8}That's a big number.

1158
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,039
{\an8}No, that's confusing.
I'll just use our names.

1159
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,207
{\an8}Okay.

1160
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,459
Wait a minute.

1161
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,002
-138.
-Okay.

1162
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,754
Wow!

1163
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,883
{\an8}All right. Time to calculate.

1164
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,510
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1165
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,553
-There are only these two.
-The three...

1166
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,889
Hello, sorry for barging in.

1167
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,974
-Come back later.
-Can't I go in now?

1168
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,018
-You can't.
-Just talk from there.

1169
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,396
It's a bit hard to say in words.

1170
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,065
-Then just don't say anything.
-Could you wait a bit?

1171
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,441
-We're still...
-We're calculating.

1172
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,276
-Okay, sorry.
-We're still calculating.

1173
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,487
-Let's figure out ours.
-Did you see that?

1174
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,572
-What?
-They won't even let me in.

1175
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,576
Do you really have to
keep working with See-won?

1176
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,287
-Sorry?
-Do you want to team up with See-won?

1177
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,623
I could switch over today if I wanted to.

1178
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,292
That's what I'm saying.

1179
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,794
Why not just work with us going forward?

1180
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,170
I know.

1181
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,964
For this game,

1182
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,340
-I agreed to work with you two.
-Right.

1183
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,466
-So I'll keep my promise.
-Right.

1184
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,719
-That hasn't changed.
-Okay.

1185
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,138
Let's figure this out then.
What did you get?

1186
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,973
When Hye-sung and I made contact...

1187
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,141
Yeah?

1188
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,977
I don't know
if I should share this information.

1189
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,894
With me?

1190
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,772
With everyone. I don't know
if I should just give the results.

1191
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,233
-No, we need to know everything.
-Okay.

1192
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,153
I'm going to trust you.

1193
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,989
-I really am.
-That's the only way.

1194
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,073
You're right.

1195
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:36,658
Don't show this to anyone.

1196
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,743
Okay.

1197
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,454
-It's one?
-Yeah.

1198
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,080
If you divide by one,
there are three possible outcomes.

1199
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,040
They're similar numbers then.

1200
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,960
It just means the difference is under 40.

1201
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,963
We can't figure anything out
based on this.

1202
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,507
I'm having a mental breakdown.

1203
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,051
Yu-min, where are you going?

1204
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,970
We're going to make contact.

1205
00:50:59,014 --> 00:50:59,890
You are?

1206
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,349
Can I purchase tickets?

1207
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,018
-You can. Please close the door.
-Okay.

1208
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,063
-Would you like to purchase tickets?
-Yes.

1209
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,732
Please pay one Piece.

1210
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,983
Did you figure it out?

1211
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,902
No, I haven't narrowed it down yet.

1212
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,987
Hye-sung, I got it.

1213
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,614
I can't figure this out.

1214
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,741
It makes sense that you can't.

1215
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,743
You went wrong here.

1216
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,912
Why? Tell me what went wrong.

1217
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:26,458
{\an8}Dong-jae, 94 plus 64 isn't 138.

1218
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,960
-Wait.
-What is this?

1219
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,004
-Did you see it wrong?
-I...

1220
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,255
-I...
-Are you sure?

1221
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,591
-Hang on. Let me calculate.
-Did we see it wrong?

1222
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,760
How could both of you see it wrong?

1223
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,471
-They disappeared too quickly.
-Hey.

1224
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:43,225
I don't see why he would
team up with you two out of the blue.

1225
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,311
-We'll use four...
-Can you go with me?

1226
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,230
I want to figure mine out quickly.

1227
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,189
Why?

1228
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,901
I don't know
if I should share this information.

1229
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:53,819
With me?

1230
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,448
So what's wrong with the equation?

1231
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,951
Was it 158?

1232
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,410
Hey.

1233
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,662
Are you crazy?

1234
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,413
How could you two not remember?

1235
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,499
Well, I...

1236
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,669
I thought the numbers
would stay on the screen.

1237
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,796
They disappeared quickly.

1238
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,840
Wait a minute.

1239
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,341
-138.
-Okay.

1240
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,343
Was this not it?

1241
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,303
It might've been 158.

1242
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,139
-That's why the calculation isn't working.
-You guys.

1243
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,934
-How could it go from this to this?
-You're right.

1244
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:28,144
Wait, this is crazy.

1245
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,313
Here's my division ticket.

1246
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,565
You two go use this.

1247
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,984
Dong-jae, it's not this number.

1248
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,528
-The calculation doesn't work.
-Okay, I get it.

1249
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,030
-So you two go and confirm it.
-Okay.

1250
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,825
-Please view the result.
-This doesn't make sense.

1251
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,202
{\an8}It doesn't make sense.

1252
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,622
-Dong-jae.
-No, I...

1253
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,125
If we need to,
let's purchase an addition ticket.

1254
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,460
I might have made a mistake.

1255
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,129
I'll try again. I'm sorry.

1256
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,590
-What did I miss?
-Darn it, this...

1257
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,765
Your equation was right.

1258
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,976
-Hye-sung, your equation was right.
-What?

1259
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,853
-You were right.
-So why was there an error?

1260
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:10,896
There wasn't.

1261
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:11,980
So mine is...

1262
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,607
Yours is 84.

1263
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,192
-I see.
-Got it?

1264
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,527
I feel so stupid.

1265
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,446
-Okay.
-I feel so stupid.

1266
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,281
What should I do? I have four tickets.

1267
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,824
I don't have any.

1268
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,409
-Right. He has four.
-Right.

1269
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,702
You were going to work with him, right?

1270
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,787
Once we figure out ours,

1271
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,372
-someone will go with you
-So right now...

1272
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,666
and help you solve your number.

1273
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,003
How do I figure out my number?
I haven't made contact yet.

1274
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,756
-We have spare tickets.
-You go with that.

1275
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,049
-You have spare tickets?
-Go with me or ORBIT.

1276
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,217
We're figuring out
how to use fewer tickets.

1277
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,969
-We're trying to use fewer tickets.
-We want spares.

1278
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,096
-If necessary, we can spend Pieces.
-Right.

1279
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,514
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

1280
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,183
-It's nine, seven, and four.
-It is.

1281
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,936
-So it's nine, seven, and four.
-We're sure of that.

1282
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,063
The division ticket
could help us get the exact number.

1283
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,022
-Really?
-Yeah.

1284
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,695
-Will you make contact?
-Yes.

1285
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:01,863
Please.

1286
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,953
Don't tell me yet.

1287
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:08,870
It wasn't one, right?

1288
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:09,996
It is.

1289
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,248
Why?

1290
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,541
Why?

1291
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,543
-If we divide...
-Then there are three possible outcomes.

1292
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:19,130
<i>See-won and Yeon-woo's quotient is one.</i>

1293
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,968
<i>As such, the outcomes with quotients
higher than two are invalid,</i>

1294
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,261
<i>leaving three possible outcomes.</i>

1295
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,847
What do we divide to narrow it down?

1296
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,516
If we divide our numbers,

1297
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,269
we'll get either one, two, or eight.

1298
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,562
One, two, or eight.

1299
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,481
-Then we're done.
-Let's go.

1300
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,944
-Keep this safe for us.
-Okay.

1301
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,614
After this,

1302
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,200
-let's review.
-Let's just review.

1303
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,118
That's important.

1304
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,538
{\an8}Please view the result.

1305
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,207
{\an8}Okay.

1306
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,087
Let me use the bathroom.

1307
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,338
Okay.

1308
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,978
It's impossible because there are
two unknown numbers.

1309
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,564
We've hit a wall right now.

1310
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,525
We need the sum and quotient
to figure ours out.

1311
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,735
You two go first.

1312
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,319
I'll figure out Joon-bin's.

1313
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,239
We do need an addition ticket.

1314
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,950
-One additional ticket?
-We need the sum and quotient,

1315
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,910
but Kyeong-rim
doesn't have the tickets for that.

1316
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,120
I have all four.

1317
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,621
-But we don't.
-Right.

1318
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,623
-We need to spend a Piece.
-We need to spend a Piece.

1319
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,126
<i>Unfortunately,
ORBIT's four-person strategy</i>

1320
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,378
<i>could not leave spare tickets.</i>

1321
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,214
<i>After confirming
Joon-bin and Seungkwan's numbers</i>

1322
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,301
<i>by using multiplication tickets,</i>

1323
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:49,345
<i>the team can purchase
a set of tickets with one Piece.</i>

1324
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,682
<i>And then they can confirm
the four players' numbers</i>

1325
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,517
<i>by using Kyeong-rim's tickets.</i>

1326
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:59,355
<i>Lastly, Kyeong-rim's number
can be confirmed with an addition ticket.</i>

1327
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,899
If we know our last digits,

1328
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,401
a multiplication ticket each
confirms our numbers.

1329
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,944
With her addition ticket,

1330
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,072
she can confirm her number.

1331
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,157
-Okay?
-Got it.

1332
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,575
I feel reassured.

1333
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,286
How's it going?

1334
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,829
I heard you abandoned him.

1335
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,164
I didn't.

1336
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,793
Our goal is simply to survive,

1337
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,420
so if possible, I'll help you
figure out your number.

1338
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,173
I'll help you figure yours out.

1339
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:29,052
You can't give me
all of your information, can you?

1340
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,095
-Right.
-It would be risky.

1341
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,931
-The rest...
-I haven't gained your trust either.

1342
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,683
It's fine. Don't feel guilty.

1343
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,893
It's fine.

1344
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,230
Let's go.

1345
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,732
-I see a chance.
-Sorry?

1346
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,067
-There's a chance.
-Yeah.

1347
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,193
She seemed so sincere about it though.

1348
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,737
-I get where you were coming from now.
-Exactly.

1349
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,531
We'll use our multiplication tickets.

1350
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,241
Come on.

1351
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,827
The look on her face...

1352
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,829
If that was an act...
Wait, she's an actress.

1353
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,999
I can't trust Seok-jin at all.

1354
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,001
I don't trust him.

1355
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,253
We need to spend a Piece.

1356
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,004
-We need a Piece.
-Okay.

1357
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,589
Let's do this then.

1358
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,217
Let's use my Piece.

1359
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,970
In exchange, my number
won't be shared in negotiations.

1360
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,013
-The person with one...
-We won't negotiate.

1361
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,431
-We're not negotiating.
-Yeah.

1362
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,767
We still need to purchase tickets.

1363
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,768
Go do that.

1364
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,019
-I'll go.
-Okay.

1365
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,604
-I'll repay you.
-Sorry?

1366
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,064
-I'll repay you.
-It's fine.

1367
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:26,151
Figuring this out
is a lot easier than expected.

1368
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,904
We're just trying to do our best here

1369
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,365
and we've gained other people's trust.

1370
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,702
If it works, it works.
If not, that's fine too.

1371
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,245
You're right.

1372
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,830
-Are we sharing everything?
-Yeah.

1373
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,623
-Seok-jin is seven.
-Yeah.

1374
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,958
Mine is 59.

1375
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,544
-Yours is 34.
-Okay.

1376
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,463
Don't write it down. Memorize it.

1377
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,173
I'll put this in my pocket.

1378
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,632
-All right.
-Okay.

1379
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,761
-So no one can see.
-Let's gather up our trash.

1380
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,763
So what's next?

1381
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,600
I'm thinking of giving Seungkwan
my ticket.

1382
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,393
-You're just going to give it?
-Yeah.

1383
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,394
Let's go together.

1384
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,687
-One second.
-Just give him the ticket.

1385
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,781
What's wrong?

1386
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,241
They're not going to fight, are they?

1387
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,619
-Just get Seungkwan for me.
-All right.

1388
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,037
-I'll talk to him out in the open.
-Okay.

1389
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,586
Welcome.

1390
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,129
Do you have spare tickets?

1391
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,464
Please give us some.

1392
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,091
How many of you are here?

1393
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,719
-What do you mean?
-Well, we're just here.

1394
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,845
We're just working.

1395
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:39,224
Maybe we weren't
meant to work together, Seok-jin.

1396
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,476
Do you know your number?

1397
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,769
-Of course not.
-No.

1398
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,230
Why didn't anyone take care of him?

1399
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,398
I mean I don't know mine either.

1400
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,442
Why did you abandon him?

1401
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,196
Seungkwan, I feel bad
so I'll give you my ticket.

1402
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,489
What?

1403
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,574
I said I'd take care of you

1404
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,410
but the situation was too urgent.

1405
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,621
See-won, it's all right.

1406
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,123
Are we going to apologize for everything?

1407
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,835
-I failed to take responsibility.
-Honestly, I was confused.

1408
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,838
-Anyways, I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

1409
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,091
This ticket should help you.

1410
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,885
-Take it.
-Seungkwan, just take it.

1411
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,763
Yeon-woo, can I just say one thing?

1412
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,181
-Please win.
-Okay.

1413
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,560
-Let's survive. You're right.
-You're in good hands with those two.

1414
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,436
Why were they in that room?

1415
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,564
-Why were you there?
-What?

1416
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,815
Were you fighting?

1417
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,025
-No.
-I killed all of them.

1418
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,986
-You got yours?
-I did.

1419
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,279
-Seok-jin.
-Yeah?

1420
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,830
Joon-bin, here is your answer sheet.

1421
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,046
There's nothing I can do about that.

1422
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,047
See-won, come here.

1423
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,399
You got this.

1424
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,612
This is complicated.

1425
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,073
Joon-bin, your notepad was facing...
Is this yours?

1426
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:23,244
Here are your answer sheets.
You have twenty minutes remaining.

1427
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,162
-Is this yours?
-Yeah.

1428
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,205
I covered it
because people were coming in.

1429
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,123
Why?

1430
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,709
To check in on us.
They kept asking us stuff.

1431
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,961
-Apparently, they know their numbers.
-Dong-joo.

1432
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,339
-Seungkwan.
-Yes.

1433
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,299
I just saw everything.

1434
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,051
It's just as I thought.

1435
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,011
While pretending to check in on us,

1436
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,805
Dong-jae and Seok-jin just made contact.

1437
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,974
They told each other the numbers already.

1438
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,477
Okay, I'll tell them.

1439
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,687
-I can't tell them.
-I'll tell them.

1440
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,317
Where did everyone go?

1441
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,741
-Why?
-Your number.

1442
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,786
Dong-jae just exposed your numbers.

1443
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,913
-To whom?
-To Seok-jin.

1444
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,290
-How do you know?
-Joon-bin saw them.

1445
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,876
He handed your information over.

1446
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,172
Your numbers are exposed,
so tell us Dong-jae's number.

1447
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,884
-You can't be here long.
-The thing is... Why?

1448
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,886
-Dong-jae might see.
-He betrayed you.

1449
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:23,221
I don't get it.

1450
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,597
-I'll help you understand.
-Okay.

1451
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,557
You currently have three points.

1452
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,518
You lose one point, but you'll survive.

1453
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,977
-But that's unfair, right?
-Yeah.

1454
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,605
If we all hand in Dong-jae's number,
it's over for him.

1455
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,483
But how? When did he do it?

1456
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:36,859
-Forget about that.
-There's no time.

1457
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,945
-That's unimportant.
-Don't think about that.

1458
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,488
For you to survive...

1459
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,407
-We can't give you ours.
-That's right.

1460
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,284
Give us Dong-jae's number
and the five of us will hand it in.

1461
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,328
-He'll get a negative five.
-You want him to finish last.

1462
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,247
Then you'll survive.

1463
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:53,000
-About you and Yu-min's number...
-Yeah?

1464
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,586
Dong-jae gave them to Seok-jin.

1465
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,422
-How do you know?
-Joon-bin saw it.

1466
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,802
{\an8}Dong-jae and Seok-jin
already made contact.

1467
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,054
-They know.
-Do they know my number?

1468
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,598
-He probably told him.
-He probably did.

1469
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,308
-We're not sure though.
-I don't know yours.

1470
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,768
You don't know my number?

1471
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,687
-I don't.
-Right.

1472
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,898
If Seok-jin and Dong-jae made contact...

1473
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,025
If they hand in your number, you're last.

1474
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,902
It's a possibility.

1475
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,738
-We don't know for sure though.
-If so...

1476
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,906
-We're not 100% sure.
-Right, but it seems that way.

1477
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,742
You worked with three people, right?

1478
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,410
<i>People kept trying to sway me.</i>

1479
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,621
They kept saying,
"Dong-jae already exposed your number."

1480
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,040
It's up to you to trust us or not.

1481
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,501
I'm not in a position to trust anyone.

1482
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,211
Your numbers have been exposed.

1483
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,546
Are you sure?

1484
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,673
Joon-bin saw them. We didn't see.

1485
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,966
What if it's a lie?

1486
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:45,303
In that case, we all end with five points.

1487
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,222
You two don't have a choice.

1488
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:52,018
-We've got our points.
-We're all set.

1489
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,770
It's clear who'll be last.

1490
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,606
Hye-sung, you're guaranteed
to finish last.

1491
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,649
You two are bound to finish last

1492
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,486
because no one outside our team
knows our numbers.

1493
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,321
-But...
-We secured five points.

1494
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,990
He might have shared false information.

1495
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,451
-I really...
-You can't let everyone survive.

1496
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,577
-Seriously.
-Right.

1497
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,370
I might be wrong.

1498
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,997
<i>Three minutes remaining.</i>

1499
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,875
<i>If you have not submitted
your answer sheet,</i>

1500
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,668
-<i>please do so now.</i>
-So you felt bad?

1501
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:18,878
Yeah.

1502
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,797
-Did you submit your answer sheet?
-No.

1503
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,923
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1504
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,174
-Did you submit yours?
-Not yet.

1505
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,383
-You haven't?
-No.

1506
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,468
Are you submitting yours?

1507
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,011
Yeah, I am.

1508
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,888
We need to do it before time runs out.

1509
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,473
Yeah, submit them now.

1510
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,724
-Are you submitting yours?
-We need to.

1511
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,060
-Can we go here?
-Can we?

1512
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,895
-We can.
-Right, we can.

1513
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:36,979
-We can.
-I'm going in.

1514
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,026
We have to submit this, right?

1515
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,654
You do it in the dealer room.

1516
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,905
-What the heck?
-Really?

1517
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,283
You do it in the dealer room.

1518
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,618
-What the heck?
-Really?

1519
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,537
What's going on?

1520
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,122
-Wait...
-Let me submit this first.

1521
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,290
-Did you submit yours?
-Not yet.

1522
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,376
-Submit yours. We have three minutes left.
-Wait...

1523
01:03:58,459 --> 01:03:59,877
What's going on?

1524
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,712
-I'll tell you after submitting it.
-What happened?

1525
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,297
Why did you go in?

1526
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:43,272
