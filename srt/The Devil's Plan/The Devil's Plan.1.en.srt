<i>In the name of public order

5
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>these masks conceal
your true self and your ambition.</i>

6

<i>In</i> The Devil's Plan, <i>you can

-Here's your Americano.
-Thank you.

25
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,774
<i>I was apprehensive and nervous at first,</i>

26
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,820
<i>but the place was unexpectedly
bright, warm, and inviting.</i>

27
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,964
My name's on here.

28

-How are you?
-It's been so long.

32
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,486
{\an8}Hello, my name is Lee See-won

38
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,918
Pretty much the same.

39
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,753
You seemed to have lost weight.

40
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,838
-Really?
-Yes.

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>I had met him before as a guest on a show.</i>

42

<i>I wanted to use that past encounter</i>

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,178
<i>to get closer to him.</i>

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,891
I have a feeling that, for these shows,

45
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,101
-having a close ally is important.
-You're right.

46

Someone you can work with.

47

-You need a great team.
-That's right.

48

Let's work together.

49

-We've worked together before.
-Right.

50
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,776
I look forward to it.

51
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,613
-Do you know who else is coming?
-I don't.

52
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,907
I think who we room with

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,200
will also be important.

54
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,328

<i>To keep her place

-She has a lot of luggage.

67

You packed a lot.

68
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,869
<i>My strategy is to seem naive</i>

69
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,413
so the others underestimate me.

70
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,083
Are you planning to stay here for a while?

71

You know, just in case.

72
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,671
It's my first time being somewhere

-without my phone.
-Same here.

74
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,008
-I'll just think of it as a temple stay.
-That's right.

<i>but I haven't seen her as an adult,</i>

156
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,395
<i>so it's great to see her again.</i>

157
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,898
Hello.

158
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,816
-Hello.
-Hello.

159
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,985
-He seems like an expert.
-He's a YouTuber.

160
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,862
-He's a popular travel YouTuber.
-He's Kwaktube.

161
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,697
-Hello.
-Hello.

162
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,823
Hello.

163
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,493
-Should I speak English?
-No.

164
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,954
{\an8}Hello, my name is Kwak Joon-bin and I'm...

165
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,247
{\an8}KWAK JOON-BIN
YOUTUBER

166
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,208
{\an8}...31 years old. I'm a travel YouTuber.

167
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,002
<i>After working at the Azerbaijan embassy,</i>

168
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,921
<i>Joon-bin became a travel YouTuber</i>

169
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,424
<i>and gained one million subscribers
in three years.</i>

170
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,927
<i>With his language ability
and friendly attitude,</i>

171
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,180
<i>he can survive just about anywhere.</i>

172
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,475
<i>When I'm into something,
I like to dig deep.</i>

173
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,435
<i>I've watched
Producer Jeong Jong-yeon's shows</i>

174
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,687
and a lot of foreign mind game programs.

175
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,481
<i>so I'm sort of a geek.</i>

176
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,942
-I knew you'd be here.
-You did?

177
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,068
-I predicted it.
-How?

178
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,613
-I came up with a potential list.
-That's amazing.

179
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,949
I guessed you two correctly.

180
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,996
-Hello.
-Hello.

181
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,375
{\an8}Hello, I'm Cho Yeon-woo,
a professional Go player.

182
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,335
<i>As a high school student, Cho Yeon-woo</i>

183
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>won a women's Go tournament
and became a professional player.</i>

184
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,174
<i>She then studied in Singapore</i>

185
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,802
<i>and graduated from Ireland's
most prestigious school,</i>

186
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,971
<i>University College Dublin.</i>

187
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,723
I'm Cho Yeon-woo, a pro Go player.

188
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,101
That's cool.

189
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,644
Hello, nice to meet you.

190
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,896
It's great to meet
such interesting people.

191
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,356
-Tell me about it.
-You're right.

192
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,526
Not a single person can be underestimated.

193
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,902
Are there ten of us?

194
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,030
-Hello.
-Hello.

195
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,408
-Hello.
-Hello.

196
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,076
-She looks cool.
-She seems so young.

197
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,703
Welcome.

198
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,704
Nice to meet you.

199
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,038
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

200
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,249
Are you an international student?

201
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,584
Why do you say that?

202
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,127
Perhaps a Mensa member.

203
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,004
Right, with an IQ of 163.

204
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,046
-That's true.
-Right.

205
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,341
Why don't we all try to guess who she is?

206
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,843
You're not a celebrity, are you?

207
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,013
-Do you not recognize me?
-I'm sorry.

208
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,347
It already feels like

209
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,724
she's playing mind games with us.

210
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,891
-You shouldn't have said that.
-The game's begun.

211
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,602
-Are you playing us already?
-Already?

212
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,855
{\an8}Hello, my name is Suh Yu-min.

213
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,274
{\an8}I'm an orthopedist in the US,

214
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,151
{\an8}and I'm 31 years old.

215
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,778
<i>Joining through an open casting call,</i>

216
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,823
<i>Suh Yu-min graduated
from medical school in New York</i>

217
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,451
<i>and is currently
an orthopedist in the USA.</i>

218
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,330
<i>She's a talented individual who's fluent
in Korean, Spanish, and English.</i>

219
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,041
-You're a doctor?
-A doctor.

220
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,167
I see.

221
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,918
If we get hurt, can you treat us?

222
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,670
-That'd be great.
-I was thinking that too.

223
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,130
You shouldn't get hurt.

224
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,382
<i>She seemed proven.</i>

225
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,259
She had an aura as a doctor.

226
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,055
<i>I think she'd be great
at deductive reasoning.</i>

227
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,018
-Hello.
-Hello.

228
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,103
-Hello.
-Applause.

229
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,189
-Hello.
-Hello.

230
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,983
{\an8}Hello, I'm Kim Dong-jae,
a 25-year-old Korea University student

231
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,526
{\an8}at the School of Biomedical Sciences.

232
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,988
<i>As a current student at Korea University,</i>

233
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,574
<i>Dong-jae was one of the two people
in the open casting call</i>

234
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,494
<i>who got a perfect score on</i>
The Devil's Plan's <i>written test.</i>

235
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,873
<i>He is also a pro poker player
and a highly unique man.</i>

236
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,249
What do you study?

237
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,044
I'm currently studying biology,

238
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,837
but I'm not very academic.

239
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,215
-That's how it goes in college.
-Is that so?

240
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,424
<i>Dong-jae.</i>

241
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,635
He strikes me
as an out-of-the-box thinker.

242
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,262
<i>I want to be teammates with Dong-jae.</i>

243
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,348
<i>He seemed exceptional.</i>

244
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,225
Dong-jae's the toughest enemy here.

245
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,810
I already called him my enemy.

246
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,894
This should be everyone, right?

247
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,939
I think so, but a while ago someone...

248
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,899
What was that?

249
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,278
He must be the Devil.

250
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,072
<i>Greetings.</i>

251
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,370
<i>For the next week, you will all
participate in a special game.</i>

252
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,248
<i>Starting now, I will explain</i>

253
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,667
<i>the rules of the special game.</i>

254
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:56,006
<i>In your hand is what we call a "Piece."</i>

255
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,508
"Piece"?

256
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,677
<i>It acts as a currency within these walls.</i>

257
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,805
<i>Depending on the results of the games,</i>

258
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,516
<i>you may gain or lose these Pieces.</i>

259
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,354
<i>Pieces may be used to purchase
advantageous items for games</i>

260
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,858
<i>or as bargaining chips
for negotiations between contestants.</i>

261
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:19,822
<i>The two contestants with the most Pieces
will advance to the final round,</i>

262
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,366
<i>and the winner of this final round</i>

263
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,202
<i>will be crowned the victor
of</i> The Devil's Plan.

264
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,748
<i>Contestants who lose all of their Pieces</i>

265
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,793
<i>will be immediately eliminated
and must leave the place.</i>

266
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,836
This is nerve-racking.

267
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,131
<i>You will participate
in two games every day.</i>

268
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,549
Two games?

269
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,842
<i>A main match in the morning,</i>

270
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,760
<i>and a prize match in the evening.</i>

271
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,097
<i>All players will participate
in the main match.</i>

272
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,142
<i>And depending on the results,
you may gain Pieces</i>

273
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,518
<i>or even lose them.</i>

274
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,563
<i>At the end of the main match,</i>

275
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,732
<i>the two players
with the least number of Pieces</i>

276
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,525
<i>will be imprisoned.</i>

277
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,114
<i>If three or more players
have the least number of Pieces,</i>

278
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,950
<i>the player with the most number of Pieces</i>

279
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,703
<i>will choose the two players
who will go to prison.</i>

280
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,165
-That's brutal.
<i>-Players in prison</i>

281
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,959
<i>may not participate in the prize match</i>

282
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,922
<i>and cannot leave the prison
until the main match the next morning.</i>

283
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,965
-Spend the night?
-So it's like a real prison?

284
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,425
Until the next morning?

285
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,178
<i>In the prize match, all players
must work together</i>

286
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,972
<i>to achieve the same mission.</i>

287
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,225
<i>The prize matches will determine</i>

288
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,769
<i>the amount of the final prize.</i>

289
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,814
<i>Currently, the final prize is zero won.</i>

290
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,192
<i>After six prize matches,</i>

291
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,695
<i>the final prize may rise to
a maximum of 500 million won.</i>

292
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,953
The Devil's Plan
<i>is a battle of intelligence.</i>

293
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,415
<i>You must maximize your brain power.</i>

294
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,045
<i>Within these walls, only results matter.</i>

295
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,174
<i>With the exception of violence or theft,</i>

296
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,010
<i>any course of action can be taken to win.</i>

297
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,807
<i>Though your victory may be stained
with deceit and betrayal,</i>

298
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,104
<i>we will gladly applaud you
and award you with the final prize.</i>

299
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,815
<i>I'll give it my all. I can do it.</i>

300
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,776
<i>I heard the prize money is astronomical.</i>

301
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,404
<i>My goal is to win.</i>

302
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,364
<i>I'm here for the long haul.</i>

303
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,866
<i>I'm just going to enjoy this.</i>

304
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,659
<i>I'm here to win, no matter what.</i>

305
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,452
<i>I have to brace myself.</i>

306
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,580
<i>We'll see who turns into devils.</i>

307
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,707
<i>Who's my friend or foe here?</i>

308
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,376
<i>I'm going to put my life on the line.</i>

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,461
<i>I have to finish first.</i>

310

<i>Welcome.</i>

312
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,342
The Devil's Plan

313
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,677
<i>begins now.</i>

314
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:07,573
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

315
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,659
<i>Let me introduce
the building you are currently in.</i>

316
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,496
<i>The building is divided
into the game area and the living area.</i>

317
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,876
<i>The game area is only open
during the main and prize matches,</i>

318
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,046
<i>and you may not leave
until the game is over.</i>

319
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,798
<i>When not playing games,</i>

320
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,468
<i>you will spend time in the living area.</i>

321
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,553
<i>The keepers of the living area</i>

322
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,513
<i>will assist you during your stay here.</i>

323
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,643
<i>Your rooms have been assigned.</i>

324
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,144
-Already?
<i>-And your luggage</i>

325
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,355
<i>has been taken to your rooms.</i>

326
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,482
ROOM 101: PARK KYEONG-RIM, SUH DONG-JOO
ROOM 102: GUILLAUME, HA SEOK-JIN

327
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,234
I'm with you.

328
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,737
<i>Transfer of Pieces between players</i>

329
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,031

330
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,785
{\an8}<i>During the main and prize matches,</i>

331
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,372
{\an8}<i>Pieces may not be transferred
within the game area.</i>

332
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,501
<i>Now, before we begin our first main match,</i>

333
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,003
<i>you may spend your free time as you wish.</i>

334
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,674
Let's go. Take your Pieces with you.

335
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,591
-Will do.
-Okay.

336
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,634
We're roommates.

337
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,551
-Right.
-Nice to meet you.

338
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,303
Me too. Nice to meet you.

339
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,596
-Let's go, Joon-bin.
-Sure.

340
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,682
-What's our room number?
-I think it was 201.

341
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,309
Hey, roommate, let's go.

342
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,436
-Let's go see our room.
-I'm so thrilled.

343
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,522
-Can I call you by name?
-Of course.

344
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,649
-Kyeong-rim.
-I know your mom well.

345
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,109
-Really?
-I do.

346
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,027
<i>Apparently, she's on
a first-name basis with my mom,</i>

347
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,488
{\an8}and I'm on a first-name basis with her.

348
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,156
{\an8}So it's a confusing hierarchy.

349
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,282
-Do you have trouble falling asleep?
-Do you snore?

350
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,785
-I don't snore.
-Then I won't have trouble sleeping.

351
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,286
You're older so choose your bed first.

352
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,455
I'm a travel YouTuber,
so I can sleep anywhere.

353
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,041
-I see.
-As long as there's a bed, I'm set.

354
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,253
I think choosing the inner bed
is a matter of primal instinct.

355
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,213
Well, science isn't really my thing.

356
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,840
-All right.
-Make yourself at home.

357
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,591
<i>As a fellow YouTuber,</i>

358
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,053
{\an8}I already felt quite close to Joon-bin.

359
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,680
<i>So I'm glad I met him here.</i>

360
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,099
We should aim to take all the Pieces.

361
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,600
Actually, my goal

362
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,186
is to have all 12 of us
reach the final round.

363
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,521
Oh, really?

364
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,149
-We have opposite goals.
-Really?

365
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,568
{\an8}Our goals are completely different,

366
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,487
so the room assignment wasn't ideal.

367
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,574
Let's take this coincidental fate

368
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,367
of being roommates

369
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,203
-and turn it into good fortune.
-Let's do this.

370
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,372
-Let's make it to the final round.
-Together.

371
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,915
Let's get there together.

372
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,917
<i>Professional Go players</i>

373
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,420
{\an8}rarely lose their composure, right?

374
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:30,424
<i>I think good things
can happen for us as a team.</i>

375
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,385
Yu-min, when were you born?

376
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,553
I was born in 1992.

377
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,181
-We're the same age!
-We are?

378
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,100
I'm so glad!

379
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,186
<i>Since we're the same age,</i>

380
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,563
{\an8}I felt like we could click.

381
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,190
I think we're the same age.

382
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,941
-Really? Were you born in 1998?
-Yes.

383
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,651
-Oh, I see.
-Yes.

384
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,404
Why don't we talk casually then?

385
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,156
-Shall we?
-Sure.

386
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,991
-Sounds good.
-We're roommates after all.

387
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,119
{\an8}At first, I thought we were friends
since we were the same age.

388
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,039
-How old are you?
-I'm 26 years old.

389
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,624
I was born in early 1999,

390
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,875
-so I count myself as 1998.
-Early 1998.

391
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,293
Wait, you're early 1999?

392
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,836
We aren't the same age then.

393
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,255
I'm actually early 1998.

394
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,381
-Oh, no.
-Really?

395
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,842
He said we should be friends up there.

396
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,428
-You're early 1998?
-But, I mean...

397
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,597
-This is all messed up.
-Hello, sir.

398
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,516
{\an8}Seungkwan is older than I am.

399
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,267
We decided to be formal again.

400
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,019
So everyone's older than I am.

401
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,438
I thought I'd be
one of the older ones here.

402
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,774
-I didn't know I'd be young.
-Really?

403
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,026
-Are we the youngest?
-I'll eliminate him today.

404
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,862
Then I can be the youngest here.

405
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,197
You want to be the youngest.

406
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,782
-He wants to be young.
-That's it.

407
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,825
I'm changing targets.

408
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,077
Oh, no.

409
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,454
<i>Since he's brainy, I think we could</i>

410
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,207
destroy other teams if we work together.

411
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,959
<i>I want to team up with Dong-jae.</i>

412
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,503
I'm trying to see

413
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,714
who doesn't care that much
about the prize money.

414
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,592
Ultimately, I want all 12 of us
to reach the final round.

415
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,178
That's more like
an angel's plan than a devil's plan.

416
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,890
Ideally, no one would get eliminated
until the final episode.

417
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,852
<i>It's a survival show,
so naturally, the focus is on the games.</i>

418
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,729
However, the scientific approach
to the games

419
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,898
and all the extra information...

420
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,818
Darwin once said
that species that adapt to change

421
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,153
are the ones that survive.

422
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:18,532
My goal is to make the other 11 players
find science interesting.

423
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,826
Are you interested in anything else
other than science?

424
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,743
I don't.

425
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,831
So much science is involved in wine.

426
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,709
We can talk all day about
where humans are from and headed.

427
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,170
It's an American satellite called ERBS.

428
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,259
I thought I'd get along with ORBIT,
but all he talks about is science.

429
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,635
-It's nonstop.
-He's obsessed with science.

430
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,053
-Is he still talking about science?
-Yes.

431
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,180
It all goes back to science.

432
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,806
Should we eliminate him?

433
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,183
I want to use my room alone.

434
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,854
-This guy is pretty scary.
-He is.

435
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,148
I don't want to team up
with Kwak Joon-bin.

436
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,983
To be honest,

437
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,111
<i>I think he gets swayed too easily.</i>

438
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,487
Everyone's scary. I'm worried.

439
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,947
-What?
-Everyone's scary.

440
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,115
They are.

441
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,117
Behind every smile...

442
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,329
-Everyone's hiding their cards.
-Exactly.

443
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,206
Out of all these people,

444
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,834
you have to find someone trustworthy.

445
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,794
Especially in the beginning
up until the mid-game.

446
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,129
Don't you think?

447
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,886
What the fuck?

448
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,346
Are you an ordinary citizen?

449
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,556
-I am.
-Why are you all trying to eliminate me?

450
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,724
Damn it.

451
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,609
Just tell me the reason for elimination.

452
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,740
It's beginning.

453
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,824
The bell's rung.

454
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,992
<i>In a moment,</i>

455
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,827

00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,288
<i>Please gather in the game area.</i>

457
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,207
It's starting.

458
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,711
The door is open now.

459
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,088
Is this the way?

460
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,548
-I think so. Let's go.
-It's so cool.

461
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,259
-Let's go.
-I'm excited!

462
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,969
This is going to be fun.

463
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,637
-Let's go.
-Let's do this!

464
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,514
Let's all have fun!

465
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,849
-Do we go in?
-Yes.

466
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,935
-Are we all here? Let's go.
-All right.

467
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:10,978
-Let's head in.
-Okay.

468
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,272
It looks amazing.

469
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,234
Do you smell the luxury?

470
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,237
-Netflix is different.
-Netflix really is.

471
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,572
I think the vibe
will be completely different

472
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,116
-behind these doors.
-It may.

473
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,993
I think it'll get really dark.

474
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm excited.

475
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,456
I'm scared already.
Those people look scary.

476
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,541
What's in there?

477
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,128
-They're the dealers.
-Hello.

478
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,673
Amazing. I'm getting goosebumps.

479
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,259
This feels like the wild.

480
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,303
What is that?

481
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,723
<i>Welcome.</i>

482
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,810
<i>This is the game area,
where the matches will be held.</i>

483
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,690
{\an8}<i>Let me introduce the game area.</i>

484
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,277
{\an8}<i>The game area is largely divided
into the main hall,</i>

485
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,280
{\an8}<i>the dealer room,</i>

486
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,907
{\an8}<i>the security room,</i>

487
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,659
{\an8}<i>the work room,</i>

488
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,203
{\an8}<i>the storage room,</i>

489
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,581
{\an8}<i>and the kitchen.</i>

490
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,084
<i>Players may freely use each room</i>

491
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,712
<i>according to their strategies.</i>

492
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:23,342
<i>Now, time for the first main match.</i>

493
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,259
I'm nervous.

494
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,677
-My heart's racing.
<i>-The first main match</i>

495
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,054
<i>of</i> The Devil's Plan <i>is...</i>

496
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,098
<i>the Virus Game.</i>

497
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,558
Virus?

498
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,103
<i>This game is a battle between
terrorists who are spreading the virus</i>

499
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,191
<i>and citizens who need to stop them.</i>

500
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,068
It's political.

501
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,237
<i>Before the game, players will draw lots</i>

502
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:50,035
<i>to determine their characters in the game
and a unique number between 1 and 12.</i>

503
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,997
<i>Each character in the Virus Game
has different abilities.</i>

504
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,502
<i>Once they accomplish a task, their ability
will be triggered automatically</i>

505
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,962
<i>What character someone is</i>

506
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,465
<i>and what task will trigger
a character's ability</i>

507
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,302
<i>are only known to the assigned player.</i>

508
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:13,016
{\an8}<i>The characters are terrorists,
citizens, and neutrals.</i>

509
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,393
{\an8}-There are also neutrals.
<i>-The terrorists.</i>

510
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,104
{\an8}<i>There are two terrorists.</i>

511
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,232
{\an8}<i>As the game progresses,
they will learn each other's identities.</i>

512
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,484
{\an8}It's like the Mafia game.

513
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,861
{\an8}-You're right.
<i>-Terrorists</i>

514
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:29,032
{\an8}<i>have the ability
to infect a player with a virus.</i>

515
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:35,038
{\an8}<i>They may discuss with each other to pick
one player to infect during the game.</i>

516
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,917
{\an8}<i>Each terrorist may treat a player</i>

517
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,877
{\an8}<i>with their antidote ability</i>

518
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,713
{\an8}<i>and kill one player
with their bullet ability.</i>

519
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,883
<i>They begin the game
with one of each ability.</i>

520
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,429
<i>For the terrorists to win the game,
one or more terrorists must be alive</i>

521
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,642
<i>and kill all players
aside from the one player with antibodies.</i>

522
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,771
<i>In this case, the terrorists
will obtain four Pieces each.</i>

523
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,274
<i>Next, the citizens.</i>

524
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:07,612
{\an8}<i>They are divided into ordinary citizens,
researchers, and journalist.</i>

525
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,656
<i>If either all terrorists die</i>

526
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,491
<i>or the cure is developed,</i>

527
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,744
<i>the citizens win the game
and obtain one Piece each.</i>

528
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,037
I see.

529
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,956
{\an8}<i>There are five ordinary citizens</i>

530
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,625
{\an8}<i>and they do not know
each other's identities.</i>

531
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,298
{\an8}<i>One ordinary citizen is randomly chosen
to possess antibodies.</i>

532
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,175
{\an8}<i>No one will know who this player is,</i>

533
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,343
<i>even the player themself.</i>

534
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,595
What can we do then?

535
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,138
<i>The player with antibodies</i>

536
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,808
<i>can also be infected and infect others,</i>

537
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,978
<i>but they recover after each round.</i>

538
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,191
<i>They are also crucial for the task
of developing the cure.</i>

539
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,525
This is interesting.

540
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,486
<i>At the end of the game,
surviving ordinary citizens</i>

541
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,240
<i>receive one additional Piece
as a survival bonus.</i>

542
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,576
<i>The researchers.</i>

543
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,036
{\an8}<i>There are two researchers.</i>

544
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,414
{\an8}<i>Like terrorists, researchers
will learn each other's identities.</i>

545
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,335
{\an8}<i>Researchers have the ability
to develop the cure,</i>

546
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,253
{\an8}<i>and they must accomplish this task</i>

547
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,547
{\an8}<i>by working with the player
with antibodies.</i>

548
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:09,925
Teamwork is needed.

549
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,136
<i>The cure development task
can only be completed once each round.</i>

550
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,599
<i>Two successful tasks
lead to the development of the cure.</i>

551
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,143
<i>If the first development task
is successful,</i>

552
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,145
<i>the cure will be announced as ready</i>

553
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,397
<i>when the next round begins.</i>

554
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,817
<i>After one more successful task,</i>

555
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,736
<i>the cure will be announced as completed.</i>

556
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,240
<i>In this scenario,
the citizens win the game.</i>

557
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,575
Researchers are really important.

558
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,953
<i>If the game ends
with the development of the cure,</i>

559
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:42,165
<i>researchers obtain an extra Piece each.</i>

560
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,584
{\an8}<i>The journalist.</i>

561
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,044
{\an8}<i>There is one journalist.</i>

562
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,005
{\an8}<i>In each round,
they can investigate and find out</i>

563
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,091
{\an8}<i>the identity of one player.</i>

564
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,389
{\an8}<i>However, they cannot find out
which player has antibodies.</i>

565
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,307
{\an8}<i>If still alive by the end of the game,</i>

566
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:04,312
{\an8}<i>the journalist also obtains
an extra Piece.</i>

567
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,773
<i>Next, the neutrals.</i>

568
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,527
<i>Regardless of which side wins,</i>

569
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,446
<i>the neutrals are only concerned about
obtaining more Pieces.</i>

570
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,615
{\an8}<i>The officer.</i>

571
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,158
{\an8}<i>There is one officer.</i>

572
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,662
{\an8}<i>They have the bullet ability
to kill one player.</i>

573
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,206
{\an8}<i>They may use this ability once per round.</i>

574
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,959
I like that character.

575
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,754
<i>The officer only gains Pieces
if both terrorists die.</i>

576
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,384
<i>If they succeed within two rounds,
they receive four Pieces.</i>

577
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,512
<i>However, for each round that passes,</i>

578
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,890
<i>the number of Pieces they can obtain
will decrease by one.</i>

579
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,143
<i>The fanatic.</i>

580
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,353
{\an8}<i>There is one fanatic.</i>

581
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,231
{\an8}<i>The fanatic obtains Pieces if they die.</i>

582
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,859
-You have to die.
-I want this character.

583
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,444
<i>If they die in round one,</i>

584
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,611
<i>they get three Pieces.</i>

585
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,281
<i>If they die in rounds two or three,
they get two Pieces.</i>

586
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,576
<i>If they die in round four,
they obtain only one Piece,</i>

587
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,538
<i>while they get no Pieces at all
if they are not dead by round five.</i>

588
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,916
<i>Each round will last for 30 minutes.</i>

589
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,501
<i>The game will continue</i>

590
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,589
<i>until either the terrorists or citizens
achieve victory.</i>

591
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,343
<i>If a player dies during the rounds,</i>

592
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,845
<i>they will be isolated in the dealer room,</i>

593
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:23,141
<i>and their name and character
will be announced.</i>

594
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,604
<i>However, information regarding
antibodies will not be revealed.</i>

595
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,314
This is interesting.

596
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,732
This is well thought out.

597
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,152
{\an8}<i>Once the first player is infected
with the virus by a terrorist,</i>

598
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:38,073
{\an8}<i>the infection will spread
based on the infected player's number.</i>

599
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,244
{\an8}<i>Once the next round begins,
the infection will spread to both sides</i>

600
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,207
{\an8}<i>and two players
will be infected every round.</i>

601
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,335
{\an8}<i>However, if a player consumes the antidote</i>

602
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,088
{\an8}<i>during the round they get infected in,</i>

603
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,091
{\an8}<i>the infection will cease
in that player's direction.</i>

604
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:00,345
{\an8}<i>Dead players will be skipped
in the infection process</i>

605
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,391
{\an8}<i>and numbers 12 and 1
will be considered to be connected.</i>

606
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,684
<i>Infected players will die</i>

607
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,105
<i>within two rounds if left untreated.</i>

608
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,815
{\an8}<i>For example,</i>

609
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,735
{\an8}<i>if player six is infected
in round one by a terrorist,</i>

610
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,115
{\an8}<i>player six will die
when round three begins.</i>

611
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:24,536
{\an8}<i>Players five and seven,
infected in round two by player six,</i>

612
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,372
{\an8}<i>will die when round four begins.</i>

613
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,335
<i>Players may take a virus test</i>

614
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,754
<i>only once during the game</i>

615
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,382
<i>to confirm whether they are infected.</i>

616
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,470
-This is crazy.
<i>-Virus tests may be taken at any time</i>

617
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,681
<i>at the testing station.</i>

618
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,684
<i>Results are not revealed to anyone else.</i>

619
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,980
<i>Round one will end after 30 minutes.</i>

620
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,400
<i>From round two, the following will
be announced at each round's beginning.</i>

621
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,152
<i>The status of the cure development,</i>

622
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,362
<i>the players that died from the virus,</i>

623
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,157
<i>and the number of infected players.</i>

624
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,827
<i>Each round will proceed the same way.</i>

625
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,582
<i>Once the terrorists or citizens
fulfill the requirements for victory,</i>

626
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,916
<i>the game will end.</i>

627
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,960
-This is amazing.
-It's wild.

628
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,086
It's crazy.

629
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,256
<i>Once the game ends,
depending on each player's character,</i>

630
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,592
<i>the victors and losers will be determined</i>

631
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,093
<i>and Pieces will be distributed.</i>

632
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,265
<i>The game will begin in 60 minutes.</i>

633
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,391
-In 60 minutes?
-In 60 minutes?

634
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,436
<i>-Spend this time as you wish.</i>
-They want us to practice.

635
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,730
<i>It reminded me of the Mafia game.</i>

636
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,774
<i>Maintaining a poker face
seems to be key here.</i>

637
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,651
I'll have to be deceitful.

638
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,029
I'm confident at deceiving people.

639
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,782
Regardless of my own character,

640
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,451
it'll be fun trying to find out
who everyone else is.

641
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,328
Shall we go talk in a room?

642
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,414
Can someone who understood the rules
explain them to me again?

643
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,000
I think I'm the most confused person here.

644
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,044
<i>I didn't expect such a tough game
from the start.</i>

645
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,840
-Anyway...
-To be a great terrorist,

646
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,634
you need to understand
the rules perfectly.

647
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,135
I don't want to be a terrorist.

648
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,012
-Same here.
-I don't want it either.

649
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,598
I think everyone will suspect me
if I'm a terrorist.

650
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,724
You're already suspicious.

651
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,852
-We haven't even chosen characters yet.
-Even so, you're suspicious.

652
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,355
I think being a terrorist
will be the most stressful.

653
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,483
With ten enemies against you,
you and your partner

654
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,068
have to go kill everyone.

655
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:24,906
<i>With a single virus and two bullets,
the two terrorists</i>

656
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,201
<i>must kill all players to win.</i>

657
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,870
How do the researchers
find the player with antibodies?

658
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,581
Even the player themselves
don't know they have antibodies.

659
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,084
So how would the researchers find them?

660
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,377
They just keep guessing.

661
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,212
-They should look at the results...
-Right.

662
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,630
and act silently.

663
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,006
That's a tough job.

664
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,883
-The toughest one.
-It's the most difficult.

665
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,218
They're the saviors of humanity.

666
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,136
<i>To find the player with antibodies,</i>

667
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,224
<i>researchers must randomly choose
a player to carry out their task on</i>

668
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:55,770
<i>and check whether a cure development
is announced in the next round.</i>

669
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,524
If you get on the officer's wrong side,
you could face an unfair death.

670
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,819
They can investigate identities,
so they wouldn't kill randomly.

671
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,987
That's the journalist's job.

672
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,780
-Oh right, the journalist investigates.
-Yes.

673
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,324
-The officer just kills.
-Okay.

674
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:12,203
<i>The officer can kill one player per round.</i>

675
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:16,708
<i>The officer only gains Pieces
if both terrorists die.</i>

676
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,460
<i>It would be a good idea</i>

677
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,088
<i>to work with the journalist,
who can vet player identities.</i>

678
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,549
I want to be the fanatic.

679
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,885
It's a fairly straightforward role.

680
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:27,886
However,

681
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,222
the fanatic can't die
just because they want to.

682
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,099
-Someone has to kill them.
-Right.

683
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,643
<i>The fanatic wins if they are killed.</i>

684
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,854
<i>The sooner, the better.</i>

685
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:41,983
Joon-bin.

686
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,901
Yes?

687
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,865
If some of us decided to

688
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,075
share each other's identities.

689
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,493
would that be dangerous?

690
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,078
Actually,

691
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,497
I talked to Yu-min about this

692
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,791
since we're roommates and all.

693
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,419
-The three of us could work together.
-Sounds good.

694
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,504
-Just us three people born in 1992.
-Okay.

695
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,842
<i>I wanted to win over someone trustworthy</i>

696
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,303
and bring them to my side early on.

697
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,055
-It'll be fun to team up with you.
-Yes.

698
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,515
-I just don't want to be a terrorist.
-Same here.

699
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,935
But I don't think it would be that bad.

700
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,812
If one of us were a terrorist
and the other were the fanatic,

701
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,522
that would be a great partnership.

702
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,608
<i>Well...</i>

703
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,068
I'm keeping my options open.

704
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,904
<i>I've set my mind on Seungkwan,</i>

705
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,031
but I'm also on team 1992

706
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,283
<i>with Hye-sung and Yu-min.</i>

707
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,785
I haven't talked to Yu-min.

708
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,328
What do you expect to get?

709
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,373
If we agree to help each other,
I'll tell you my character's traits.

710
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,084
You look so smart that you intimidate me.

711
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,628
<i>Basically, with games like the Mafia game,</i>

712
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,546
trust is important.

713
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,883
Let's agree to share these details.

714
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,929
-I promise to tell you the truth.
-Okay, me too.

715
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,263
We need to help each other.

716
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,515
Got it.

717
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,393
-This is fun.
-We all ended up here.

718
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,812
Let me give you a briefing.

719
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,855
I have a winning strategy
for the citizens.

720
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,526
I have a plan that will lead
the citizens to victory.

721
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,736
After we each get our characters,

722
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,029
I'll reveal my plan.

723
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,783
So the citizens should go to ORBIT.

724
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,036
If I'm convinced
you're a citizen, we'll talk.

725
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,663
What if he turns out
to be a terrorist after all this?

726
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,792
<i>I need to keep ORBIT in check.</i>

727
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,920
He seems like such a talkative person.

728
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,298
<i>Please gather back in the hall.</i>

729
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,759
<i>The virus game will begin now.</i>

730
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,637
-Gather around!
-Please come out to the hall!

731
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,639
I'm so excited for this.

732
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,225
This is going to be a bloodbath.

733
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,102
-I'm sure.
-It feels like the Colosseum.

734
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,604
-I'm sure it will.
-I love the Colosseum.

735
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,314
-I'm nervous.
-I'm so nervous.

736
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,443
<i>First, it is time to draw your numbers.</i>

737
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,736
I got number one.

738
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,279
-I got number two.
-Number three.

739
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,238
Dong-jae, number four.

740
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,156
Number five.

741
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,407
Number six.

742
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,868
-Number seven.
-You got lucky seven.

743
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,745
-Number eight.
-Number nine.

744
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,496
-Ten.
-Number eleven.

745
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,207
-Twelve is the last one.
-Number twelve.

746
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,461
<i>Now, it's time to draw your characters.</i>

747
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,172
<i>Starting with Yu-min,
enter the dealer room alone</i>

748
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,549
<i>in numerical order.</i>

749
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,675
Sounds good.

750
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,927
-Focus on their expressions.
-This is it.

751
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,512
Number one, Yu-min.

752
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,433
Hello.

753
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,685
Please choose a character card.

754
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,651
She's out.

755
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,571
Judging by your face,

756
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,989
I think you're a citizen.

757
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,533
I'm excited for our grand strategist
to come out.

758
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,245
I'll choose this one.

759
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,915
-What's taking so long?
-Look when he comes out.

760
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,375
This is great.

761
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,794
-It is?
-Yes.

762
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,253
-Can the citizens win?
-Yes.

763
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,422
I can confidently tell you
the winning strategy.

764
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,841
-Dong-joo.
-Yes.

765
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,676
Please choose a character card.

766
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,475
-She's out.
-How was it?

767
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,310
Sorry? I'm relieved.

768
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,436
-You look down.
-What did you get?

769
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,854
-No, I'm okay.
-She looks down.

770
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,815
-Me? I'm a citizen.
-What's your task?

771
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,566
You're a citizen? Okay.

772
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,776
She's changed all of a sudden.

773
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,111
How is she so obvious?

774
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,196
Is that how things are in the States?

775
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,572
You're a citizen.

776
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,532
You seem flustered.

777
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,075
Your face is flushed.

778
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,077
-Dong-joo. What do we do with you?
-Please help me.

779
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,495
-I'm sure...
-Help.

780
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,163
She's not one of the five
ordinary citizens.

781
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,290
-Seok-jin!
-Definitely not.

782
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,709
-It seems that way.
-No, it's not like that.

783
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,212
<i>I'm sure Dong-joo is a terrorist.</i>

784
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,713
She was too flustered.

785
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,133
Dong-joo is definitely not a citizen.

786
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,803
I'm in trouble.
I think they saw right through me.

787
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,429
-You're a citizen?
-Yes.

788
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,347
What about you?

789
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,391
Okay.

790
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,769
-I'll choose this card.
-Okay.

791
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,814
-I'm good.
-What did you get?

792
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,024
You look so happy.

793
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,276
It's getting interesting.

794
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,237
-It is?
-Your expression changed a lot.

795
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,490
I'm starting to get it.
I understood about 50% of the game.

796
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,911
Please be a fun one.

797
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,080
Please.

798
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,625
Please show your card to the camera.

799
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,336
You are an ordinary citizen.

800
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,505
Darn it.

801
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,800
I wanted to be
the highlight of episode one.

802
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,051
Are you the fanatic?

803
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,595
If I were, I would've been so happy.

804
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,804
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

805
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,055
What did you get?

806
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,849
-Me? Citizen.
-All right.

807
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,517
Guillaume, what did you get?

808
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,643
Are you a citizen?

809
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,605
-He's not saying anything, so...
-I guess he's not.

810
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,356
I'll consider you as an unlikely citizen.

811
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,774
-Joon-bin?
-I'm a complete citizen.

812
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,859
-A complete citizen?
-Yes.

813
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,777
-Complete citizen?
-A citizen for sure.

814
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,451
-Seungkwan.
-What did you get?

815
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,535
What did you get?

816
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,995
Everyone else got citizens.

817
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,623
-I'll do my best.
-You didn't get citizen?

818
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,251
-You're unlikely to be a citizen.
-I hate you so much.

819
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,003
I seriously hate you.

820
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,258
Done?

821
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,593
See-won, what did you get?

822
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,761
Are you a citizen?

823
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,763
-An ordinary citizen?
-Yes.

824
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,764
Not a researcher?

825
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,018
This one is calling my name.

826
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,773
{\an8}Kyeong-rim, you are the journalist.

827
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,690
{\an8}Okay.

828
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,235
-This is your task card.
-Thank you.

829
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,696
<i>The journalist may use the phone
in the kitchen or the work room</i>

830
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,368
<i>to confirm the identity of the player
they wish to investigate.</i>

831
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,535
Sure, let's do that.

832
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,663
-Kyeong-rim, what did you get?
-I can...

833
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,831
-Citizen?
-I can confidently say that I am.

834
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,333
All right then.

835
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,586
I'll choose this.

836
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,381
-Yeon-woo.
-Are you a citizen?

837
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,008
-You're a citizen, right?
-I'm on the good side.

838
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,843
-On the good side, but not a citizen.
-The good side.

839
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,053
-Okay.
-No.

840
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,596
I'm sure we can help each other out.

841
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,681
-You think so?
-Yes.

842
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,349
Kyeong-rim, what did you get?

843
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,433
You tell me first.

844
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,768
-I go first?
-You should.

845
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,396
-I already revealed my character.
-That was the truth?

846
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,148
Then I think I can help you.

847
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,692
How?

848
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,361
<i>Dong-jae said he's a citizen.</i>

849
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,446
So I let him know without a word

850
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,156
that I'm the journalist.

851
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,037
-Seok-jin's out.
-Are you a citizen?

852
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,414
-It's hard to tell.
-All right.

853
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,581
This is good.

854
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,375
This is so fun.

855
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,793
I have a hunch.

856
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,087
-You do?
-You know who the terrorists are?

857
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,672
I know those who aren't citizens.

858
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:23,426
<i>Starting now, round one
will go on for thirty minutes.</i>

859
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:27,847
<i>All players must fully utilize this time.</i>

860
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,640
You all look so worried.

861
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,852
What's up?

862
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,688
-Are you an ordinary citizen?
-I am.

863
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,523
-Really? Can I trust you?
-Yes.

864
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,736
All right.

865
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,532
-Are you two filming <i>Single's Inferno</i>?
-You two...

866
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,535
-Are they the terrorists?
-Let me just say this.

867
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,997
The goal, for now,
is for the citizens to win.

868
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,291
-Let me tell you the winning strategy.
-Great.

869
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,751
-Great.
-To all of us?

870
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,627
-In front of the terrorists?
-I have to.

871
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,548
I think it would help if we visualized

872
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,092
who can infect which players.

873
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,136
-Why don't we stand in numerical order?
-Good idea.

874
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,473
Yu-min, you go here. I'm next to you.

875
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,185
Then Joon-bin, Seungkwan, See-won...

876
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,729
The virus spreads to those
on both sides of you.

877
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,522
-That's right.
-Let's figure this out.

878
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,441
Let's say someone gets infected.

879
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,111
If two people die and one survives,

880
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,988
then the survivor is likely a terrorist.

881
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,907
What about the antibodies?
They could be immune.

882
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,325
-Exactly.
-That's also possible.

883
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,119
If we can maintain
this distance between us,

884
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,954
then we win, no matter what.

885
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,583
For the terrorists
to accomplish their goals,

886
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,628
it's likely that they have to
interact with us.

887
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,796
-So we stay still?
-Yes.

888
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,507
As long as we stay still,
ordinary citizens win.

889
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,258
Distancing like this is weird to me.

890
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,345
We could all just act naturally,

891
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,931
but it seems like
he's trying to restrict us.

892
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,933
Isn't that a good thing?

893
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,935
-Is that good?
-They can't do their tasks.

894
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,896
<i>There is a flaw
in ORBIT's winning strategy.</i>

895
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,649
<i>By preventing anyone
from completing their tasks,</i>

896
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,444
<i>the citizens cannot kill the terrorists
or even develop the cure.</i>

897
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,323
<i>It is a no-lose, no-win strategy.</i>

898
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,826
Are you a terrorist?

899
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,244
Yes.

900
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,746
What's your strategy then?

901
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,165
-You said we should all stay still, right?
-Right.

902
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,250
But I saw through everyone.

903
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,544
-You did?
-The moment I said that

904
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,795
I saw people's reactions.

905
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,922
I have several leads.

906
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,340
<i>The terrorists or the fanatic</i>

907
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,093
would definitely oppose this plan.

908
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,512
<i>So keeping an eye out
for negative reactions</i>

909
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,306
<i>would lead me to the terrorists.</i>

910
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,144
-In my opinion, this is pointless.
-We need to find the journalist

911
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,521
-and depend on them.
-That's the problem.

912
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,981
Figuring out the journalist...

913
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,858
What do you think, Journalist Lee?

914
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,610
You look like a journalist.

915
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,155
I wish, but I'm just an ordinary citizen.

916
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,782
<i>In each round, the journalist
can figure out identities.</i>

917
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,535
<i>They can know who to trust and avoid.</i>

918
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,954
The key to that information
is the journalist.

919
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:01,125
The first thing
we need to do as citizens is...

920
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,587
We need to either find the terrorists

921
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,464
or figure out people's identities.

922
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,965
-You're right.
-Figure that out

923
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,176
-To do that, we need the journalist.
-and not let the terrorists know.

924
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,262
Figuring out who
the journalist is won't be hard.

925
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,139
The journalist has no reason

926
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,183
-to lie about their identity.
-That's right.

927
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,518
Should we look for
someone who claims to be the journalist?

928
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,519
It's me.

929
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,354
-You're the journalist?
-I am.

930
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,564
Really?

931
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:28,402
I'm just looking for
those who are undoubtedly citizens.

932
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,529
-Are you a citizen?
-Yes.

933
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,822
-Are you really?
-I am.

934
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,032
I'm an ordinary citizen.

935
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,534
What are you going to do
if it turns out you're not?

936
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,037
Sorry? But honestly, I'm bad at lying.

937
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,663
-Really?
-I'm really bad at lying.

938
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,999
So, it might be...

939
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,042
This is tough.

940
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,547
-You seem like you have special roles.
-Do we?

941
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,299
-You really do.
-We're very special.

942
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,800
-Do you have a special role?
-No, I'm an ordinary citizen.

943
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,885
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

944
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,886
I wanted to help.

945
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,721
You could help us.

946
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,681
We need to find the officer.

947
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,933
-The officer?
-Yes.

948
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,267
What happens if we do?

949
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,104
The officer has to
find the terrorists and kill them.

950
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,024
But if they get caught by the terrorists...

951
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,360
-They die first, so they'll keep quiet.
-They're important.

952
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,070
-They can't die.
-That's why we need to find them.

953
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,572
-We need to protect them.
-This is me.

954
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,823
JOURNALIST

955
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,117
-That's why
-Yes?

956
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,786
I can obtain information.

957
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,287
Are you the officer?

958
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,956
No, I'm an ordinary citizen.

959
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,124
See-won, let's go talk.

960
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,628
-Let's discuss this.
-Let's talk it through.

961
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,423
Who have you talked to so far?

962
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,260
-I've just been observing.
-Right.

963
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,886
{\an8}My character...

964
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,931
{\an8}-I'm just...
-I don't have a special role,

965
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,016
{\an8}so there's nothing I can really do.

966
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,393
{\an8}-Right.
-Yeah.

967
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:46,188
{\an8}The player with antibodies
is randomly chosen, right?

968
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,856
{\an8}Right, so it could be any one of us.

969
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,442
{\an8}-The researcher has to find that player
-Oh, right.

970
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,860
{\an8}and perform a task.

971
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,613
{\an8}We need to hold hands here.

972
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,490
{\an8}-Like this.
-Then can we figure it out?

973
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,826
{\an8}-For five seconds.
-The researchers' task is to hold hands?

974
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,703
{\an8}Yes, but don't say it out loud.

975
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,872
{\an8}But in order to develop the cure,
shouldn't they do that then?

976
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,332
{\an8}That's what we're doing.

977
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,754
Seungkwan, you are a researcher.

978
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,674
Dong-joo, you are a researcher.

979
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,926
I got a tough role. This is bad.

980
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,970
<i>For researchers to develop the cure,</i>

981
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,722
<i>they must hold hands with the player</i>

982
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,099
<i>they believe to possess the antibodies
for five seconds</i>

983
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,560
<i>on the bench next to the dealer room.</i>

984
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,478
{\an8}We did it already.

985
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,355
{\an8}-You two did your task?
-Yeah.

986
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,107
{\an8}I had no idea.

987
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,028
Is this the citizens' alliance?

988
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,113
It sort of feels that way.

989
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,740
-You're sharing strategies?
-Yes. Take a seat.

990
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,866
Sit.

991
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,951
This is what I'm wondering.

992
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,912
{\an8}The social distancing plan
from a while ago was suspicious.

993
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,749
If we can maintain
this distance between us...

994
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,500
What was weird to me

995
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:52,296
{\an8}<i>was how See-won and ORBIT
kept going off on their own.</i>

996
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:56,383
{\an8}The most suspicious players
are ORBIT and See-won.

997
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,387
{\an8}Then let's eliminate them in round one.

998
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,598
That makes the most sense.

999
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,475
See-won is acting so suspiciously.

1000
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,392
Watch out.

1001
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,104
One of them could be the fanatic.

1002
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,898
That's plausible.

1003
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,150
-First of all,
-They aren't ordinary for sure.

1004
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,902
we, citizens, are in no rush.

1005
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,655
We just need to wait out round one.

1006
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,865
But certain players
are trying to get things

1007
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,617
-going right now.
-Right.

1008
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,245
<i>The fact that I can
find out someone's identity each round</i>

1009
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,706
is a great advantage
because I can fact-check.

1010
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,750
So I intend to do exactly that

1011
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,086
<i>and share my findings with others.</i>

1012
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,678
{\an8}<i>The social distancing plan...</i>

1013
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,347
{\an8}<i>...was how See-won and ORBIT
kept going off on their own.</i>

1014
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,560
I would like to know See-won's identity.

1015
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,020
Are you a citizen?

1016
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,647
I have no role.

1017
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,981
I'm really bad at lying.

1018
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,526
Okay. Thank you.

1019
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,281
-At the end of round one.
-They announce it at the end.

1020
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,908
Don't they announce it right away?

1021
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,245
Do you have another
winning strategy for citizens?

1022
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,955
-Can you think of another?
-Well...

1023
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,124
-We really need to win.
-Do you know something?

1024
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,292
Are you an ordinary citizen?

1025
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,044
No, I'm not.

1026
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,712
Are you an ordinary citizen?

1027
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,215
I'm diligently researching.

1028
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,093
{\an8}So you're a researcher.
I'm the journalist.

1029
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,138
{\an8}I just confirmed someone's identity,
and they're a terrorist.

1030
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,307
{\an8}See-won, you are a terrorist.

1031
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,017
{\an8}I just had it confirmed.

1032
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,061
{\an8}See-won?

1033
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,312
{\an8}She's a terrorist.

1034
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,025
That's not good.

1035
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,861
The researchers' task is to hold hands?

1036
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,029
-We did it already.
-You two did your task?

1037
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,449
A terrorist knows who the researchers are.

1038
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,409
She got you good.

1039
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,036
<i>I revealed my identity too easily.</i>

1040
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,623
How's it going?

1041
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:55,210
Well, I have good news.

1042
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,172
I think they've started
to develop the cure.

1043
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,214
-No way.
-Really?

1044
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,426
What's up?

1045
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,845
You're not a researcher, are you?

1046
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,555
-Because...
-An attempt has been made.

1047
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,931
For now...

1048
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,683
-She's a terrorist.
-They made an attempt?

1049
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,601
At research.

1050
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,728
-An attempt has been made at research?
-Research?

1051
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,027
STORAGE ROOM

1052
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,362
See-won is a terrorist.

1053
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,281
-See-won? How do you know?
-Are you sure?

1054
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,991
I am. Trust me.

1055
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,534
-I think so too.
-I'm sure of it.

1056
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,161
-Really?
-Come here.

1057
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,496
You're a researcher, right?

1058
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,497
-Then the other researcher...
-No.

1059
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,539
-You said you were.
-I'm an ordinary citizen.

1060
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,124
I said they were making an attempt.

1061
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,127
-I thought you said you were.
-No, I didn't.

1062
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,548
-See-won is a terrorist.
-What?

1063
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,634
She's a terrorist. Okay?

1064
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,177
See-won's a terrorist.

1065
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,182
What are you?

1066
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,475
Which one of these characters?

1067
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,770
I'm a citizen. This one.

1068
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,855
-You're this?
-Yeah.

1069
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,273
It'd be amazing if you were a terrorist.

1070
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,399
I'm not.

1071
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,568
{\an8}I'm the journalist.

1072
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,321
Seriously? The journalist is right there.

1073
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,824
I want to find out who the officer is.

1074
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,035
-Are you the officer?
-The officer...

1075
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,828
Right, you said
you're an ordinary citizen.

1076
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,041
The officer can kill
one player each round.

1077
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,918
-This is wild.
-Right.

1078
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,379
Don't take what I said seriously.

1079
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,339
-I haven't told anyone else about it.
-<i>Kyeong-rim</i>

1080
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,549
<i>has died.</i>

1081
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,927
<i>Kyeong-rim has died.</i>

1082
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,430
<i>Kyeong-rim's character was the journalist.</i>

1083
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,848
-Kyeong-rim.
-Oh, my God!

1084
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,642
-Please enter the dealer room.
-No way.

1085
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,727
You may not speak anymore.

1086
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,646
-Who was it?
-Don't go.

1087
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,357
-Journalist!
-No!

1088
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,483
I got goosebumps.

1089
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,027
No way. So she's dead? Just like that?

1090
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,989
This is crazy.

1091
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,240
She must've died from a bullet.

1092
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:51,034
You can't die
from the infection right now.

1093
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,202
You can't.

1094
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,079
-Right?
-They can only die by bullets.

1095
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,330
You lied to me.

1096
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,332
I admit that I did.

1097
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,376
-Your lie was exposed right away.
-I know.

1098
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,961
<i>...was the journalist.</i>

1099
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,879
-Seriously.
-Oh, my God!

1100
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,172
I was going to tell you

1101
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,675
it was a lie right away.

1102
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,719
But it's not a crime or anything.

1103
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,180
<i>He told me such a big lie.</i>

1104
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,557
I'm sure of him now.

1105
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,058
He told me he was the journalist.

1106
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,435
That clears things up.

1107
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,729
-We can confirm one identity.
-Two identities actually.

1108
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,439
What I'm suspicious of

1109
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,232
is this person told me
they're a researcher.

1110
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,234
I'm a citizen. This one.

1111
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,320
-This person said they're a researcher?
-Yes.

1112
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,196
-Who's the other one?
-They can't be trusted.

1113
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,282
-Who's the other one?
-Guillaume.

1114
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,576
Tell us the truth,
or we'll assume you're a terrorist.

1115
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,494
If he's a researcher,
that would mean that I'm not.

1116
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,412
-Right.
-Right.

1117
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:39,666
{\an8}I'm a beginner at this game,
so I'll be quiet to start.

1118
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,462
So you aren't what you said you were
a while ago, right?

1119
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,925
-You're getting too stressed.
-<i>The time has expired.</i>

1120
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,053
<i>Round two will now begin.</i>

1121
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:54,056
<i>This is the current status of the game.</i>

1122
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,140
Oh, no.

1123
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,516
Oh, man.

1124
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,268
<i>The number of infected players</i>

1125
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,437
<i>is three.</i>

1126
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,065
-Wait a minute.
-It spread already.

1127
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,233
-Who's patient zero?
-We don't know.

1128
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,653
We don't know anything right now.

1129
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,821
The infected will die after this round.

1130
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,699
The terrorists might not
take the antidote right now.

1131
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,243
They can survive the infection
for one round,

1132
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,788
so a terrorist might be infected.

1133
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,414
-So it spread.
-It's so complicated.

1134
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,501
I got it.

1135
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,296
{\an8}Look, the terrorists
target the furthest person.

1136
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,382
{\an8}She linked arms with me.

1137
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,466
I think that's when it happened.

1138
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,135
<i>I think See-won infected me</i>

1139
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,805
<i>since I'm the furthest away from her.</i>

1140
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,139
I'll die by the next round.

1141
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,391
I'll die too.

1142
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,642
You do.

1143
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,560
-So...
-This is tough.

1144
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,820
The terrorists had no reason
to kill the journalist.

1145
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:53,281
They had to because they could be
exposed by the journalist.

1146
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,700
No, think about it.

1147
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,619
Let's say I'm a terrorist
and someone suspects that I am one.

1148
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,414
If I kill that person,
that confirms they're the journalist.

1149
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,249
Then the terrorists
have no reason to kill them.

1150
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,085
The journalist is also a citizen,

1151
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,547
so it makes sense
for the terrorists to kill them.

1152
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,298
-Really?
-That would be safer.

1153
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,675
-Then that would mean
-The danger is there.

1154
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,885
the officer did nothing in the last round.

1155
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,304
Why didn't the officer
kill anyone in round one?

1156
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,306
They could have, but they didn't.

1157
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,142
There's no way they killed Kyeong-rim.

1158
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,685
-They could have.
-It's possible.

1159
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,437
Maybe they were scared of the terrorists.

1160
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,272
The officer is a passive person.

1161
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,399
{\an8}-The officer...
-It could be Yu-min.

1162
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,817
-I'll go get her.
-Yeah, bring her.

1163
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,735
Bring her here.

1164
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,408
What is this?

1165
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:37,826
You startled me.

1166
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,829
-Come in.
-Anyway...

1167
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,206
-No, she can't.
-Yu-min, come with us.

1168
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,250
-Why are you trying to take me?
-We're in trouble.

1169
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,752
-What is going on?
-We're talking right now.

1170
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,086
-It'll be quick.
-Come with us.

1171
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,713
-What's going on?
-Why me?

1172
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,131
-We're not done.
-I'm scared.

1173
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,924
-We need to talk first.
-Just one minute.

1174
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,760
-After a minute, let's talk.
-Okay.

1175
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,179
-Just one minute, all right?
-Wait.

1176
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,847
I'm sure of Dong-jae.

1177
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,265
I'm 100% sure.

1178
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,934
-I'm sure of Dong-jae's identity.
-Dong-jae?

1179
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,853
He keeps getting in our way.

1180
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:08,106
If we look at it this way, it makes sense.

1181
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,691
{\an8}Kyeong-rim died, right?

1182
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,651
{\an8}-That was a dead giveaway.
-It really was.

1183
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,738
<i>Everything she said turned out to be true.</i>

1184
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,031
We're sure of that.

1185
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,699
The other one
is most likely to be this person.

1186
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,827
I don't get why the terrorists
killed the journalist.

1187
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,204
Assuming that they did.

1188
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,998
The journalist told everyone
who one of the terrorists was.

1189
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,500
She revealed it to the others?

1190
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,959
-Yes.
-She didn't tell me.

1191
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,503
-You didn't hear?
-No.

1192
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,088
<i>She told us See-won is a terrorist.</i>

1193
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,799
Who's the other terrorist?

1194
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:34,925
I don't know.

1195
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:35,926
How about ORBIT?

1196
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:36,885
ORBIT is a citizen.

1197
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,969
-Is he a citizen?
-Yes.

1198
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,096
-ORBIT.
-Yes? I'm coming.

1199
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,600
Who are you sure is a citizen?

1200
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,645
There is a citizen I'm sure about.
What do you two think?

1201
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,063
He says he's a citizen,

1202
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,606
-and so do you.
-Right.

1203
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,818
-And See-won is a terrorist.
-That's right.

1204
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,152
-You're sure of that?
-I am.

1205
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,197
I think you're a citizen.

1206
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,282
An ordinary citizen.

1207
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:03,161
No offense to you Dong-jae,
but I'm suspicious of you.

1208
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,915
All I've done so far is gather information

1209
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,708
-and share it with others.
-Right.

1210
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,418
-Right, but...
-Maybe...

1211
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,504
-But...
-Maybe you've been gaslighted.

1212
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,130
-Possibly.
-That's what I think.

1213
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,925
If my hunch about you is wrong,

1214
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,718
I'll help you in the next game.

1215
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,595
I'll trust in your honesty then.

1216
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,972
-Okay.
-I'm just

1217
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,890
trying to do my best here.

1218
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,017
Right. We're all doing that.

1219
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,102
You're clean, right?

1220
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,521
Yes, I'm completely clean.

1221
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,981
Why did you suspect me then?

1222
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,525
You just seemed suspicious.

1223
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,443
You could've been flustered
because of your character.

1224
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,528
I was.

1225
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,988
-In my opinion...
-Yes?

1226
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,115
This person is the officer.

1227
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,576
They should've killed someone
in round one.

1228
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,828
But they didn't
because they didn't understand the rules.

1229
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,457
So the officer has to be bad at this game.

1230
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,834
And it has to be him.

1231
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,253
The officer should've killed someone

1232
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,673
<i>because Kyeong-rim told everyone
that number eight was a terrorist.</i>

1233
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,050
<i>Only Guillaume wouldn't get that.</i>

1234
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,719
That's what confirmed it for me.

1235
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,430
-Apparently, everyone's a citizen.
-Let's talk. Just us two.

1236
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,973
Guillaume,

1237
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,475
you're the officer, right?

1238
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,477
You didn't kill anyone in round one.

1239
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,105
You made a mistake, right?
You had to kill someone.

1240
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:14,983
Am I right?

1241
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,277
The officer has to do something
in round two.

1242
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,529
If you don't say anything, we can't win.

1243
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:23,116
You have to kill a terrorist
in this round.

1244
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,911
Can you come here for a second?

1245
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,037
Sure.

1246
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,164
-You have to kill a terrorist.
-If I'm sure?

1247
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,042
If you don't want to be exposed,
kill this person.

1248
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,377
<i>You have to kill number eight.</i>

1249
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,671
<i>Kyeong-rim confirmed her identity.</i>

1250
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,382
-She's a terrorist?
-She definitely is.

1251
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,468
Kill her or we won't win.

1252
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,012
Kill her. You want to win, right?

1253
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:44,930
Gather around.

1254
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,265
Citizens are in a crisis right now.

1255
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,350
It's looking bad.

1256
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,726
As time passes,

1257
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,436
-it's getting tougher.
-We can't win.

1258
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,022
<i>Also, an important character has died.</i>

1259
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,485
If I get tested for the virus
and get a positive result,

1260
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,238
we can figure out several things
including who infected me.

1261
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,032
I'll leave it at that.
And as for the officer...

1262
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,993
I'm sorry for saying this

1263
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,705
but See-won has to be a terrorist
if I get a positive result.

1264
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:11,957
-If you're infected?
-Yes.

1265
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,501
If I get a negative result,
this theory could be wrong.

1266
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,169
-You're going to get tested?
-I will.

1267
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,420
TESTING STATION

1268
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,007
{\an8}PUSH THE BUTTON
TO FIND OUT IF YOU'RE INFECTED

1269
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,759
TEST RESULT
YOU HAVE BEEN INFECTED

1270
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,052
Okay.

1271
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,887
I'm sure now.

1272
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,472
-I'm infected.
-You are?

1273
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,765
I have the virus.

1274
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,433
So we're sure now.

1275
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,770
-Yu-min and Dong-joo are also infected.
-You're right.

1276
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,896
Help me.

1277
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:40,068
<i>If ORBIT's theory that he was
the first to be infected is correct,</i>

1278
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,154
<i>ORBIT will die once round three begins.</i>

1279
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:47,784
<i>When round four begins,
Yu-min and Dong-joo will also die.</i>

1280
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,078
I believe See-won infected me.

1281
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,330
-That's highly likely.
-Why?

1282
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,374
-She must have done something.
-Yes, she did.

1283
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,751
-What?
-She linked arms with me.

1284
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,086
That's not it.

1285
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,046
I can prove it.

1286
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,798
-What are you doing?
-What is this?

1287
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,050
-Why me?
-Are you infected now?

1288
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,385
-Why me?
-Yes.

1289
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,220
-He's infected?
-Seok-jin,

1290
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,596
you've probably been infected.

1291
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,015
Oh, no!

1292
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,475
Does that really matter though?

1293
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,437
I think the infection
could have happened remotely.

1294
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,605
<i>Kyeong-rim said she confirmed
the identity through a phone.</i>

1295
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,900
Maybe the action itself
doesn't really matter.

1296
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,570
Sure, there could be
different possibilities.

1297
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,530
But considering the likeliest options,

1298
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,533
unfortunately, I think
See-won is a terrorist.

1299
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,869
Since he's defending her,
Dong-jae is suspicious too.

1300
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,871
<i>See-won has died.</i>

1301
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,873
<i>See-won has died.</i>

1302
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,500
<i>See-won's character</i>

1303
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,085
<i>was a terrorist.</i>

1304
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,628
See-won, please enter the dealer room.

1305
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,963
Wait a minute.

1306
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,136
<i>As soon as I found out
Kyeong-rim was the journalist,</i>

1307
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,680
<i>I killed her immediately.</i>

1308
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:55,185
<i>Even if I died,
I could protect the other terrorist.</i>

1309
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,561
Welcome.

1310
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,522
-It's so hard.
-It was tough, right?

1311
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,982
It really was tough.

1312
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:05,361
I can't imagine how hard
being a terrorist must have been.

1313
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,073
I wonder who the officer is.
They killed me.

1314
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:11,534
By having a terrorist eliminated,

1315
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,369
I've proven my innocence, right?

1316
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,538
Currently, Dong-jae
seems the most suspicious.

1317
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,790
-Me?
-Yes.

1318
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,542
-For defending See-won?
-Exactly.

1319
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,669
If Kyeong-rim wasn't the journalist,

1320
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,005
things would've been
much more complicated.

1321
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,256
But she told everyone everything

1322
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,550
-when she was alive.
-She did.

1323
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,511
<i>She was such an open journalist.</i>

1324
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:33,348
-She was loved by all of us.
-We should've protected her.

1325
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,183
-She was like a war correspondent.
-Right.

1326
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,643
-Seriously.
-A true journalist.

1327
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,646
With her death,
things have become crystal clear.

1328
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,856
-This is ridiculous.
-To summarize,

1329
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,402
the terrorist can't wipe the citizens out
within the next four or five turns.

1330
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,364
Right now, four citizens remain.

1331
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,908
Seok-jin and Dong-jae are in danger.

1332
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,035
Dong-jae has an antidote, so he's fine.

1333
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,453
Wait a minute.

1334
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,122
I'm really sorry.

1335
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,081
If I'm wrong,

1336
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,166
-I'll help you in the next game.
-It's fine.

1337
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,752
-I'll just keep quiet.
-And then Seok-jin will get infected.

1338
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,796
This is a bit tame
for the first episode of a Netflix show.

1339
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,840
Well, this is science.

1340
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,843
Maybe <i>The Devil's Plan</i>
shouldn't have invited

1341
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,719
a science communicator to the show.

1342
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,096
You steamrolled the competition.

1343
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,432
<i>The game involved science,</i>

1344
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,184
<i>so I couldn't help it.</i>

1345
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,603
It was a one-man show by me.

1346
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,688
This is science.

1347
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,982
{\an8}Remember what I said?

1348
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,025
{\an8}The officer killed her
as soon as I told him to.

1349
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,694
{\an8}You have to kill number eight.

1350
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,904
{\an8}<i>See-won has died.</i>

1351
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,282
{\an8}-We know who the officer is.
-We do.

1352
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,950
-It's over now.
-I knew right away.

1353
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,577
-You're not a terrorist?
-I'm not.

1354
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,579
Why would I be?

1355
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,622
Didn't I tell you who the terrorist was?

1356
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,957
She said See-won is a terrorist.

1357
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,292
She is?

1358
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:45,211
Why would a terrorist
betray their partner?

1359
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,754
-You have a point.
-I guess.

1360
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,132
If Guillaume kills Dong-jae,

1361
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,383
the game ends.

1362
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,511
But if that happens,
the episode might get cut short.

1363
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,555
Dong-jae, join us.

1364
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,807
"Us"? I'm being left out, remember?

1365
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,851
It wasn't your choice to be a terrorist.

1366
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,436
I'm not a terrorist.

1367
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,980
I say this because I feel bad.

1368
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,316
<i>If I were a terrorist,</i>

1369
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,984
<i>I'd feel the same way.</i>

1370
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,653
WORK ROOM

1371
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,906
I feel so bad for him.

1372
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,034
Dong-jae, I'm really sorry.

1373
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,160
I'm not a terrorist.

1374
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,204
-<i>Seungkwan has died.</i>
-I said this earlier...

1375
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,248
<i>-Seungkwan has died.</i>
-What?

1376
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,792
-<i>Seungkwan's character...</i>
-What?

1377
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,169
<i>...was a researcher.</i>

1378
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,796
-Seungkwan, please enter the dealer room.
-Researcher.

1379
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,345
Seungkwan!

1380
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,556
The game is no joke.

1381
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,683
I saw the wickedness of man.

1382
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,311
<i>I shouldn't hold hands
with strangers so easily.</i>

1383
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,979
I was such a fool.

1384
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:45,897
Are you all right?

1385
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,398
-No, I'm not.
-Do you feel wronged?

1386
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,567
I don't have any abilities.

1387
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,860
You don't?

1388
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,278
Why do I have to die?

1389
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,365
-I've lost my motivation.
-Who do you think it is?

1390
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,867
It doesn't matter what I think.

1391
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,827
I can't even share my opinion.

1392
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,454
<i>He seemed really upset.</i>

1393
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:06,084
Would a terrorist get that upset about
being suspected as a terrorist?

1394
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,545
If Dong-jae dies and he's a terrorist,
then the game ends.

1395
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,462
If not...

1396
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,381
If not, then it would mean
I made a mistake.

1397
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,549
It's unlikely though.

1398
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,342
<i>The time has expired.</i>

1399
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,387
<i>Round three begins now.</i>

1400
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,640
<i>Here are the deaths due to the virus.</i>

1401
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,434
<i>-ORBIT has died.</i>
-Okay.

1402
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,437
<i>-ORBIT was an ordinary citizen.</i>
-Oh, no.

1403
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,398
<i>Currently,</i>

1404
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,525
<i>four people are infected.</i>

1405
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,568
Four?

1406
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,238
Seok-jin, you've been infected.

1407
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,239
I have.

1408
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:40,159
HA SEOK-JIN, KIM DONG-JAE

1409
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,248
-Wait. Dong-joo.
-It's four now.

1410
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:48,167
-Can you develop the cure alone?
-Yes.

1411
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,794
Shouldn't we work together?

1412
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,589
I could have the antibodies.

1413
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,631
Right.

1414
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,883
What do you need to do
to develop the cure?

1415
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,678
Wait, I'm going to die this round.

1416
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,223
I can only prep for the cure this round.

1417
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,391
I can't make the cure.

1418
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:04,892
What?

1419
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,186
<i>Without having started
the cure-development process,</i>

1420
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,730
<i>Seungkwan has already died.</i>

1421
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:11,357
<i>Dong-joo will die when
the next round begins,</i>

1422
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,110
<i>so the cure cannot be developed.</i>

1423
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:19,616
<i>The only plan for survival now
is to kill the remaining terrorist.</i>

1424
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,577
-Who's the officer? We have to find them.
-It's Guillaume.

1425
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,245
-Is that possible?
-Guillaume.

1426
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,831
Who did you decide on?

1427
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,291
We need to end the game.

1428
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,751
It's over soon.

1429
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,377
Who did you decide on?

1430
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,255
-Seeing how he's so upset...
-Dong-jae?

1431
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,840
He's so upset right now.

1432
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,342
That doesn't mean much.

1433
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,761
-Really?
-Yes, in a game like this.

1434
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:43,222
I also think it's Dong-jae.

1435
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,599
-It is him.
-No? Then who?

1436
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,600
-I'm not sure.
-No.

1437
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,060
-It's either him or Seok-jin.
-Hang on.

1438
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,269
Don't kill anyone else.

1439
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,562
-It's Dong-jae.
-It's him.

1440
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,898
He lied to me about being the journalist.

1441
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:52,982
I'm the journalist.

1442
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:58,154
Everyone seems to be
certain about Dong-jae's identity,

1443
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:02,575
<i>so it seems like the game will end
with his death by the officer.</i>

1444
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,827
-Are you a terrorist?
-Me?

1445
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,163
I swear I'm telling the truth.

1446
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,248
You're the only one I can trust.

1447
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:17,006
Personally, I think
there's only one clear suspect.

1448
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,132
{\an8}This person.

1449
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,425
{\an8}CHO YEON-WOO

1450
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,345
{\an8}<i>She's the one
that I interacted the least with.</i>

1451
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,723
So far, Yeon-woo has the least interaction
with other players.

1452
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,600
<i>For example, Joon-bin and Hye-sung</i>

1453
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,062
<i>are all working so hard
on the front lines.</i>

1454
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,898
It can't be anyone else.

1455
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:38,152
What are you?

1456
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,279
-What's your role?
-I'm a citizen.

1457
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,156
-Just an ordinary citizen?
-This is

1458
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,033
how I've been playing from the start.

1459
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,080
-Dong-jae.
-Tell me the truth.

1460
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,915
-I mean...
-I'm disappointed in you, Dong-jae.

1461
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,584
-Me?
-A terrorist... I'm really disappointed.

1462
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,295
How could you say
Seok-jin's an ordinary citizen?

1463
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,631
-He told me that. What else can I say?
-Be honest.

1464
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,175
He said...

1465
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,802
-It's not like I lied to you.
-But why...

1466
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,554
-Yes?
-Why only talk with him?

1467
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,431
-Other citizens are here.
-You know why?

1468
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,182
Because they're the terrorist and fanatic.

1469
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,100
-Exactly.
-Wait.

1470
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:13,062
The terrorist wouldn't want to
kill the fanatic.

1471
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,440
The terrorists have used up
both their bullets.

1472
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:18,192
They can't kill anyone anymore.

1473
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,986
You didn't know that, did you?

1474
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,405
-You guys don't even know anything.
-What? Why?

1475
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,365
The terrorists used both their bullets.

1476
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,616
-When?
-Did they?

1477
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,703
They used one on Kyeong-rim,
then another on Seungkwan.

1478
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,538
-They're out of bullets.
-Wait.

1479
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,706
-Seriously.
-I hadn't thought of that.

1480
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,207
You couldn't even think of that,

1481
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,625
-and you accuse me?
-I thought one was left.

1482
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,627
-Wait a minute, Yeon-woo.
-Let's backtrack.

1483
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,379
Are you really a citizen?

1484
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,797
I definitely am.

1485
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,632
Wait, this is crazy.

1486
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,968
We're getting nowhere.

1487
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:49,682
The terrorists are out of bullets, right?

1488
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,435
{\an8}They're not.

1489
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,478
No?

1490
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,520
Why not?

1491
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,523
This is how.

1492
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,317
-Really?
-Seriously?

1493
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,234
Yeah.

1494
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,779
This is crazy.

1495
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,071
Guillaume, just a moment.

1496
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,949
Let's talk with Yeon-woo.

1497
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,660
-You have crucial information?
-I do.

1498
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,954
Guillaume, you killed Seungkwan, right?

1499
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,831
-I did.
-Why?

1500
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,666
He was a terrorist.

1501
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,918
You thought he was?

1502
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,002
He was.

1503
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,755
-No, he wasn't.
-He wasn't!

1504
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,174
Why didn't you discuss it with us?

1505
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,968
I think he acted on minimal suspicion.

1506
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,846
You killed him without knowing?
We were all talking about it.

1507
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,556
No one told me.

1508
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,559
We have five minutes left.

1509
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,186
Who's our suspect?

1510
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,688
All of a sudden,

1511
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,983
-I have a feeling it's Guillaume.
-No, I don't think it's him.

1512
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,026
Guillaume said

1513
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,821
he killed Seungkwan.

1514
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,490
-When?
-Just now.

1515
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,242
-He said he killed him?
-Yeah.

1516
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:52,411
-I told him...
-He claims he's the officer

1517
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,580
and that he killed him by mistake.

1518
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,666
This is driving me crazy.

1519
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,876
-He said he's the officer?
-Yeah.

1520
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:00,753
Guillaume!

1521
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,048
The terrorists didn't use both bullets.

1522
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:04,966
They didn't?

1523
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:07,927
-The officer killed one.
-But Kyeong-rim...

1524
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,053
I'm the officer.

1525
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,429
I'm the officer.

1526
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,722
I'm the officer!

1527
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,433
What?

1528
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,063
{\an8}Seok-jin, you are the officer.

1529
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,317
I want to find out who the officer is.

1530
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,944
<i>I wasn't sure of anything in round one.</i>

1531
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,196
<i>So I wanted to save my bullets.</i>

1532
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,490
I believe See-won infected me.

1533
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,783
She linked arms with me.

1534
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,743
I can prove it.

1535
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,078
What are you doing?

1536
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,372
-Why me?
-Are you infected now?

1537
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,623
Why me?

1538
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,543
-He's infected?
-Seok-jin, you've probably been infected.

1539
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,505
Number eight.

1540
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:51,637
{\an8}TO KILL A PLAYER, FLIP THE BOOK
WITH THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER

1541
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,764
<i>See-won has died.</i>

1542
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,809
<i>See-won's character was a terrorist.</i>

1543
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,729
A terrorist pretending to be the officer.

1544
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:00,771
<i>That was his plan.</i>

1545
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,565
-He said he's the officer?
-Yeah.

1546
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,651
As the real officer,
I can't let that slide.

1547
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,653
Seok-jin.

1548
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:08,863
I'm killing Guillaume.

1549
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,990
-No, it's not him.
-Why?

1550
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,868
He could just lay low and survive.
Why would he act rashly?

1551
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:14,827
For what reason?

1552
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:19,206
We've only got five minutes left.
I've got to act.

1553
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,124
What do you think?

1554
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,585
-You're the officer.
-I still think it's Yeon-woo.

1555
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:23,836
-Who?
-Yeon-woo.

1556
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,339
Everyone outside...

1557
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,673
Guillaume said...

1558
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,300
-He said he killed Seungkwan?
-Yes.

1559
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:30,801
What was his reason?

1560
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,386
As the officer,

1561
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,306
-he said he wasn't sure about Seungkwan.
-No.

1562
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,682
-That doesn't make sense.
-Look here.

1563
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,934
Listen to me.

1564
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,311
He's the fanatic.

1565
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,939
-He wants to be killed?
-Yes, he's asking to be killed.

1566
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,315
We shouldn't kill him.

1567
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:45,942
The fanatic is...

1568
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,318
What are you?

1569
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,986
Tell me the truth.

1570
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,363
I'm not the officer.

1571
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,364
Are you a citizen?

1572
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,074
-I'm an ordinary citizen.
-Really?

1573
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:56,869
<i>If he didn't have to die right now,
he wouldn't have said anything.</i>

1574
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,996
He's asking to be killed

1575
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,831
-because he has to die.
-Are you a citizen?

1576
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,667
-I'm a citizen.
-Who do you want dead?

1577
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,793
Yeon-woo.

1578
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:06,128
-You...
-I don't think it's Yeon-woo.

1579
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,755
See? No one's sure.

1580
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:08,881
-If I go outside and...
-No one's sure.

1581
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,967
-Do you trust Guillaume then?
-If I...

1582
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,343
I don't trust him.

1583
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:13,427
So he's the fanatic?

1584
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,804
-He has to be the fanatic,
-Okay.

1585
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,305
-judging by what he's saying.
-Okay.

1586
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,224
We have no time. We have to end this.

1587
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,350
Who will you kill?

1588
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:20,393
I'm not the officer.

1589
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,144
-You're not?
-No.

1590
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,604
He's not.

1591
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,106
This is crazy.

1592
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,484
{\an8}What the fuck? Seriously.

1593
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:29,527
It's not Dong-jae?

1594
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,153
It's not me. Damn it!

1595
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,364
Why? Who is it then?

1596
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,032
{\an8}Guillaume's the fanatic.

1597
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,283
What?

1598
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,661
Guillaume has to be eliminated.

1599
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,663
Wait a minute.

1600
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,164
-Yeon-woo.
-Who is it?

1601
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,752
-Who?
-Yeon-woo.

1602
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,671
-Isn't it Guillaume?
-I...

1603
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,714
-Sorry?
-Isn't it Guillaume?

1604
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,215
But Yeon-woo...

1605
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:52,675
Me?

1606
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:53,801
Are you a citizen?

1607
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,177
I am. Why doubt me?

1608
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,849
-Dong-jae is...
-Then come declare your innocence.

1609
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,893
<i>Round three ends in three minutes.</i>

1610
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,812
-We don't have time.
-Look here.

1611
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:07,064
-You said they used both bullets, right?
-Hurry up.

1612
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,734
How are you sure
the terrorists are out of bullets?

1613
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,360
That's the only explanation.

1614
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,529
Guillaume killed one.

1615
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:17,033
Guillaume killed Seungkwan, right?

1616
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,409
How much time is left?

1617
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,827
-Did you kill him?
-No.

1618
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,620
-So you lied to us?
-Dong-jae.

1619
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,372
-I did.
-I mean...

1620
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,375
Officer? It's Guillaume.

1621
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,294
-I don't think it's him.
-You don't?

1622
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,130
He wants to be killed.

1623
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:32,923
One minute left!

1624
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,676
-What do we do?
<i>-Round three ends in one minute.</i>

1625
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,219
-Just trust me.
-Are you the fanatic then?

1626
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,221
-He is.
-What's going on with the game?

1627
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,640
-Exactly.
-It's not Dong-jae?

1628
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,725
-It's not me.
-Dong-jae...

1629
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:43,893
I'm counting on you.

1630
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,186
Go with Dong-jae...

1631
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,646
Trust your gut.

1632
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,482
-Oh, no!
-Wait a minute.

1633
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:51,859
Ten.

1634
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,199
Things are getting crazy.

1635
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,826
<i>Yeon-woo has died.</i>

1636
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,745
-Please!
-Please!

1637
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,246
<i>Yeon-woo's character was...</i>

1638
