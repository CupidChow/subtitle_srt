1
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,925
{\an8}Dong-jae moves six spaces backward.

2
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,346
{\an8}He has moved.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,848
We need to land on the offices.

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,974
-Right.
-Yeah.

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,934
Moving six spaces backward was a big blow.

6
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,519
<i>After moving six spaces backward,</i>

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,854
{\an8}my head started to spin.

8
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,564
Dong-joo, take it slow.

9
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,733
-I can't control the result.
-Please roll the dice.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,361
Escape. Nothing happens.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,196
-This is good.
-This is better.

12
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,911
One.

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:37,871
You move one space.

14
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,497
Will things work out for me?

15
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,458
You're lucky, Dong-jae.

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,959
-Prison.
-It didn't work out.

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,377
I was due to go.

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,379
Dong-jae moves to prison.

19
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,049
-I got one space.
-Better than nothing.

20
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,845
You moved one space.

21
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,930
-Dong-jae, please roll the dice.
-I will use the ticket.

22
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,015
He's out of the prison now.

23
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,725
You have escaped prison.

24
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,269
-Two.
-Two.

25
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,104
-ORBIT.
-Good job. Congratulations!

26
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,522
-You finished second.
-Congratulations.

27
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,776
-Second place.
-It's all over now.

28
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,444
{\an8}I will use this.

29
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,904
{\an8}-Who will you send back?
-I will...

30
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,572
Don't let him land on the office.

31
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,324
-Even if he rolls a three.
-Stop Dong-jae.

32
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,284
-Stop Dong-jae.
-If we stop him, even if he rolls a three,

33
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,119
-He can't go.
-he can't land there?

34
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,204
-Send him back.
-In that case,

35
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,706
I will send Dong-jae

36
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,542
-one space backward.
-Dong-jae moves

37
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,835
-one space backward.
-Okay.

38
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,220
With two escape tickets,
I will send Guillaume and Dong-jae...

39
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,140
both one space backward.

40
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,685
Guillaume and Dong-jae,
you each move one space backward.

41
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,605
I will discard one escape ticket

42
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,941
and send Dong-jae one space backward.

43
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,026
Dong-jae, you move one space backward.

44
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,445
That's the smart thing to do.

45
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,282
With two escape tickets, I will send
Guillaume and Dong-jae backward.

46
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,410
Guillaume and Dong-jae,
you each move one space backward.

47
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,246
This is tough.

48
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,540
I can use three escape tickets.

49
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,792
This time, I'll use all three on Dong-jae.

50
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,628
Dong-jae, you move three spaces backward.

51
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,299
Those who have tickets will be likely
to finish in the next round.

52
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,259
It's highly likely.

53
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,554
{\an8}<i>Currently, four players
have finished the game.</i>

54
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,807
{\an8}<i>Dong-joo will cross
the finish line imminently,</i>

55
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,143
<i>and Seungkwan is in prison.</i>

56
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,562
<i>Having been last for most of the game,</i>

57
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,482
<i>Yeon-woo is now level
with Guillaume and Dong-jae.</i>

58
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,693
Please roll the dice.

59
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,944
Let's finish it.

60
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,445
Okay!

61
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,905
Great job.

62
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,031
You did great.

63
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,658
Dong-joo, you crossed the finish line.

64
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,661
-You did great.
-I almost died.

65
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,746
{\an8}I was part of a team,

66
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,915
<i>but at some point, I had to survive.</i>

67
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,293
It was an inevitable choice.

68
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,335
Next, Seungkwan.

69
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,378
You get one if you escape.

70
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,172
-I'll use this.
-Will you use one?

71
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,798
Let's escape.

72
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,426
-Seungkwan, leave one ticket.
-Okay.

73
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:58,761
-Okay.
-One.

74
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,679
-That's a relief.
-Go.

75
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,889
You moved one space.

76
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,848
Next, Guillaume.

77
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,932
-Two.
-Two.

78
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,726
-You move two spaces.
-Okay.

79
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,853
Next, Dong-jae, you move two spaces.

80
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,854
Next, See-won.

81
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,440
-This roll is important.
-It is.

82
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,358
Each roll is so crucial.

83
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,819
{\an8}Prison.

84
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,867
-I'm going to prison again.
-No way.

85
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,785
I know how that feels.

86
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,829
-Next, Hye-sung.
-I know how it feels.

87
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,706
-You still have a chance.
-How many times have I been to prison?

88
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,916
You still have a chance.

89
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,001
I'm so scared.

90
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,502
{\an8}Just move forward.

91
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,504
{\an8}-Two.
-That's a relief.

92
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,881
-Just move forward.
-That's good.

93
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,466
-You move two spaces.
-You're close.

94
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,135
-Next, Yeon-woo.
-Roll a three.

95
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,803
-You got this.
-Time for my last spurt.

96
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,807
Prison.

97
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,768
-How could you?
-It's over for me.

98
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,686
It's an endless journey to prison.

99
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,230
What is it with prison?

100
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,065
Kyeong-rim, please roll the dice.

101
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,358
I want to escape!

102
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,817
-Please escape.
-Roll escape.

103
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,362
{\an8}Two.

104
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,739
{\an8}-You failed to escape.
-That's a shame.

105
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,407
-Yeon-woo.
-Yes?

106
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,326
Due to your personal rule,
you gain one escape ticket.

107
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,869
-Congratulations.
-What?

108
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,913
{\an8}IF THE LEADING PLAYER ROLLS A TWO,
I RECEIVE ONE ESCAPE TICKET

109
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,874
{\an8}-Yeon-woo, what's going on?
-I still have a chance.

110
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,459
{\an8}Kyeong-rim, you rolled a two.

111
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,461
Your rule is saving you.

112
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,921
Next, Seungkwan.

113
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,339
You're done now.

114
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,465
-What?
-We're out of tickets.

115
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,217
Leave one ticket

116
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,804
-and use the rest.
-Then I'll use it on each of them.

117
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,305
Just one space backward.

118
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,433
Guillaume and Dong-jae,
you each move one space backward.

119
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,559
Please roll the dice.

120
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,355
{\an8}-Three.
-Great job!

121
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,399
{\an8}-Great job, everyone.
-Well done, Seungkwan.

122
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,693
-You did great.
-I only finished

123
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,027
because everyone helped me.

124
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,029
Seungkwan, you crossed the finish line.

125
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,824
Almost no one is getting tickets now.

126
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,325
We have a chance.

127
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,579
<i>Dong-joo and Seungkwan
have crossed the finish line.</i>

128
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,667
{\an8}<i>It seems that the escape ticket strategy
of the majority alliance</i>

129
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,837
{\an8}<i>will no longer work.</i>

130
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,797
{\an8}Next, Guillaume, you move one space.

131
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,425
{\an8}Next, Dong-jae, you rolled escape
and nothing happens.

132
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,593
{\an8}See-won, you rolled a three
and failed to escape.

133
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,012
{\an8}Hye-sung, you rolled a one.

134
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,223
Yeon-woo, will you use your escape ticket?

135
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,599
Please roll the dice.

136
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,727
{\an8}Prison.

137
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,813
{\an8}-What's up with you?
-What's wrong with me?

138
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,606
What a twist of fate.

139
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
This game isn't for me.

140
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,860
-Next, Guillaume.
-It's your turn.

141
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,778
-Hye-sung is our only bet.
-It's now or never.

142
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,324
{\an8}-Prison.
-Guillaume!

143
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,034
What is this?

144
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,535
How many are in prison right now?

145
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,663
Next, Dong-jae.

146
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,208
-Three.
-Dong-jae's back in the game.

147
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,335
You move three spaces.

148
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,545
See-won, please roll the dice.

149
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,588
See-won, please.

150
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,965
Please.

151
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,260
{\an8}You rolled a two and failed to escape.

152
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,513
You just need to finish
within tenth place, right?

153
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,599
Yeah, the eleventh and twelfth
will get eliminated.

154
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,809
Two.

155
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,394
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

156
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,188
Okay.

157
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,607
Hye-sung, you crossed the finish line.

158
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,941
Do you have tickets?

159
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,109
-No.
-Please roll the dice.

160
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,235
{\an8}-How many Pieces do you have?
-Four.

161
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,071
{\an8}Four? Wait a minute.

162
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,656
{\an8}<i>Currently, five players remain.</i>

163
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,575
{\an8}<i>With just one Piece,</i>

164
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,453
{\an8}<i>Yeon-woo will get eliminated
if she finishes in the last three.</i>

165
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,414
{\an8}<i>With two Pieces each,
See-won and Kyeong-rim</i>

166
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,543
{\an8}<i>must finish within the tenth
for any chance of survival.</i>

167
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,546
Yeon-woo, due to your personal rule,
you gain one escape ticket.

168
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,672
{\an8}The leading player rolled a two.

169
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,632
{\an8}-You're getting lucky.
-Exactly.

170
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,592
This isn't good.

171
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,094
Next, Yeon-woo.

172
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,011
-Here's my ticket.
-Let's escape.

173
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,471
Will you use your escape ticket?

174
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,431
Damn, wait a minute.

175
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,892
Damn it.

176
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,394
-Yeon-woo, go for it.
-This is my last...

177
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,730
-You won't go to prison again, will you?
-It's neck and neck right now.

178
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,524
The people in prison...

179
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,235
{\an8}You rolled escape. Nothing happens.

180
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,361
{\an8}This is unbelievable.

181
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,695
Next, Dong-jae.

182
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,701
Dong-jae, you're not in prison.

183
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,744
So you can move.

184
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,412
Do you have a ticket?

185
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,330
-No.
-She used it.

186
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,665
-I used it.
-You did?

187
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,711
{\an8}-You rolled escape. Nothing happens.
-Escape?

188
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,463
-Others could really use that escape roll.
-Next, See-won.

189
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,215
Why did I roll escape?

190
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,136
How do I up my chances of rolling escape?

191
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,137
Should I roll for you?

192
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,186
Nice!

193
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,146
You can do it.

194
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,440
-You can do it. Stay focused.
-She's alive.

195
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,483
-She has a chance.
-You can do it.

196
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,779
See-won had a sudden stroke of luck.

197
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,905
Please roll the dice.

198
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,366
Yeon-woo and Kyeong-rim are...

199
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,703
{\an8}-One.
-One.

200
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,413
{\an8}-Okay.
-You move one space.

201
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,831
Okay.

202
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,875
-Yeon-woo, please roll the dice.
-You can do it.

203
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,418
This roll is crucial.

204
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,920
-Okay!
-Three.

205
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:43,921
{\an8}Nice, Yeon-woo!

206
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,465
{\an8}-Nice.
-You move three spaces.

207
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,425
Anything can happen now.

208
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,926
-Anything can happen.
-Kyeong-rim.

209
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,846
{\an8}Guillaume, you failed to escape.

210
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,014
Next, Dong-jae.

211
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,224
{\an8}What do you want? A one?

212
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,268
{\an8}Dong-jae has to move forward.

213
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,061
-You're right.
-Otherwise, he'll go to prison again.

214
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,354
-I guess.
-Prison.

215
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,442
{\an8}-Dong-jae, you move to prison.
-Dong-jae.

216
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,110
{\an8}It's okay.

217
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,279
-This is unpredictable.
-This is crazy.

218
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,989
The roll of the dice
is really unpredictable.

219
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,116
-Next, See-won.
-What's happening?

220
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,451
-What...
-That was unlucky.

221
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,705
{\an8}-Prison.
-No way.

222
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,624
{\an8}What a twist of fate.

223
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,460
You move to prison.

224
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,129
It's okay, Dong-jae.

225
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,923
They're all in prison. You can do it.

226
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,132
Just don't come in last.

227
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,384
You can do it.

228
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,511
-I can't...
-You can do it.

229
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,679
save anyone anymore.

230
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,015
-You got this.
-This is hell.

231
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,893
I can't save See-won.

232
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,312
I can't save Guillaume.

233
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,899
{\an8}-Two.
-Okay.

234
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,068
{\an8}-She gets an escape ticket.
-You have landed on an office.

235
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,027
I'd like a ticket.

236
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,154
-If you roll, you could get prison.
-Here is your escape ticket.

237
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,072
This is safer.

238
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,907
Kyeong-rim, please roll the dice.

239
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,619
{\an8}You failed to escape.

240
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,537
-Yeon-woo.
-Yes?

241
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,871
You gain an escape ticket.

242
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,083
-Oh, because of my rule.
-Next, Guillaume.

243
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,213
{\an8}-Escape.
-Okay!

244
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,218
Okay, it's time for a comeback.

245
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,219
Please roll again.

246
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,012
Come on, three.

247
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,180
{\an8}-Two.
-Good.

248
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,599
{\an8}-Guillaume's back.
-You move two spaces.

249
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,184
Dong-jae, please roll the dice.

250
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,189
{\an8}-You rolled prison and failed to escape.
-What is this?

251
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,650
{\an8}You can't finish last. Come on, focus.

252
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,985
-I know.
-You can do it.

253
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,987
-Don't be upset.
-I know.

254
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,071
Next, See-won.

255
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,700
{\an8}You rolled a three and failed to escape.

256
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,659
Next, Yeon-woo.

257
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,662
-Prison.
-I knew it.

258
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,163
-You move to prison.
-She's a prison expert.

259
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,290
Damn it.

260
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,833
Kyeong-rim, please roll the dice.

261
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,587
-Two. Yeon-woo gains one escape ticket.
-What's up with her?

262
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,796
She keeps rolling two.

263
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,755
You got this.

264
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,216
-You rolled a two again!
-You failed to escape.

265
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,635
Yeon-woo, you gain one escape ticket.

266
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,014
I will use two tickets
to send Guillaume backward.

267
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,056
Please give me the ticket.

268
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,100
Guillaume moves two spaces backward.

269
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,394
I think it's over for us.

270
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,813
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's all right.

271
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,566
{\an8}I never imagined this would happen.

272
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,194
<i>We were too arrogant
and assumed things would work out.</i>

273
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,530
<i>We thought we'd be able to</i>

274
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,658
{\an8}work something out with our strategies
no matter the situation.

275
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,244
{\an8}We played arrogantly.

276
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,579
-Yeon-woo, let's finish it.
-Seriously.

277
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,705
-All right.
-Finish it!

278
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,044
{\an8}Two.

279
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,961
{\an8}Yeon-woo did it.

280
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,464
-You did it! No way!
-Yeon-woo,

281
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,299
-I owe this to you all.
-you crossed the finish line.

282
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,967
Thank you so much, everyone.

283
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,177
Yeon-woo.

284
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,470
-No way.
-Only Kyeong-rim's left.

285
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,221
<i>The dice wasn't the problem.</i>

286
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,098
{\an8}I don't want to blame my team.

287
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,769
{\an8}We were all completely new to this game.

288
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,854
{\an8}So no one could have known

289
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,231
<i>that the escape tickets
would be so important.</i>

290
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,399
-Next, Guillaume.
-Yes.

291
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,860
Guillaume, please roll a one.

292
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,944
Roll a one.

293
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,531
{\an8}-Prison.
-Anything can happen.

294
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,616
{\an8}-Anything's possible.
-Seriously.

295
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,992
-Guillaume moves to prison.
-It's all up to luck.

296
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,244
-This is so fun.
-Let's give them our energy!

297
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,704
-Let's give them our energy!
-This is crazy.

298
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,705
Next, Dong-jae.

299
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,042
-Two.
-Two again.

300
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,418
You failed to escape.

301
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,419
Next, See-won.

302
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,593
-She escaped.
-See-won escaped.

303
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,803
See-won, please.

304
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,391
-Okay.
-Two.

305
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,184
You move two spaces.

306
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,102
-Me?
-Kyeong-rim.

307
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,396
-It's time to escape.
-Please escape.

308
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,522
Help me.

309
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,026
{\an8}You rolled a three and failed to escape.

310
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,277
{\an8}This isn't good.

311
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,113
{\an8}-Guillaume.
-Let's escape!

312
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,074
{\an8}You rolled a three and failed to escape.

313
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,033
{\an8}Next, Dong-jae.

314
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,828
Please, let me roll escape.

315
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,954
Come on.

316
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,707
{\an8}You rolled a one and failed to escape.

317
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,959
Next, See-won.

318
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,545
{\an8}-See-won is going to cross the line.
-She most likely will.

319
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,547
-I just don't want prison.
-You got this.

320
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,673
You won't roll prison.

321
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,841
Just throw it.

322
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,426
{\an8}-Yes!
-Two.

323
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,387
{\an8}-She survived.
-I survived.

324
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,889
Congratulations.

325
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,643
-Next, Kyeong-rim.
-My goodness.

326
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,524
<i>Currently, three players remain.</i>

327
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:17,027
<i>At least one is guaranteed
to get eliminated out of the three.</i>

328
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,447
<i>With only two Pieces,</i>

329
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,951
<i>Kyeong-rim must finish tenth to survive.</i>

330
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,203
Next, Kyeong-rim, please roll the dice.

331
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,091
{\an8}Yes!

332
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,927
-Yes!
-Not yet.

333
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,846
-Wait, not yet.
-Kyeong-rim.

334
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,431
-She still has to roll.
-One more roll.

335
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,266
-She has one more roll.
-One more.

336
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,809
-You got out.
-One more roll.

337
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,895
Kyeong-rim,
you can't roll prison this time.

338
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,314
Just relax. Roll it casually.

339
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,610
{\an8}Yes!

340
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,487
{\an8}Kyeong-rim!

341
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,031
Kyeong-rim, you crossed the finish line.

342
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,075
Next, Guillaume, please roll the dice.

343
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,535
-Good luck.
-Okay.

344
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,601
-Escape.
-Escape.

345
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,395
-Escape.
-Escape.

346
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,522
-Was that Dong-jae?
-Dong-jae.

347
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,565
-Dong-jae, you escaped prison.
-Guillaume...

348
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,276
This is giving me the chills.

349
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,989
{\an8}Two.

350
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,616
{\an8}You move two spaces.

351
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:53,958
{\an8}It's over.

352
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,465
It's done.

353
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,758
It's over now.

354
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,640
{\an8}-Two.
-He's in.

355
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,766
{\an8}Good job, everybody.

356
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,143
Dong-jae, you crossed the finish line.

357
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,563
-Good job.
-I'm sorry.

358
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,606
I'm so sorry.

359
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,983
Good job, Dong-jae.

360
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:44,091
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

361
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,844
<i>The rules race has finished.</i>

362
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,221
Good job.

363
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:56,270
<i>I feel really bad</i>

364
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,606
that I negatively affected my teammates.

365
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,694
I could have done better.

366
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,697
<i>Here are the results of the game.</i>

367
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,451
<i>First, these were
the personal rules of every player.</i>

368
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,744
I'm curious to see them.

369
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,331
{\an8}They tried to send others to prison.

370
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,249
{\an8}We tried to get escape tickets.

371
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,043
{\an8}-We had opposite strategies.
-Yeah.

372
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,551
<i>Here is the final ranking.</i>

373
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,388
<i>Players who finished first to third</i>

374
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,765
<i>receive Pieces as a reward.</i>

375
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,643
{\an8}<i>First place, Seok-jin,
receives three Pieces.</i>

376
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,770
<i>Second place, ORBIT,</i>

377
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,438
{\an8}<i>-receives two Pieces.</i>
-Congrats.

378
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,732
{\an8}-They belong to you all.
-Keep them.

379
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,734
{\an8}<i>Third place, Yu-min,</i>

380
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,861
{\an8}<i>receives one Piece.</i>

381
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,323
{\an8}<i>Players who finished tenth to twelfth
are punished with a penalty.</i>

382
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,910
{\an8}<i>Tenth place, Kyeong-rim,
must return one Piece.</i>

383
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,496
-Going to prison was good.
-It was a godsend.

384
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,499
If I hadn't gone to prison,
I might have lacked Pieces.

385
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,042
{\an8}Kyeong-rim, it's a miracle.

386
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,130
{\an8}<i>Eleventh place, Dong-jae,
must return three Pieces.</i>

387
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:11,095
{\an8}<i>Twelfth place, Guillaume,
must return all of his remaining Pieces.</i>

388
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,560
<i>Guillaume has lost all of his Pieces.</i>

389
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,980
<i>Therefore, Guillaume is the first player</i>

390
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,066
{\an8}<i>to get eliminated from</i> The Devil's Plan.

391
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,487
<i>Guillaume, please return
to the living area, pack your belongings,</i>

392
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,322
<i>and leave.</i>

393
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,334
It was an honor to meet you.

394
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,629
Kyeong-rim, I hope you finish first.

395
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,340
You should be realistic.

396
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,426
Thank you, Guillaume.

397
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,677
-Bye!
-Bye!

398
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,387
-Let's meet again.
-Goodbye.

399
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,184
<i>I think we were a bit too confident.</i>

400
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,688
We arrogantly believed
we could win as a minority alliance.

401
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,733
Seungkwan, are you crying? Don't cry.

402
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,569
I feel bad for sending him back so much.

403
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,653
It's all right.

404
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,450
<i>Toward the end,
I kept sending him backward.</i>

405
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,662
A lot of emotions are running through me.

406
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,124
<i>Here is the current Piece count
of each player.</i>

407
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,376
<i>Joon-bin, Kyeong-rim,</i>

408
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,462
<i>Hye-sung, Seungkwan,</i>

409
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,797
{\an8}<i>and Yeon-woo
have the same number of Pieces.</i>

410
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,842
{\an8}<i>Seok-jin, who has the most Pieces,</i>

411
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,636
<i>please choose two players
who will go to prison</i>

412
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,639
<i>from the five players
with the least Pieces.</i>

413
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,934
I think I'm going.

414
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,561
We might go together.

415
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,812
<i>Judging by Seok-jin's personality,</i>

416
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,441
he would send Yeon-woo and Kyeong-rim
based on their performances,

417
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,650
but Kyeong-rim's already been to prison.

418
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,860
I can't send Kyeong-rim again.

419
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,112
I'll choose from the last-placed players.

420
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,697
Who were next to being last?

421
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,532
Maybe Yeon-woo and Hye-sung will go.

422
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,160
I'm contemplating between
Hye-sung and Seungkwan.

423
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,495
Seungkwan, let's take a book.

424
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,954
Right.

425
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,165
-We might go right away.
-I've been expecting it.

426
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,125
If I go, I won't be going alone.

427
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,088
I'll spend time with my fellow inmate.

428
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,465
That's settled.
Let's talk about this game later.

429
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,800
All right.

430
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,593
Seok-jin must have decided.

431
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,011
Already?

432
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,015
<i>Seok-jin, please choose
two players who will go to prison.</i>

433
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,521
Based on her bad performance
and unfortunate luck,

434
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,688
I choose Yeon-woo.

435
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:34,321
Also, considering how much suffering
he caused my teammates,

436
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,447
I choose Seungkwan.

437
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,826
I choose those two to go to prison.

438
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,702
At least you're going to prison
with a K-pop idol.

439
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,329
Oh my god. What do I do?

440
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,330
<i>-Yeon-woo</i>
-Thank you.

441
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,706
-Good luck.
<i>-and Seungkwan,</i>

442
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,708
<i>-please enter the prison cell.</i>
-Sorry, Seungkwan.

443
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,585
Seok-jin, when I come out again,

444
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,129
-buy me a drink.
-Of course.

445
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,131
-See you in 18 hours.
-Good thing you're going to prison.

446
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,841
-You were almost eliminated.
-I know, right?

447
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,844
I'm jealous they're taking
a lot of stuff with them.

448
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,011
Yesterday was no joke.

449
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,012
Bye!

450
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,014
I'll miss you all!

451
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,392
-Please go inside.
-Okay.

452
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,768
I'm actually in prison.

453
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,106
It's like a cave. Let's have fun.

454
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,401
-This looks legit.
-Please wait a moment.

455
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,570
Is this it?

456
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,699
-Please enter.
-Oh, my god.

457
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,368
It's worse than I expected.

458
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,954
So it's just us two here?

459
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,330
Really?

460
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,082
Is that a chamber pot or something?

461
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,959
We only get water.

462
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,628
This reminded me to live a virtuous life.

463
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,839
<i>The main match has finished.</i>

464
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,384
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

465
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,011
-I'm sorry.
-What?

466
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,138
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say that.

467
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,528
<i>I didn't know before I joined the show,</i>

468
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,447
but this show really

469
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,743
makes the players feel a lot of emotions.

470
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,545
-I'm leaving.
-Wait!

471
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,088
-Wait a moment.
-Wait.

472
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,341
-Guillaume.
-Kyeong-rim.

473
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,052
I wish I had more opportunity
to talk to you.

474
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,637
-It's such a shame.
-I know.

475
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,848
-Let's meet again next time.
-Okay.

476
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,060
<i>I just thought,
"You're a pro gamer. Just play games."</i>

477
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,728
<i>I didn't know I'd feel this way.</i>

478
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,105
I had a lot of fun.

479
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,148
You can win.

480
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,361
You can do it.

481
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,904
It's short, but we wrote you something.

482
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,074
You all did this for me?

483
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,158
-Wow.
-Can you read it?

484
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,743
-The handwriting is pretty bad.
-Is it legible?

485
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,120
It'll take time, but I'll read all of it.

486
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,790
-I'm leaving. Good luck!
-See you soon.

487
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,042
-Let's send him off with a smile.
-Eat a lot of good food.

488
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,043
-I don't want to go.
-Help him.

489
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,419
-Help him.
-I don't want to leave.

490
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,048
-Bye, Guillaume.
-See you soon!

491
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,716
-Bye.
-Bye.

492
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,718
-Bye.
-Bye.

493
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,595
<i>Dong-jae seemed to be</i>

494
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,598
beating himself up, saying how sorry he is

495
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,976
and that he made a mistake.

496
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,937
<i>But I got eliminated
because of my decisions.</i>

497
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,065
<i>It wasn't Dong-jae's fault at all.</i>

498
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,712
This is such a surreal moment for me.

499
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,422
I never would've imagined

500
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,468
being stuck in this
tiny prison cell with you.

501
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,220
-Seriously.
-I know, right?

502
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,806
Did you ever think
you'd be stuck in such a small space

503
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,641
-with a pro Go player?
-You're right.

504
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,685
-I'm sure you never imagined it.
-Exactly.

505
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,813
Apparently, you can do something here.

506
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,440
-There's a quest.
-Right.

507
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,899
Kyeong-rim has two.

508
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,651
{\an8}-Kyeong-rim, you have two.
-She got one more.

509
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,278
-Was there something in prison?
-I guess so.

510
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,238
I'm curious if only I...

511
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,281
Can only one person do it?

512
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,284
Well, Yu-min didn't get one
while Kyeong-rim did.

513
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,745
-It didn't feel like they competed for it.
-Exactly.

514
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,621
<i>There's something in prison.</i>

515
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,417
Either a game or something like a mission.

516
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,918
I'm going to use the bathroom.

517
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,587
I'm going to search.

518
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,132
<i>I heard that
you can find something in prison,</i>

519
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,635
<i>so I started to
search the room immediately.</i>

520
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,263
Come on, show yourself.

521
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:29,890
Come on.

522
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,019
What could there be?

523
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,023
What? It's a safe.

524
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,733
What? It's a safe.

525
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,865
<i>There seemed to be
a power outlet at the bottom.</i>

526
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,533
<i>Something was fishy,</i>

527
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,660
<i>so I took the cover off and found a safe.</i>

528
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,496
What's the code?

529
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,042
Not this?

530
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,129
There has to be a code.

531
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,301
Is there a code?

532
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,387
It has to be here somewhere.

533
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,601
No way.

534
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:18,063
"This cast puzzle box
contains a metal puzzle for one."

535
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,608
If I solve this puzzle...

536
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,609
This was it.

537
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,529
<i>The safe and cast puzzle
were probably linked.</i>

538
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,781
{\an8}How do I solve this?

539
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,658
Turn it.

540
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,204
I can't believe I'm in prison.

541
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,790
I guess it is.

542
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,874
I found something.

543
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,000
What is it?

544
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,627
Look at this.

545
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,712
This thing.

546
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,589
It's harder than it looks,

547
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,715
so I'm struggling.

548
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,343
I don't think it's supposed to be easy.

549
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,971
Also, I was looking over there.

550
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,223
If you open up the outlet back there,

551
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,724
you'll see a safe.

552
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,768
-This?
-Yeah.

553
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,817
Is this a way to escape?

554
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,611
I don't know if you get a Piece
just by solving this puzzle.

555
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,238
That safe might not be related.

556
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,073
-True.
-It might just be there.

557
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,658
Yeah, that's possible.

558
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,618
-So I'm just trying to solve this.
-Right.

559
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,954
-Good job.
-I'm exhausted.

560
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,123
I played the game so cold-heartedly.

561
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,083
-It's all right. I understand.
-I'm sorry.

562
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,044
-I understand.
-I was upset about losing yesterday,

563
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,921
-You did well.
-so I really went all out today.

564
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,174
I think I let my rage take over
during the game today.

565
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,301
-See-won.
-You did great today.

566
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,720
-I'm glad you survived.
-Seriously.

567
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,436
-I really...
-Is it because Guillaume's gone?

568
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,229
-I feel so bad.
-Don't be.

569
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,316
-It has nothing to do with you.
-No, you did well.

570
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,650
You have to collect yourself

571
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,194
-and keep moving forward.
-Right.

572
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,570
-What's wrong?
-Earlier,

573
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,071
-She's okay.
-I cried a lot.

574
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,948
-This is like a sad movie.
-It's like a movie scene.

575
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,241
How are you feeling?

576
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,411
To be honest, I...

577
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,001
I think I made too many wrong choices.

578
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,545
Well, the game...

579
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,589
I just feel like
he got eliminated because of me.

580
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,800
It could have been any of us three.

581
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,054
But it happened to be him,

582
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,014
and not us.

583
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,266
But that's not your fault.

584
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,353
But honestly, I wanted to survive.

585
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,652
That's only natural.
I'm sure Guillaume also wanted to survive.

586
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,779
You shouldn't beat yourself up over that.

587
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,199
We got unlucky.

588
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,368
And the unluckiest person among us
got eliminated.

589
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,661
Exactly.

590
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,828
That's what makes it sadder.

591
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:39,788
I know.

592
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,039
I'm so upset.

593
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:46,211
My initial strategy
was for eight players to survive,

594
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,504
but it seemed unrealistic.

595
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,421
What a shame.

596
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,298
This was a complete loss

597
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,175
for me.

598
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,387
Do you think you could betray your team?

599
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,888
-Me?
-Yeah.

600
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,515
Can you betray them?

601
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,350
In the situation I'm in...

602
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,893
-You can't do it, can you?
-I...

603
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,603
Can you betray Seok-jin? No, right?

604
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,189
I can betray anyone.

605
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,985
So you've settled on carrying on
in your group of three, right?

606
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,861
-For now.
-You guys aren't too powerful now.

607
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,698
I'll form a new alliance tomorrow.

608
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,825
What if I join the majority again?

609
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,911
Then I'll need to come up
with a strategy to break it apart.

610
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,454
Can you win as the minority?

611
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,998
That's my thing.

612
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,457
I like to win as the underdog.

613
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,710
You really are the underdog now.

614
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,169
I know and I enjoy that.

615
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,132
<i>I love people who enjoy the games</i>

616
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,676
<i>and play them with utmost passion.</i>

617
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,263
Dong-jae and I are similar in that sense.

618
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,392
<i>Anyone would say we're complete opposites,</i>

619
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:46,062
and so far we've played
for our own survival.

620
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,191
<i>But we agreed to help each other
as much as possible for now.</i>

621
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,779
They actually gave us toiletries

622
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,197
even though we're in prison.

623
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,616
That's all the water we have.
You heard, right?

624
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,993
Really?

625
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:00,994
I also...

626
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,204
Is this...

627
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,122
This is it?

628
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,623
This is for one person, right?

629
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,919
-Wait.
-I actually feel like a prisoner.

630
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,671
-Is this it?
-I feel like a prisoner.

631
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,214
Is this bread for real?

632
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,841
I was expecting a big loaf of bread.

633
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,926
Don't you feel bad giving this to us?

634
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,136
This is really...

635
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,346
It was bread and milk.

636
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,265
Is this real?

637
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,391
This is fun.

638
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,435
It's fun.

639
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,480
-Does it have any fillings?
-It tastes horrible.

640
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,274
They didn't even give us jam.

641
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,360
Even the orange is tiny.

642
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,238
<i>If and when I get back
to the living area tomorrow,</i>

643
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,075
I'm going to eat
the Chicago-style cheese pizza

644
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,243
I found in the freezer.

645
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,329
I want to heat that up

646
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,916
and eat it with dumplings and cup noodles.

647
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,626
I'm annoyed.

648
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,255
I think being in prison
just once is all right.

649
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,466
-You're right.
-But it'll be really tough

650
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,635
-to come back here again.
-Exactly.

651
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,970
-Wouldn't the alliances change tomorrow?
-That's very likely.

652
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,514
Since we have one player
with a lot of Pieces,

653
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,516
-we just need to target that player.
-Okay.

654
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,059
Seok-jin, are you ready to cry tomorrow?

655
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,312
-He's a real actor.
-I'm looking forward to it.

656
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,939
-He's such an actor.
-I'm excited.

657
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,400
-He's a great actor.
-Are you making fun of me?

658
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,819
-That's how I cried.
-It could become a meme.

659
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,327
I hope we win some Pieces

660
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,746
-in the later stages.
-Yeah.

661
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,832
What are you talking about so seriously?

662
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,750
-Nothing.
-Nothing much.

663
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,294
I'll do my best in the evening.

664
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,881
It would've been nice
to send ORBIT to prison today.

665
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,969
I feel like we need him in the games
to keep upping the ante.

666
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,179
If he was in prison,

667
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,182
-we could have cut his link to the others.
-We should have.

668
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,101
-That would be ideal.
-Because the group

669
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,104
-depends on him too much.
-Their reliance on him?

670
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,690
-He's practically the leader.
-Yeah. Right now,

671
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,066
when the game begins,

672
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,027
<i>it's just us two,
and the rest flock to him.</i>

673
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,279
-They do.
-<i>And they ask, "What do we do?"</i>

674
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,072
They do whatever he says.

675
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,866
Should the four of us team up?

676
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,619
Join us. I kept telling you to.

677
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,622
When I saw you two in the morning,
I thought I couldn't join.

678
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,916
You two look so tight,
so I couldn't join in.

679
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,753
From day one, we talked about that
when you guys weren't around.

680
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,379
You guys were tight since day one.

681
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,591
Why is this safe here?

682
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,885
Why does it need a code?

683
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,471
Why is it locked?

684
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,932
Then a bunch of Pieces pour out.

685
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,058
No?

686
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,354
I was number seven during the game.
What were you?

687
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,439
Two.

688
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:40,862
Darn it.

689
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,280
I tried our birthdays,

690
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,115
<i>the date of today's shoot,</i>

691
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,826
<i>our phone numbers, you name it.</i>

692
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,037
You know what? Screw this.

693
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,748
They should give us
some sort of hint for the code.

694
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,047
We're so close, yet so far.

695
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,759
At escape rooms,
they usually give hints at this point.

696
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,471
You're all here?

697
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,931
Gosh, you look so young.

698
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,599
You look like you're in your twenties.

699
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,558
Kyeong-rim.

700
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,644
If I had spare Pieces,
I would have given you two.

701
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,728
Really?

702
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,232
I had no idea I'd wear
my previous clothes for so long.

703
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,817
Tell me about it.

704
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,193
I wonder what the next game is.

705
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,194
Me too.

706
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,947
I really want to win today.
Failing again would be such a bummer.

707
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,616
What's going on?

708
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,784
It's time.

709
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,578
<i>The prize match will begin soon.</i>

710
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,122
<i>Please return to the game area.</i>

711
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,666
-Let's go.
-Let's do well.

712
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,670
I'm so...

713
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,673
I'm so curious and annoyed.

714
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,425
Let's do this.

715
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,593
-We got this!
-We got this!

716
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,053
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

717
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,054
Teamwork!

718
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,848
Hello.

719
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,225
-Hello.
-What's going on?

720
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,519
-There's nothing.
-There's really nothing.

721
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,728
Are we wrestling?

722
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,314
Are they going to make us stand here
and do something?

723
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,067
<i>Before we begin,</i>

724
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,195
<i>please hand in
all of your writing utensils.</i>

725
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,197
It's a memory game.

726
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,198
I'm bad at these.

727
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,493
This is bad.

728
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,870
Aren't you good at this?

729
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,497
No, I'm not good at
short-term memorization.

730
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,251
Can't we all just shout out the answers?

731
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,211
-It's a team game.
-We probably won't be allowed to.

732
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,171
Maybe we all combine our answers.

733
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,464
That would be chaos.

734
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,426
Or maybe we memorize
different sections and combine them?

735
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,927
Oh, individually?

736
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,721
<i>Today's prize match is called</i>

737
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,306
<i>Fragments of Memory.</i>

738
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,601
We were right.

739
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,478
<i>In Fragments of Memory,
players must memorize the information</i>

740
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,355
<i>shown in a picture to solve the questions.</i>

741
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,650
<i>When the game begins,
a picture containing information</i>

742
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,070
<i>will be shown
on the LED screen for 20 minutes.</i>

743
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,989
-Twenty minutes?
-What?

744
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,951
<i>While the picture is up on the screen,
players may not leave the main hall</i>

745
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,536
<i>and they are not allowed to take notes.</i>

746
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,622
<i>After the picture is shown,</i>

747
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,082
<i>all players move to the kitchen.</i>

748
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,084
I guess we each take turns.

749
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,754
<i>After five minutes,
the questions will be given one by one.</i>

750
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,298
<i>Players may choose their order freely</i>

751
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,718
<i>and enter the main hall individually
to solve the questions.</i>

752
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,306
<i>The questions are not revealed
to the other players.</i>

753
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,059
-We go one by one.
-<i>A total of ten questions will be given,</i>

754
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,645
<i>and they get more difficult
as the game progresses.</i>

755
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,940
<i>To help you all understand,</i>

756
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,858
<i>here is an example.</i>

757
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,862
<i>All answers to the questions
are in the picture.</i>

758
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,406
<i>Please focus on the picture shown.</i>

759
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,548
"Seungkwan Fancam."

760
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,218
<i>The questions will be revealed now.</i>

761
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:51,844
I barely had time to look.

762
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,554
<i>Here is the first question.</i>

763
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,891
Q1. WHAT IS THE CURRENT TIME
IN THE PICTURE?

764
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,726
{\an8}I'm already out.

765
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,478
{\an8}-Wasn't it 10:02 p.m.?
-It's 10:02 p.m.

766
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,146
{\an8}You saw that?

767
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,148
{\an8}-It's 10:02 p.m.
-You all saw the time.

768
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,733
{\an8}<i>The answer to the first question</i>

769
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,486
{\an8}<i>is 10:02 p.m.</i>

770
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,989
I only saw "Escape room with Jong-yeon."

771
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,782
I only saw "Boo Seungkwan fancam."

772
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,201
<i>Here is the second question.</i>

773
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:19,163
Q2. WHEN IS THE BIRTHDAY
OF THE DESK'S OWNER?

774
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,165
{\an8}-I have no idea.
-This is just...

775
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,543
"Mom and Dad's restaurant reservation"
was on the 12th.

776
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,961
I saw that, but I don't know the birthday.

777
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,629
<i>The answer to the second question is</i>

778
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,715
{\an8}<i>January 27.</i>

779
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,299
{\an8}MY BIRTHDAY
ANSWER: JANUARY 27

780
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,801
This is harder than yesterday's game.

781
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,803
<i>Here is the third question.</i>

782
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:37,890
Q3. THE DESK'S OWNER IS A STUDENT.
WHAT GRADE ARE THEY IN?

783
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,934
{\an8}-A high school senior.
-Was it there?

784
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:40,893
{\an8}-Not sure.
-A senior, maybe?

785
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,895
{\an8}-A senior.
-What do you mean maybe?

786
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,439
{\an8}-I saw sociology and ethics.
-There was the CSAT.

787
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,149
{\an8}-Oh, CSAT was on it.
-Also college essays.

788
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,817
{\an8}<i>The answer to the third question</i>

789
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,695
{\an8}<i>is a high school junior.</i>

790
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,905
{\an8}-Oh, 2024.
-Oh, so we had to...

791
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,323
<i>After the question is given,</i>

792
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,284
<i>players must answer within a minute.</i>

793
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,827
<i>If the player is correct,</i>

794
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,290
<i>that player may continue
to answer the next question.</i>

795
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,293
<i>If the player cannot answer,</i>

796
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,627
<i>they may pass the question.</i>

797
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,173
<i>Players who pass
will go to the security room</i>

798
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,634
<i>and may not participate
in the game any longer.</i>

799
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,844
Passing is answering?

800
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,596
-No, it's when you skip.
-<i>If a player passes a question,</i>

801
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,766
<i>a new player from the kitchen will pick up</i>

802
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,518
<i>where the previous player left off.</i>

803
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,561
It's harder toward the end.

804
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,981
<i>If players succeed in answering
all the questions,</i>

805
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,400
<i>fifty million won will be added
to the final prize.</i>

806
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,696
<i>However, if all players pass the questions
and are removed from the game</i>

807
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,032
<i>or even if one player
gets the question wrong,</i>

808
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,159
<i>the prize match ends immediately.</i>

809
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,369
<i>In that case,
no prize money will be added.</i>

810
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,996
We can't get the answer wrong.

811
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,664
-Immediately?
-If unsure,

812
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,124
-just pass.
-Pass if unsure.

813
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,876
<i>If the prize match ends in failure,</i>

814
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,922
<i>the player with the incorrect answer
must return one Piece.</i>

815
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,841
What if you only have one Piece?

816
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,343
If you don't know, just pass.

817
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,721
<i>The game will begin in five minutes.</i>

818
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,349
If I lose one Piece, do I get eliminated?

819
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,975
<i>I'm horrible at memorization,</i>

820
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,227
so I was flustered.

821
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,063
Because of the rules,
you can't just guess.

822
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,815
My memory is really bad.

823
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,151
<i>This game requires
short-term memorization,</i>

824
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,695
and that's an area I'm not adept at.

825
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,032
I hope I do well
but I'm drained right now.

826
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,786
<i>Fragments of Memory begins now.</i>

827
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,705
<i>For your convenience,
pictures will be shown on the LED screen</i>

828
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,999
<i>and also on the panel below.</i>

829
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,376
My bad eyesight can't be an excuse now.

830
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,963
<i>The picture will be shown
for the next 20 minutes.</i>

831
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,716
<i>Please focus on the picture.</i>

832
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,723
What... Goodness.

833
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,019
<i>There's a reason why
the maximum prize money</i>

834
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,813
is set at 500 million won.

835
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,481
<i>They don't intend to give it away.</i>

836
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,573
{\an8}HALL, NIGHT-DUTY ROOM

837
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,825
PATIENT ROOM

838
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,037
OUTPATIENT ROOM

839
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,956
SURGERY ROOM

840
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,458
VIP ROOM

841
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,751
What?

842
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,212
What should we memorize?

843
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,881
Who's bad at memorization?

844
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,134
-Seeing this, I'm suddenly not confident.
-It looks like...

845
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,429
"Arrest warrant for Orin Group's
Chairman Jung dismissed."

846
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,181
He's eating "Devil Chips."

847
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,018
They're watching <i>Squid Game</i>.

848
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,477
Surgery on the 27th.

849
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,062
It's on the 27th of 2021.

850
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,439
What month is it?

851
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,150
-We should know that.
-It just says 2021.

852
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,194
Is there no way to know the month?

853
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,904
We should memorize this.

854
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,573
Information about which department
is in charge of the surgery.

855
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,824
I think neurosurgery

856
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,076
is connected to the number 038.

857
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,286
So code 038.

858
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,621
This might come up too.

859
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,123
{\an8}This person is getting brain surgery.

860
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,167
{\an8}-What is it?
-Brain surgery.

861
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,212
{\an8}-Doctor, are they getting brain surgery?
-That's brain surgery.

862
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,755
Who's confident right now?

863
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,882
We need to study this more. No way.

864
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,634
Look at this list of donors.

865
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,595
"Dr. Han Da-bal completes
100 liver transplants."

866
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,639
He's done 100 liver transplants.

867
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,182
Twenty-eight minutes have elapsed?

868
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,475
-We have to know that?
-And 19 seconds?

869
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,019
Would the questions be that specific?

870
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,312
That's too detailed.

871
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,023
-It might come up toward the end.
-Right, since it gets more difficult.

872
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,150
<i>There was too much information.</i>

873
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,944
I was very lost.

874
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,155
-Are you okay?
-I'm not confident.

875
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,365
<i>It's very tough.</i>

876
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,617
Yesterday's puzzle was easier.

877
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,285
I like rapid memorization,

878
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,913
but what we need to know here
is too broad.

879
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,331
I hope we have a memory game.

880
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,999
-I hate memorization.
-Really?

881
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,918
-I hate memorization.
-I'm good at rapid memorization.

882
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:34,835
I'm jealous.

883
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,088
I'm assuming the final prize
will be 400 million won.

884
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,047
-Joon-bin.
-Yeah?

885
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,340
You're not confident, are you?

886
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,800
I was, but not anymore.

887
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,677
-Then just focus on one thing.
-Okay.

888
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,553
-Just memorize one specific area.
-Okay.

889
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,430
I'll memorize the donor list.

890
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,307
-You memorize the list.
-Okay.

891
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,602
"Celebrity Gam Ho-don,
comedian Jang Dok-dae."

892
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,688
"Gam Ho-don, soccer player Lee Han-pyo,

893
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,356
footvolley coach Son Bal,

894
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,484
Park Se-rin Golf Academy,
magician Lee Eun-geol."

895
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,986
{\an8}I memorized the names.

896
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,071
<i>"Celebrity Gam Ho-don,
soccer player Lee Han-pyo,</i>

897
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,073
<i>actor Son Gang-hu,
and Councilor Lee Do-si."</i>

898
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,284
That's all that's on my mind right now.

899
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:10,162
Everyone, Joon-bin is memorizing
the donor list, but...

900
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,998
I think this will come up toward the end.

901
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:16,460
-You're right.
-Also, these names are all fake.

902
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,795
-"Lee Eun-geol."
-"Lee Eun-geol."

903
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,256
-"Park Se-rin."
-Names such as "Gam Ho-don."

904
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,716
-If we get one letter wrong,
-"Lee Han-pyo."

905
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,633
we fail the game.

906
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,884
We need to get this right.

907
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,845
I don't think we can do this.

908
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,848
How can they give us
such a difficult picture?

909
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,642
For those who have one Piece,
please don't get eliminated.

910
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,019
Ten minutes remaining.

911
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,061
Ten minutes?

912
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,062
It's one o'clock.

913
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,647
One in the afternoon.

914
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,649
It's one in the morning.

915
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,818
-You're right.
-It's not one in the afternoon.

916
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,528
-Right.
-It's one in the morning.

917
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,322
The hospital is bustling despite the time.

918
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,158
We should look for the person
who lost their shoe.

919
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,411
-Someone lost their shoe.
-There's so much information.

920
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,288
That's why this game
is called "Fragments of Memory."

921
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,333
By talking to each other,
the fragments of the pictures are stored.

922
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,502
{\an8}Wait, this kid is missing a shoe.

923
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,962
{\an8}-Missing what?
-This kid.

924
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:00,880
{\an8}Yellow socks.

925
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,757
{\an8}He has yellow socks and blue shoes.

926
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,050
The grandfather's left-handed.

927
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,844
Also, look at the hat and scarf
on the coat hanger.

928
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,138
This person is Chairman Jung.

929
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,765
After his warrant was dismissed,

930
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,433
-he came here in a wheelchair.
-He's eating noodles.

931
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,394
-Those are his scarf and hat.
-You're right.

932
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,521
-Yeah, his scarf and hat are over there.
-Yeah.

933
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,899
That's Chairman Jung.

934
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,442
This is probably important.

935
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,443
Dr. Han Song-i...

936
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,404
Dr. Han Da-bal operated on him.

937
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,114
-You're right.
-You're right.

938
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,657
-Han Da-bal did.
-A liver transplant.

939
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,451
He used liver problems as an excuse.

940
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,162
-He lied
-So he lied.

941
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,955
-to get his warrant dismissed.
-Right.

942
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,290
Three minutes remaining.

943
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,419
Patient gowns
are either orange or light blue.

944
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,171
-Orange gowns?
-Where are the orange ones?

945
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,798
-Oh, there.
-Orange and light blue.

946
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,383
Oh, you're right.

947
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,719
The head of the pediatric department
is Han Song-i.

948
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,012
Han Song-i is the pediatrician.

949
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,514
There's a dinosaur on the very top shelf.

950
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,016
A pirate, police car,
and teddy bear are on the second shelf.

951
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,103
And a princess doll, a wooden doll,
and a rabbit are on the bottom.

952
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,521
Good.

953
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,730
There are three key names.

954
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,940
Choi Song-hwa is a patient.

955
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,441
Han Da-bal does liver transplants.

956
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,943
Han Song-i is a pediatrician.

957
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,611
I feel like there's more
to the surgery room.

958
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,446
There are three people under surgery.

959
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,782
-Choi Song... There's no match.
-It's Choi Song-hwa.

960
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,700
-Choi Song-hwa? Okay.
-It's Choi Song-hwa.

961
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,785
She's Choi Song-hwa.

962
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,828
Their blood type is Rh+A.

963
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,413
Today is their surgery.

964
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,372
It is.

965
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,832
-So Choi Song...
-So the 27th?

966
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,792
-They're getting surgery.
-What month?

967
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,377
The month is covered.

968
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,671
So today must be the 27th then.

969
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,589
No, wait a minute.

970
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,633
It isn't the 27th
because a day has passed.

971
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,885
-So it's the 28th.
-Today's the 28th.

972
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,262
Today's the 28th.

973
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,556
-Why?
-Twenty-eight hours have passed.

974
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,640
-Right.
-That's right.

975
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,725
-It's the 28th.
-Good job.

976
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,186
-Nice catch, Dong-jae!
-Nice.

977
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,521
-Keep looking.
-Good job!

978
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,064
-It's the 28th today.
-It's the 28th.

979
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,816
-So today's the 28th?
-Yeah.

980
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,735
-The 28th is a Sunday.
-The 28th is a Sunday.

981
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,820
-The 28th is a Sunday.
-It's a Sunday.

982
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,738
Is there a 28th day in this month?

983
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,615
-No month has only 27 days.
-No month...

984
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,867
It's February then.

985
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,993
It's February.

986
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,495
-Amazing. It is!
-It's February 2021!

987
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,621
-That's right!
-It's the last day.

988
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,290
It's the last day of February 2021.

989
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,458
Nice one.

990
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,877
Our best players should go first.

991
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,754
It's better they go first
before they forget.

992
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,797
Goodness.

993
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,508
-<i>Your time is up.</i>
-I will fold this now.

994
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,844
-<i>Please move to the kitchen.</i>
-The Chairman is left-handed.

995
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,473
-I can't let my memory escape.
-I can't forget in the next five minutes.

996
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,682
I'm holding my memory in.

997
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,559
I don't want to lose it.

998
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,437
All right, let's all share
what we memorized.

999
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,482
-The nail-biter's shirt was green.
-Orin Group.

1000
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,568
The pregnant woman with a hat was wearing

1001
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,111
-yellow-green.
-Orange and green.

1002
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,155
-The person that was facing her.
-The hat-wearer was wearing yellow-green.

1003
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,908
The person being operated on
is Choi Song-hwa

1004
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,076
and they're receiving brain surgery.

1005
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,913
Their blood type is Rh+A

1006
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,998
-and the department number is 038.
-It's 038.

1007
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,042
I just memorized whatever I saw.

1008
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,960
See-won, you go first.

1009
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,796
Go first before you forget.

1010
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,840
You've memorized a lot of details,
so go first.

1011
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,384
<i>The player who will answer
the first question,</i>

1012
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,636
-<i>please enter the main hall.</i>
-Do I go?

1013
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,305
-If you're unsure, just pass.
-Take it easy.

1014
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,765
If unsure, pass.

1015
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,235
<i>Here is the first question.</i>

1016
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,780
<i>Here is the first question.</i>

1017
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,036
<i>I think we're all desperate today.</i>

1018
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,000
<i>We all hurt each other and experienced
our fair share of drama earlier today.</i>

1019
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,546
All that would become meaningless
if we fail to add to the final prize.

1020
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,049
It would mean we divided
and fought each other for nothing.

1021
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,634
One wrong answer and it's over.

1022
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,931
<i>See-won has decided to pass.</i>

1023
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,391
-Already?
-It's already difficult?

1024
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,226
-This is tough.
-If it's that hard, does that mean

1025
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,770
-it didn't come up during our discussions?
-I guess it didn't.

1026
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,021
-<i>See-won,</i>
-Oh, no.

1027
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,523
<i>please move to the security room.</i>

1028
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,026
See-won knows the most out of us.

1029
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,987
Yet she passed on the first question.

1030
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,946
Should I go next?

1031
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,532
-I honestly don't mind.
-Answer the easy ones first.

1032
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,284
If I don't know, I'll pass.

1033
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,411
-I have to pass if I'm unsure.
-Right.

1034
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,746
-The approach we took was...
-Did we take the wrong approach?

1035
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,926
We can't blame anyone
if we all end up passing.

1036
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,387
Even after we worked so hard...

1037
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,347
<i>Here is the first question.</i>

1038
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,642
Q. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE HOSPITAL
IN THE PICTURE?

1039
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,522
<i>Here is the first question.</i>

1040
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,109
It was Dana Hospital.

1041
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,277
It's Seoul Dani Hospital.

1042
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,653
-No, Dana.
-Seoul Dana Hospital.

1043
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,571
This is important.

1044
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,239
Seoul Dana Hospital.

1045
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,075
I know this. I'm going to pass.

1046
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,785
I'm going to pass.

1047
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,204
<i>See-won has decided to pass.</i>

1048
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,790
<i>See-won, please move to the security room.</i>

1049
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,961
Wait, I don't get to keep passing
until the last question?

1050
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,880
Once you pass, you are out of the game.

1051
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,593
<i>I thought we all would
have a go at answering the questions.</i>

1052
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,513
My plan was to answer the hard questions
others would likely pass on.

1053
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,932
<i>I knew it was Seoul Dana Hospital,</i>

1054
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,142
but I passed it.

1055
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,144
Seoul Dana.

1056
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,187
<i>You are correct.</i>

1057
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,396
Okay!

1058
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,024
I wonder what it was.

1059
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,986
<i>Here is the second question.</i>

1060
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,490
Q. WHO IS THE CEO
OF GANG GANG PHARMACEUTICALS?

1061
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,912
I'll memorize the donor list.

1062
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,747
-You memorize the list.
-Okay.

1063
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,123
These names are all fake.

1064
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,375
-"Lee Eun-geol."
-"Lee Eun-geol."

1065
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,044
-"Park Se-rin."
-Names such as "Gam Ho-don."

1066
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,379
-If we get one letter wrong,
-"Lee Han-pyo."

1067
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,296
we fail the game.

1068
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,341
The CEO of Gang Gang Pharmaceuticals is...

1069
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,345
Heo Yak.

1070
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,181
{\an8}<i>You are correct.</i>

1071
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,100

1072
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,101
<i>You are correct.</i>

1073
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,727
-Dong-joo!
-Great!

1074
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,937
-Great!
-This is good.

1075
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,147
-Dong-joo is amazing.
-She really is.

1076
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,357
If unsure, just pass.

1077
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,775
Please just give us the stuff we know.

1078
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,653
<i>Here is the third question.</i>

1079
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,696
Q. WHO IS THE HEAD OF PEDIATRICS
AT SEOUL DANA HOSPITAL?

1080
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,743
{\an8}The head of the pediatric department
is Han Song-i.

1081
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,036
{\an8}Han Song-i is the pediatrician.

1082
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,746
<i>Here is the third question.</i>

1083
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,625
Han Song-i.

1084
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,918
Han Song-i.

1085
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,004
<i>You are correct.</i>

1086
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,006
<i>You are correct.</i>

1087
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,847
<i>Here is the fourth question.</i>

1088
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,808
Q. WHAT COLOR IS THE NURSE UNIFORM
AT SEOUL DANA HOSPITAL?

1089
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,773
Patient gowns
are either orange or light blue.

1090
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,442
Oh, you're right.

1091
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,487
The doctor's surgery gown is blue,

1092
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,822
while the nurses wear pink.

1093
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,241
The doctors wear blue.
Others wear orange and light blue.

1094
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,577
Orange and light blue.

1095

-All right!
-No way.

00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,795
-She's amazing at this.
-No way.

1100
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,964
-She has the entire law book memorized.
-She should have handled

1101
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,340
the details from the start.

1102
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,050
-No wonder she went to law school.
-Right.

1103
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,552
<i>Here is the fifth question.</i>

1104
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,637
Q. WHAT KIND OF FOOD
IS THE DELIVERYMAN DELIVERING?

1105
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,892
Do you think this will be asked?
He's delivering pizza.

1106
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,518
The deliveryman's holding pizza.

1107
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,395
Pizza.

1108
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,480
<i>You are correct.</i>

1109
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:15,981
What?

1110
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,816
-Dong-joo, finish it!
-She might finish this.

1111
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,152
-Fifty million is ours!
-She might finish it.

1112
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,988
<i>Here is the sixth question.</i>

1113
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,032
Q. WHAT IS THE PERSON WEARING
A HAZMAT SUIT HOLDING IN THEIR LEFT HAND?

1114
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,705
-What could they ask about?
-I'll focus on the left.

1115
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,916
Look for people doing strange things.

1116
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,585
That person is trying to
open a can of Coke.

1117
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,545
Someone's using their smartphone.

1118
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,589
-Who is?
-The one in the hazmat suit.

1119
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,635
I guess COVID-19
is still ongoing in this picture.

1120
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,514
A smartphone.

1121
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,515
<i>You are correct.</i>

1122
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,559
<i>You are correct.</i>

1123
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,937
-That's right!
-No way.

1124
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,859
-What could it have been?
-Holy...

1125
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,277
This also takes the pressure

1126
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,071
-off of See-won.
-She got nervous.

1127
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,697
This is crazy.

1128
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,324
-It's such a relief.
-I'm getting goosebumps.

1129
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,242
She's doing good.

1130
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,202
<i>Here is the seventh question.</i>

1131
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,120
Q. A POLICE OFFICER IS HOLDING A PHOTO

1132
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,122
AND LOOKING FOR THE PERSON IN IT.

1133
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,041
WHAT ITEM IS THAT PERSON HOLDING?

1134
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,384
We should look for the person
who lost their shoe.

1135
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,637
-Someone lost their shoe.
-There's so much information.

1136
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,265
-Is the police officer helping them?
-Yeah, he is.

1137
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,724
But... Oh, the guy doesn't know.

1138
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,601
Wasn't there a kid who lost their shoe?

1139
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,353
-At the bottom.
-She's holding a stuffed rabbit.

1140
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,271
A stuffed rabbit.

1141
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,730
-The person who lost their shoe
-That person

1142
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,857
-is holding a stuffed rabbit.
-has a stuffed rabbit.

1143
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:41,942
A stuffed rabbit.

1144
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,820
A gray stuffed rabbit.

1145
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,071
<i>You are correct.</i>

1146
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,491
<i>You are correct.</i>

1147
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,661
-Seriously?
-No way.

1148
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,871
This is insane.

1149
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,084
She's already on the eighth question.

1150
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,627
<i>Here is the eighth question.</i>

1151
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:05,090
Q. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE PATIENT
IN THE VIP ROOM?

1152
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,762
The head of Orin Group,
Chairman Jung, is the VIP.

1153
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,556
His arrest was dismissed. Orin Group...

1154
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,850
This person is Chairman Jung.

1155
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,476
After his warrant was dismissed,

1156
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,645
-he came here in a wheelchair.
-He's eating noodles.

1157
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,106
-Those are his scarf and hat.
-You're right.

1158
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,733
Yeah, his scarf and hat are over there.

1159
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,861
-Chairman of Orin Group, Jung Dae-su.
-Who's Jung Dae-su?

1160
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,529
Orin Group's chairman is Jung Dae-su.

1161
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,406
So he's Chairman Jung Dae-su.

1162
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,200
We need to memorize his name.

1163
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,453
They might ask what his name is.

1164
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,538
Jung Dae-su.

1165
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,664
<i>You are correct.</i>

1166
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:43,879
<i>You are correct.</i>

1167
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,133
-She doesn't need us.
-What's going on?

1168
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,092
I'm getting goosebumps.

1169
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,845
-What are the questions?
-I'm seriously getting goosebumps.

1170
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,680
-Dong-joo is on a roll.
-How is this possible?

1171
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,098
I'm going to cry.

1172
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,896
-Please, Dong-joo.
-Take it easy.

1173
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,564
<i>Here is the ninth question.</i>

1174
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,068
Q. WHAT IS TODAY'S DATE IN THE PICTURE?

1175
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,861
I feel like there's more
to the surgery room.

1176
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,488
There are three people under surgery.

1177
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,865
-Choi Song... There's no match.
-It's Choi Song-hwa.

1178
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,950
-Choi Song-hwa? Okay.
-It's Choi Song-hwa.

1179
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,285
Today is their surgery.

1180
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,244
It is.

1181
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,913
-So, Choi Song...
-Is it the 27th?

1182
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,332
So today must be the 27th then.

1183
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,417
No, wait a minute.

1184
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,294
It isn't the 27th
because a day has passed.

1185
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,421
-So it's the 28th.
-Today's the 28th.

1186
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,339
-Good job.
-It's the 28th.

1187
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,966
-Nice catch, Dong-jae!
-Nice.

1188
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,219
-Good job! It's the 28th.
-It's the 28th today.

1189
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,346
Q. WHAT IS TODAY'S DATE IN THE PICTURE?

1190
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,932
{\an8}March 1, 2021.

1191
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,149
<i>You are correct.</i>

1192
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,239
-Good job! It's the 28th.
-It's the 28th today.

1193
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,573
So today's the 28th?

1194
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,910
-The 28th is a Sunday.
-The 28th is a Sunday.

1195
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,829
Today is Sunday, the 28th.

1196
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:00,872
Wait.

1197
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,207
-It's the 28th.
-Is it?

1198
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,667
Wait. The surgery...

1199
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,752
There's no 29th, so the 28th is right.

1200
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,382
What time did the surgery start
for it to be the 28th?

1201
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,925
At four in the morning.

1202
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:12,926
It's one o'clock.

1203
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,511
One in the afternoon.

1204
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,513
It's one in the morning.

1205
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,436
-Wait a minute.
-February 28th.

1206
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,104
That doesn't make sense.

1207
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,356
The surgery has been going on
for 28 hours.

1208
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,942
But it's one in the morning right now.

1209
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,861
So that means two days have passed.

1210
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,362
-It's March 1st then?
-Yeah.

1211
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,157
-It's the elapsed surgery time.
-Exactly, so it's one in the morning.

1212
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,283
-It is.
-Then that means

1213
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,034
a day has already passed

1214
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,245
-and the surgery began
-Right.

1215
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,288
-between 9 and 10 p.m.
-Everyone.

1216
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,539
-It's March 1st.
-March 1st.

1217
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,666
March 1, 2021.

1218
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,917
<i>You are correct.</i>

1219
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,256
<i>You are correct.</i>

1220
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,345
-It's the last question now.
-All the way to the last one.

1221
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,308
-Please finish the thing off.
-Please.

1222
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,976
<i>Here is the tenth question.</i>

1223
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,481
Q. ONE PATIENT IS WEARING AN EYE PATCH.
WHICH EYE IS IT ON?

1224
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,941
{\an8}The left.

1225
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,740
The left.

1226
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,830
Right before we went to the kitchen...

1227
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,540
The person with the eye patch...

1228
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,884
The person with the eye patch
has it on their left eye.

1229
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,636
The left.

1230
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,641
<i>You are correct.</i>

1231
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,185
<i>You are correct.</i>

1232
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,396
<i>You have solved all ten questions.</i>

1233
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,190
<i>You succeeded in the prize match.</i>

1234
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,239
<i>Fifty million won has been added,</i>

1235
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,950
<i>and the final prize
currently stands at fifty million won.</i>

1236
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,412
I'm proud of being Dong-joo's friend.

1237
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,914
Ladies and gentlemen!

1238
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:11,169
After all this trouble, we finally added
50 million won to the final prize.

1239
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,504
That was amazing.

1240
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,588
You were unbelievable.

1241
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,715
<i>The prize match has ended.</i>

1242
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,468
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

1243
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,928
-Great job!
-Great job!

1244
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,137
I'm so happy.

1245
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,347
-Let's have a party.
-Dong-joo!

1246
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,390
Seungkwan, do you see this?

1247
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,724
-Yo!
-Let's go!

1248
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,351
Shouldn't you get something
for your heroics?

1249
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,936
You should get ten Pieces.

1250
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:28,895
Exactly.

1251
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,148
Were there any questions
you were unsure about?

1252
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,526
I wanted to pass on Heo Yak,

1253
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,735
-but I didn't.
-You remembered?

1254
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,823
I thought no one else would be
able to get it if I passed up on it.

1255
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,908
-Way to step up to the plate.
-Seriously.

1256
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,702
She risked her Piece.

1257
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:47,122
-She basically risked her life.
-That's amazing.

1258
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,332
I'm curious about what the question was.

1259
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,042
What's Heo Yak?

1260
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,627
He's the CEO of Gang Gang Pharmaceuticals

1261
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,672
Joon-bin was preparing for that
to be the last question.

1262
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,257
All I did was memorize that.

1263
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,262
<i>-You spent 20 minutes.
-All I did was memorize that.</i>

1264
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,639
<i>She managed to catch that as well.</i>

1265
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,266
-She's amazing.
-You're impressive.

1266
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,435
Thank you.

1267
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,145
What was the tenth question?

1268
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,479
{\an8}It was about the eye patch.

1269
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,189
{\an8}Did anyone else see the eye patch?

1270
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,816
{\an8}-I didn't.
-No.

1271
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,819
What was the person doing COVID tests
holding in their left hand?

1272
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,154
{\an8}-What was it?
-A smartphone.

1273
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,864
{\an8}-A smartphone.
-Right.

1274
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,908
-You're amazing.
-You must feel so good.

1275
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,577
See-won, what happened
is actually pretty interesting.

1276
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,787
You passed on the first question.

1277
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,581
We thought it would be hard.

1278
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,917
-If our ace can't answer it...
-We thought we took the wrong approach.

1279
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,959
I thought if you were unsure,

1280
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,503
-then I definitely would be too.
-Actually,

1281
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,964
I wanted to save
the easy questions for later

1282
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,966
<i>and keep passing</i>

1283
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,052
<i>-to answer the hard ones.
-I see what you mean.</i>

1284
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,429
-That was your plan.
-I wanted to get them

1285
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,306
out of the way and end my turn.

1286
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,016
-But I misunderstood the rules.
-That was your plan.

1287
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,268
-I was too focused on the picture.
-You know what though?

1288
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,853
-It all worked out.
-Exactly.

1289
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,813
-We got a good result.
-It was memorable.

1290
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,024
Had you solved a couple of them,
it wouldn't have been as dramatic.

1291
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,067
-Thanks, See-won.
-Right.

1292
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,276
You made this happen.

1293
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,487
-We got a dramatic result.
-Exactly.

1294
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,988
-It's a relief.
-You were amazing.

1295
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,949
Kyeong-rim, good work today.

1296
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,408
Who wants beer?

1297
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,451
-Me.
-Okay.

1298
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,911
-Let's get the beer.
-You're drinking beer?

1299
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,580
I felt both the pain of defeat

1300
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,874
and the joy of victory today.

1301
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,293
That's true.

1302
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,591
-Do you want one?
-Today, I...

1303
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,259
-You feel like drinking?
-No.

1304
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,679
-No?
-I feel like a fool.

1305
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,431
It's all right.
You got carried away. It happens.

1306
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,435
<i>You've been exhausted since the morning.</i>

1307
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,436
It's okay.

1308
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,522
I'd like to end the day

1309
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,357
by sharing something with my teammates.

1310
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,109
You don't have to.

1311
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,611
I could've had zero or negative Pieces.

1312
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,904
That's not true.

1313
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,155
But I ended up with five.

1314
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,574
I think this is the right thing to do.

1315
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,994
<i>Looking back on today,</i>

1316
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,413
<i>I was able to finish with five Pieces</i>

1317
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,665
<i>thanks to my hard-working teammates.</i>

1318
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,001
<i>And I didn't feel like I deserved it.</i>

1319
00:54:56,084 --> 00:55:00,130
<i>So I think giving a Piece each
to Dong-jae and See-won,</i>

1320
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,966
<i>who both went through a lot,
is only appropriate.</i>

1321
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,300
-All right.
-Okay.

1322
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,552
We did our best.

1323
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,636
We worked hard.

1324
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,388
-We tried our best.
-Seriously.

1325
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,806
We did our best.

1326
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,933
Dong-joo's reputation now is...

1327
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,019
-The world knows she's a genius now.
-Exactly.

1328
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,270
She'll be known as the genius lawyer.

1329
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,688
-I'm jealous.
-I'm jealous.

1330
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,107
This should make a highlight reel.

1331
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,985
Just play the video on repeat
at your law office.

1332
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,570
-Play it.
-Keep looping it.

1333
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,822
Just have it on repeat.

1334
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,657
I'll tell my clients to watch this
before talking to me.

1335
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,869
-Could you hear us scream?
-I could.

1336
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,495
It's like listening
to a sports game on the radio.

1337
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,122
-That's so true.
-You're right.

1338
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,457
-You're right.
-Seriously.

1339
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,459
Could you follow me back on social media?

1340
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,128
-Sure, if you give me a Piece.
-Hey, how dare you?

1341
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,422
Joon-bin memorized the entire donor list.

1342
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,673
He did.

1343
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:44,799
Celebrity Gam Ho-don.

1344
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,927
Soccer player Lee Han-pyo.

1345
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,304
Actor Son Gang-hu.

1346
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,555
Councillor Lee Do-si.

1347
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,057
Footvolley coach Son Bal,
pool player Ma Se-hui,

1348
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,099
Director Shin Ji-bi,

1349
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,143
-Park Se-rin Golf Academy.
-Oh, Shin Ji-bi.

1350
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,936
-Park Se-rin Golf Academy.
-I get Shin Ji-bi now.

1351
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,855
I hadn't realized it before.

1352
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,567
I'll help. Are you washing your hands?

1353
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,402
I almost got a cramp a while ago

1354
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,237
-because I squeezed too hard.
-You did?

1355
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,533
I want to wash both my hands at once.

1356
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,287
-Just ask me for help.
-Okay.

1357
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,330
Are you ready?

1358
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,414
Yeah.

1359
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,501
I'll squeeze your foam cleanser for you.

1360
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,543
-This?
-Yeah.

1361
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,461
Okay.

1362
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,798
I knew I would end up in prison
at least once.

1363
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,761
It does feel better that I'm in here
with Seungkwan.

1364
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,346
Are you doing it?

1365
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,766
I've never seen someone
so bad at washing up.

1366
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,434
Get your cheeks more.

1367
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,061
-Cheeks?
-Yes, right there.

1368
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,229
There's more left.

1369
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:42,190
The more she washed,
the more foam went back here.

1370
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,650
Sweep it up.

1371
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,652
Bring the foam forward. That's right.

1372
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,237
That's good.

1373
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,072
I told her to wash here, but she kept...

1374
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,868
There's some left near your ears.

1375
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:55,995
Are the lights out?

1376
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,541
-Wait...
-Yeah?

1377
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,709
Is there more here?

1378
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,420
-Why did it have to go out now?
-The lights went off?

1379
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,797
Oh, your eyes are closed.

1380
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,632
The lights went out in the middle,

1381
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:08,842
and that was also pretty sad.

1382
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:14,013
I've never commentated on
someone washing their face before.

1383
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,182
There aren't any towels.

1384
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,727
I wasn't anticipating this.

1385
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,146
We don't have towels.

1386
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,439
There's tissue.

1387
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,523
Tissue?

1388
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,692
-Just wipe off the moisture.
-I have no choice.

1389
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:26,901
This is primitive.

1390
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,362
When else would we experience this?

1391
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,158
Honestly, I'm so ashamed about
what happened in today's game.

1392
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,535
-Me too. I'm so embarrassed.
-I lost so miserably

1393
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,955
<i>after being horrible at the game.</i>

1394
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,624
This is what I've been thinking
since yesterday.

1395
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,002
There's no need to linger on defeat.

1396
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,670
Once you've coped
with the emotions, move on.

1397
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,005
You're right.

1398
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,173
{\an8}What's wrong?

1399
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:51,634
{\an8}ORBIT, I feel really...

1400
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,472
{\an8}I feel so powerless.

1401
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,514
Until now,

1402
00:57:57,098 --> 00:58:00,602
I've worked hard my whole life
to accomplish my goals.

1403
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,979
But it's too hectic here for that.

1404
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,106
-Here, I don't even know
-Right.

1405
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,566
where my efforts should be headed.

1406
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,693
So I feel lost.

1407
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,445
Hye-sung, why are you crying?

1408
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,739
-What sad story are you telling?
-Why are you crying?

1409
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,991
We were talking about life
and how bitter it is.

1410
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,326
Life is bitter?

1411
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,536
Everyone here

1412
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,247
came with their own
expectations and assumptions.

1413
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,584
I didn't expect anything.
I knew I'd be like this.

1414
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,878
{\an8}What are you most worried about?

1415
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,589
{\an8}-What are you struggling with?
-The games are too hard.

1416
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,175
I wish they would just tell me
what to study.

1417
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,469
-None of us know.
-That's what honor students do.

1418
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,888
We feel more comfortable

1419
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,140
when we're given a range to study for.

1420
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:43,520
-With your calm and positive attitude,
-Right.

1421
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,564
try to learn new things
and work on yourself.

1422
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,400
Personally, I think you're doing great.

1423
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,236
You're doing good.

1424
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,781
18 HOURS LATER

1425
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,241
ORBIT.

1426
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,743
What did you put as my number?

1427
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:03,039
Weren't we supposed to be a team?

1428
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:03,957
What?

1429
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,417
We had agreed to work together.

1430
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,003
And...

1431
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:14,884
Can't you at least tell me
if you know my number or not?

1432
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:55,777
