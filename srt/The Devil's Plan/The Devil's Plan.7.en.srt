1
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,954
I'm getting goosebumps again.

2
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,672
It turned out to be a very beautiful cube.

3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,383
Wait, is it right to call it a cube?

4
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,765
<i>A combination of the three Pieces
with different shapes.</i>

5
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>A beautiful key that would unlock</i>

6
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,146
<i>the deepest secret of</i>
The Devil's Plan <i>has been created.</i>

7
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:25,126
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,753
So the first and third Pieces
fit together.

9
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,171
Exactly.

10
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,590
I assumed the Pieces would fit in order.

11
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,468
It looked like these would fit.

12
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,013
It's crazy how beautifully
these Pieces fit.

13
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,057
{\an8}I was exhilarated.

14
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,184
{\an8}But I couldn't make any noise.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,607
I have to say, I'm pretty amazing.

16
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,817
How did I figure it out?

17
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,070
-It's all thanks to your tenacity.
-It is!

18
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,655
You mad scientist.

19
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:58,326
But the problem is
that we don't know how or when to use it.

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,994
Hi-ya!

21
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:04,999
Hi-ya!

22
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,960
I guess that's not it.

23
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,171
What do you think the reward for this is?

24
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,798
Maybe five Pieces?

25
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,007
Or maybe ten?

26
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,301
-I'm curious.
-We'll find out later.

27
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,804
We've managed to figure this out.

28
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,222
Let's see what happens tomorrow.

29
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:41,202
{\an8}ROOM 203

30
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,539
{\an8}<i>It was my first night sleeping alone here.</i>

31
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,249
{\an8}<i>I had a lot going on in my mind.</i>

32
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,960
{\an8}I wasn't in the best condition.

33
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,920
{\an8}ROOM 201

34
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,298
{\an8}<i>I tossed and turned all night.</i>

35
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,174
{\an8}I kept asking, "Why am I doing this?"

36
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,969
<i>This whole thing</i>

37
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,054
<i>is a grand scheme</i>

38
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,599
to turn 12 kind people into devils.

39
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,709
Good morning.

40
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,629
Good morning.

41
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,255
Yu-min, where's your room?

42
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,174
-In that corner.
-She's next to mine.

43
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,884
-At the furthest corner?
-Yeah.

44
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,177
-And this is See-won's room?
-Yeah.

45
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,222
Did you two share a room last night?

46
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,432
I was actually a bit worried.

47
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,768
I wondered if you would sleep well.

48
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,354
-It did take me a while to fall asleep.
-Right.

49
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,105
I should have gone to you earlier.

50
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,108
I went to your room just in case
you were having trouble falling asleep.

51
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,818
So I went up...

52
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,490
<i>It was 2:30 a.m.,
and I didn't see anyone inside.</i>

53
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,620
Considering how much
you two went through yesterday,

54
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,623
I assumed you two decided to share a room.

55
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,291
<i>So I went over to the next room</i>

56
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,876
<i>-and no one was inside.
-No one?</i>

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,379
<i>-I was so scared.
-That must have been scary.</i>

58
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,713
<i>We just disappeared.</i>

59
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,756
Do you use the inner bed?

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,341
-I use the outer bed.
-The one by the window.

61
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,884
<i>That's probably why you didn't see us.</i>

62
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,137
I guess you two
were out of my line of sight.

63
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,764
-I got goosebumps all over.
-How scary.

64
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,439
Your breakfast is here.

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,910
<i>I'm getting too comfortable
with this place.</i>

66
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,289
{\an8}In a way, it started to feel like home.

67
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,376
{\an8}Sleeping with pants on
was so uncomfortable.

68
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,713
{\an8}I usually sleep with just my underwear on,
so it was very uncomfortable.

69
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,964
You're not eating?

70
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,674
-I don't feel like it.
-You don't?

71
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,509
There's shrimp inside.

72
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,594
Really? I'll just take a bite then.

73
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,348
This is good.

74
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,474
What is this?

75
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,934
-Why is this good?
-It's shrimp porridge.

76
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,602
It's really good.

77
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,815
-You know what, See-won?
-What?

78
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,651
We've never been
on the same side this entire time.

79
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,696
You don't want to be teammates
until the end?

80
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,781
My goal is to protect the weak

81
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,326
and ensure as many survivors as I can.

82
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,453
I'm going to be honest with you.

83
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,830
You keep saying that's your goal,

84
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,333
but to me,

85
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,753
it seems you're eliminating people
you see as rivals.

86
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,588
That's how I see it.

87
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,674
You only help people
you can easily control,

88
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:46,721
and eliminate those you can't control.

89
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,016
Not sure what gave you that idea,
but I've actually never thought about

90
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,684
who my rivals are.

91
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,770
My goal is to protect the weak

92
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,064
and to do so, I have to eliminate
those who are eager to be the winner.

93
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,940
That's how you can protect them.

94
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,651
-But someone has to win, right?
-Yeah.

95
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,737
Does that mean you'll decide
who wins in the end?

96
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,781
-No, I don't have that authority.
-Exactly.

97
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,366
I'll just do my best
until that time comes.

98
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,786
-Right.
-If I didn't have this goal in mind...

99
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788
So in short,

100
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,457
you're using your goal
to protect the weak as a pretext

101
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,128
to eliminate strong competitors
on the other side

102
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,589
and let someone on your side

103
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,633
become the winner in the end.

104
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,010
Well, that may not be
as easy as it sounds.

105
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:32,642
He said it's unfortunate that we never
had the chance to team up.

106
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,394
That's an outright declaration of war.

107
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,939
It sounds as if he has no intention
of ever teaming up with me.

108
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,858
Once time passes
and we see ourselves on the show,

109
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,653
we'll notice moments that make us go,
"Why did I do that?"

110
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,071
-That seems likely.
-You're right.

111
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,364
-There are so many moments like that.
-Right.

112
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,243
-We'll think, "It was meant to be fun."
-Once time passes, we'll see.

113
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,620
-"I should've enjoyed it more."
-Exactly.

114
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,999
You all say that
but it's different once the games begin.

115
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,335
-Everyone's eyes light up.
-Exactly.

116
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,461
It's all science.

117
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,631
-This too?
-It is.

118
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,966
Do you know the doorway effect?

119
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:11,848
<i>When we go into a room,
sometimes we forget what we're there for.</i>

120
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,224
<i>We just forget.</i>

121
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:17,145
Once we cross the doorway
and the environment changes,

122
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,149
our previous thoughts
are replaced by new ones.

123
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,108
That's why we have these doors.

124
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,609
-Right.
-A separate game area.

125
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,236
<i>Once we enter the game area,</i>

126
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,489
<i>we forget all the good times we had.</i>

127
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,658
<i>And we start to focus on the game again.</i>

128
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,119
I think they created it this way
to leverage the doorway effect.

129
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,996
And when the game ends,

130
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,874
we forget about everything that happened
behind the doors.

131
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,429
Seungkwan.

132
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,892
{\an8}She woke me up by calling my name.

133
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,644
{\an8}I thought she was my school teacher.

134
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,438
Good morning.

135
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,608
See-won.

136
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,443
-Things are urgent.
-Why?

137
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,738
ORBIT apologized to me this morning.

138
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,864
Why?

139
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:14,660
He said he was sorry
he and I never got to team up.

140
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,205
Does that mean
it's not happening today either?

141
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,289
Exactly.

142
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,959
So I came here urgently.

143
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,632
<i>I don't know if she
wants me to team up with her</i>

144
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,051
<i>or just wants me to hear her out.</i>

145
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,844
As someone who was on her team,

146
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,971
I know that she's being sincere.

147
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,058
Anyways, that's what I had to say.

148
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,358
How worried was she
to come all the way here?

149
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,610
My cute little bro.

150
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,906
I need to get him a shirt
and a change of socks.

151
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,158
His socks will probably smell bad.

152
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,161
No socks?

153
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,455
This is absurd.

154
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,253
I'll use the face wash to wash my hair.

155
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,212
The face wash?

156
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,505
It's cold.

157
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,799
It's so cold.

158
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,883
Stop.

159
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,470
There's not much water.
I should've used less yesterday.

160
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,681
-What time is it now?
-Right now?

161
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,558
-It's 38 minutes.
-Past nine?

162
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,226
No, past ten.

163
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,103
-I have to use the bathroom.
-There's not much time.

164
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,276
Seok-jin's in a hurry.
He didn't know so much time had passed.

165
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,491
There's not enough time.

166
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,993
Come on, Seungkwan.

167
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,119
Gosh, Seungkwan.

168
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,375
<i>The main match will begin soon.</i>

169
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,128
<i>Please gather in the game area.</i>

170
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,212
No!

171
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,590
It's like we're late for school.

172
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,553
It's chaotic.

173
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,555
-How's my hair?
-Sorry?

174
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,472
How's my hair?

175
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,559
You look like an inmate
who tried to escape but failed.

176
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,019
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

177
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,187
Is it that way? Why am I here?

178
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,647
-I'm waiting to be eliminated.
-Going home?

179
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,942
At this point,
I feel like I should get tofu.

180
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,905
We should give all the Pieces
to the person who goes to prison.

181
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,325
You want to practice?

182
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,076
I want to go to prison.

183
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,204
You look like you're willing
to commit a crime to go.

184
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,457
-I want to go to prison.
-We can't send you there.

185
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,500
-Why not?
-You look like you're going through a lot.

186
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,543
I only have two Pieces.

187
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,919
I'm sorry to say this,

188
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,212
but with two Pieces,

189
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,465
-you're more likely to get eliminated.
-Gosh.

190
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,258
-You're very logical, aren't you?
-Yeah.

191
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,301
I'm logical and I stick to facts.

192
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,720
A, B?

193
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,513
What's A, B?

194
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,723
What can it be?

195
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,183
Is it a grill?

196
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,309
I guess we'll be in teams.

197
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,769
So it's a team game.

198
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,021
I really hope the teams are random.

199
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,316
-Joon-bin!
-You're back!

200
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,692
Welcome back!

201
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,943
-Welcome back.
-Yeon-woo!

202
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,695
Hello.

203
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,864
-What's wrong with your hair?
-What happened, Joon-bin?

204
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,032
I washed it with face wash.

205
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,909
You actually washed your hair?

206
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,951
Have some iced coffee.

207
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,953
-Have some.
-We made coffee.

208
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,580
-We made this.
-Really? Amazing.

209
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,666
-You said you wanted it.
-Thank you so much.

210
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,001
-You went through a lot.
-No, it was all right.

211
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,086
It must've been tough.

212
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,962
Oh, my.

213
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:12,963
Did you solve the puzzle?

214
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,173
-Sorry?
-The cast puzzle.

215
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,716
I have so much respect for you now.

216
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,884
How did you solve it?

217
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,761
-It's impossible.
-You didn't get a Piece?

218
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,554
Kyeong-rim is the smartest person here.

219
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,597
-Really?
-You couldn't solve it?

220
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,681
It's impossible.

221
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,725
<i>Greetings.</i>

222
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,020
<i>The fourth main match
of</i> The Devil's Plan <i>will begin.</i>

223
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,775
<i>Hye-sung and Dong-jae
were eliminated in the last game.</i>

224
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,444
<i>And only nine players survive.</i>

225
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,323
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

226
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,701
{\an8}<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

227
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,911
{\an8}Yu-min, you have three.

228
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,121
Yu-min has three?

229
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,038
For her prison bet.

230
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,998
Oh, right. That's good.

231
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,166
I resent you all.

232
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,963
{\an8}<i>Currently, Seok-jin has the most Pieces.</i>

233
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,591
<i>Today's main match is Zoo.</i>

234
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,509
-What?
-What is that?

235
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:02,054
<i>In Zoo, players bid on
animal tiles they need</i>

236
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,725
<i>to complete animal combinations
on the board.</i>

237
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,352
Tiles?

238
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,147
<i>Players will first enter
the dealer room individually</i>

239
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,608
<i>and determine their animal combination
and personal condition.</i>

240
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,985
That sounds difficult.

241
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,949
<i>There are snake, lion, parrot, monkey,
and elephant animal cards.</i>

242
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,910
<i>Thirty cards will be used
to determine animal combinations,</i>

243
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,662
<i>with six cards of each animal type.</i>

244
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,707
<i>Players will select three animal cards</i>

245
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,251
<i>out of all the cards placed face down.</i>

246
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,837
There could be duplicates.

247
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,298
<i>Once three cards are selected,</i>

248
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,301
<i>players will determine
the order of their cards</i>

249
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,760
<i>and submit them to the dealer.</i>

250
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,640
<i>Each condition card has an illustration
that compares the number of animals</i>

251
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,560
<i>as you can see in the example.</i>

252
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,855
<i>Each condition card
has a different condition.</i>

253
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,067
<i>Out of ten condition cards
placed face down,</i>

254
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,196
<i>players will select one condition card</i>

255
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,323
<i>to determine their personal condition.</i>

256
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,076
<i>Once the animal combinations
and personal conditions are determined,</i>

257
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,664
<i>players must choose
one animal from their animal combination</i>

258
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,083
<i>and reveal it to the other players.</i>

259
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,087
<i>The rest of the player's combination
or condition will not be revealed.</i>

260
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,381
It's a game of probability.

261
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>The game board
is made up of twenty-five tiles,</i>

262
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,221
<i>with five tiles across and five down.</i>

263
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,182
<i>There are five types of animal tiles</i>

264
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:34,939
<i>and four of each
will be placed in Box A and B.</i>

265
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,400
<i>And four tiles randomly drawn
from each box will be put up for auction.</i>

266
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,277
-Auction?
-<i>Based on the auction,</i>

267
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,572
<i>one set of tiles from either box A or B</i>

268
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,616
<i>will be placed on the game board.</i>

269
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,035
<i>The player with the winning bid</i>

270
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,371
<i>will place the tiles however they choose.</i>

271
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,830
Winning bid.

272
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,750
<i>Tiles are to be dropped from the top
and placed from the bottom row.</i>

273
00:13:55,251 --> 00:14:00,589
<i>And they are to be stacked
and fill up the game board.</i>

274
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,592
<i>Here is how the auction will work.</i>

275
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,346
<i>Each player will receive thirty credits</i>

276
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,932
<i>that they may use
to bid during the auction.</i>

277
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,894
<i>Credits will be stored in the dealer room</i>

278
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,147
<i>and must be submitted
to the dealer when bidding.</i>

279
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,777
<i>A player's credit balance
will not be revealed to other players.</i>

280
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>Once the auction begins,</i>

281
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,325
<i>players will enter
the dealer room individually</i>

282
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,829
<i>and make their bids
on either group A or B.</i>

283
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,455
So making the right bid is important.

284
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,458
<i>Players must bid at least one credit.</i>

285
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,587
<i>And the used credits will not be returned</i>

286
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,297
<i>even if the bid is unsuccessful.</i>

287
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,094
<i>When bidding, players must take
their animal combinations into account.</i>

288
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,804
<i>If a player's bid is successful,</i>

289
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,766
<i>the player will choose the order
and location of the animal tiles</i>

290
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,351
<i>and submit them to the dealer.</i>

291
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,103
This is so complicated.

292
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,689
<i>Between groups A and B,</i>

293
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,192
<i>the group with the least bid credits
will win the auction.</i>

294
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,404
<i>And the player in that group
who bid the most credits</i>

295
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,031
<i>wins the round.</i>

296
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,491
<i>When this happens,</i>

297
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,536
<i>animal tiles that are not auctioned off
will be discarded.</i>

298
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,374
So the group's bid has to be low,
but your own bid has to be high.

299
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,292
This is hard.

300
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,630
<i>Once the total number of credits used
in each round is announced,</i>

301
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,593
<i>the game board
with the winner's tile placement</i>

302
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,845
<i>will be shown on the screen.</i>

303
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,724
<i>However, the winner will not be revealed.</i>

304
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,018
-This is so complicated.
-It's hard.

305
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,855
<i>If both groups have
the same number of credits bid</i>

306
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,858
<i>or there are two or more players
with the highest bid</i>

307
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,902
<i>in the group with the successful bid,</i>

308
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,696
<i>another auction will be held.</i>

309
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,739
Oh, no.

310
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,823
My gosh.

311
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,452
<i>In the case of a re-auction,
credits bid in that round</i>

312
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,037
<i>will be returned.</i>

313
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,081
-They'll be returned.
-They will?

314
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,416
<i>The game will last five rounds.</i>

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,337
<i>A total of 20 animal tiles
will be placed on the game board.</i>

316
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,757
-It looks like alliances are necessary.
-<i>Once the game ends,</i>

317
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,676
<i>if the tiles on the board</i>

318
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,761
<i>match the player's animal combination</i>

319
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,807
<i>horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally in a line,</i>

320
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,225
<i>the player will earn a point.</i>

321
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,518
The middle tile is key.

322
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,187
<i>Each matching combination
is worth one point,</i>

323
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,065
<i>and points are awarded
for reverse order combinations as well.</i>

324
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,361
{\an8}<i>For example, if the combination is in
the order of elephant, lion, and monkey,</i>

325
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,114
{\an8}<i>a combination of monkey, lion, elephant</i>

326
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,824
{\an8}<i>will also get you a point.</i>

327
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,075
The reverse order works too.

328
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,662
<i>If a player's personal condition is met
when the game ends,</i>

329
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,580
<i>that player's points are doubled.</i>

330
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,208
That gets us the most points.

331
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:46,255
<i>Players with a final score
of two or above will earn one Piece.</i>

332
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:50,134
<i>Players with zero points
must return one Piece as a penalty.</i>

333
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:55,180
<i>Thus, players must finish with at least
one point to avoid the penalty.</i>

334
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,306
-At least one?
-Yeah.

335
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,685
<i>If only one player finishes
with the most points,</i>

336
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,565
<i>that player will be awarded
with three additional Pieces.</i>

337
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,692
-Wow.
-I want to win.

338
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,987
<i>If two or more players
finish with the most points,</i>

339
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,614
<i>no additional Pieces will be awarded.</i>

340
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,949
No additional pieces
if there are more than two.

341
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,327
-Only one has to end with the most.
-<i>The game will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

342
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,579
Thirty minutes?

343
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,582
<i>Spend this time as you wish.</i>

344
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,624
No one can get eliminated.

345
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,834
{\an8}Except Yeon-woo.

346
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,919
{\an8}We should try to save Yeon-woo...

347
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,921
We could, but is that necessary?

348
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,131
-What?
-Maybe it's time for her to go.

349
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,799
Hey, you little...

350
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,342
Do you want to be
in prison for life or executed?

351
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,262
<i>I need to change things up.</i>

352
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,389
I should play more aggressively

353
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,475
<i>to earn as many Pieces as I can.</i>

354
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,810
I need to give you a Piece
in the living area.

355
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,021
-Why?
-You used one for me yesterday.

356
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,064
I'll repay you.

357
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,523
How did you get another Piece?

358
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,858
Because you went to prison.

359
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,527
<i>I'm shocked that Kyeong-rim wrote my name.</i>

360
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,113
I thought she supported me, but she
secretly hoped that I would go to prison.

361
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,865
When did you get that rule book?

362
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,283
I just got it in there.

363
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,161
What is it?

364
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,412
-You know the safe?
-Yeah.

365
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,247
The safe?

366
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,167
-Take a seat first and lower your voice.
-Did you solve it?

367
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,711
The rules are crazy.

368
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,004
How was prison?

369
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,006
It was all right.

370
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,674
They say something's hidden there.

371
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,926
-It's like an escape room.
-Right.

372
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,427
Something's hidden there.

373
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,470
Who said that?

374
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,971
She found something.

375
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,265
-Where? What is it?
-It's...

376
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,975
After finding it...

377
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,769
I need to change.

378
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,562
Can you cover the camera for me?

379
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,815
-Why would you tell them?
-What's wrong?

380
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
What is it?

381
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,946
-What's going on?
-I need to change. Cover me.

382
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,614
-I'm changing.
-He's changing.

383
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,743
That safe will most likely contain

384
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,915
something that can be used to prevent
an elimination or in an emergency.

385
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,543
But if we let ORBIT
and the rest in on this,

386
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,585
it will become useless

387
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,421
because more people will have a say
in who gets to use it.

388
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,466
This is what I'm thinking.

389
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,719
Keep it between you, me, and Yeon-woo.

390
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,013
We'll use it if one of us
runs into trouble.

391
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,062
-I'm not in an alliance today.
-Me neither.

392
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,064
So it's you and me.

393
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,316
-After what happened yesterday...
-What do you mean?

394
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,277
-We have to what?
-We're teaming up today.

395
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,445
I feel bad for yesterday.

396
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,613
-Joon-bin.
-Yeah?

397
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,741
-I wanted to tell you this.
-What?

398
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,994
Between you and Dong-jae, I chose you.

399
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,996
Did you know that?

400
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,956
-Really?
-I'll do my best to help you.

401
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,127
So if the animals in my condition card

402
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,795
-and my combination...
-Only if they match.

403
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,672
It's good if they match,

404
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,757
but it could also be good if they don't.

405
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,510
If they don't match,
it could still be good for others.

406
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,554
-That's good for me and for others.
-Exactly.

407
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,222
When Kyeong-rim is stacking her tiles,

408
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,224
she could be meeting
your personal condition.

409
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,476
-Then I can support her.
-That's possible.

410
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,811
Even if they don't match.

411
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,316
<i>Each matching combination on the board
is worth one point.</i>

412
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>If a player's personal condition is met,</i>

413
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,988
<i>their score will be doubled.</i>

414
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,450
After that is when the game really begins.

415
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,368
It's a matter of how many credits you bid.

416
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,745
-Let's say you like A.
-Okay.

417
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,623
-Then you should bid on B so A wins.
-You could do that.

418
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,874
-Exactly.
-Additionally,

419
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,585
whoever makes the highest bid
decides the combination, right?

420
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,462
<i>Unlike in ordinary auctions,</i>

421
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:18,091
<i>in Zoo, the group with the lower bid
wins the auction.</i>

422
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:22,638
<i>Additionally, whoever bids
the most credits on the winning side</i>

423
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,475
<i>ultimately decides
the placement of the tiles.</i>

424
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,228
As for the auction in this game,

425
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,438
-the side with the lower bid wins, right?
-Right.

426
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,524
-You two bid on the other side.
-The other side?

427
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,070
Yeah, then I can bid on my side
and increase my chances of winning.

428
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,657
How well have you understood the rules?

429
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,200
Is this an alliance?

430
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,618
-What?
-Are you all in an alliance?

431
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,745
-You two are in an alliance.
-No.

432
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,622
Tell us if we can win by working together.

433
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,581
It's more likely.

434
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,874
How?

435
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,960
First, decide on one animal
to put in the middle.

436
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,795
Let's say we all have snakes.

437
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,547
If we all put the snake in the middle,
our chances will increase.

438
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,675
And we'll all go with stickers
that aren't snakes.

439
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,926
That way,

440
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,055
the others won't hesitate to place snakes
and we're more likely to win the auction.

441
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,517
<i>Even with different animal combinations,</i>

442
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,478
<i>players can place
the same animal card in the middle.</i>

443
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,941
<i>By using the minimum amount of tiles,</i>

444
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:20,028
<i>players can each earn at least one point
through the shared animal.</i>

445
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,073
It's highly unlikely
that we will pick the same cards.

446
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,658
So just focus on the middle.

447
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,827
If our cards overlap, that would be great.

448
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,911
But I can't control that.

449
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,038
Of course not.
That's why it's a game of probability.

450
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,960
We're just trying to increase our chances
by making the right placements.

451
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,255
Right from the beginning of the game,

452
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,590
we will all want different things.

453
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,843
-Right.
-All of us will.

454
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,803
-Anyone can be allies?
-Teams will keep changing.

455
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:48,807
Everyone's interests
will change every round.

456
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,058
We'll be divided.

457
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,187
<i>The time has expired.
Please return to the main hall.</i>

458
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,149
<i>Zoo begins now.</i>

459
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,986
<i>First, the players' order
will be determined through a draw.</i>

460
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,238
Yeon-woo, please draw a ball.

461
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,197
One.

462
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,157
Two.

463
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,867
-Three.
-Four, the number of death.

464
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,910
Six.

465
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,037
Seven.

466
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,163
Seungkwan, eight.

467
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,457
<i>The players' combinations</i>

468
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,375
<i>and personal conditions
will be determined.</i>

469
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,379
<i>Starting with Yeon-woo,
please enter the dealer room one by one.</i>

470
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,297
Yeon-woo,

471
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,674
please draw three animal cards.

472
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,889
Choose an animal to reveal to others.

473
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,558
-I'll choose snake.
-Will you choose snake?

474
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,352
-Yeon-woo's out.
-How was it?

475
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,730
Did you pick three of the same cards?

476
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,149
Choose an animal to reveal to others.

477
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,863
All right. I got the cards I wanted.

478
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,531
-Really?
-I got what I wanted.

479
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,616
What?

480
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,543
{\an8}Honestly, getting two cards
of the same animal isn't ideal.

481
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,214
I need my poker face on.

482
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,550
Who's number four?

483
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,844
How was it?

484
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,387
-I'm doomed.
-You are?

485
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,644
-Do you have duplicates?
-I got two snakes and a lion.

486
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,770
It's the worst.

487
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,980
Don't tell anyone you're doomed.

488
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,525
If you do,
they'll all know you have duplicates.

489
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,901
Do this instead.

490
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,654
Just say you didn't draw
an animal you like.

491
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,114
While going out,

492
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,324
-I'll say, "They're not that bad."
-Okay.

493
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,367
They're not that bad.

494
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,203
-Stop working together.
-It's not that.

495
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,288
I saw her cards and they're not that bad.

496
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,706
-What?
-You saw her cards?

497
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,749
I'll look at yours too.

498
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,792
I'm good.

499
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,793
What about you, Seok-jin?

500
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,877
I'm good too.

501
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,464
What's this animal?

502
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,133
-That's a snake.
-I see.

503
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,300
I'll reveal this card.

504
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,052
-Will you reveal the snake?
-Yes.

505
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,850
<i>All players' combinations</i>

506
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,018
<i>and personal conditions
have been determined.</i>

507
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,520
There are so many lions.

508
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,857
{\an8}Yeon-woo, I guess
fate has brought us together today.

509
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,942
{\an8}-Let's do well.
-Seok-jin.

510
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,277
I'll have to join the lions.

511
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,112
I guess you do. Darn it.

512
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,280
This is annoying.

513
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,198
Why did everyone choose lion?

514
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,617
<i>The animal tiles
for round one will be drawn.</i>

515
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,412
The animal tiles
for group A will be drawn.

516
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,830
Everyone, look.

517
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,248
This is fun.

518
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,458
Snake.

519
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,628
-Snake?
-Snake?

520
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,796
Snake?

521
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,298
Elephant.

522
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,883
Snake.

523
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,385
{\an8}-I guess you could draw two snakes.
-That's a lot of snakes.

524
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,595
-Snake.
-What's your animal?

525
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,888
-Mine is snake.
-Snake?

526
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,639
Kyeong-rim will go for A then.

527
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,267
Lion.

528
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,518
{\an8}There's a lion.

529
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,521
{\an8}<i>It was a perfect combination for me.</i>

530
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,608
I need A to win the auction
no matter what.

531
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,904
The animal tiles
for group B will be drawn.

532
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,822
Elephant.

533
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,990
No one chose elephant.

534
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,325
Parrot.

535
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,120
Elephant.

536
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,039
Where's the monkey? This draw is a bust.

537
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,166
-Snake.
-No monkey?

538
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,376
-There are a lot of snakes.
-Where's the monkey?

539
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,463
<i>The auction will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

540
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,380
Thirty minutes?

541
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,925
{\an8}-A is perfect for you, right?
-Yeah.

542
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,011
{\an8}You should get into group A
and go with snake, snake, lion.

543
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,763
{\an8}I should be the highest bidder

544
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,348
-for the group with lower bid.
-Right.

545
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,432
So...

546
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,684
-Four?
-Bid three.

547
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,936
-That would be safe.
-Three?

548
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,647
Isn't three too little?

549
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,858
If we show each other our cards,
we win for sure.

550
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:27,901
-Really?
-I'm sure of it.

551
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,527
We have to show our cards.

552
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,279
Be honest. Are you in an alliance?

553
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,156
Are you working with anyone else?

554
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,199
I'm not.

555
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,743
I'm just wondering
how you'll play alone then.

556
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,037
I'm worried they'll notice us together.

557
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,498
-We have to be careful.
-Be careful and decide quickly.

558
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,208
The situation isn't great for us two.

559
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,584
If you have the best cards,
we'll back you up.

560
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,754
I'll go with parrot, lion, parrot.

561
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,798
Please draw one condition card.

562
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,841
Your condition is

563
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,427
that there are more parrots than lions.

564
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,637
That's right.

565
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,305
-Your condition is perfect.
-It is.

566
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,015
Your combination is really good.

567
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,141
I have parrot, lion, elephant.

568
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,726
{\an8}She has lion, parrot, monkey,
and you have parrot, lion, parrot.

569
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,061
{\an8}We all have parrots and lions.

570
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,398
{\an8}But for this,
the lion can't go on the sides.

571
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,525
{\an8}Right, because we put them in the middle.

572
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,235
{\an8}We should've discussed this.

573
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,778
Are you guys brainstorming?

574
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,407
Seungkwan, I have a question.

575
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,575
Which side works better for you?

576
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,744
Right now, they're both similar.

577
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,289
Then can you bet on B?

578
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,083
{\an8}If I place the tiles vertically,
that would be a bingo.

579
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,586
{\an8}Then I can place four more tiles
horizontally in the next round.

580
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,881
{\an8}In that case, I can help other people.

581
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,301
<i>Her plan is to place tiles vertically
in the first column</i>

582
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,886
<i>to leave rows empty.</i>

583
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,930
Hey, Yeon-woo.

584
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,098
-Which side is better?
-For me?

585
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,308
Is there a side?

586
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,517
Is it still unclear?

587
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,352
They're both not bad for me.

588
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,273
From what she said,
it seems like A is better for her.

589
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,941
-Really?
-Kyeong-rim.

590
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,487
-A is better for you?
-Sorry? Well...

591
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:59,159
The first round
was a perfect chance for me to win.

592
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,077
So I <i>had</i> to win.

593
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,748
If Dong-joo managed
to make deals with everyone,

594
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,915
it's over for us.

595
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,168
As of now, she can only ask

596
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,755
me, you, and ORBIT for help.

597
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,174
-Can you blow up A for me?
-Then Seok-jin...

598
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,135
I think that parrot
will make or break for me.

599
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,095
Just let me have that parrot.

600
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,181
-See-won, think this through.
-Why?

601
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:25,101
-If you make deals for one parrot,
-Yeah?

602
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,479
you'll have to fill two spaces next time.

603
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,189
Can you make deals again then?

604
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,692
By making deals
when you're in an uncertain situation,

605
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,028
the parrot won't mean anything
if you don't match three.

606
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,781
I was thinking of
setting the parrot aside.

607
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,491
To be honest, I have a parrot too.

608
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,623
Will your order be
elephant, parrot, monkey?

609
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,665
-Yes.
-Yes.

610
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,250
{\an8}Do you also have a parrot?

611
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,461
{\an8}Can you choose that side then?

612
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,172
I'm giving up this round.

613
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,716
And I don't want to waste credits.

614
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,843
Don't tell people about your cards.

615
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,678
Don't say you want a parrot.

616
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,597
She already has the parrot sticker on.

617
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,723
Oh, you're right.

618
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,520
<i>The auction will begin in three minutes.</i>

619
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,481
What's Dong-joo doing right now?
I thought she needed this.

620
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,441
-What?
-She's close to winning, right?

621
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,484
That's right.

622
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,778
-Just bid four then.
-Okay.

623
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,987
-Four for all of us.
-Okay.

624
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,076
Parrot.

625
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,496
-Let's blow A up, us parrots.
-Sorry?

626
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,623
Let's blow A up by bidding a lot.

627
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,999
-I want a parrot.
-You like B?

628
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:30,917
Yeah.

629
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,378
See-won said she's going to blow up A.

630
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,172
-She did?
-Yeah, because she has a parrot.

631
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,592
-That's annoying.
-Can she do that alone?

632
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,344
<i>The time has expired.</i>

633
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,138
<i>The auction begins now.</i>

634
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:47,058
<i>Starting with Yu-min,
please enter the dealer room one by one.</i>

635
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,226
Yu-min.

636
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,146
Which side will you bid on?

637
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,689
I will bid on B.

638
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,654
Please place your tiles on the board.

639
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,658
I'm done.

640
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,326
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

641
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,121
{\an8}I will bid four credits on B.

642
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,873
I'm going to blow up A.

643
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,500
See-won, please enter the dealer room.

644
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,793
Come on, blow up.

645
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,089
Joon-bin, did you hear about
See-won's plan to blow A up?

646
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,717
-I did.
-It's scaring me.

647
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,969
Please bid however many credits
you would like.

648
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,554
{\an8}I will bid four.

649
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,849
{\an8}Which side will you bid on?

650
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,102
{\an8}I will bid seven credits on A.

651
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,563
Does Dong-joo not want any Pieces?

652
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,523
-She just wants a point?
-That's right.

653
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,651
-So after that, she'll help others?
-Yeah.

654
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,112
She'll do that first
and then consider getting two points.

655
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,615
Since I have snake, snake, lion,
I'll go with snake, snake, lion, elephant.

656
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,616
Okay, I'm done.

657
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,326
If finished,
please return to the main hall.

658
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,535
Thank you.

659
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,996
Seok-jin, which side will you bid on?

660
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,206
I will...

661
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,874
<i>Here are the results of the auction.</i>

662
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,709
-Right away?
-Wow.

663
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,085
Which side won the bid?

664
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:01,049
<i>In this round,
a total of 41 credits were bid.</i>

665
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,759
I guess they don't tell you
which side won.

666
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,262
<i>Here is the placement chosen
by this round's winner.</i>

667
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,431
So they don't tell us which side won.

668
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,226
{\an8}It looks like A won.

669
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,731
Snake, snake, lion, elephant.
Okay, I'm done.

670
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,359
What?

671
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,069
Okay.

672
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,862
-Who got snake?
-Snake, snake, lion, elephant.

673
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,282
We did what she said.

674
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,702
And we also tried to benefit from it,
but it didn't work.

675
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,704
This is how I placed my tiles.

676
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,373
But this is how it turned out.

677
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,000
Someone outbid me
and chose this placement.

678
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,087
<i>The animal tiles
for round two will be drawn.</i>

679
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,130
The animal tiles
for group A will be drawn.

680
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,590
-Give me a monkey.
-Parrot.

681
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,764
-Lion.
-Lions are drawn so frequently.

682
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,850
-They could all be drawn early on.
-Yeah.

683
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,727
-Okay!
-Monkey.

684
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,854
{\an8}That's good.

685
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,356
-Elephant.
-Elephant.

686
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,484
{\an8}This is really good for us.

687
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,611
It can't get better than this.

688
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,406
The animal tiles
for group B will be drawn.

689
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,533
Lion.

690
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,868
-Monkey.
-Great.

691
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,869
Monkey.

692
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,454
-So many monkeys.
-This is ORBIT's round.

693
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,581
This is great.

694
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,458
-Snake.
-Okay.

695
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,670
<i>The auction will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

696
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,715
Why are the tiles in the second column?

697
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,592
-Sorry?
-Why did you go with the second column?

698
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,599
Someone else must have done it.

699
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,225
Have you heard anything?

700
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,685
-Really?
-No one made a mistake.

701
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,520
This is crazy.

702
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,858
I want A to win the auction.

703
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,484
-Okay.
-What about you?

704
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,944
Me too.

705
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,281
Are you good with just these tiles?

706
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,283
Or do you need to combine them
with the previous ones?

707
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,827
-You have to think about that.
-Not sure I can share that with you.

708
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,454
I'll be honest.

709
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,457
I can help you all
because the placement's not good for me.

710
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,083
I can also help.

711
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,835
I'm done after this.

712
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,171
-You?
-Yeah, I'll be done.

713
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,589
What is it that you want?

714
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,132
Just bid four on B.

715
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,011
Seok-jin, let's help each other out.
This round is important to me.

716
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,973
<i>These players hope
that group A will win the auction.</i>

717
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,559
<i>Their combinations may be different,</i>

718
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,146
<i>but if Joon-bin and Yu-min
place the tiles as shown,</i>

719
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,190
<i>they can both earn points.</i>

720
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:28,071
<i>ORBIT and See-won can earn points
by placing the tiles like this.</i>

721
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,575
<i>It seems like
the players' fortunes will change</i>

722
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,453
<i>depending on who places the tiles.</i>

723
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,500
I think this round is important to me.

724
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,335
So you want me to blow B up?

725
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,670
-By bidding a lot?
-Yeah.

726
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,755
I'm not sure how much I should bid

727
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,215
for B to blow up.

728
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,383
You're going to bid on B?

729
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,134
No, I'll bid on A.

730
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,261
I need to bid the most
on the winning side.

731
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,806
And you're going to ask others
to blow up the other side?

732
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,599
Let me weigh my options.

733
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,560
Parrot, what will you do?

734
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,980
You want the side
with the parrot to win, right?

735
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,190
-You want B to blow up, don't you?
-Me?

736
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,900
How many parrots do you have?

737
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,568
I can't tell you.

738
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,153
That means you have a lot. Okay.

739
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,238
You...

740
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,575
Joon-bin and I need to win.

741
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,786
-You have to.
-We really need to get this round.

742
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,913
Right, and is this what you're going with?

743
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,124
{\an8}I have lion, parrot, monkey.

744
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,333
{\an8}-Lion, parrot, monkey?
-Yeah.

745
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,377
{\an8}-Joon-bin has elephant, lion, parrot?
-Yeah.

746
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,628
{\an8}It doesn't work for me.

747
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,796
{\an8}What do you have?

748
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,964
{\an8}I have elephant, parrot, monkey.

749
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,257
{\an8}-That's why.
-I see.

750
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,842
This is tough.

751
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,928
Then I'll... Yu-min.

752
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,805
-Yeah?
-Are you doing all right?

753
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,015
Are you figuring it out?

754
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,307
We haven't told her yet, right?

755
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,268
I can end this by being selfish.

756
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,769
But it's better for the two to get it.

757
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,355
I'm just going to support the two
since I can't make it anyway.

758
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,149
The last round was key for you.

759
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,900
This round is key for me.

760
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,777
-Right.
-Bid four on B.

761
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,529
-I'll do the same.
-I need this round.

762
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,614
Joon-bin, this round is yours.

763
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,866
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

764
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,119
I need a point here.
I can't make a mistake again.

765
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,706
<i>The way I saw it, I really needed a point
in the early rounds.</i>

766
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,710
That way, I could plan for victory
in rounds three, four, and five.

767
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,336
-This is what I'm worried about.
-What?

768
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,839
What if I don't get a point in this round?

769
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,675
We both need points,
so can you bid ten on B?

770
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,428
-Don't you think B will blow up?
-That's not guaranteed.

771
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,722
-That's true, but...
-We lost the first round.

772
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,433
Do you think ten will be enough?

773
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,893
<i>The time has expired.</i>

774
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,562
<i>The auction for round two begins now.</i>

775
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,524
<i>Starting with Yeon-woo,
please enter the dealer room one by one.</i>

776
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,444
Yeon-woo, please make a bid.

777
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,239
Hello.

778
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,993
{\an8}One, two, three, four.

779
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,370
I wonder what the results will be like.

780
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,039
ORBIT, please make a bid.

781
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,666
Joon-bin, please make a bid.

782
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,502
Do I need to tell you how many?
I have a lot.

783
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,591
This is hard.

784
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,967
How many did you bid on A?

785
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,178
You bid on A, didn't you?

786
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,262
Please return to the main hall.

787
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,890
Who's next?

788
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:01,891
Who's number seven?

789
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,102
I'm eight. Who's seven?

790
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,646
-Too bad for you.
-It's too late.

791
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,980
I bid a lot.

792
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,399
-You did?
-Yeah. What if it blows up?

793
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,860
You were telling everyone to bid on B.

794
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,321
I just sat there watching you.

795
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,782
-See-won, please enter the dealer room.
-Okay.

796
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,866
You haven't gone yet?

797
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,829
-I almost got you.
-You're really something.

798
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,290
I got chills down my spine. She's such a...

799
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,334
sly fox.

800
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,086
Please make a bid.

801
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,421
She told me she already went,
so I almost told her.

802
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,385
{\an8}These look like fizzy tablets.

803
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,720
Wait a minute.

804
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,349
<i>Here are the results
of the auction for round two.</i>

805
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,600
I can't watch.

806
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,354
<i>In this round,
a total of 59 credits were bid.</i>

807
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,480
-What?
-Really?

808
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,065
-What's this?
-Are you serious, See-won?

809
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,942
-She made a big bet.
-You went all in?

810
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,028
<i>Here is the placement chosen
by this round's winner.</i>

811
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,534
-Joon-bin.
-Yeah?

812
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,535
Ten on A.

813
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,745
Do you think ten will be enough?

814
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,038
How many did you bid on A?

815
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,206
You bid on A, didn't you?

816
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,668
{\an8}-You have bid ten credits.
-Okay.

817
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,628
{\an8}Do I need to tell you how many?
I have a lot.

818
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,298
{\an8}-Please let me know.
-Right. I'll bid thirteen credits.

819
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,010
{\an8}B blew up.

820
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,469
{\an8}How many were bid on it?

821
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,681
See-won did that.

822
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,774
If fifty-something got bid,
then it really blew up.

823
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,569
<i>The animal tiles
for round three will be drawn.</i>

824
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,112
Elephant.

825
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:39,906
Snake.

826
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,366
Monkey.

827
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,243
{\an8}Another monkey? Great.

828
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,621
{\an8}-Parrot.
-Parrot!

829
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,538
{\an8}This is great!

830
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,707
-You don't even have a parrot.
-All right!

831
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,791
I'm so naive, aren't I?

832
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,043
Yeah, you're the best.

833
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,005
<i>There was a parrot on this side.</i>

834
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,174
<i>I could have gotten parrot, lion, parrot.</i>

835
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:02,220
{\an8}<i>With such a great draw,
I had to get something in this round.</i>

836
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,388
The animal tiles
for group B will be drawn.

837
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,932
Lion.

838
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,141
Lion, nice!

839
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,060
Are you cheering for everything?

840
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,395
-Lion.
-No way.

841
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,605
It's over.

842
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,814
-What's up with him?
-What's with him?

843
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,399
Monkey.

844
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,734
Monkey? This is amazing.

845
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,069
Lion.

846
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,070
Three lions!

847
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,780
-That's amazing!
-It's full of lions.

848
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:24,492
This is great for whoever has two lions.

849
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,077
Can you all please blow up A?

850
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,495
I ask as a lion.

851
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,497
Help me. I need A to win.

852
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,623
-You need A?
-Yeah.

853
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,376
I just need a snake on this tile.

854
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,377
-Snake?
-Yeah.

855
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,628
You take A then.

856
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,840
I drew a monkey, snake, and elephant.

857
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,801
<i>I got the combination I wanted.</i>

858
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:46,097
{\an8}<i>There are even snakes and elephants tiles
in the bottom row.</i>

859
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,724
I think I have a fighting chance.

860
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,893
If you win,
put a monkey tile at the bottom.

861
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,562
-Okay.
-Then put a snake tile above it.

862
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,480
Right.

863
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,899
The remaining tiles don't really matter,
but I'll check the others.

864
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,778
My cards aren't that great.

865
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,322
<i>Alliances were more important
than I thought.</i>

866
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:07,159
I thought about talking to
ORBIT, Dong-joo, and Joon-bin.

867
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,203
<i>Knowing ORBIT,</i>

868
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,331
<i>he wants to protect the weaker players.</i>

869
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,251
No one's weaker than someone
who's been to prison twice.

870
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,670
<i>I thought I could use that
to my advantage.</i>

871
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,343
{\an8}-What's yours?
-Elephant, snake, elephant.

872
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,804
{\an8}Elephant, snake, elephant?
Okay, I'll help you.

873
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,930
-You can?
-Yeah.

874
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,056
How?

875
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,142
-A is your only option, right?
-Yeah.

876
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,019
-Just go for this.
-I'll go for that.

877
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,187
-Put a parrot here.
-It'll be parrot, lion, parrot.

878
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,732
Talk to them.

879
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,734
-They're devising a plan.
-Okay.

880
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,278
I'm looking at all the combinations.

881
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,071
Two people are getting points this round.

882
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,240
-How?
-Two this round, then Kyeong-rim.

883
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,408
Do we go for A or B?

884
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,409
-Go for B.
-A.

885
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,119
If it's A, Seungkwan can get a point.

886
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,620
I'll look at Seungkwan's in a bit.

887
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,582
Kyeong-rim bid ten,
and the rest will bid four.

888
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,876
-So you all bid on B?
-Yeah.

889
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,461
-I'll bid on A.
-We'll bid four.

890
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,546
-I'll go with A.
-You bid ten credits.

891
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,590
I need to help you survive, right?

892
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,258
Right.

893
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,385
I'll do some calculations.

894
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,347
Okay.

895
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,558
Okay, this is good.

896
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,060
We've got a great combination this round.

897
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,312
Everyone except me will get a point.

898
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,772
And two of us will win two points.

899
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,315
-Me...
-You and one more.

900
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,733
Me and who?

901
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,817
I need to find them.

902
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,986
-I need to figure it out.
-What's the great combination?

903
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,947
Do you have elephant, lion, parrot?

904
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,866
Yeah, why?

905
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,576
You'll get a point.

906
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,578
-How?
-When you get a Piece...

907
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,247
Wait a minute.
Does Seungkwan get a point too?

908
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,208
-Seungkwan? Hang on.
-Yeah.

909
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,751
It doesn't seem like it'll work.

910
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,298
In this round,

911
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,926
-four people on our side will get points.
-Really?

912
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,094
But not me.

913
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,888
-I need a point in the next round.
-Okay.

914
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,640
What's your plan?

915
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,141
What about you?

916
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,434
I need to...

917
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,144
get rid of B.

918
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,479
-You need to get rid of B?
-Yeah.

919
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,441
Not many people seem to want B to win.

920
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,567
Exactly.

921
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,363
I want to place A's tiles on the board.

922
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,740
-Blowing up B would be a good move.
-Right.

923
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,242
ORBIT, there are six tiles

924
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,661
-for each animal, right?
-Yeah.

925
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,621
Then how many tiles
have been drawn so far?

926
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,290
-Monkey, elephant...
-Don't they put the tiles back in?

927
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,210
-Do you put the tiles back in?
-No.

928
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,253
-They're removed?
-Yes, they are.

929
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,171
-See? We can calculate this.
-Really?

930
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,297
That's what I was saying.

931
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,425
-Lion, lion, monkey, lion.
-Yeah.

932
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,593
No more lion tiles are left.

933
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,762
-You're right.
-The lions are gone.

934
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,180
What's your personal condition?

935
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,640
{\an8}I need more lions than monkeys.

936
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,976
{\an8}I've met mine. I'm done.

937
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,394
{\an8}You are.

938
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,856
<i>The auction for round three
will begin in ten minutes.</i>

939
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,567
Based on the tiles drawn,
the lion tiles are gone.

940
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,235
-So no more lions?
-No more.

941
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,945
Can you finish first then?

942
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,238
What's your personal condition?

943
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,364
My condition is that

944
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,825
there are more lions, so I'm done.

945
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,368
-How about you?
-I can't meet it.

946
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,078
You really need to win group A.

947
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,955
-Bid thirteen.
-Thirteen?

948
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,707
-Yeon-woo.
-Yeah?

949
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,333
-You have one Piece, don't you?
-Yeah.

950
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,461
Let's see what the draw is like
in the next round first.

951
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,755
<i>The time has expired.</i>

952
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,341
<i>The auction for round three begins now.</i>

953
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,678
<i>Starting with Yu-min,
please enter the dealer room one by one.</i>

954
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,597
So you're bidding on B?

955
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,932
-Four on B.
-Right.

956
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,184
You said you'd get parrot, lion, parrot.

957
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,020
-I said that?
-Weren't you going to do that?

958
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,438
Well, the thing is...

959
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,400
They want me to bid on B?

960
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,777
Then parrot...

961
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,447
Seungkwan, please make a bid.

962
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,532
I really need a point.
This is frustrating.

963
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,452
Will it be that bad?

964
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,751
Six.

965
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,420
I'll bid six on A.

966
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,631
Six.

967
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,468
This is just...

968
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,928
<i>I really want to</i>

969
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,846
go my own way today.

970
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,432
I want to get myself together

971
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,518
<i>and stop being swayed by others.</i>

972
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,602
Six...

973
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,395
I'm sorry!

974
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,772
{\an8}I'll bid four on B.

975
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,400
I'm a coward.

976
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,152
-You bid four on B.
-Yes.

977
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,489
I really hope someone puts a parrot here.

978
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,782
Parrot!

979
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,994
Why do you look so sad?

980
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,663
I need to get a point.

981
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:21,914
-You haven't yet?
-No.

982
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,000
These are the tiles left.

983
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,294
-There are no more lions?
-None.

984
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,463
-I'm doomed.
-You are?

985
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,382
I have a slim chance.

986
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,510
Talk to me. I'll help you.

987
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,887
Please make a bid.

988
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,941
You really need to win group A.

989
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,818
-Bid thirteen.
-Thirteen?

990
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,245
-If we go with your plan,
-Yeah?

991
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,913
wouldn't Yeon-woo end up in prison again?

992
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,790
That's why we'll get her another point.

993
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,167
-I'm in a bad situation too.
-Right.

994
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,712
Don't worry, you'll get a point later.

995
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,879
What were your cards again?

996
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,008
-I didn't tell anyone.
-What was it? I don't remember.

997
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,802
-Do I not know yours?
-No, you don't.

998
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,679
ORBIT, how many credits
do you think will be in round three?

999
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,389
How can he help you if he doesn't know?

1000
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,141
You didn't tell him?

1001
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,268
-No.
-Then how would he help you?

1002
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,186
He told me you were in a good situation.

1003
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,440
-How will he help you then?
-I've only been working with you.

1004
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,276
-What?
-I've only been working with you.

1005
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,194
What? I thought you told him.

1006
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,322
-What are you talking about?
-Then you won't get a point this round.

1007
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,908
What combinations have you worked on?
Let me write them down just in case.

1008
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,120
{\an8}Then Seungkwan...

1009
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,248
{\an8}Did he bid on A?

1010
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,502
{\an8}This won't work for Seungkwan.

1011
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,297
-This is your only chance to get a point.
-Joon-bin.

1012
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,382
-Please enter the dealer room.
-We need to go with parrot, lion, parrot.

1013
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,342
What will you do?

1014
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,885
-You're right.
-Want me to switch things up?

1015
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,928
You're right.

1016
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:00,971
ORBIT.

1017
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,931
My combination is parrot, lion, parrot.

1018
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,726
-What's yours?
-Parrot, lion, parrot.

1019
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,810
This is...

1020
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,895
It won't work.

1021
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,439
-I'm in danger.
-You really are. Hey, ORBIT.

1022
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,191
I think you made a mistake.

1023
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,152
Seungkwan...

1024
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,987
I didn't have Seungkwan's combination.

1025
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,530
He didn't tell me.

1026
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,949
-How can I help you then?
-That's my point.

1027
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,284
Didn't Joon-bin help you?

1028
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,702
-He did help me.
-I didn't know yours.

1029
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,038
-Joon-bin helped me.
-It's over now.

1030
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,667
-Did Kyeong-rim go in?
-She's already been in. It's over.

1031
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,711
I had no idea what his combination was.

1032
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,588
It's over.

1033
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,215
Hey, why didn't you...

1034
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,717
-Why didn't you help him?
-I thought you knew.

1035
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,260
I didn't because you didn't tell me.

1036
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,304
-We're only now realizing this.
-Damn it.

1037
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,555
What is it?

1038
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,767
-ORBIT, please enter the dealer room.
-Wait a minute.

1039
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,896
-Who hasn't gone in yet?
-Then Kyeong-rim... I haven't gone in yet.

1040
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,523
I need to solve this somehow.

1041
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,275
Then I'll... ORBIT, how many did you bid?

1042
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,443
Four.

1043
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,903
-Hey, wait a moment. Talk it out now.
-Joon-bin.

1044
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,780
-Dong-joo.
-Just a moment.

1045
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,700
{\an8}I'll put a parrot right here and bid more.

1046
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,160
Kyeong-rim, how many did you bid again?

1047
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,663
-Thirteen.
-Okay.

1048
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,581
Wait.

1049
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,250
Wait.

1050
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,001
-What?
-It might blow up if we bid too much.

1051
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,423
The next person has to bid more then.

1052
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,632
No!

1053
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,801
-What?
-Wait, we can't.

1054
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,927
What?

1055
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,638
We can't do that.
Someone else won't get a point.

1056
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:25,931
-Who?
-It's elephant, snake, elephant.

1057
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,016
I don't know who it is,
but someone has that combination.

1058
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,476
I don't know who it is though.

1059
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,104
<i>We have to choose
one of these two combinations.</i>

1060
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,606
I don't know who has
elephant, snake, elephant.

1061
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,483
Helping everyone is impossible.

1062
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,610
So what do I do?
Do I just bid four on B then?

1063
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,071
If I do, it's over for Seungkwan.

1064
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,325
I don't know who has
elephant, snake, elephant.

1065
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,369
Is this Yeon-woo's combination?

1066
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,496
-What's yours?
-Elephant, snake, elephant.

1067
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,874
Elephant, snake, elephant?
Okay, I'll help you.

1068
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,334
It's Yeon-woo's. We need to help her.

1069
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,087
Seungkwan has two Pieces.
Yeon-woo has one. It'll be over for her.

1070
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,047
She'd be gone for good.

1071
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,049
Go with the original plan and bid on B.

1072
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,303
Seungkwan, there's no choice.

1073
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,096
-It's fine.
-Yeon-woo would have to go home.

1074
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,432
It's like I'm watching
the fall of the welfare state.

1075
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,976
You can lose a Piece, can't you?
I'll give you one.

1076
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,811
If Yeon-woo loses hers,
she has to go home.

1077
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,605
We can't help you because of Yeon-woo.

1078
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,608
Okay? Even if I know yours,
I have to prioritize her.

1079
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,736
-We could lose our Pieces.
-That's fine with me.

1080
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,154
If you lose yours, I'll give you one.

1081
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,490
-Don't worry.
-No, that's all right. But...

1082
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,411
Yeon-woo could die

1083
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,746
-if we help Seungkwan.
-Really?

1084
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,124
We need to get Yeon-woo a point first.

1085
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,962
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

1086
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,173
-Are you okay?
-We couldn't have it both ways anyway.

1087
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,675
If we had changed plans at the end,
Yeon-woo would've gone home.

1088
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,719
Seriously.

1089
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,181
How can this happen even after we spent
so much time thinking this through?

1090
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,854
I don't feel too good about today's game.

1091
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,608
<i>This is all for ORBIT.</i>

1092
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,486
Just to play
according to ORBIT's philosophy,

1093
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:06,156
<i>everyone in the alliance has to suffer</i>

1094
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,784
<i>and help other people survive.</i>

1095
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,536
They didn't earn their own points.

1096
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,745
-They didn't.
-Right.

1097
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,163
They're mooching off him.

1098
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:17,042
Is this <i>The Devil's Plan</i>
or The Moocher's Plan?

1099
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,418
What's the point of surviving like that?

1100
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,839
They're just there to be controlled
like lifeless puppets.

1101
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,633
What's the point of saving them?

1102
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,261
Everyone should know this.

1103
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:32,015
You can't achieve what you want
by relying on others.

1104
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,185
<i>Are you here to simply survive
or to play the game?</i>

1105
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,603
They should think about that.

1106
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,314
<i>Here are the results
of the auction for round three.</i>

1107
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,443
<i>In this round,
a total of 60 credits were bid.</i>

1108
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,573
<i>Here is the placement chosen
by this round's winner.</i>

1109
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,782
Please.

1110
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,661
Come on, parrot.

1111
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,749
Monkey, snake, elephant.

1112
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,505
It's mine.

1113
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,674
{\an8}-You bid 12 on A.
-Yes.

1114
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,887
{\an8}-You bid 13 on A.
-Yes.

1115
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,014
<i>I should've gone all in.</i>

1116
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,266
<i>Not doing so was a huge blunder.</i>

1117
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,893
<i>The animal tiles
for round four will be drawn.</i>

1118
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,979
The animal tiles
for group A will be drawn.

1119
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,692
Parrot.

1120
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,528
We'll be getting a lot of parrots
since we didn't get many of them earlier.

1121
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,655
Monkey.

1122
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,282
Monkey.

1123
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,867
Elephant.

1124
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,702
Parrot, monkey, monkey, elephant.

1125
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,495
The animal tiles
for group B will be drawn.

1126
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,373
Snake.

1127
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:39,833
Elephant.

1128
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,293
Parrot.

1129
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,669
Elephant.

1130
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,796
-Snake, elephant, parrot, elephant.
-Parrot and elephant.

1131
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,634
<i>The auction for round four
will begin in ten minutes.</i>

1132
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,763
If Yeon-woo gets another point,

1133
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,056
{\an8}-she gets a Piece.
-Right.

1134
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,849
{\an8}She has elephant, snake, elephant.

1135
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:01,188
<i>If Yeon-woo wins the auction in round four
and places the tiles as shown</i>

1136
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,858
<i>and places another snake tile
here in round five,</i>

1137
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,819
<i>she could even earn three points.</i>

1138
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,073
Let's place the tiles like that.

1139
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,283
And then see what happens in round five.

1140
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,951
For Seungkwan,

1141
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,954
it's over because there are no more lions.

1142
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,290
<i>What angered me the most</i>

1143
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,960
was that we had agreed
to form a group of four

1144
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,922
and try our best to protect each other.

1145
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,883
Yet once faced with a situation like this,

1146
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:32,844
<i>Seungkwan was forgotten
and it was all about saving Yeon-woo.</i>

1147
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,597
<i>Then what's the point of an alliance?</i>

1148
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,809
And I think this will cause problems
down the road.

1149
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,185
We have to decide.

1150
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:43,647
If we decide to help Yeon-woo get a Piece,

1151
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,565
I will lose a Piece.

1152
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,026
And Seungkwan will go to prison.

1153
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,903
Is there a way to save Seungkwan?

1154
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,446
How can we save him with his combination?

1155
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,531
-We can't.
-I have to go.

1156
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,158
-We can't save him then.
-I'm going to prison.

1157
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,577
-Just save Yeon-woo then.
-We have to.

1158
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,538
I'll sacrifice myself and help Yeon-woo.

1159
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,084
<i>In conclusion,</i>

1160
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,253
<i>Seungkwan is going to prison again.</i>

1161
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:10,257
And Yeon-woo avoids
both prison and elimination.

1162
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,551
I think Dong-joo is pretty upset

1163
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,429
as she sees this as an issue
that arose from miscommunication.

1164
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,181
It's my fault
that Seungkwan is going to prison.

1165
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,975
I wonder who'll go with me.

1166
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,768
-You're going? Let's go together.
-Sure.

1167
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,271
-Let's go together.
-I don't have a point yet.

1168
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,022
Why don't you have a point?

1169
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,482
-You didn't get a match?
-It's not that.

1170
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,109
None of my bids worked.

1171
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,194
It makes sense
since that alliance worked together.

1172
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,654
-Did you win a round yet?
-No.

1173
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,572
Exactly.

1174
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,116
I bid a lot in round three,
but it didn't work.

1175
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,075
Same here.

1176
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,371
It's hard to beat that alliance
with just 30 credits.

1177
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,166
I didn't realize there were
so many people in that alliance.

1178
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,168
I didn't know until round three.

1179
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,253
-Out of us four,
-Yeah.

1180
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,338
Seungkwan is taking all the damage.

1181
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,008
It's great we're helping others, but...

1182
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,303
You're right.
That was a mistake in this game.

1183
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,514
It was a mistake that I could have fixed.

1184
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,225
Seungkwan has two Pieces.
Yeon-woo has one. It'll be over for her.

1185
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,102
Go with the original plan and bid on B.

1186
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,271
I'm not really happy
with how things turned out.

1187
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,231
I think we lost this game.

1188
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,317
If we helped Seungkwan,
Yeon-woo would have gone home.

1189
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,068
That's why I thought
it was the right thing to do.

1190
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,488
And I thought it was right
for her to go home.

1191
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,907
So we help her survive this time.
Then what's next?

1192
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,492
Do we help her again next time?

1193
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,786
I don't think I can anymore.

1194
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:24,790
I feel like swearing.
I'm so mad at ORBIT and the others.

1195
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,458
-You are?
-Yeah.

1196
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,003
Losing a Piece...

1197
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,548
I should just...

1198
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,928
-ORBIT.
-Yeah?

1199
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,764
Don't blame yourself.

1200
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,849
I think I'm doomed.

1201
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,727
I guess helping everyone survive
isn't a good thing.

1202
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:49,064
We're not here to survive
for as long as possible.

1203
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,442
We're here to compete.

1204
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,527
You're right.

1205
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,738
I think I'm doing something wrong.

1206
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,074
Am I really helping the weak?

1207
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,617
How do we define "weak"?

1208
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,120
Am I actually helping
people with a few Pieces?

1209
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,539
<i>Is this all for my satisfaction?</i>

1210
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,082
<i>I was deep in thought.</i>

1211
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,500
<i>The time has expired.</i>

1212
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,127
<i>The auction for round four begins now.</i>

1213
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,297
<i>Starting with Yeon-woo,
please enter the dealer room one by one.</i>

1214
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,382
I'm first.

1215
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,512
{\an8}You bid 13 on B.

1216
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,097
Please make a bid.

1217
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,355
<i>Here are the results
of the auction for round four.</i>

1218
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:34,985
<i>In this round,
a total of 43 credits were bid.</i>

1219
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,574
<i>Here is the placement chosen
by this round's winner.</i>

1220
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,497
{\an8}-Is that yours?
-Yeah.

1221
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,292
<i>After round four,</i>

1222
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:54,296
<i>four players have earned two points
for their matching combinations.</i>

1223
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,089
-You got two matches?
-Yeah.

1224
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,175
<i>The animal tiles
for round five will be drawn.</i>

1225
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,344
The animal tiles
for group A will be drawn.

1226
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,100
Lion.

1227
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,144
-Why is there a lion?
-What?

1228
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,770
-How did a lion get drawn?
-What?

1229
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,063
There was a lion left?

1230
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,315
A lion got drawn?

1231
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,608
-Snake.
-What?

1232
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,068
-Parrot.
-This shouldn't be happening.

1233
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,487
-Lion.
-Why are there so many?

1234
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,157
-What's happening?
-No, this makes sense.

1235
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,366
-It's expected.
-Really?

1236
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,618
What's happening?

1237
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,537
Based on the tiles drawn,
the lion tiles are gone.

1238
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,997
There are no more lions left.

1239
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,708
-Why are there more lions? Seungkwan.
-Didn't you count them?

1240
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,543
-Yeah?
-Let's try to come up with a plan.

1241
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,587
The animal tiles
for group B will be drawn.

1242
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,504
Parrot.

1243
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,547
-No way.
-What?

1244
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:38,924
Parrot.

1245
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,175
Monkey.

1246
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,176
Snake.

1247
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:45,305
<i>The auction for round five
will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

1248
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,515
I guess they put the tiles back in.

1249
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,809
No, there are four of each animal
and 20 in total.

1250
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,894
Tiles drawn are discarded.

1251
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,646
There are four each in A and also in B?

1252
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,647
-That's correct.
-Exactly.

1253
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,608
-We had it wrong.
-Each box has four of each.

1254
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,234
-I was mistaken.
-Right.

1255
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,072
All right, so there are more lions.

1256
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,616
<i>As there are
lion and parrot tiles in group A,</i>

1257
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:08,286
<i>Seungkwan seems to have a fighting chance.</i>

1258
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:12,707
<i>However, there are not enough spaces
for Seungkwan's combination.</i>

1259
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:18,421
<i>Had the parrot and elephant tiles
been placed differently in round four,</i>

1260
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:23,259
<i>Seungkwan would have been able
to earn one point in this round.</i>

1261
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,178
It won't work.

1262
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,431
We should've saved Seungkwan.

1263
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,308
I thought you could.

1264
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,726
No, it's not possible.

1265
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,650
If we can't save him, just make me win.

1266
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,276
Help me out if you can't make it work.

1267
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,444
Can you bid on B?

1268
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:45,073
<i>Dong-joo currently has two points.</i>

1269
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:49,369
<i>If the snake and lion tiles
from group A are placed as shown,</i>

1270
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,037
<i>she can finish with three points.</i>

1271
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,456
Yeon-woo, Kyeong-rim.

1272
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,958
Can you blow up B?

1273
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,418
-B? All right.
-Blow up B?

1274
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,044
Blow up B so I can win.

1275
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,088
Blow up B so I can win.

1276
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,506
-Blow up B?
-Yeah.

1277
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,009
Yu-min, can you please
blow B up if you can?

1278
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,552
-So you can win?
-Yeah, bid on B.

1279
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,762
You just have to bid
the remaining credits on B.

1280
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,140
Seok-jin, can you give me the Piece?

1281
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,516
The third one.

1282
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,601
-You're going to try it here?
-Yeah.

1283
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,603
I've got a hunch.

1284
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,397
You and your darn hunches.

1285
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,235
I believe it's a key.

1286
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,166
-I think luck is on my side today.
-Why?

1287
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,793
{\an8}<i>I had placed the tiles on the left.</i>

1288
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,712
{\an8}<i>But the tiles were placed
in the second column.</i>

1289
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,630
-That means someone else did it.
-Right.

1290
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,340
-And did it help you?
-I was so lucky.

1291
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,675
I'm snake, snake, lion.

1292
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,010
You got two matches?

1293
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,054
I can get another one,
which is why I'm asking for your help.

1294
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,556
I see. You have a great combination.

1295
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,558
I placed these.

1296
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,476
You did?

1297
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,602
I also have a lion.

1298
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,025
Seven, and the last one makes it eight.

1299
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:11,576
That's crazy. We should have talked about
our shared interests from the start.

1300
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,952
Well, we couldn't.

1301
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,829
Kyeong-rim, how many credits do you have?

1302
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,748
-I only have one left.
-Just one?

1303
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,249
-You have one too?
-When did you use them all?

1304
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,292
-You have one?
-Yeah.

1305
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,293
How many do you have?

1306
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,712
I have ten, but I'm only going to bid six.

1307
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,755
That should be enough.

1308
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,381
If I bid all ten...

1309
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,967
-You might end up blowing it up.
-I'm worried the bid will fail.

1310
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,845
<i>The time has expired.</i>

1311
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,098
<i>The auction for round five begins now.</i>

1312
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,893
<i>Starting with Yu-min,
please enter the dealer room one by one.</i>

1313
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,604
I'm going all in.

1314
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,064
I will bid on B.

1315
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,775
There are so many snake tiles.

1316
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,321
Two, three...

1317
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,281
I'll put this here
so no one else gets points.

1318
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,951
<i>Here are the results
of the auction for round five.</i>

1319
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:57,038
<i>In this round,
a total of 60 credits were bid.</i>

1320
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,792
<i>Here is the placement chosen
by this round's winner.</i>

1321
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,757
I didn't win.

1322
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,259
-What?
-Really?

1323
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,511
That's not my placement,
but I still got a match.

1324
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,929
-Really?
-I'm so...

1325
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,098
-I'm so lucky.
-Today's really your day.

1326
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,059
Who bid so many on A?
My placement wasn't chosen.

1327
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,520
<i>I placed the tiles vertically in a line.</i>

1328
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,188
-Do you really not know?
-I only bid four.

1329
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,231
-Really?
-Yeah.

1330
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,775
-So do you have three combinations?
-I have...

1331
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,986
I have three points then.

1332
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,404
-One, two, three, four.
-Your personal condition.

1333
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,822
What's your condition?

1334
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,199
{\an8}It's that there have to be
more lions than monkeys.

1335
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,454
So you have six points then?

1336
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,664
-Yeah.
-No way.

1337
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,125
<i>Here are the results of the game.</i>

1338
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,129
Joon-bin, are you serious?

1339
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,006
You little punk!

1340
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,049
-Why are we tied?
-Hey!

1341
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,010
In round five,
let's try to meet our conditions.

1342
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:56,222
Joon-bin really needed points
in round two,

1343
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,726
<i>so I bid ten on B so he could get them.</i>

1344
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:04,772
And rounds three and four
weren't that important to us.

1345
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:09,360
{\an8}<i>So I saved up my credits
to support Joon-bin in round five.</i>

1346
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,987
My strategy was to save

1347
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,781
as many credits as possible
for round five.

1348
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,699
What's your personal condition?

1349
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,242
-I can't meet it.
-You can't?

1350
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,036
-I can get a match here.
-Right.

1351
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,662
But Dong-joo would get one too.

1352
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,706
I get double points, so six in total.

1353
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,041
Are you sure she can't meet her condition?

1354
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,209
-She said she couldn't.
-What is it?

1355
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,460
I don't remember,
but she said she couldn't.

1356
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,588
Even if she gets three matches,

1357
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,881
I'll finish with six points.

1358
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,591
Dong-joo won't really suspect me.

1359
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,051
Letting her get a point would be better.

1360
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,178
I have ten, but I'm only going to bid six.

1361
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,971
{\an8}I will bid six on A.

1362
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,932
{\an8}You have bid 11 on A.

1363
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,975
-Is he serious?
-If that's the case,

1364
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,728
-you've missed out on extra Pieces.
-We don't get more Pieces.

1365
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,772
-I had no idea you had six points.
-Hey.

1366
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,690
You said you couldn't meet your condition.

1367
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,776
That's what caused this.

1368
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,819
So that's what made you think
you were in the lead.

1369
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,988
I thought I'd win
even if I gave her a point.

1370
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:55,490
Darn it.

1371
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,493
I had such a hectic time trying to win.

1372
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,119
Darn it.

1373
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,956
Joon-bin, that jerk.

1374
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,832
No one earned a lot of Pieces.

1375
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,418
<i>They got the equality that they wanted.</i>

1376
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,503
It's satisfying to see.

1377
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,714
{\an8}<i>Here are the combinations
and conditions of all players.</i>

1378
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,134
{\an8}See-won, we had the same combination.

1379
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,970
{\an8}-We did.
-You did.

1380
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,347
If I had been selfish,
See-won would have racked up points.

1381
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,723
-That's true.
-She could have gotten free points.

1382
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,725
I gave up on getting points in this game.

1383
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,102
See-won, it's time for prison.

1384
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,270
I'm finally going.

1385
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,437
Seungkwan, I'm sorry.

1386
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,314
You should be. Oh, I'm sorry.

1387
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,192
-Didn't he promise you a Piece though?
-Seungkwan, I'm sorry.

1388
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,569
{\an8}<i>Based on the final score,</i>

1389
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,279
{\an8}<i>players with two or more points
receive a Piece.</i>

1390
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,405
{\an8}<i>Joon-bin...</i>

1391
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,406
{\an8}Thank you.

1392
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,740
{\an8}Don't I get three?

1393
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,617
If you have a conscience,
give Dong-joo one.

1394
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,160
Why would I? I earned this.

1395
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,870
{\an8}<i>...Dong-joo,</i>

1396
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,872
{\an8}-<i>Kyeong-rim,</i>
-Thank you.

1397
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,125
{\an8}<i>and Yeon-woo receives one Piece.</i>

1398
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,918
Good job, Yeon-woo.

1399
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,796
{\an8}<i>As two players are tied for first,</i>

1400
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,715
<i>no additional Pieces will be awarded.</i>

1401
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,341
Thank you, Mr. Kwaktube.

1402
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,634
"Mr. Kwaktube"?

1403
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,054
{\an8}<i>Players with zero points</i>

1404
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,181
{\an8}<i>-will be penalized.</i>
-Nice acting.

1405
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,810
{\an8}This one is less pretty.

1406
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,521
{\an8}Please place the Piece here.

1407
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,775
{\an8}<i>Here is the current Piece count
of each player.</i>

1408
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,486
{\an8}-Kyeong-rim!
-That's amazing.

1409
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,696
{\an8}-No way.
-Wow.

1410
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,780
{\an8}-Kyeong-rim.
-Kyeong-rim.

1411
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:21,284
{\an8}<i>Seungkwan and See-won
have the least number of Pieces.</i>

1412
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,577
{\an8}<i>Please enter the prison cell.</i>

1413
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,872
-Seungkwan.
-Oh, no.

1414
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,415
-Good luck in there.
-Goodness.

1415
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,083
-I'll be back.
-Good luck.

1416
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,668
I'm finally going to prison.

1417
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,755
Since the first day,
I've talked about how much I wanted to go.

1418
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,007
I'll consider this a wish come true.

1419
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,717
-Hang in there!
-Have a nice dinner.

1420
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,135
-You got this!
-You can do it!

1421
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,637
See you soon.

1422
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,181
I feel so bad.

1423
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,808
I hate this prison system so much.

1424
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,395
<i>The main match has ended.</i>

1425
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,649
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

1426
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,400
I'm back in the living area!

1427
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,569
Welcome back, Yeon-woo!

1428
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,571
-I escaped prison.
-You returned.

1429
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,365
Eat whatever you want.

1430
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,408
-There are cup noodles and more.
-Okay.

1431
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,994
Gosh, it's my room.

1432
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,457
I spent more time in prison
than in the living area.

1433
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,709
<i>I've also missed out on two prize matches.</i>

1434
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,336
<i>So I have some catching up to do.</i>

1435
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,090
I almost cried.

1436
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,676
-Here you go.
-That's why I asked.

1437
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,593
Asked what?

1438
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:24,931
I think Joon-bin deserves it
because he used his Piece

1439
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,016
<i>to buy the set of cards for me.</i>

1440
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,893
So that Piece belongs to Joon-bin.

1441
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,728
-I said I'd give it to you.
-You don't have to.

1442
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,730
I was going to use it
for the team anyways.

1443
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,940
But I'll take it if you insist.

1444
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,192
I couldn't refuse her Piece.

1445
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,777
So I just accepted it.

1446
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,532
-Please enter.
-Okay.

1447
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,203
Can we not leave once we enter?

1448
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,205
-No, we can't.
-Really?

1449
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,957
I've been wanting to come here.

1450
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,210
But it's even more bare-bones
than I had expected.

1451
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,087
I guess prison is just prison.

1452
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,422
I'm back.

1453
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,632
I'm back!

1454
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,093
Thankfully, I'm not here
because I committed a crime.

1455
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,220
What is this? Is this a fireplace?

1456
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,431
I thought so too, but it has no use.

1457
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,599
Are there more inmates through here?

1458
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,976
That's the bathroom.

1459
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,645
You're so familiar with the place.

1460
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,272
Which bed did you use?

1461
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,815
-This one.
-Then I'll use this.

1462
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,858
I don't mind.

1463
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,153
I'm glad I'm here
with an experienced inmate.

1464
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,362
Where's the puzzle?

1465
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,488
-Puzzle?
-Yeah.

1466
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,365
The thing we have to solve.

1467
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,951
Is it this? Oh, it's yours.

1468
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,954
-What?
-Did it change?

1469
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,164
It wasn't this one.

1470
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,582
It's a different design.

1471
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:33,916
-Really?
-Yeah.

1472
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,585
This is hard.

1473
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,421
-You have one Piece, right?
-Yes.

1474
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,298
Whoever it may be,

1475
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:43,217
we have to leave this place
with one more Piece.

1476
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,012
-Yeah, we need to solve this.
-This is basically a free Piece.

1477
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,934
-That's how we have to wash up?
-Yeah.

1478
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,519
That's shocking.

1479
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,896
I know, right?

1480
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,857
-There's no faucet here?
-There isn't.

1481
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,027
-Everyone, let's eat!
-Let's eat.

1482
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,195
It's real food.

1483
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,238
You finally get to eat well.

1484
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,449
I barely ate anything on the second day.

1485
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,284
So my pants feel loose right now.

1486
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,703
-It's so good.
-Right?

1487
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:15,208
We only got really dry bread.

1488
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,292
We didn't even get jam.

1489
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,795
-We didn't eat properly last night.
-I see.

1490
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,671
That bread was not edible.

1491
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,174
How bad was the bread
for all of you to talk about it?

1492
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,259
It was dry bread worse than plain toast.

1493
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,053
I can't believe
I have to eat the bread again.

1494
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:28,888
This sucks.

1495
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,473
It must be really horrible.

1496
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,391
I don't want bread for dinner.

1497
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,062
Is that our dinner?

1498
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,065
It's a different bread.

1499
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,651
It is? Thank you.

1500
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:43,277
-It's a hearty meal.
-Right?

1501
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,072
-We only got this bread before.
-Really?

1502
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,491
-I guess it's getting better.
-This looks good.

1503
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,412
-It's good.
-Is it?

1504
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,874
It's not the best, but it's good
compared to the other bread.

1505
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,335
-Today's game wasn't too tense.
-You're right.

1506
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:03,172
We're all losing energy in this place
with no windows and sunlight.

1507
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,842
-Today's game was quite fun.
-Right.

1508
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,677
It was a high-quality game.

1509
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,761
-It was.
-Right.

1510
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,680
If only we played individually.

1511
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,519
<i>The majority alliance is a problem,
but so are freeloaders.</i>

1512
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,397
They do nothing but stick close to ORBIT

1513
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,066
<i>and destroy the minority alliance.</i>

1514
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,943
<i>That's why Seok-jin is so angry.</i>

1515
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:27,196
I know Seok-jin
is just as capable as ORBIT is.

1516
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,615
As much as ORBIT
wants to protect the weak,

1517
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,076
Seok-jin hates winning through alliances.

1518
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,871
<i>He even told me
to stop mooching off my alliance.</i>

1519
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,540
I had thought of Seok-jin
as an enemy until now.

1520
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:40,418
But I had a slight change of mind
towards the end of today's game.

1521
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,130
I'm starting to doubt myself too.

1522
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:48,926
If someone accuses me
of trying to control everyone,

1523
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,804
I really have nothing to say.

1524
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,473
<i>I had a lot on my mind.</i>

1525
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,184
Instead of continuing
with what I've been doing,

1526
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:00,354
I realized I needed to change my ways.

1527
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,982
Before coming on to <i>The Devil's Plan</i>,

1528
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,651
-I had made up my mind to give it my all.
-Right.

1529
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,570
What happened to that spirit?

1530
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,155
Here's the thing.

1531
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,448
This may sound like an excuse.

1532
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:14,619
But today, I wanted to
play more aggressively.

1533
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:16,996
But they told me, "Yeon-woo could die."

1534
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,373
They're using it against you.

1535
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,917
<i>-They demanded sacrifice.
-Exactly.</i>

1536
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,628
<i>-I cared too much for Yeon-woo.
-It's only natural.</i>

1537
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,004
<i>I was a coward.</i>

1538
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,797
<i>How did I...</i>

1539
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:28,674
become such a coward?

1540
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,093
This is what I hate the most.

1541
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,512
I hate how they treat
other people like pawns.

1542
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,515
<i>Don't be a pawn in their selfish plans.</i>

1543
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,477
Do what you want and die with honor.

1544
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,395
It's better than dying after being used.

1545
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,774
From now on, I'm really going to...

1546
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,109
I don't care if I suck or make a mess.

1547
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,030
I'll clean up after myself
and leave on my own terms.

1548
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,991
Sorry for lecturing.

1549
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,493
Don't say that.

1550
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,203
I think you're really cool.

1551
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,622
<i>After talking to See-won,</i>

1552
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,166
the wall between us suddenly collapsed.

1553
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:05,670
I started to think about
how I could help her.

1554
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,172
I feel like I can tell you about this.

1555
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:10,925
Check this out.

1556
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,636
