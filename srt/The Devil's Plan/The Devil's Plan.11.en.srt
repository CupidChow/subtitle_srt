1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,757
Here are your hidden cards.

2
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,978
{\an8}ORBIT: 4 CHIPS

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,938
Here are your second open cards.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,064
{\an8}Two.

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,357
{\an8}Two.

6
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,860
{\an8}I hoped to get simple cards.

7
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,654
{\an8}<i>A square root card
would complicate things for me.</i>

8
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,739
{\an8}Square root.

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,908
{\an8}Six.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,661
{\an8}The first round of betting begins now.

11
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,204
{\an8}ORBIT, please make your bet.

12
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,832
{\an8}-I'm folding.
-You have folded.

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,709
You're folding very easily.

14
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,627
It would be embarrassing
to die right away.

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,546
I'm going to get eliminated
in the next round.

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,756
I'm betting two.

17
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,842
You have bet two.

18
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,343
-Joon-bin.
-I'm folding.

19
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,096
-You have bet two.
-I'm folding.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,807
Here are your third open cards.

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,100
{\an8}Please.

22
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,185
{\an8}Four.

23
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,562
{\an8}Ten.

24
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,481
{\an8}Nine.

25
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,775
{\an8}Your open cards are dealt.

26
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,902
{\an8}Time will be given
to complete your equations.

27
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,153
{\an8}Come on, focus.

28
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,824
{\an8}I guess I should go with this.

29
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,368
The final round of betting begins now.

30
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,369
Seok-jin.

31
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,954
I'm betting three more.

32
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,165
-Seungkwan.
-I'm folding.

33
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,792
{\an8}Dong-joo, please make your bet.

34
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,628
{\an8}Dong-joo and I
will probably win this round.

35
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,004
{\an8}All players have bet the same amount.

36
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,464
Please reveal your markers.

37
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,882
You have bet on low.

38
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,175
Next, Seok-jin.

39
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,676
{\an8}You have bet on high.

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,179
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is Seok-jin.

41
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,014
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is Dong-joo.

42
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,390
The rich get the spoils.

43
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,434
You each receive nine chips.

44
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,852
{\an8}SUH DONG-JOO: 50 CHIPS

45
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,103
{\an8}Capitalism at its finest.

46
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,772
ORBIT.

47
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,816
I know nothing's final yet,

48
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,193
but you've helped me so much...

49
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,822
Saying things like that
makes things sadder.

50
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,781
I...

51
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,533
-Please don't cry.
-We might not...

52
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,035
Everyone gets eliminated.
Why cry about it? I don't get it.

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
I don't get it either.

54
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,163
Are you going to cry for everyone?

55
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,999
ORBIT, you see...

56
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,084
Don't make things sad.

57
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,627
Let me talk.

58
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,295
Why do you keep saying that?

59
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,839
Don't cry. It'll be more painful.

60
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,384
It doesn't matter
what happens in this game.

61
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,802
If I do really badly

62
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,221
in this round,

63
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,723
all of your help would go to waste.

64
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,933
Right?

65
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,935
Pieces will be key in the next game.

66
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,145
So get as many as possible.

67
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,772
{\an8}-That's how you can win, okay?
-I know.

68
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,440
-Stay focused.
-I didn't want your efforts

69
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,484
to be in vain.

70
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,652
How many do you have?

71
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,738
Seungkwan, you're surviving well
with the chips you have.

72
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,990
You're doing great.

73
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,324
If you get twenty or one,

74
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,742
just go all in.

75
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,495
We will move on to the next round.

76
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,038
The first player of this round

77
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,748
-is Seok-jin.
-All right.

78
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,250
He's the scariest first player.

79
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,085
Please pay your ante.

80
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,588
You must be nervous.

81
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,755
ORBIT...

82
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,173
Anything could happen.

83
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,341
Exactly.

84
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,093
{\an8}Here are your open cards.

85
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,094
{\an8}Ten.

86
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,387
{\an8}Six.

87
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,347
{\an8}Three.

88
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,348
{\an8}Zero.

89
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,767
You probably can't win.

90
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,727
{\an8}Nine.

91
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,145
{\an8}Her too.

92
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,104
{\an8}Two.

93
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,024
{\an8}Your open cards are dealt.

94
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,401
Seok-jin, please make your bet.

95
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,486
-I'll pass.
-Are you passing?

96
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,447
Seungkwan, please make your bet.

97
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,741
{\an8}He has good cards.

98
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,493
{\an8}-You have bet one.
-Yes.

99
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,453
Joon-bin.

100
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,704
I'll bet one.

101
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,456
Yu-min, please make your bet.

102
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,167
{\an8}<i>I needed the players
with fewer chips to get eliminated</i>

103
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,585
{\an8}<i>if I wanted to win more chips.</i>

104
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,589
You have bet two more chips.

105
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,090
-ORBIT
-I'm folding.

106
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,926
You have folded.

107
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,427
Seok-jin.

108
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,678
You have bet three.

109
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,763
Seungkwan.

110
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,892
<i>My cards were actually not that bad.</i>

111
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,852
I'll go for it.

112
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,520
You have bet two.

113
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,356
-Joon-bin.
-I'll bet two.

114
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,941
I'll just bet two as well.

115
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,317
All players have bet the same amount.

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
Here are your third open cards.

117
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,403
{\an8}Nine.

118
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,488
{\an8}Three.

119
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,572
{\an8}Eight.

120
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,740
{\an8}Nine.

121
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,659
{\an8}-So this is how it is.
-Six.

122
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,702
Your open cards are dealt.

123
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,746
{\an8}Time will be given
to complete your equations.

124
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,706
{\an8}It feels like the scale game
all over again.

125
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,961
{\an8}My heart is pounding.

126
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,464
{\an8}I don't even have a square root.

127
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,176
<i>I had a good chance
of winning either high or low.</i>

128
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,347
<i>I thought I could win
if I made the right choice.</i>

129
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,224
The final round of betting begins now.

130
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,809
Seok-jin, please make your bet.

131
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,602
I'm passing.

132
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,271
I'm passing too.

133
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,397
I'm passing.

134
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,856
I'm passing as well.

135
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,941
-You have passed.
-Yes.

136
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,276
-The most I can bet
-Yu-min.

137
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,819
-is how much he has?
-Yes.

138
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,696
You may bet up to three chips.

139
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,948
-I'll bet three.
-You have bet three.

140
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,491
-Yu-min is going for it.
-Seok-jin.

141
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,702
Yu-min's cold-hearted.

142
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,745
You have bet three.

143
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,830
Seungkwan.

144
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,707
Go for it.

145
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,208
<i>Instead of being a coward,</i>

146
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,752
<i>I decided to go for it.</i>

147
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,714
And I also had to
make up for my earlier bets.

148
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,881
All right then.

149
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,050
You have bet three.

150
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,385
You have bet three.

151
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,928
-This is interesting.
-Joon-bin.

152
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,179
All right, give me a win.

153
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,432
You have bet three.

154
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,349
Dong-joo.

155
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,059
-Everyone's going for it.
-You have bet three.

156
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,686
Please choose a betting marker

157
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,938
and place your hand on the table.

158
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,737
<i>I thought most would bet on high.</i>

159
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,697
{\an8}<i>Several people had multiplication cards.</i>

160
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,659
{\an8}<i>And Seok-jin had ten, nine, and nine.</i>

161
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,291
Dong-joo, who bet last,

162
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,168
please reveal your marker.

163
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,670
{\an8}You have bet on low.

164
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,422
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

165
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,299
{\an8}Are you serious?

166
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,468
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

167
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,510
{\an8}Joon-bin.

168
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,596
{\an8}You have bet on high.

169
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,139
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

170
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,852
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

171
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,853
{\an8}Next, Seungkwan.

172
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,190
{\an8}-Do I reveal my marker?
-Yeah.

173
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,484
{\an8}-I'm out of it.
-You have bet on low.

174
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,569
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

175
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,239
Let me make one last calculation.

176
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,368
<i>I was in such a stressful situation.</i>

177
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,163
<i>So although I had
already done the calculations,</i>

178
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,791
I let the overwhelming pressure get to me

179
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,667
<i>and kept doubting myself.</i>

180
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,878
Darn it.

181
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,254
What am I doing?

182
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,756
I'm sorry.

183
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,382
Take your time.

184
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,844
<i>I had already done the calculations,</i>

185
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,429
<i>but seeing everybody wait for me...</i>

186
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,181
I'm ready.

187
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,265
You did your best.

188
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,892
Thank you.

189
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,946
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

190
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,700
Seungkwan's out.

191
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,417
Seok-jin, please reveal your marker.

192
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,087
{\an8}You have bet on high.

193
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,631
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

194
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,008
{\an8}Good job.

195
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,468
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

196
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,470
{\an8}That's so close to 20.

197
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,222
{\an8}Yu-min, please reveal your marker.

198
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,557
{\an8}You have bet on low.

199
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,016
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

200
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,690
Hey.

201
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,111
You could've won.

202
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,328
You were too hasty.

203
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,499
The winner of this round's
high bet is Seok-jin.

204
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,835
And the winner of the low bet is Dong-joo.

205
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,796
<i>Seungkwan has lost all of his Pieces.</i>

206
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,465
<i>-As such,</i>
-Seungkwan.

207
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,135
<i>Seungkwan is the seventh player
to get eliminated from</i>  The Devil's Plan.

208
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,595
-Good job, everybody.
<i>-Seungkwan,</i>

209
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,472
<i>please return to the living area,
pack your belongings,</i>

210
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,974
-<i>and leave.</i>
-You almost had it.

211
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,309
Thank you, everyone.

212
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,520
It's hard to do well
under so much pressure.

213
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,564
-You did great.
-Thank you.

214
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,857
Seungkwan.

215
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,694
It was fun.

216
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,321
Please put up a good fight.

217
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,491
-Bye, Seungkwan.
-Goodbye.

218
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,659
You're the best!

219
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,660
Thank you.

220
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,878
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't disappointed when I lost.

221
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,923
<i>I feel a lot of regret.</i>

222
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,343
What a shame.

223
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,514
Memories of <i>The Devil's Plan</i> are going to

224
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,098
<i>stay with me for a while,</i>

225
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,018
<i>including all the sights and smells.</i>

226
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,811
<i>I was so happy here.</i>

227
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,979
<i>I had fun.</i>

228
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,065
<i>And I don't think I'll ever forget this.</i>

229
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,317
Thank you so much for casting me.

230
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,860
I really mean it.

231
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,698
Goodbye.

232
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,825
Bye.

233
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,246
I'm crying so much today.

234
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,914
I can't stop.

235
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,041
There's only one thing left
for me to do now.

236
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,043
I hope I can get it done.

237
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,378
Sending Joon-bin home before I go.

238
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,879
What's wrong with you?

239
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,422
I'm folding until you leave.

240
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,049
We will move on to the next round.

241
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,093
Joon-bin will go first.

242
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,303
Here are your hidden cards.

243
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,221
{\an8}SUH DONG-JOO: 60 CHIPS

244
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,806
{\an8}You have way too much.

245
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,433
{\an8}-The rich get richer.
-This really is the devil's plan.

246
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,354
Playing with just a few chips
makes you really nervous.

247
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,897
My hands usually don't sweat.

248
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,275
-But I've been sweating.
-His hands are wet.

249
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,943
Here are your two open cards.

250
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,027
{\an8}Four.

251
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,070
{\an8}Eight.

252
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,029
{\an8}One.

253
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:32,947
{\an8}Three.

254
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,031
{\an8}Eight.

255
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,575
{\an8}The first round of betting begins now.

256
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,034
-Joon-bin.
-I'll pass.

257
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,202
You have passed.

258
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,496
You can only bet two.

259
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,497
Two is the max.

260
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,666
Yeah? Then I'll bet one.

261
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,834
You have bet one.

262
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,419
Yu-min, please make your bet.

263
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,046
I'm folding.

264
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,172
You have folded.

265
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,341
ORBIT, please make your bet.

266
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,385
Should I be cool and bet two?

267
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,387
-Just bet one.
-You have bet one.

268
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,722
Either way, you're dead.

269
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,140
-That's right.
-Right.

270
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,308
You have bet one.

271
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,560
-Joon-bin.
-I'll match ORBIT.

272
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,729
-Here's one.
-You have bet one.

273
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,063
It's the least you can do.

274
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,898
{\an8}Here are your third open cards.

275
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,150
{\an8}Seven.

276
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,151
{\an8}Three.

277
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,193
{\an8}Six.

278
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,820
{\an8}Three.

279
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,572
{\an8}These cards are hard to work with.

280
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,784
{\an8}This is difficult.

281
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,210
{\an8}The final round of betting begins now.

282
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,211
I'll pass.

283
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,588
I'll also pass.

284
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,631
I'll pass.

285
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,548
I'll also pass.

286
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,758
Everyone has passed.

287
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,926
Please decide on your betting markers.

288
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,934
Seok-jin, who bet last,
please reveal your marker first.

289
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,437
{\an8}You have bet on low.

290
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,897
Please complete your equation.

291
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,696
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes, I am.

292
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,741
ORBIT, please reveal your marker.

293
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,494
{\an8}You have bet on low.

294
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,828
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

295
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,246
{\an8}There's not much I can do.

296
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,546
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-This is the best I can do.

297
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,591
{\an8}Dong-joo, please reveal your marker.

298
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,844
{\an8}You have bet on low.

299
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,766
{\an8}I'm not winning this one.

300
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,851
Joon-bin, please reveal your marker.

301
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,936
I'm sorry, ORBIT.

302
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,480
{\an8}You have bet on high.

303
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,066
The winner of this round's
high bet is Joon-bin.

304
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,276
And the winner of the low bet is Seok-jin.

305
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,986
You each receive four chips.

306
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,988
Seok-jin won? Why didn't I know that?

307
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,532
Our brains are all fried.

308
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,201
Dong-joo also could have won.

309
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,828
{\an8}-You could have made one.
-I...

310
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,995
{\an8}Really?

311
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,373
{\an8}Eight minus seven
plus zero divided by three.

312
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,793
{\an8}I must be out of my mind.

313
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,420
We will move on to the next round.

314
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,088
This is my last stand.

315
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,381
It was fun, ORBIT.

316
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,590
It was.

317
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,050
Thank you.

318
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,762
{\an8}ORBIT: 1 CHIP

319
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,223
I didn't think ORBIT would get eliminated.

320
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,602
Here we go.

321
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,146
Here are your hidden cards.

322
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,276
Here are your open cards.

323
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,485
{\an8}Four.

324
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,653
{\an8}Seven.

325
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,737
{\an8}Two.

326
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,780
{\an8}Four.

327
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,823
{\an8}Eight.

328
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,618
{\an8}As no more bets can be made,

329
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,495
here are your third open cards.

330
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,705
{\an8}Two.

331
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,998
{\an8}Two.

332
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,249
{\an8}Seven.

333
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,500
{\an8}Ten.

334
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,751
{\an8}Seven.

335
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,628
Time will be given
to complete your equations.

336
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,507
I think everyone's going to bet on low.

337
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,176
I'm betting on high then.

338
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
-Time has expired.
-I'm not done yet.

339
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,722
I guess I'll have to calculate on the go.

340
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,434
Joon-bin, who bet last,
please reveal your marker first.

341
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,353
{\an8}You have bet on high.

342
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,813
That's not good.

343
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,607
Please complete your equation.

344
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,363
{\an8}I'm done.

345
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,448
{\an8}What did you get?

346
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,200
{\an8}-I got 17.
-Seok-jin, please reveal your marker.

347
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,368
{\an8}You have bet on low.

348
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,162
{\an8}I didn't do too well.

349
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,663
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

350
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,420
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

351
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,881
ORBIT, please reveal your marker.

352
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,593
{\an8}You have bet on high.

353
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,514
{\an8}Why is everyone betting on high?

354
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,440
{\an8}-That's not bad.
-I won't get eliminated by Joon-bin.

355
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,608
{\an8}You really won't.

356
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,860
{\an8}Yu-min, please reveal your marker.

357
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,195
{\an8}You have bet on low.

358
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,947
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

359
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,699
{\an8}I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't do this.

360
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,910
{\an8}But I couldn't come up
with a better equation.

361
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,829
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

362
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,457
Dong-joo.

363
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,334
{\an8}You have bet on high.

364
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,544
{\an8}I...

365
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,094
{\an8}I had a hard time with this equation.

366
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,513
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

367
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,723
The winner of this round's
high bet is ORBIT.

368
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,267
And the winner of the low bet is Seok-jin.

369
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,810
-Good job, ORBIT.
-Sir.

370
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,186
{\an8}You each receive two chips.

371
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,604
{\an8}This gives me a chance.

372
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,022
{\an8}-You got two.
-This is exciting.

373
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,524
We will move on to the next round.

374
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,942
{\an8}You have bet on low.

375
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,235
{\an8}You have bet on low.

376
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,528
{\an8}You have bet on low.

377
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,113
ORBIT, please reveal your marker.

378
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,323
{\an8}You have bet on high.

379
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,576
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is ORBIT.

380
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,578
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is Seok-jin.

381
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,830
<i>I was amazed.</i>

382
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,373
<i>As expected of ORBIT.</i>

383
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,043
If you're going to play this long,
I don't think I'll be sad when you leave.

384
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,463
We will move on to the next round.

385
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,882
Here are your hidden cards.

386
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,092
Please.

387
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,226
Here are your open cards.

388
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,770
{\an8}Three.

389
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,647
{\an8}Nine.

390
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,482
{\an8}Two.

391
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,610
{\an8}One.

392
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,528
{\an8}Six.

393
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,323
Your open cards are dealt.

394
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,741
The first round of betting begins now.

395
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,200
ORBIT, please make your bet.

396
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,494
I'll pass.

397
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,122
-I'm passing.
-You have passed.

398
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,999
-I'm passing.
-You have passed.

399
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,918
-Me too.
-You have passed.

400
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:19,877
Please make your bet.

401
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,086
-I'm passing.
-You have passed.

402
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,255
Here are your third open cards.

403
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,091
Multiplication.

404
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,426
Please discard a symbol card.

405
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,178
{\an8}No way.

406
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,767
{\an8}This is too risky.

407
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,479
{\an8}You have discarded subtraction.

408
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,731
One.

409
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,025
{\an8}Nine.

410
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,945
{\an8}Nine?

411
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,029
{\an8}Zero.

412
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,073
{\an8}Seven.

413
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,116
{\an8}Ten.

414
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,994
{\an8}All the cards are dealt.

415
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,413
Time will be given
to complete your equations.

416
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,916
{\an8}This is driving me crazy.

417
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,920
{\an8}Nine...

418
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,473
Are you looking at Yu-min's cards?

419
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,642
Yeah, you can see what she's trying to do.

420
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,229
<i>Yu-min was assembling her equation
on the table for all to see.</i>

421
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,147
<i>And I could tell what she would bet on.</i>

422
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,116
Time has expired.

423
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,951
The final round of betting begins now.

424
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,703
ORBIT, please make your bet.

425
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,747
It's time to end it.

426
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,250
I'm tired.

427
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,292
You have bet three.

428
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,836
I'll match.

429
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,212
You have bet three.

430
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,506
-Joon-bin.
-I'll fold.

431
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,507
You have folded.

432
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,010
Dong-joo, please make your bet.

433
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,053
You have bet three.

434
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,350
Please decide on your betting markers.

435
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,227
I'm out of chips.

436
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,854
Make sure to raise the stakes
once I'm gone.

437
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,777
Now that everyone's ready,
Yu-min, who bet last,

438
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,237
please reveal your marker.

439
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,157
{\an8}You have bet on low.

440
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,408
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

441
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,576
{\an8}What does she have?

442
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,618
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-It's a zero.

443
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,786
{\an8}-Yes.
-Is that the best equation?

444
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,746
{\an8}Dong-joo.

445
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,290
{\an8}You have bet on low.

446
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,750
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

447
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,921
{\an8}I'm done. Thank you.

448
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,214
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

449
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,092
Seok-jin, please reveal your marker.

450
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,012
{\an8}-You have bet on high.
-Amazing.

451
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,346
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

452
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,851
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

453
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,062
ORBIT, please reveal your marker.

454
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,022
{\an8}You have bet on low.

455
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,607
{\an8}I thought you would bet on high.

456
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,025
{\an8}I thought so too.

457
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,485
{\an8}Did my cards turn you away?

458
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,654
{\an8}I thought it'd be fun to bet on low
with my multiplication card.

459
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,580
{\an8}-One.
-That's beautiful.

460
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:27,147
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

461
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,690
ORBIT has resurrected.

462
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,651
Your bluffing was top-notch.

463
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,986
The winner of this round's
high bet is Seok-jin.

464
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,571
And the winner of the low bet is ORBIT.

465
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,156
{\an8}You each receive eight chips.

466
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,825
{\an8}ORBIT: 8 CHIPS, HA SEOK-JIN: 114 CHIPS

467
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,076
{\an8}Good job, ORBIT.

468
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,161
{\an8}-You're making a comeback.
-You only had one just a while ago.

469
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,206
{\an8}-He did it.
-Nothing's changed.

470
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,874
We will move on to the next round.

471
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,251
Here are your hidden cards.

472
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,169
I'm not going to be nice anymore.

473
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,421
You're basically the dealer of the casino.

474
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,507
Seok-jin should stop playing
and just be a judge.

475
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,634
<i>A player can never beat the casino</i>

476
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,387
<i>because the casino
has an endless amount of chips.</i>

477
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,097
How do I take him on?

478
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,391
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is Seok-jin.

479
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,268
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is Joon-bin.

480
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,979
{\an8}This isn't easy.

481
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,522
We will move on to the next round.

482
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,775
Try not to raise the bets
so I can play for a bit more.

483
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,443
I should be the one sending you home.

484
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,157
{\an8}Here are your second open cards.

485
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,158
{\an8}Six.

486
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,534
{\an8}Ten.

487
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,743
{\an8}Six.

488
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,786
{\an8}Good.

489
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,163
{\an8}Eight.

490
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,539
{\an8}One.

491
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,457
{\an8}Your open cards are dealt.

492
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,750
The first round of betting begins now.

493
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,793
Joon-bin.

494
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,461
-I'll pass.
-You have passed.

495
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
I'll pass.

496
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,881
-I'll pass.
-You have passed.

497
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,549
-ORBIT.
-I'll pass.

498
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,217
Seok-jin, you have passed.

499
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,719
{\an8}Here are your third open cards.

500
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,636
{\an8}Multiplication.

501
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,139
{\an8}You have discarded addition.

502
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,765
{\an8}Zero.

503
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,017
{\an8}One.

504
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,476
{\an8}Zero.

505
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,477
{\an8}Seven.

506
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,771
{\an8}Two.

507
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,939
{\an8}All right.

508
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,524
{\an8}All the cards are dealt.

509
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,651
{\an8}Time will be given
to complete your equations.

510
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,779
{\an8}I'm going to lose my mind.

511
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,531
{\an8}Nothing works.

512
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,829
Time has expired.

513
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,873
The final round of betting begins now.

514
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:08,832
I'll pass.

515
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,750
I'll pass.

516
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,586
Yu-min, please make your bet.

517
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,171
{\an8}Let me survive one more round.

518
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,340
{\an8}SUH YU-MIN: 6 CHIPS, ORBIT: 5 CHIPS

519
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,133
Do what you want, Yu-min.

520
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,301
I'll go when it's time.

521
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,219
You might not go.

522
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,012
It's looking bleak right now.

523
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,555
Keeping your cool is also a science.

524
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,641
-That's true.
-I'm making my bet.

525
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,268
You have bet five.

526
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,103
ORBIT, please make your bet.

527
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,773
Are these all the chips I have?

528
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,941
Yes.

529
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,236
-You have bet five.
-Yes.

530
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,404
This is crazy.

531
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,615
-Seok-jin.
-I'll match.

532
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,158
-Joon-bin.
-It's too much.

533
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,826
You must bet five or more to bet.

534
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,870
-Then I won't.
-You have folded.

535
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,581
-Dong-joo.
-Yu-min must have good cards.

536
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,834
Six divided by six...

537
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,294
I should fold, shouldn't I?

538
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,046
-I'll fold.
-Please flip over your number card.

539
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,508
-This is tough.
-You have made your bets.

540
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,885
Good job, everybody.

541
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,929
Is Joon-bin going to
make it to the finals?

542
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,306
No, only four can survive.

543
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,766
Yu-min only has one chip.

544
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,643
-She can win more.
-That's true.

545
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,144
She probably will right now.

546
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,856
-If Seok-jin wins, you're both out.
-It's over if Seok-jin wins.

547
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,484
Seok-jin, please reveal your marker first.

548
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:19,987
You bet on high, didn't you?

549
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,365
{\an8}-No, on low.
-You have bet on low.

550
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,866
Please complete your equation.

551
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,996
{\an8}Unfortunately for those who bet on low,
I'm winning it.

552
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,706
-He must have a one.
-He has a one.

553
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,836
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

554
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,882
I'm glad I folded.

555
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,967
{\an8}ORBIT.

556
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,052
{\an8}Darn it.

557
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,514
{\an8}You have bet on high.

558
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,183
{\an8}That's the ORBIT we know.

559
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,644
This is a twist.

560
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,438
ORBIT could beat Joon-bin.

561
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,231
I put a lot of thought into it

562
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,442
{\an8}to see if it would work or not.

563
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,153
That makes 16, and...

564
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,071
{\an8}Only those above 19,5 can beat me.

565
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,325
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-You did a great job.

566
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,660
{\an8}Yu-min, please reveal your marker.

567
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,120
{\an8}You have bet on low.

568
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,621
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

569
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,126
{\an8}You had a zero.

570
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,212
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is ORBIT.

571
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,173
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is Seok-jin.

572
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,342
ORBIT, you're amazing.

573
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,844
How is ORBIT doing this?

574
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,845
{\an8}How?

575
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,138
{\an8}ORBIT: 10 CHIPS

576
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,681
{\an8}Yu-min, let's win and get Korean barbecue.

577
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,933
We will move on to the next round.

578
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,270
As Yu-min has no chips to bet,

579
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,230
we will proceed without any further bets.

580
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,440
Here are your hidden cards.

581
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,733
You can do it, Yu-min.

582
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,568
-Let's win some chips.
-You need a good hand.

583
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:46,239
-We can't make bets anyway.
-Here are your open cards.

584
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,657
{\an8}-Six.
-Square root and six.

585
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,992
{\an8}Six.

586
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,160
{\an8}-What...
-Three.

587
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,953
{\an8}Two. Nine.

588
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,371
All the cards are dealt.

589
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,290
Time will be given
to complete your equations.

590
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,417
{\an8}I got such an unlucky set of cards.

591
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,919
{\an8}This doesn't work.

592
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,380
{\an8}Time has expired.

593
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,841
Please choose a betting marker
and place your hand on the table.

594
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,052
Gosh, my head hurts.

595
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,638
Joon-bin, please reveal your marker first.

596
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:12,891
{\an8}Swing.

597
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,978
{\an8}-You have bet on swing.
-He's trying to be cool.

598
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:22,901
-Like this.
-Okay.

599
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,320
{\an8}This is my low equation.

600
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,279
{\an8}Not bad.

601
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,031
{\an8}Please complete your second equation.

602
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,286
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

603
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,247
{\an8}-This is my high equation.
-Good job.

604
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,916
{\an8}You did a great job.

605
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,627
{\an8}Seok-jin, please reveal your marker.

606
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,587
{\an8}-I bet on low.
-You have bet on low.

607
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,922
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

608
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,050
This is the best I could do with my cards.

609
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,301
I'm proud of myself.

610
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,511
{\an8}I got 1,5.

611
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,305
{\an8}ORBIT, please reveal your marker.

612
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,559
{\an8}You have bet on low.

613
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,435
{\an8}I had no choice.

614
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,728
This was my only option.

615
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,773
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

616
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,900
{\an8}Yu-min, please reveal your marker.

617
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,822
{\an8}You have bet on low.

618
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,074
{\an8}-Gosh, my hand is sweating.
-Please complete your equation.

619
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,831
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-It's zero.

620
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,251
{\an8}The winner of this round is Joon-bin,
who made a swing bet.

621
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,712
{\an8}Good job.

622
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,047
{\an8}-You receive five chips.
-You should have won more.

623
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,301
<i>-Yu-min has lost all of her Pieces.</i>
-No, the stakes were just right for me.

624
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,095
<i>As such, Yu-min is the eighth player</i>

625
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,389
<i>to get eliminated from</i> The Devil's Plan.

626
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,933
-Good job, Yu-min.
-Good job. See you tomorrow.

627
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,351
-Thank you.
-See you tomorrow.

628
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,021
It's a shame that we didn't get to
win something together.

629
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,275
{\an8}Part of my disappointment comes from

630
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,695
{\an8}wondering if someone else could have won

631
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,739
<i>had they been cast</i>

632
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,616
<i>and taken my place in the show.</i>

633
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,826
<i>I wonder if I have shown</i>

634
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,495
the best version of myself

635
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,873
while participating in the games.

636
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,167
-Yu-min, I'll see you tomorrow.
-I'm tearing up again.

637
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,877
-Okay?
-What's wrong with me?

638
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,587
What's with you?

639
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,504
See you tomorrow.

640
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,131
-Bye. See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

641
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,008
-You did great.
-Goodbye.

642
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,676
-Bye.
-Bye.

643
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,761
Hi, Hye-sung.

644
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,642
Once again, I'm sorry.

645
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,102
What I kept worrying about

646
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:25,357
was that you would think
I betrayed you on purpose.

647
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,653
<i>By the time this show airs,
a lot of time will have passed.</i>

648
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,489
<i>But I hope you didn't get hurt by that.</i>

649
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,949
I'm so glad I met you.

650
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,159
And I wish you the best
in everything you do.

651
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,499
Good job making it this far.

652
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,793
Seriously.

653
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,337
-Why are you crying?
-I don't know.

654
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,130
Why are you crying?

655
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,717
It's so obvious we're in an alliance.

656
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,927
No one's hugging Seok-jin.

657
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,720
Good job, Seok-jin.

658
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,767
-I only think of you as an enemy in games.
-I'm...

659
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,810
I'm a lone wolf.

660
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,228
-No.
-That's how it is.

661
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,230
We will move on to the next round.

662
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,439
Please take your seats.

663
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,066
Here are your hidden cards.

664
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,445
{\an8}Here are your open cards.

665
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,905
-ORBIT.
-I'm folding.

666
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,906
You have folded.

667
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,574
-Seok-jin.
-I'm folding.

668
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,535
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is Dong-joo.

669
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,161
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is Joon-bin.

670
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,747
{\an8}I barely won anything.
Did I win just two chips? No, I won one.

671
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,207
We will move on to the next round.

672
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,001
Please pay your ante.

673
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,336
I feel like an actual gambler.

674
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,171
Here are your hidden cards.

675
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,174
Darn it. It's not looking good again.

676
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,884
Here are your open cards.

677
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:35,885
Seven.

678
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,886
Six.

679
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,013
Zero.

680
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:38,930
Zero.

681
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,432
{\an8}How am I supposed to work with this?

682
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,933
{\an8}There's no opening.

683
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,601
{\an8}Here are your second open cards.

684
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,103
{\an8}It's got to be a low this time.

685
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,147
{\an8}-Multiplication.
-Nice!

686
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,815
{\an8}Please discard a symbol card.

687
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,734
{\an8}Try betting low
with a multiplication card.

688
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,486
{\an8}I will discard the addition.

689
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,863
{\an8}You have discarded addition.

690
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,114
{\an8}Two.

691
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,115
{\an8}Five.

692
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,033
{\an8}Multiplication.

693
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,868
{\an8}-Great.
-Please discard a symbol card.

694
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,202
I'll discard the same card.

695
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,370
You have discarded addition.

696
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,747
{\an8}Ten.

697
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,749
{\an8}The first round of betting begins now.

698
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,791
Seok-jin.

699
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,585
-I'll pass.
-You have passed.

700
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,211
-Joon-bin.
-I'll pass.

701
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,088
-Me too.
-Dong-joo has passed. ORBIT.

702
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,715
-I'll pass.
-You have passed.

703
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,842
{\an8}Here are your third open cards.

704
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:16,843
{\an8}Nine.

705
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,219
{\an8}Nine?

706
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,471
{\an8}Five.

707
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,555
{\an8}Square root.

708
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,974
{\an8}-Nine.
-Goodness.

709
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,893
Time will be given
to complete your equations.

710
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,398
I've made a big mistake.

711
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,651
{\an8}I should have kept my addition card.

712
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,447
{\an8}Time has expired.

713
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,949
The final round of betting begins now.

714
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,494
-Seok-jin, please make your bet.
-I'll pass.

715
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,704
-Joon-bin.
-How many does he have?

716
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,622
Seven.

717
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,916
-I'll bet two.
-You have bet two.

718
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,834
-Seriously?
-Dong-joo.

719
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,003
You have bet two.

720
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,171
ORBIT.

721
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,965
-You're betting?
-What can I do?

722
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,217
I can't just sit back.

723
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,385
You have bet two.

724
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,136
-Seok-jin.
-I'll go for it.

725
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,763
You have made your bets.

726
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,808
Please choose a betting marker
and place your hand on the table.

727
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,393
I did what ORBIT wanted.

728
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,936
You're betting on high.

729
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,312
You said to bet on low
with multiplication.

730
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,022
What? You're betting on low?

731
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,816
Seok-jin, who bet last,

732
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,234
please reveal your marker.

733
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,987
{\an8}-Low.
-You have bet on low.

734
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,739
-No way.
-Please complete your equation.

735
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,699
Seok-jin's a madman.

736
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,327
{\an8}It was safer to bet on high.

737
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,204
But ORBIT wanted me to bet on low.

738
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,206
So I'm making a bold bet.

739
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,291
What did you get?

740
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,918
{\an8}I got 0,4.

741
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,169
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

742
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,130
{\an8}That's good, Seok-jin.

743
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,132
ORBIT, please reveal your marker.

744
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,551
{\an8}You have bet on low.

745
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,885
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

746
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,096
{\an8}I'm not sure if this is
the right way to go.

747
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,771
{\an8}Is it 0,9? I should have bet on high.

748
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,898
{\an8}Dong-joo, please reveal your marker.

749
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,150
{\an8}You have bet on low.

750
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,362
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

751
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,822
Joon-bin.

752
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,824
The punk that's trying to eliminate me.

753
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,117
Please reveal your marker.

754
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,453
{\an8}-That little...
-You have bet on low.

755
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,663
-Everyone bet on low.
-Please complete your equation.

756
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,998
{\an8}I can't lose to Joon-bin.

757
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,544
{\an8}-You did well.
-I got 1,2.

758
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,296
The winner of this round is ORBIT.

759
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,297
Nice.

760
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,008
-It's hard to win. I'm going for it now.
-You receive 12 chips.

761
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,009
{\an8}I have the fewest now.

762
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,926
{\an8}KWAK JOON-BIN: 16 CHIPS

763
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,178
{\an8}This is crazy.

764
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,221
{\an8}He overtook you.

765
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,639
How is that even possible?

766
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,976
We will move on to the next round.

767
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,395
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is Dong-joo.

768
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,314
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is ORBIT.

769
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,899
{\an8}You each receive six chips.

770
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,777
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is Seok-jin.

771
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,528
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is ORBIT.

772
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,197
-I'll fold.
-I'll fold.

773
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,531
{\an8}Please reveal your marker.

774
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,116
{\an8}-High.
-You have bet on high.

775
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,576
Please reveal your marker.

776
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,286
-He bluffed.
-You got me.

777
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,829
-You receive 14 chips.
-You're annoying.

778
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:55,001
<i>My mind went blank and I had a hard time
coming up with an answer</i>

779
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,796
<i>when I saw ORBIT
go from zero chips to twenty.</i>

780
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,714
I'm sweating.

781
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,300
We will move on to the next round.

782
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,760
Here are your hidden cards.

783
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,387
{\an8}Here are your open cards.

784
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,430
{\an8}Zero.

785
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,890
{\an8}Four.

786
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,769
{\an8}These cards are giving me nothing again.

787
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,562
{\an8}Four.

788
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,897
{\an8}The betting will begin now.

789
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,857
-I'll start with one for now.
-You have bet one.

790
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,276
Actually, I'll pass for now. I'm sorry.

791
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,531
<i>In the beginning,
I only focused on my cards.</i>

792
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,866
<i>Toward the end,
I had my eyes on Seok-jin's cards.</i>

793
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,243
{\an8}ORBIT.

794
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,410
{\an8}Should I go for it?

795
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,079
{\an8}I think I should.

796
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,622
But I'll only bet five.

797
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,127
-Seok-jin.
-I'll match him.

798
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,046
You have bet five.

799
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,923
-Joon-bin.
-There's no need to ask anymore.

800
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,174
-You have folded.
-I'm folding.

801
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,969
-Dong-joo, you have folded.
-This isn't going anywhere for me.

802
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,595
Here are your open cards.

803
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,180
{\an8}-Nine.
-Come on, sir.

804
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,100
{\an8}-Five.
-Six, four, and five.

805
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,810
{\an8}Time will be given
to complete your equations.

806
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,436
{\an8}I don't think this will work.

807
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,272
{\an8}Shall we try calculating?

808
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,029
I'm going to try this.

809
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,532
<i>I needed to steal his Pieces.</i>

810
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,994
<i>I knew there was a chance I could lose,
but it didn't matter.</i>

811
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,705
Time has expired.
The final round of betting begins now.

812
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,373
ORBIT, please make your bet.

813
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,171
This is nerve-racking.

814
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,715
What?

815
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,676
What?

816
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,431
You have bet 12.

817
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,515
Seok-jin.

818
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,559
-Are you matching?
-Twelve?

819
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,935
Are you matching?

820
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,353
I'll start with 12.

821
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,396
I only have three left.

822
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,231
And add two more.

823
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,066
And add two more.

824
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,653
You have no choice.

825
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,113
You're out of options. Just do it.

826
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,241
ORBIT.

827
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,285
-Joon-bin.
-Yeah?

828
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,038
-I'm going for it.
-Okay.

829
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,456
-All in?
-Really?

830
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,624
There's no point in keeping one.

831
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,334
Seok-jin.

832
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,587
You have made your bet.

833
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,048
I wanted to survive until the end
and face you.

834
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,759
Please choose a betting marker
and place your hand on the table.

835
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,677
-Joon-bin.
-Yeah?

836
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,013
Do well tomorrow.

837
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,056
Seriously?

838
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,022
Seok-jin,

839
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,690
please reveal your marker.

840
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,817
You have bet on low.

841
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,028
{\an8}-Please complete your equation.
-For real?

842
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,753
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

843
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,046
{\an8}What color is the zero?

844
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,339
{\an8}Silver.

845
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,059
{\an8}-You have bet on low.
-No way.

846
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,602
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

847
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,132
It was the lowest number I could get.

848
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,010
ORBIT has won.

849
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,679
Good game.

850
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,431
I beat Seok-jin once.

851
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:37,974
I did it.

852
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,976
-I'm getting emotional.
-Great job.

853
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,480
-You receive 44 chips.
-I barely beat Seok-jin.

854
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,648
You caught up.

855
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,984
I went for it because you two folded.

856
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,610
If you hadn't, I couldn't have done this.

857
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,988
It's crazy how you both got one.

858
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,448
This is really tough.

859
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,033
That was a fun round.

860
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:55,992
{\an8}ORBIT: 44 CHIPS

861
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,535
{\an8}I faced you down.

862
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,748
Hi-Lo is intriguing because it's poker
where you can turn the tables around.

863
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,375
You can increase the value of your hand.

864
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,044
We will move on to the next round.

865
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,755
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is ORBIT.

866
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,715
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is Seok-jin.

867
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,799
Please pay your ante.

868
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,010
{\an8}Here are your open cards.

869
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,553
{\an8}-Four.
-Darn it.

870
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,430
{\an8}Nine.

871
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,639
{\an8}Four.

872
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,433
The betting will begin with Seok-jin.

873
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,103
I'll bet five.

874
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,230
-Joon-bin.
-I'm folding.

875
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,691
-I'm folding.
-You have folded.

876
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,610
If you two are folding, I'm going for it.

877
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,611
Five.

878
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,113
We need to take
as much as we can from him.

879
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,532
-Goodness. Do it then.
-You're so cool.

880
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,326
{\an8}-Why steal mine?
-Here are your third open cards.

881
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,786
{\an8}You have a lot.

882
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,703
{\an8}Eight.

883
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,246
{\an8}Six.

884
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,331
{\an8}Darn it.

885
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,749
{\an8}Time will be given
to complete your equations.

886
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,209
{\an8}What's with my cards?

887
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,628
{\an8}ORBIT, are you betting on low?

888
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,214
-I guess.
-Are you confident?

889
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,924
No, I'm not.

890
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,218
Knowing him,

891
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,930
he would make a neat equation
to win the low bet.

892
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,432
Listen to him.

893
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,853
I can't keep up with the bluffing.

894
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,188
Time has expired.

895
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,689
Seok-jin, please make your bet.

896
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,441
I'll bet five more.

897
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,859
You have bet five more.

898
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,529
I can't tell what you're thinking.

899
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,948
Are you not betting on high?

900
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,951
I'm going for it
since we need to beat Seok-jin.

901
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,577
You have bet five more.

902
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,662
Nice.

903
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,915
Please choose a betting marker
and place your hand on the table.

904
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,958
Wait.

905
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,543
Darn it.

906
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,546
ORBIT, please reveal your marker.

907
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,925
{\an8}You have bet on low.
Please complete your equation.

908
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,432
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

909
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,685
Seok-jin, please reveal your marker.

910
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,980
{\an8}-He really made a swing bet.
-You have made a swing bet.

911
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,857
{\an8}Please complete your equations.

912
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,108
{\an8}He's crazy.

913
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,246
{\an8}-This is my high equation.
-You have completed your high equation.

914
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,665
You're really something.

915
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,292
Please complete your low equation.

916
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,462
ORBIT made a good equation.

917
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,047
-You're really something.
-I wanted to try this,

918
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,966
even if it ends in a loss.

919
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,260
I have to try this at least once.

920
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,429
The winner of this round is ORBIT.

921
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,055
Both of you got one though.

922
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,473
But I had this card.

923
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,476
-It made sense to make a swing bet, right?
-Yeah.

924
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,769
That was a good choice.

925
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,147
We've been playing for seven hours.

926
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,440
This is tough.

927
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,859
It's harder to make equations
with fewer people.

928
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,403
It's harder for some reason.

929
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,574
I'm also hesitant to make bold bets
even if they could work.

930
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,659
Please pay your ante.

931
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,785
{\an8}HA SEOK-JIN: 84 CHIPS

932
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,078
{\an8}KWAK JOON-BIN: 8 CHIPS

933
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,080
{\an8}ORBIT: 57 CHIPS, SUH DONG-JOO: 41 CHIPS

934
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,290
{\an8}Here are your hidden cards.

935
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,422
Here are your open cards.

936
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,340
Square root.

937
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,257
{\an8}Two.

938
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,842
{\an8}One.

939
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,302
{\an8}Zero.

940
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,845
{\an8}Seven.

941
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,680
Please make your bets.

942
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,681
-Joon-bin.
-I'll pass.

943
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,141
-Dong-joo.
-I'll pass.

944
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,059
-ORBIT.
-I'll pass.

945
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,769
-Seok-jin.
-Me too.

946
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,103
Here are your third open cards.

947
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,981
{\an8}-Nine.
-Darn it.

948
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:14,941
{\an8}Two.

949
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,442
{\an8}Ten.

950
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,902
{\an8}Square root.

951
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,487
{\an8}How annoying.

952
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,488
{\an8}Six.

953
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,739
Joon-bin, please make your bet.

954
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,157
-I'll pass.
-You have passed.

955
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,867
Dong-joo, please make your bet.

956
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,291
You have bet five.

957
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,210
-Oh, my.
-ORBIT, please make your bet.

958
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,127
I'm folding.

959
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,796
-Seok-jin.
-I'll fold.

960
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,838
Joon-bin.

961
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,138
-I'll fold.
-You have folded.

962
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,932
Dong-joo has won this round.

963
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,726
Did you bet on high or low?

964
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,019
Low.

965
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,354
Did you get a one?

966
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,399
Almost. I got 1,1.

967
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,402
{\an8}KWAK JOON-BIN: 8 CHIPS

968
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,488
{\an8}SUH DONG-JOO: 45 CHIPS

969
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,367
ORBIT: 57 CHIPS, HA SEOK-JIN: 84 CHIPS

970
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,454
{\an8}<i>We played for so long</i>

971
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,292
{\an8}that I could tell
whether my hands were good or bad.

972
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,420
This is irritating.

973
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,215
But I didn't have the mental energy left
to utilize the good hands.

974
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,383
-Joon-bin.
-I'll fold.

975
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,301
You have folded.

976
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,468
I'll fold.

977
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,469
You have folded.

978
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,639
Joon-bin hasn't shown much
for a while now.

979
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,641
Your swing bet a while ago was great.

980
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,268
I haven't done anything since.

981
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,561
Please pay your ante.

982
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,897
{\an8}Here are your open cards.

983
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,524
{\an8}I sure get a lot of these black zeros.

984
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,567
{\an8}Nine.

985
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,402
{\an8}Four.

986
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,070
{\an8}Five.

987
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,323
Seok-jin, please make your bet.

988
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,949
-I'll pass.
-You have passed.

989
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,826
-Joon-bin.
-I'll pass.

990
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,619
-Dong-joo.
-I'll pass.

991
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,746
-ORBIT.
-I'll pass.

992
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,997
Here are your third open cards.

993
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,665
{\an8}Two.

994
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,251
{\an8}Ten.

995
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,961
{\an8}Eight.

996
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,505
{\an8}-Five.
-I got three of the same again.

997
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,758
{\an8}-Please complete your equations.
-This is crazy.

998
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,800
{\an8}Again?

999
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,849
Time has expired.

1000
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,601
Seok-jin, please make your bet.

1001
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,853
-I'll pass.
-You have passed. Joon-bin.

1002
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,065
<i>Whoever has the most chips wins the game.</i>

1003
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,817
<i>So I wasn't even
thinking about beating Seok-jin.</i>

1004
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,737
My only goal was to finish third.

1005
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,952
You have bet seven.

1006
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,663
Dong-joo, please make your bet.

1007
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,469
You have bet seven.

1008
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,681
-ORBIT.
-I'll fold.

1009
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,392
-Seok-jin.
-I'll fold.

1010
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,768
You have folded.

1011
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,686
{\an8}Please place your betting marker.

1012
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,355
{\an8}TO SPEED UP THE GAME,

1013
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,399
{\an8}PLAYERS MUST REVEAL MARKERS SIMULTANEOUSLY
FROM ROUND 25 AND ON

1014
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,026
{\an8}Please reveal your markers simultaneously.

1015
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,405
Please reveal your markers.

1016
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,407
{\an8}-Low.
-Wow.

1017
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,699
{\an8}Please complete your equations.

1018
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,165
{\an8}I got 1,25.

1019
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,507
{\an8}Dong-joo wins this round.

1020
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,717
{\an8}I can't do this anymore.

1021
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,303
-Thank you.
-Good job.

1022
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,765
<i>Joon-bin has lost all of his Pieces.</i>

1023
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,142
<i>As such,</i>

1024
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:40,020
<i>Joon-bin is the ninth player
to get eliminated from</i> The Devil's Plan.

1025
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,063
I finished fourth.

1026
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,148
-Well done.
<i>-Joon-bin,</i>

1027
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,108
<i>please return to the living area,
pack your belongings,</i>

1028
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,444
<i>and leave.</i>

1029
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,071
<i>This main match
was the kind of individual battle</i>

1030
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,198
that I was looking forward to
this whole time.

1031
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,868
But I hit a wall the more I played.

1032
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,829
<i>And the only thought in my head</i>

1033
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,039
was that I didn't deserve
to make it to the finals.

1034
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,125
<i>ORBIT was turning the tables for himself.</i>

1035
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,626
<i>But what was I doing?</i>

1036
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,213
I'd gone through a lot all thanks to you.

1037
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,339
Why are you crying?

1038
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,551
-We'll see each other in a bit, won't we?
-Yeah.

1039
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,095
I'm sorry.

1040
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,975
-I...
-I can't beat you.

1041
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,852
Thank you for everything.

1042
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:20,811
All right.

1043
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,605
There was no choice.

1044
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,606
You did well.

1045
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,113
<i>The game has finished.</i>

1046
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,074
{\an8}<i>Your chips will be converted
back to Pieces.</i>

1047
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:38,329
{\an8}<i>Dong-joo receives 11 Pieces
for her 55 chips.</i>

1048
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,541
{\an8}<i>Orbit receives 11 pieces
for his 58 Chips.</i>

1049
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:47,004
{\an8}<i>And Seok-jin receives 16 Pieces
for his 81 chips.</i>

1050
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,132
<i>No player will go to prison tonight.</i>

1051
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,135
<i>All players will participate
in the prize match.</i>

1052
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,056
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

1053
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,975
Good game. Let's head back.

1054
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,227
Let's go.

1055
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,776
You're still here.

1056
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,404
Why does nothing go as planned?

1057
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,406
What do you mean?

1058
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,658
Why were you being such a tryhard?

1059
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,327
You did great, you little punk.

1060
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,373
You did amazing to survive this far.

1061
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,708
I couldn't do the math anymore.

1062
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,960
It was time for me to go.

1063
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,753
<i>To be honest,</i>

1064
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,756
no one had picked me to go to the finals.

1065
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,050
<i>And I wanted to prove them wrong,</i>

1066
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,969
<i>but I realized I couldn't beat them.</i>

1067
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,096
More than anything,

1068
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,223
I'm happy to have finished fourth.

1069
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,266
But you know,

1070
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,435
I finished fourth
so I think I'm smarter than expected.

1071
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,896
<i>It's not easy to finish fourth
competing against</i>

1072
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,231
<i>such intelligent players.</i>

1073
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,108
<i>I wanted to finish in first place,</i>

1074
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,776
<i>but I expected to finish last.</i>

1075
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,862
So I'm satisfied
with finishing fourth out of twelve.

1076
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,114
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

1077
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,490
Thanks for everything.

1078
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,993
Thank you, Seok-jin.

1079
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,203
-See you outside.
-All right.

1080
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,039
Goodbye.

1081
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:04,957
Bye.

1082
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,333
Joon-bin.

1083
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,253
So this is how it plays out.

1084
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,024
<i>Of course,</i>

1085
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,901
<i>I wanted to do my best
and get good results.</i>

1086
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,195
<i>And I've tried so hard
to make it this far.</i>

1087
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,197
{\an8}But I didn't know...

1088
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,700
{\an8}SUH DONG-JOO
LAWYER

1089
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,036
{\an8}...I would get so emotionally invested
along the way.

1090
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,997
<i>It's so frustrating to see
all those efforts and struggles to survive</i>

1091
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,750
<i>end up in vain.</i>

1092
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,502
<i>And the pain of eliminating
those who I was allied with</i>

1093
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,421
was just too much to bear.

1094
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,052
Focus.

1095
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,428
Let's win the prize money.

1096
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,517
Let's eat.

1097
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,810
The food looks good.

1098
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,484
This is tough.

1099
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,486
It's because we lived together.

1100
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,820
True.

1101
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,030
If we hadn't,

1102
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,823
-I wouldn't be sad at all.
-Yeah.

1103
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,451
It means a lot to spend 24 hours together.

1104
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,996
This place has become
the only world I know.

1105
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,459
It's like we're in an isolated society.

1106
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,960
I don't remember
what the outside world was like.

1107
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,006
I don't remember anything.

1108
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,927
<i>I need to focus and play the prize match.</i>

1109
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,595
Or Joon-bin will get mad at me

1110
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,263
if I get eliminated now.

1111
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,058
Since we had a memory game yesterday...

1112
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,685
You're talking about today's match?

1113
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,103
-The prize match?
-Yeah.

1114
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,688
I think it'll be that thing.

1115
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,147
{\an8}You remember the board game?

1116
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,108
{\an8}You mean Four in a Row?
I don't know how to play it.

1117
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,943
-It's similar to Gomoku.
-I've never played it.

1118
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,069
Will I be okay?

1119
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,904
-Shouldn't we try it?
-I played with Joon-bin once.

1120
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,242
<i>The prize match will begin soon.</i>

1121
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,370
<i>Please gather in the game area.</i>

1122
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,706
-Let's go.
-Let's stay focused.

1123
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,000
We need to focus.

1124
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,132
It's almost over.

1125
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,144
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

1126
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,105
<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

1127
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:38,485
{\an8}<i>Currently, Seok-jin has the most Pieces.</i>

1128
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,905
<i>The two players with the most Pieces</i>

1129
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,324
<i>by the end of this prize match</i>

1130
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,327
<i>-will move on to the final.</i>
-Really?

1131
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,456
<i>The player with the fewest Pieces</i>

1132
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,457
<i>will get eliminated.</i>

1133
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,041
<i>Now,</i>

1134
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,712
<i>here is the sixth prize match.</i>

1135
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,089
<i>Today's prize match...</i>

1136
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,676
<i>is Four Player Three in a Row.</i>

1137
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,388
<i>In Four Player Three in a Row,</i>

1138
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,183
<i>players will aim to be the first to place</i>

1139
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,478
<i>three of their pieces in a row</i>

1140
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,397
<i>either horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally.</i>

1141
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,484
<i>As the game is played with four players,</i>

1142
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,905
<i>the three players
will be joined by a special guest.</i>

1143
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,323
Is it Yeon-woo?

1144
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,449
It must be Yeon-woo.

1145
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,743
<i>Once the game begins,</i>

1146
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:32,664
<i>players will be placed in different rooms
and play the game in isolation.</i>

1147
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,210
<i>The board consists of 16 squares</i>

1148
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,629
<i>in 4 rows and 4 columns.</i>

1149
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:43,467
<i>Each player will receive five pieces
in a color different from the others.</i>

1150
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,469
<i>Based on a set procedure,</i>

1151
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,554
<i>the color of the pieces</i>

1152
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,223
<i>and the order of play
will change each round.</i>

1153
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,601
<i>During their turn,</i>

1154
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,896
<i>a player may choose
to either place a new piece</i>

1155
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,731
<i>or move an existing piece.</i>

1156
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,233
<i>Placing a new piece.</i>

1157
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,278
<i>A new piece
may only be placed on one square,</i>

1158
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:07,407
<i>and up to three pieces
may be stacked on one square.</i>

1159
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:12,162
<i>A new piece may be stacked
on another player's piece,</i>

1160
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,874
<i>but stacks may only
go up to three pieces high.</i>

1161
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,962
<i>In addition,
a player may not place a piece</i>

1162
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,880
<i>on a square
that already has a stack of three.</i>

1163
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,299
<i>Moving an existing piece.</i>

1164
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,554
<i>If a player's piece
is on the very top of the stack,</i>

1165
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,807
<i>the player may move their piece</i>

1166
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,518
<i>one square in any direction.</i>

1167
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,189
<i>The player may not move
their piece to a square</i>

1168
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,400
<i>that already has a stack of three.</i>

1169
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,861
<i>When moving a piece on the board,</i>

1170
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,614
<i>only one piece may be moved at a time.</i>

1171
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,244
<i>For example,
even if the two pieces at the top</i>

1172
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,162
<i>are both a player's pieces,</i>

1173
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,873
<i>the player may only move
the topmost piece.</i>

1174
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,086
<i>If a player is unable to place a new piece</i>

1175
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,588
<i>or move an existing piece,</i>

1176
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,548
<i>the player must pass their turn.</i>

1177
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,759
<i>While playing the game,</i>

1178
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,095
<i>if a row of three pieces of one color</i>

1179
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,222
<i>can be seen horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally</i>

1180
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,726
<i>when looking down on the board from above,</i>

1181
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,895
<i>the player who owns those pieces
wins the round.</i>

1182
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,984
<i>Thus, players must get
three topmost pieces in a row.</i>

1183
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,738
<i>And the winner of each round
will receive three Pieces.</i>

1184
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,991
<i>The game will last for four rounds.</i>

1185
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,119
<i>If the special guest wins even one round,</i>

1186
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,829
<i>the prize match ends in failure</i>

1187
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:38,123
<i>and no prize money will be added.</i>

1188
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,875
Wow.

1189
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,462
<i>If the three players win all four rounds,</i>

1190
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,088
<i>the prize match ends in success</i>

1191
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,091
<i>and 100 million won
will be added to the final prize.</i>

1192
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,260
-We have to win all four?
-Yeah.

1193
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,263
<i>If two players get three in a row
at the same time,</i>

1194
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,433
<i>and the special guest
is one of those players,</i>

1195
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,310
<i>the prize match ends in failure.</i>

1196
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,021
<i>If two regular players get three in a row
at the same time,</i>

1197
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,565
<i>no Pieces will be given.</i>

1198
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,401
<i>If there is a tie after four rounds,</i>

1199
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:10,906
<i>the tied players will play extra rounds
to determine the finalists.</i>

1200
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,533
-Have you played this game?
-Well, I...

1201
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,952
I tried it once yesterday.

1202
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,372
I actually played the game yesterday

1203
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,000
<i>with Seungkwan, Yu-min, and Kyeong-rim.</i>

1204
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,543
I'm glad I did.

1205
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,504
<i>I've only tried it for a bit.</i>

1206
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,006
I haven't gotten the hang of it yet.

1207
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,469
<i>We lost a couple of prize matches
where we weren't allowed to communicate.</i>

1208
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,262
So this is going to be tough.

1209
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,224
Based on the color of the pieces,

1210
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,101
we'll decide where to place them first.

1211
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,353
-If it's one of us...
-Then we can tell who's friend or foe.

1212
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,106
You're only talking about
the piece placed first, right?

1213
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,900
Yeah, because it gets
complicated from there.

1214
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,318
There's not much we can do
after the first move.

1215
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,569
-So...
-Just look at the first piece.

1216
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,571
Let's say I'm at the table.

1217
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,658
And I'm the first player to go.

1218
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,743
Then I should place my piece here.

1219
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,787
Why there?

1220
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,206
From where I am, it goes R, B, Y, G.

1221
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,375
This signifies that it's me.

1222
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,670
Let's say you're Red.

1223
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,547
-Then where should you go?
-Here.

1224
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,633
So if you place it here,
we can tell the player is one of us.

1225
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,802
-Right.
-Let's say you're Yellow.

1226
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,637
Then you should place yours here.

1227
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,098
We'll all be doing the same thing
in the beginning anyway.

1228
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,267
Then the special guest

1229
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,893
could place theirs here,

1230
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,854
-It doesn't matter where they place it.
-or somewhere else.

1231
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,647
We can tell
it's the special guest's piece.

1232
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,690
What happens after?

1233
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,066
We play the game.

1234
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,818
-What if...
-Once we know who's who,

1235
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,903
we should focus on
stopping the special guest.

1236
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,948
What if the special guest
places their blue piece here?

1237
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,534
-You're saying that's unlikely.
-The chances of that are slim.

1238
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,954
But it would be odd
to start the game like this.

1239
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,039
It does seem better to spread out.

1240
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,501
I saw what Yeon-woo did with See-won.

1241
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,670
-They always started around here.
-In the middle?

1242
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,590
Yeah, so it might be better
to start randomly.

1243
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,342
-We could change it then.
-We should.

1244
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,928
-We need to decide where R, B, Y, G go.
-Let's start again.

1245
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,513
Or we could do this.

1246
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,557
Change the starting placement every round.

1247
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,601
Round one.

1248
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,518
Round two.

1249
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,603
If we do this

1250
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,062
and the placement is wrong,

1251
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,523
-we know what color the special guest is.
-Okay.

1252
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,026
Let's go with this for round one.

1253
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,778
-All right.
-Okay.

1254
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,154
After that,

1255
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,448
should we do this?

1256
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,785
So, R, B, G, and Y.

1257
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,995
I should write this down.

1258
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,955
It makes sense to start with three, right?

1259
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,916
I think it's better to do that.

1260
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,542
If you only place one or two,

1261
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,127
-someone might stack on top of you.
-Exactly.

1262
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,671
-So when we start...
-We'll know who the special guest is

1263
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,923
after a couple of turns.

1264
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,342
<i>Three pieces can be stacked on one square</i>

1265
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,011
<i>and only the topmost piece can be moved.</i>

1266
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,972
<i>If a player places a stack of one or two</i>

1267
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,266
<i>and another player stacks on top of that,</i>

1268
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,644
<i>the bottom pieces become useless.</i>

1269
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:50,148
<i>Therefore, placing a stack of three
on the first move is a good strategy.</i>

1270
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,108
How do we defend?

1271
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,902
We need to stop them
from getting three in a row.

1272
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,029
So teamwork is key.

1273
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,073
{\an8}Should we try simulating it?

1274
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,157
{\an8}-Green first?
-Yeah.

1275
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,162
{\an8}I see.

1276
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,623
{\an8}-Then Blue goes here.
-If that happens...

1277
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,542
{\an8}And Red goes here.

1278
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,127
{\an8}That means Red is the special guest.

1279
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,255
{\an8}Then we can start playing.

1280
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,173
{\an8}We should surround Red

1281
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,133
{\an8}-to block it off.
-Exactly.

1282
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,928
{\an8}-Then Yellow could go here.
-It would go around Red.

1283
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,221
{\an8}That's right.

1284
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,306
{\an8}If Blue goes here, where would Red go?

1285
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,267
{\an8}Would Red stack on top of Blue?

1286
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,434
{\an8}Probably.

1287
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,479
{\an8}If so, let's say Blue stacked
two of their pieces.

1288
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,647
{\an8}Then Red does this.

1289
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,108
{\an8}-That's not good.
-Why help them?

1290
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,943
{\an8}You should make Red use two pieces.

1291
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,611
{\an8}-Really?
-Yeah.

1292
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,739
{\an8}Then Green should block this direction.

1293
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,617
{\an8}Then Yellow goes here.

1294
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,327
{\an8}-Blue goes here.
-Yeah.

1295
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,246
{\an8}Now Red has nowhere to go.

1296
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,915
{\an8}-Will they go this way?
-They would stack on top of this.

1297
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,125
{\an8}They would go here.

1298
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,002
{\an8}So Red goes here.

1299
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,879
{\an8}If Green goes here, what can Yellow do?

1300
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,839
{\an8}In this case, Blue wins.

1301
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,049
{\an8}-That's right.
-Let's say I went here.

1302
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,218
{\an8}-Blue would go here.
-Blue would get three in a row.

1303
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,220
{\an8}If we play defensively,

1304
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,681
{\an8}-It works out on its own.
-the winner will be random.

1305
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,892
We shouldn't try to win.

1306
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,184
-We should try to defend.
-Exactly.

1307
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,353
We won't know who will win.

1308
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,230
This will be tough.

1309
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,900
Either Dong-joo and I
will get eliminated anyways.

1310
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,443
-Because we don't have...
-Your Pieces?

1311
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,402
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1312
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,905
<i>Just by winning one round,</i>

1313
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,949
<i>Seok-jin will be able
to advance to the final.</i>

1314
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,871
<i>However, if ORBIT and Dong-joo
win two rounds each,</i>

1315
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,581
<i>Seok-jin gets eliminated</i>

1316
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:33,084
<i>and ORBIT and Dong-joo
will advance to the final.</i>

1317
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,046
If we all defend,
there's no way we can lose this match.

1318
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,757
If we do this, we'll win the prize money.

1319
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,885
We may not know who will advance,

1320
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,430
but let's be happy about
beating the special guest together.

1321
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,850
Our strategy for this game

1322
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,144
is to prevent
the special guest from winning.

1323
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,063
I'll do my best to win the prize money.

1324
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,774
<i>The special guest
learned the rules of the game</i>

1325
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,484
<i>an hour ago.</i>

1326
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,526
-What?
-What?

1327
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,528
<i>Four Player Three in a Row will begin now.</i>

1328
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,740
<i>Please move as directed by the dealers.</i>

1329
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,909
ORBIT, please enter the work room.

1330
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,495
Dong-joo, please enter the dealer room.

1331
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,581
I'm excited.

1332
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,416
I wonder who the guest is.

1333
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,503
<i>The special guest is Kim Sa-rang,</i>

1334
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,546
<i>the youngest-ever
Korean national chess player</i>

1335
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,007
<i>who will compete
in the Hangzhou Asian Games.</i>

1336
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,802
I really want to win.

1337
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:27,013
I don't want to lose to the special guest
after coming this far.

1338
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,728
<i>Round one begins now.</i>

1339
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,191
<i>Dealers will now inform the players
of their pieces and order of play.</i>

1340
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,527
ORBIT, you will play as Yellow

1341
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,278
-and go second.
-Got it.

1342
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,489
Is there a time limit per turn?

1343
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,782
You have 90 seconds.

1344
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,200
Okay.

1345
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,706
All right.

1346
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:01,089
So you're saying we'll be able to know
which color the guest is this way, yeah?

1347
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,009
-Let's go with this for round one.
-All right.

1348
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,052
R, Y...

1349
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,595
Okay.

1350
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,598
<i>We know what color
the special guest is playing as.</i>

1351
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:14,144
<i>So now we need to defend against them.</i>

1352
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,064
It is Green's turn.

1353
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,210
It is Yellow's turn.

1354
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,173
{\an8}It might be better to end this quickly.

1355
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,888
It is Green's turn.

1356
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,483
Okay, let's see.

1357
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,861
If I place mine here,
Red will probably stack on top of me.

1358
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,238
I can't let Red get two in a row.

1359
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,990
If I place mine here,

1360
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,533
Green would stack on top of me.

1361
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,461
Red needs to come down.

1362
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,421
There's no other choice.
I'm going to stack on top of it.

1363
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,633
Actually, Green will.

1364
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,396
It is your turn.

1365
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:46,236
I'm sure ORBIT is playing as Yellow

1366
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,905
seeing how he's saving his pieces up.

1367
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,658
{\an8}Blue should block Red off here.

1368
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,659
{\an8}Okay.

1369
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,372
{\an8}Wait a minute.

1370
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,375
{\an8}They'll do it, right?

1371
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,510
It is Green's turn.

1372
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,234
It is your turn.

1373
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,534
Yellow won.

1374
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,548
<i>Yellow has won round one.</i>

1375
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,721
<i>Round two begins now.</i>

1376
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,432
-Am I Red?
-Yes.

1377
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,850
Let's do this for round two.

1378
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,227
So, R, B, G, and Y.

1379
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,604
It is Red's turn.

1380
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,232
{\an8}It's one of us.

1381
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,321
Okay.

1382
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,823
What the...

1383
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,160
Okay, now we just need to
defend against Green.

1384
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,206
It is your turn.

1385
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,920
It is Red's turn.

1386
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,721
All right, not a bad move.

1387
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,598
To stop Red,

1388
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,683
if I place one here

1389
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,602
then Green would go on top.

1390
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,687
They should go here.

1391
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,524
I need to block this row.

1392
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,526
Someone else might do it.

1393
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,326
{\an8}Why would you...

1394
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,078
I made a mistake.

1395
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,625
I made the wrong move.

1396
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,337
{\an8}If Blue goes here...

1397
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,049
{\an8}even if Red goes here, we lose.

1398
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,385
{\an8}This square has to be blocked.

1399
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:26,980
<i>Red has won round two.</i>

1400
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,023
<i>Round three begins now.</i>

1401
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,442
You will play as Red and go first.

1402
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,736
Let's do this.

1403
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,243
After that,

1404
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,661
should we do this?

1405
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:44,789
Block off Yellow.

1406
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,127
I'm playing defensively.

1407
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,754
I'm not going to be greedy.

1408
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,881
You're bound to lose this game

1409
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,467
if you get greedy about winning it.

1410
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,719
But if you don't win,

1411
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,805
you don't get Pieces
and will end up going home.

1412
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:05,476
So the game presents
a dilemma to the players.

1413
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,651
It is Blue's turn.

1414
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,460
Why?

1415
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,964
It's best to surround
the special guest's pieces.

1416
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,052
It is Green's turn.

1417
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,262
{\an8}Green should go here.

1418
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,389
Come on, block them off.

1419
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,977
{\an8}If I block this square...

1420
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,272
{\an8}I think I won.

1421
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,736
I have no choice but to block it.

1422
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,494
{\an8}It's over.

1423
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,537
It is your turn.

1424
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,793
It is Blue's turn.

1425
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,966
<i>Blue has won round three.</i>

1426
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,385
I was lucky.

1427
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,012
<i>Round four begins now.</i>

1428
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,097
Dong-joo.

1429
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,557
-Yes?
-You will play as Green and go third.

1430
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,642
Okay.

1431
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,353
Let's play well until the end.

1432
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,531
It is your turn.

1433
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,329
Okay.

1434
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,580
Okay.

1435
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,168
Come on, Red.

1436
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,512
It is your turn.

1437
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:20,194
A stack of red, yellow,
and green pieces would work.

1438
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,739
We need to work together.

1439
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,366
Red, please get in between Blue.

1440
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,044
Why did Red go there?

1441
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,090
Why did Red make such a foolish move?

1442
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,889
Red must be Seok-jin.

1443
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,183
I figured everything out.

1444
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,894
I wrote down the order and even the names,

1445
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,228
based on the style of play.

1446
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,980
<i>I could tell who was playing what.</i>

1447
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,523
<i>And I was right every time.</i>

1448
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,404
Red, Yellow...

1449
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,656
It is your turn.

1450
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,787
No matter where I go, Blue wins.

1451
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,456
Why did he put his piece there?

1452
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:26,052
<i>Blue has won round four.</i>

1453
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,720
<i>The game has ended.</i>

1454
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,014
<i>Please return to the main hall.</i>

1455
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,481
-ORBIT.
-I made a mistake.

1456
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:39,816
I made a mistake.

1457
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,442
-You were Red?
-Yeah, I made a mistake.

1458
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,361
-You little...
-I got the order wrong.

1459
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,950
We lost.

1460
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,409
Blue will take that stack.

1461
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,453
And I don't have a way out.

1462
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,874
This is driving me crazy.

1463
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,876
{\an8}This is the only option.

1464
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,051
{\an8}I had to do that in my turn.

1465
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:09,887
{\an8}What the...

1466
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,848
{\an8}What are you doing?

1467
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,183
Why did Red make such a foolish move?

1468
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:18,813
You fool.

1469
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,442
Please wait.

1470
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,237
It is Blue's turn.

1471
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,072
What?

1472
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,741
It's Blue's turn?

1473
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,077
I mistook the order.

1474
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,455
I messed it up.

1475
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,332
You eliminated me.

1476
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,043
Dong-joo could have won.

1477
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,003
Exactly.

1478
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,004
It's fine.

1479
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,590
<i>I thought it was my turn.</i>

1480
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,053
How could I make such a mistake?

1481
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:53,848
I just...

1482
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,393
I have no excuses.

1483
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:00,062
It was my fault.

1484
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,773
<i>As the guest won round four,</i>

1485
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,525
<i>the prize match ends in failure.</i>

1486
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,319
<i>As such,</i>

1487
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,613
-<i>no prize money will be added.</i>
-Seok-jin, good job.

1488
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,948
I'm sad we failed.

1489
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,075
-I'm so sorry.
-I wanted to help win the prize match.

1490
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,579
<i>ORBIT receives three Pieces
for winning round one.</i>

1491
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:21,125
<i>Seok-jin receives six Pieces
for winning rounds two and three.</i>

1492
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,837
<i>Here is the current Piece count
of each player.</i>

1493
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,131
<i>Seok-jin, who has the most Pieces,</i>

1494
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:29,133
<i>and ORBIT, who has the second most Pieces,</i>

1495
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,093
<i>will advance to the final.</i>

1496
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,220
<i>Due to having the fewest Pieces,</i>

1497
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,474
<i>Dong-joo is the tenth player
to get eliminated from</i> The Devil's Plan.

1498
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,643
<i>-Please return to the living area</i>
-My face is up there.

1499
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:39,936
<i>pack your belongings,</i>

1500
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,562
<i>and leave.</i>

1501
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,230
Okay.

1502
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,523
Goodbye.

1503
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,568
<i>The prize match has ended.</i>

1504
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,529
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

1505
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,657
<i>We will meet again at the finals.</i>

1506
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,451
I'm sorry for making
such a rookie mistake.

1507
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,790
I feel so bad
for not getting you a final win.

1508
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,959
You did great.

1509
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,753
I really must've given it my all
because I'm not sad at all.

1510
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:10,508
At first, I didn't understand
why people cried so much.

1511
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,843
Crying every time someone leaves
is kind of...

1512
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,012
Then why eliminate someone
if you're going to cry about it?

1513
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,432
Since yesterday

1514
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:22,395
<i>and up to today, I cried so much.</i>

1515
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,523
It's interesting to see this side of me.

1516
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:29,610
I think it's proof
of how much passion and energy

1517
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:34,949
I put into all the games we played.

1518
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,034
-I'm leaving. Good luck.
-Dong-joo.

1519
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,121
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

1520
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,039
You helped me a lot.

1521
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,208
After everything, why did only I survive?

1522
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,585
This wasn't my intention.

1523
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,295
-I know that.
-It went wrong.

1524
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,548
But what's happened has happened,
so it's fine.

1525
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,174
Something went wrong.

1526
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,136
You said things were going as planned
just this morning.

1527
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:56,762
Let's go.

1528
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:57,847
I'm going now.

1529
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:01,142
<i>Nothing goes to plan inside here.</i>

1530
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:05,354
While I was here,
this place felt like my whole universe.

1531
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,524
<i>And I forgot about the outside world.</i>

1532
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:12,737
<i>My life inside these walls
was everything to me.</i>

1533
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,700
<i>The Devil's Plan
</i>was my universe for one week.

1534
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,119
-Goodbye. Thank you for everything.
-Great job.

1535
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,912
-I had fun. See you tomorrow.
-Me too. Bye.

1536
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,330
-See you tomorrow.
-All right.

1537
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,627
You did well.

1538
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:11,647
