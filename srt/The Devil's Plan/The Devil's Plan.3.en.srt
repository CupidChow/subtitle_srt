1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,516
{\an8}ROOM 201

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,229
{\an8}ROOM 204

3
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:26,025
7:00 A.M.

4
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,836
It's cold in the morning, isn't it?

5
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,046
It's colder in the bathroom

6
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,922
-It's really cold.
-than it was yesterday.

7
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,674
Who are you closest to?

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,718
-Who am I closest to?
-Yeah.

9
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,345
I still haven't learned
everyone's names yet.

10
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,972
Do you know my name?

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,933
See-won.

12
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,270
Now that we're no longer terrorists,

13
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,107
let's drink as ordinary players.

14
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,026
-Here's to you.
-To you.

15
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,611
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

16
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,741
Let's share useful information
with each other.

17
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,825
Sure.

18
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:22,499
{\an8}PRISON

19
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,045
Good morning.

20
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,840
I had a great night's sleep.

21
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,218
Maybe I'm suited to prison life.

22
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,053
How did I sleep so well?

23
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,640
I used the bathroom, and...
They must be turning on the lights.

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,725
There we go.

25
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,812
Good morning.

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,774
Wake-up call.

27
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,108
Eight o'clock wake-up call.

28
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,698
<i>I don't think I slept too well.</i>

29
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,120
<i>I feel better than I did yesterday.</i>

30
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,667
<i>I slept very well.</i>

31
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,128
<i>It was hard for me to get up.</i>

32
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,631
<i>I was so uncomfortable at night.</i>

33
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,099
I want to team up with you.

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,809
It would be fun.

35
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,145
-Don't you have a team?
-What team?

36
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,605
Isn't Dong-jae your teammate?

37
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,441
Yeah, but I could also team up with you.

38
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:35,822
You offering to be allies with me

39
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,117
is a very good thing for me

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,619
because the underdogs
want to be with the top dog.

41
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,122
I never thought of myself as the top dog.

42
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,748
-You are.
-Really?

43
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,542
Do we get breakfast?

44
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,877
-Of course we do.
-Really?

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,753
Don't underestimate prison.

46
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,382
Welcome.

47
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,592
Thank you.

48
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,344
Thank you. It's porridge!

49
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,598
Thank you. This is amazing.

50
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,474
Here you go.

51
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,601
I just woke up.

52
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,102
Thank you.

53
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,062
We get porridge for breakfast?

54
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,315
This place is quite nice.

55
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,319
It's good.

56
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,237
Doesn't it remind you
of an in-flight meal?

57
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,739
You're right.

58
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,824
If this were a plane,
it'd be business class.

59
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,950
We get to lie down.

60
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,535
It's more like first class!

61
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,162
You can't lie down in business.

62
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,831
The breakfast here is amazing.

63
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,041
The food is excellent.

64
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,418
This is like a hotel breakfast.

65
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,420
-Right.
-So...

66
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,422
Did you sleep well?

67
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,799
Dong-joo, come eat with us.

68
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,718
-Isn't it too cramped?
-Come here.

69
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,553
-Dong-joo, sit here.
-There's a seat.

70
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,891
Dong-joo, you were born in 1993, right?

71
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,017
No, 1983.

72
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,729
-Why?
-Until now,

73
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,232
-I thought you were...
-I'm the same age as him.

74
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,317
I assumed you were born in 1993
so I spoke casually.

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,694
-It's okay.
-You're older than me?

76
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,737
-Yeah.
-What's going on?

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,572
-I must've misheard her age.
-She spoke casually.

78
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,615
They're ten years apart.

79
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,533
-I thought she was born in 1993.
-It's all right.

80
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,494
I spoke casually to her until now.

81
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,204
-I see.
-Since when?

82
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,872
-Since yesterday?
-Since the beginning.

83
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,415
She wanted to speak casually,

84
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,584
so I thought we were around the same age.

85
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,503
-This is her happiest moment so far.
-Really?

86
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,755
-I feel great, Hye-sung.
-Oh, my.

87
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,507
-You were born in 1993?
-I was born in 1992.

88
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,050
-So I thought she was younger than me.
-1992?

89
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,301
Really?

90
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,762
Did you wonder why
she was speaking casually to you?

91
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,514
"Why isn't she using honorifics?"

92
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,807
"Hye-sung is a bit rude."

93
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,269
"She doesn't like
using honorifics, does she?"

94
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,521
-I thought we were only one year apart.
-"She's a bit rude."

95
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,731
So I didn't think much of it.

96
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,650
-You were also born in 1983?
-Yeah.

97
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,318
Did you think I was born in 1993?

98
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,488
-She can't say anything.
-No.

99
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,656
Or 1893?

100
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,743
In that case, you've aged well.

101
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,537
That's funny.

102
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,248
You're a top dog now.

103
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,791
-Me?
-Yeah.

104
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,751
-You have the most Pieces.
-I do.

105
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,629
-Others will keep you in check.
-Right.

106
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,466
But they will also want to
be allies with you the most.

107
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,804
Instead of being your enemy,

108
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,392
more people will want to be your ally.

109
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,562
-ORBIT.
-Yeah?

110
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,731
You didn't form
an alliance already, did you?

111
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm just helping whoever needs my help.

112
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
You know how I am.

113
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,195
Also, I'm an underdog right now.

114
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,407
I'm the weakest of the lot.

115
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,076
Everyone with just one Piece
is an underdog.

116
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,871
Is having one Piece going to
make a difference from having two?

117
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,458
If you only have one,
you're in clear danger of elimination.

118
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,251
It's risky.

119
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,297
-Let's gather more people.
-Okay, sounds good.

120
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,798
Honestly,

121
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,260
<i>I have a lot of trust in Yeon-woo</i>

122
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,388
but she hasn't had
the chance to do anything.

123
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,848
I'm not sure

124
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,768
-how good she is at the games.
-Me neither.

125
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,352
You can convince Seok-jin, right?

126
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,354
<i>-I can do that.
-Exactly.</i>

127
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,316
-I also talked to Guillaume.
-Okay.

128
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,359
-He was good yesterday.
-He was.

129
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,903
So I talked to Guillaume.

130
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,488
And you know those in prison?

131
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,908
I think an important item or opportunity
can be found there.

132
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,494
Even if that's not the case,
it would be good to check.

133
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,495
Okay.

134
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,205
I have to show you something.

135
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,956
Hang on, I'll bring it.

136
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,004
Everyone who's worried about Pieces

137
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,172
is an underdog right now.

138
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,509
The top dogs aren't worried.

139
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,641
I think there's something to these Pieces.

140
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,434
Did you know?

141
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,728
I didn't even look at mine.

142
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:40,358
Take a look.
I don't think you have it, but I do.

143
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,401
I got these yesterday, right?

144
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,612
Here is your Piece.

145
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,905
Thank you.

146
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,119
The one I received yesterday

147
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,372
is different from the ones
we received in the beginning.

148
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:22,108
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

149
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,484
The one I received yesterday

150
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,279
is different from the ones
we received in the beginning.

151
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,322
These are the ones
we received in the beginning,

152
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,241
and these are the new ones.

153
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,952
You can't really
fit these together though.

154
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,954
What can you do with this?

155
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,332
Don't tell anyone.

156
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,542
I haven't told anyone.

157
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,585
Those who know are...

158
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,130
<i>Having solved two puzzles,
Joon-bin gains one Piece.</i>

159
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,299
Joon-bin got one Piece

160
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,884
<i>and gave it to Dong-joo.</i>

161
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,469
<i>-He did?
-Yeah.</i>

162
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,429
When Joon-bin got his,

163
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,183
there's no way
he didn't notice the difference.

164
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,684
So he probably gave her
the original Piece.

165
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,019
That's possible.

166
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,104
He probably thought

167
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,690
the new Piece had more value.

168
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,983
I would've done the same.

169
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,410
<i>I didn't oversleep. I thought
I had to sleep well to play well.</i>

170
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,412
I forced myself to sleep more.

171
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,417
Can he even breathe?

172
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,710
His sleep mask...

173
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,378
Why is your mask on your mouth?

174
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,214
What time is it?

175
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,341
It's almost ten.

176
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,306
I couldn't get up either.

177
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,766
I used to need

178
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,935
wake-up calls in the morning.

179
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,731
Why am I waking up so easily?

180
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,901
You can barely open your eyes.

181
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:52,031
<i>I used to need
Wake-up calls in the morning</i>

182
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,746
Come in.

183
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,249
You helped me a lot yesterday.

184
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,543
More like manipulated. I trusted you.

185
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,671
I wanted to repay you for that.

186
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,424
-Repay me?
-Yeah, I wanted to settle our accounts.

187
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,094
-One Piece?
-Yeah, this is yours.

188
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,764
I'm actually looking
for people I can trust.

189
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,934
My goal is to form a strong alliance

190
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,020
and have two of our members
make it to the finals.

191
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,565
If it's okay with you,

192
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,233
-I'd love to.
-would you like to...

193
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,610
<i>I thought it'd be advantageous</i>

194
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,864
{\an8}if I allied myself
with such a strong contender.

195
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,449
-Here.
-Thank you.

196
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,994
Honestly, I was planning on

197
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
living on the edge today.

198
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,290
-With just one Piece?
-With one Piece.

199
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,542
You can give that back to me then.

200
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,419
-It's already in my pouch.
-Already?

201
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,879
-Once it's in, it's hard to take it out.
-I see how it is.

202
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,965
Once I put something in,

203
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,466
-they disappear.
-Really?

204
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,051
So it's gone now.

205
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,971
Thanks to you, I have two lives now.

206
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,017
Including mine, you have three.

207
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,811
-Three lives?
-Yes.

208
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,770
All right.

209
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,357
Why do you look so serious?

210
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,734
-You know...
-Yeah?

211
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:13,446
Kyeong-rim and Yu-min
are coming out soon, right?

212
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,699
Are you willing to

213
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,618
share information with me?

214
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,369
-With you?
-Yeah.

215
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,581
-If the opportunity arises,
-Yeah?

216
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,499
I'd love to team up with you.

217
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,418
Let's see what game we're playing,

218
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,378
-then come find me.
-Okay.

219
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,963
Let's do it.

220
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,215
Has anyone made you any offers?

221
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,801
I've talked with ORBIT.

222
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,595
That's it.

223
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,140
I'm looking for people I can trust.

224
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,603
If I'm being honest,
I want the games to revolve

225
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,896
around those people.

226
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,736
We need to form an alliance today.

227
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,197
We lost yesterday due to alliances.

228
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,865
We can't be too obvious though.

229
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,158
Since I gave Dong-joo a Piece,

230
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,785
-she can be part of it.
-Dong-joo.

231
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,912
And ORBIT, you, and me.

232
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,623
But it has to be just us four
and no one else.

233
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,083
It's time to win ugly.

234
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,001
All right.

235
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,712
{\an8}Trying to fight fair
cost us our victory yesterday.

236
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,881
<i>Today, I'm aiming for an ugly win.</i>

237
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,512
I really need to be on my toes
and brace myself.

238
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,015
-Listen.
-Yeah?

239
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,892
See-won came up to me

240
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,187
and asked if we could share information

241
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,648
we might get from Kyeong-rim today.

242
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,401
And she said she was also going to
share it with Dong-jae.

243
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,777
I honestly don't trust them.

244
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,821
-Right. Same here.
-At least not yet.

245
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,155
-I agree.
-I don't know them well enough yet.

246
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,281
That's where I am.

247
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,783
On my part,

248
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,286
-I will trust you and Joon-bin completely.
-So I...

249
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,414
Everyone else is just extra.

250
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,667
Am I spreading myself too thin?

251
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,002
It could be ten against us two.

252
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,004
-Everyone else is on guard
-You're right.

253
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,714
against our alliance.

254
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,219
-Good luck. You can do it.
-I'll win no matter what.

255
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,179
I'm going to survive.

256
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,223
It's one against five right now.

257
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,433
They can gang up on us.

258
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,184
-That's true.
-Exactly.

259
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,311
Let's do this then.

260
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,689
You get Seok-jin to join,
and I'll get Yeon-woo to join.

261
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,983
-All right.
-Let's do that for now.

262
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,943
I was thinking the same thing.

263
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,321
{\an8}<i>Honestly, I have doubts about</i>

264
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,199
{\an8}Yeon-woo's ability as a player.

265
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,120
<i>In games like these,
you need to be able to convince others</i>

266
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:31,667
or play the role of being a game-changer
in tough situations,

267
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,920
but Yeon-woo hasn't shown
anything at all yet.

268
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,088
We have to use

269
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,467
every trick and scheme to win today.

270
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,468
Or we go home.

271
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,511
We have to survive no matter what.

272
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,221
Is someone going home today?

273
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,347
Well, yeah.

274
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,849
Those with just one Piece
could be sent home.

275
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,976
We all have only one.

276
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,644
I want to go out now.

277
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,689
It's almost game time, so I feel like
I should be doing something.

278
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,525
Someone's coming.

279
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,778
Hello.

280
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,031
Kyeong-rim and Yu-min, please step out.

281
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,199
Thank you.

282
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,244
Yu-min!

283
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,788
We made it through.

284
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,499
Great job, Yu-min.

285
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,459
-You should give this to him.
-Right.

286
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,669
"This cast puzzle box..."

287
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,796
"One Piece will be rewarded."

288
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,010
Here.

289
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,428
As your reward,

290
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,554
here is one Piece.

291
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,639
Thank you.

292
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,307
-You may walk outside.
-Thank you.

293
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,269
<i>Once I'm outside, I'm planning on</i>

294
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,814
{\an8}becoming an ambassador for prison
and telling everyone

295
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,108
{\an8}that there's a chance to win a Piece.

296
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,528
<i>I'll make sure people talk about
my time in prison.</i>

297
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,324
-Please wait a moment.
-Okay.

298
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,747
<i>The main match will begin soon.</i>

299
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,167
<i>Please gather in the game area.</i>

300
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,586
-Let's go.
-Here we go.

301
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,171
-Let's do this!
-We got this.

302
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,130
Let's go.

303
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,632
-Let's do it.
-Let's go.

304
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,342
Will the prisoners be free now?

305
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,386
Kyeong-rim is going to be free.

306
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,096
I'll go in like this.

307
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,139
-Look apologetic.
-"Sorry."

308
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,349
Hello.

309
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,350
What is that?

310
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,268
-What is that?
-What is it?

311
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,477
It's a board game.

312
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,563
What? It's a race!

313
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,819
What is it?

314
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,739
It's a game where you pick the blocks,

315
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,241
and they tell you what to do.

316
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,620
Give us tofu.

317
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,663
Oh, no, you guys.

318
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,123
Where are the dumplings?

319
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,000
-Not dumplings. Tofu.
-How was it inside?

320
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,251
-It must've been tough.
-Seriously.

321
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,545
For the crime of reporting on a terrorist,

322
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,088
I went to prison.

323
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,090
I thought I'd never be free again.

324
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,384
I'm sorry.

325
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,677
-Behind you.
-Turn around.

326
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,599
-Did it feel great sending me to prison?
-No, it didn't.

327
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,058
Don't forgive him.

328
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,852
We got bread and milk.

329
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,270
-Really?
-Really?

330
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,981
-What happened?
-They only got bread and milk.

331
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,901
-Better than nothing.
-You didn't get to wash up?

332
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,736
It must've been tough.

333
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,779
Yu-min, we still had fun, right?

334
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,907
I'm glad I was with you.

335
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,702
-Let's do better today.
-<i>Greetings.</i>

336
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,204
<i>The second main match of</i> The Devil's Plan

337
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,497
<i>-will begin now.</i>
-The main match.

338
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>Before we begin,</i>

339
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,336
<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

340
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,671
I have one. I don't need to be reminded.

341
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,426
<i>Currently, Dong-jae possesses
the most Pieces.</i>

342
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,802
He has five.

343
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,971
I guess Joon-bin gave one to Dong-joo.

344
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,348
Kyeong-rim has two.

345
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,391
-Kyeong-rim, you have two.
-She got one more.

346
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,018
Was there something in prison?

347
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>Let me introduce the second main match.</i>

348
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,317
<i>Today's main match is a Rules Race.</i>

349
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,569
-"Rules Race"?
-<i>In this game,</i>

350
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,613
<i>each player sets their own rules</i>

351
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,574
<i>and must pass the finish line first</i>

352
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,201
<i>to win the game.</i>

353
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,663
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

354
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,665
<i>these blocks will be opened
to the players.</i>

355
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,294
<i>Players may choose blocks from the pile</i>

356
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,715
<i>to make a sentence that will serve
as their personal rule for the game.</i>

357
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,886
<i>The blocks come in nine different colors.</i>

358
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,764
<i>When creating one's personal rule,</i>

359
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,309
<i>blocks of the same color
may not be used twice.</i>

360
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,894
This is tough.

361
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,313
<i>Each player's personal rule</i>

362
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,984
<i>must be made up of
a condition and an action.</i>

363
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,612
<i>The same subject
may not be used for both parts.</i>

364
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,408
<i>First, the building blocks of the sentence</i>

365
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,202
<i>must follow the rules of grammar.</i>

366
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,373
<i>Second, the sentence must specify
the recipient of the action.</i>

367
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,545
<i>In this sentence, it is unclear
which players are affected by this rule.</i>

368
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,298
<i>If aiming to affect all players,</i>

369
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,803
<i>the word "all" should be placed
in front of "players."</i>

370
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,683
<i>Third, the sentence
must not contradict itself.</i>

371
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,855
<i>Take the sentence "Players in prison
move one space backward" for example.</i>

372
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,650
<i>Players in prison may not move
before being released,</i>

373
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,404
<i>this sentence becomes contradictory.</i>

374
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,198
<i>Direct any inquiries</i>

375
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>to the dealer in the dealer room.</i>

376
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,498
<i>Players must create their personal rules
within 120 minutes.</i>

377
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,710
<i>Once the time is up,
players must register their rules</i>

378
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,046
<i>with the dealer in the dealer room.</i>

379
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,925
<i>Personal rules will not be revealed
to other players.</i>

380
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,764
<i>Only the consequences of the rules
will be announced.</i>

381
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>After all the rules have been registered,</i>

382
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,480
<i>the order of play will be determined
by the number of letters in each rule.</i>

383
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>The player with the least letters
will start first</i>

384
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,280
<i>and will proceed in ascending order.</i>

385
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,658
<i>If there are multiples of the same number,</i>

386
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,578
<i>the order will be determined
through rock, paper, scissors.</i>

387
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,746
Is it better to go first?

388
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,331
-Probably.
<i>-Once the game begins,</i>

389
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,583
<i>the first player will roll the dice</i>

390
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,504
<i>and move their piece
according to the roll of the dice.</i>

391
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,301
<i>In this game, an ordinary dice
with one "one," two "twos,"</i>

392
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,845
<i>one "three,"</i>

393
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,099
<i>"prison," and "escape" will be used.</i>

394
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,311
<i>A special dice with one "one," two "twos,"</i>

395
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:28,107
<i>and three "threes" will also be used.</i>

396
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,652
<i>Unless a special rule is being enforced,</i>

397
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,905
<i>the ordinary dice will be used.</i>

398
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,575
<i>If the ordinary dice
lands a player in prison,</i>

399
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,995
<i>they must mark their current place
on the board</i>

400
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,582
<i>and move their piece to prison.</i>

401
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,626
It's basically a deserted island.

402
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,547
<i>The player in prison
must wait for their turn</i>

403
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,007
<i>and either roll an escape</i>

404
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,510
<i>or submit an escape ticket</i>

405
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,512
<i>-to be freed from prison.</i>
-We need to avoid going to prison.

406
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,847
-Right.
-That's difficult.

407
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,308
<i>If a player successfully escapes,
they may roll the dice right away</i>

408
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,061
<i>and move their piece.</i>

409
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,065
-It'd be annoying to get prison again.
<i>-Tickets necessary for escape</i>

410
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,194
<i>may be obtained
at the four offices on the board.</i>

411
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,531
-So that's where you can get them.
-That's what they are for.

412
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,701
<i>Players who land on the offices</i>

413
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,122
<i>may choose from one of the three benefits.</i>

414
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,167
<i>One, receiving one escape ticket.</i>

415
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:34,089
<i>Two, rolling the dice once more
and moving accordingly.</i>

416
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,302
<i>Three, registering a group rule</i>

417
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,722
<i>or changing an existing group rule.</i>

418
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,557
That sounds useful.

419
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,186
<i>The group rule is a rule
that applies to all players.</i>

420
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,857
<i>Players who choose
to register a new group rule</i>

421
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,777
<i>may assemble a sentence
and register it at the offices.</i>

422
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,405
<i>Group rule phrases are separated by color</i>

423
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,325
<i>based on their characteristics.</i>

424
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,077
<i>Players must choose one phrase per color</i>

425
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,787
<i>to assemble their sentences.</i>

426
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,498
<i>If a group rule already exists,</i>

427
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,293
<i>players may add or omit phrases</i>

428
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,420
<i>to change the rule.</i>

429
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,924
<i>If a player lands on an office</i>

430
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,384
<i>not by rolling the dice</i>

431
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,428
<i>but by moving due to a certain rule,</i>

432
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,889
<i>that player does not receive any benefits.</i>

433
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,015
Only the dice counts.

434
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,061
<i>The players' personal and group rules
and the roll of the dice</i>

435
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,272
<i>determine the progress of the race.</i>

436
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,734
<i>Once all players cross the finish line,</i>

437
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,653
<i>the game ends.</i>

438
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,573
<i>Players who finish in the top three</i>

439
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,200
<i>will be rewarded with Pieces.</i>

440
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,911
<i>First place will receive three Pieces,</i>

441
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,996
<i>second place will receive two,</i>

442
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,832
<i>and third place will receive one.</i>

443
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,503
<i>Players who finish tenth to twelfth
will be penalized.</i>

444
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,505
<i>Tenth place will lose one Piece.</i>

445
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,673
Oh, no.

446
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,716
<i>-Eleventh place will lose three.</i>
-Three pieces?

447
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,762
<i>And twelfth place will lose five.</i>

448
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,639
-What?
-No way. Someone will get eliminated.

449
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,224
-We could end up in the red.
-Oh, my god.

450
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,558
-We could get sent home.
-Exactly.

451
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,312
<i>For the next 120 minutes,
use the blocks on the table</i>

452
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,107
<i>to assemble your personal rule.</i>

453
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,944
<i>Keep in mind that you may only use</i>

454
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,737
<i>one block per color.</i>

455
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,323
No way. I'm so clueless right now.

456
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,492
So we could lose five Pieces

457
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,160
but only gain three?

458
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,537
If I place tenth, I'm out.

459
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,247
This game is merciless.

460
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,498
What do I use?

461
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,126
ORBIT, do you have a winning strategy?

462
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,253
-This is all luck.
-Is it really?

463
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,796
You've changed since yesterday.

464
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,300
I really regret giving Dong-joo a Piece.

465
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,719
<i>If I hadn't, I could survive being tenth.</i>

466
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,138
I should have just looked out for myself
and not someone else.

467
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,557
Is it empty?

468
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,851
This place is special to us.

469
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,437
You're the only one I can trust.

470
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,522
No. He's the fanatic.

471
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,648
I'm counting on you.

472
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,358
-We were here yesterday.
-Right.

473
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,111
This is what I came up with.

474
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,781
There's a good chance we end up in prison.

475
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,199
{\an8}"If the leading player is imprisoned,

476
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,452
{\an8}I move to the nearest office."

477
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,704
{\an8}That's pretty good.

478
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,457
{\an8}-Going to an office is good.
-Right.

479
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,710
{\an8}There's a good chance we end up in prison.

480
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,253
{\an8}Here's the thing.

481
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
{\an8}"If one lands on an office
without rolling,

482
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,965
{\an8}they do not receive any benefits."

483
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,259
{\an8}-You're right.
-This rule can only be used to jump ahead.

484
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,344
{\an8}You're right.

485
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,846
<i>Players who land on an office</i>

486
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,641
<i>may receive an escape ticket,
roll the dice or change a group rule.</i>

487
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,853
<i>But this benefit only applies
if a player lands on an office</i>

488
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,396
<i>by rolling the dice.</i>

489
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,898
-I have a question.
-Sure.

490
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,316
For the group rule,

491
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,236
{\an8}can I make a rule that players in prison

492
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,989
{\an8}must move forward, say, two spaces?

493
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:50,285
<i>Players in prison
cannot move while imprisoned,</i>

494
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,120
<i>so this rule is contradictory.</i>

495
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,334
{\an8}"If the player in last place moves
due to a personal rule,

496
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,420
{\an8}the leading player must roll the dice
and move backward."

497
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,673
<i>Blocks of the same color may not be used.</i>

498
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,383
PERSONAL RULE

499
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,511
{\an8}"If a player
in the same spot as me rolls a two,

500
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,764
{\an8}I can move to the nearest office."

501
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:15,352
{\an8}You have to specify
what action leads to the two.

502
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,522
{\an8}-So I'd have to go with "rolls the dice."
-Yes.

503
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,566
<i>Sentences must be grammatically correct</i>

504
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,444
<i>and must explicitly state
every minute detail.</i>

505
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,614
If several players fit the bill,

506
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,574
-then it applies to them all.
-We can't be fully cooperative.

507
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,701
This is underhanded,

508
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,912
but we can produce three losers
if we really put our minds to it.

509
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,373
-There are several of us.
-It's the four of us, right?

510
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,793
If we come up with countermeasures
as an allied effort,

511
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,712
I think at least our team could survive.

512
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,965
We should make our
personal rules together.

513
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,009
<i>These are all the blocks
given to the players.</i>

514
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,346
<i>By assembling these blocks,</i>

515
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,433
<i>players can be moved forward or backward,</i>

516
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,563
<i>escape tickets can be earned or discarded,</i>

517
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,399
<i>the special dice can be used,</i>

518
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,360
<i>and players may be moved
to specific places.</i>

519
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,071
"An escape ticket is gained."

520
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,907
-Being in prison delays things, right?
-Yeah.

521
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,368
"If so and so happens,
an escape ticket is gained."

522
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,288
-Right.
-That would keep us safe.

523
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,581
The "discard ticket" block.

524
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,916
We can discard someone's ticket, right?

525
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,210
-Locking them up would be best.
-Okay.

526
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,087
When does the group rule activate?

527
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,589
When conditions are met.

528
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,759
{\an8}<i>Either "on one's turn"
or "anytime" if in prison.</i>

529
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,386
{\an8}<i>"Pay one Piece" is also up there.</i>

530
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,722
That could be good for us.

531
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,973
-You're right.
-"Pay one Piece."

532
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,224
Others can't use that.

533
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,395
<i>Personal rules and group rules</i>

534
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,231
<i>are the pillars of the rules race.</i>

535
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,776
<i>As the group rule affects all players,</i>

536
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,487
<i>they have more power
over the flow of the game.</i>

537
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,366
<i>Anyone can change
the group rule at the offices.</i>

538
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,744
<i>Finding a group rule that fits</i>

539
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,537
<i>with one's personal rule</i>

540
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,414
<i>and using that rule appropriately</i>

541
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,083
<i>will bring a player closer to victory.</i>

542
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,753
I think working together
to make useful group rules will be key.

543
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,255
Why don't we bring in
as many people as possible?

544
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,965
An alliance of one-Piece players.

545
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,383
That's a sure win, isn't it?

546
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,802
I'll talk to Yu-min.

547
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,180
-Did you talk to Seungkwan?
-I talked to him but I need to check.

548
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,308
-I'll talk to Seungkwan again.
-That makes five of us, right?

549
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,269
-Kyeong-rim might be open to joining us.
-Yeah, for sure.

550
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,521
Let's move as a six-person alliance

551
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,899
and discuss how to
approach the group rule.

552
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,567
That will give us a good chance.

553
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,568
<i>The small alliance</i>

554
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,572
will probably come up with a strategy
to take control of the group rule.

555
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,451
But I don't think they'll stand a chance
if we overwhelm them with our numbers.

556
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,955
{\an8}I think Dong-jae and See-won are in danger

557
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,458
<i>of being eliminated in this game</i>

558
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,961
because they formed such a small alliance.

559
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,004
-Kyeong-rim.
-Yeah?

560
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,006
-So...
-Yeah?

561
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,802
Joon-bin, ORBIT, Seungkwan, and I
are working together.

562
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,012
We want you to join us.

563
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,224
You can create
your personal rule in any way

564
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,809
that benefits you.

565
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,062
But when it comes to
making the group rule,

566
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,189
we want to make it so that none of us

567
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,858
end up finishing last.

568
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,026
We're trying to raise our chances.

569
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,320
-It's a matter of probability.
-It is.

570
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,823
While you were gone,

571
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,243
Dong-jae and See-won
formed a strong alliance,

572
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,829
and the others are desperate for Pieces.

573
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,873
We're an alliance of desperate people.

574
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,042
It's basically an alliance
of the underdogs.

575
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,545
<i>The group somehow naturally formed.</i>

576
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,672
<i>And the goal of the underdogs</i>

577
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,216
is not to finish in tenth,
eleventh, or twelfth place.

578
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,469
Have you made a sentence yet?

579
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,179
It's tough.

580
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,848
What's the situation right now?

581
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,102
It's mostly every man for himself.

582
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,479
-This is what I thought of.
-Yeah?

583
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,564
I only have one Piece.

584
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,942
If I finish in twelfth,
eleventh, or tenth place,

585
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,110
-I'm done.
-Right.

586
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,447
Yeon-woo is on their side, right?

587
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,656
They're roommates.

588
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,116
That's right.

589
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,743
That makes sense.

590
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,537
-Yeon-woo?
-Yeah?

591
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,705
-You have anything?
-Sorry?

592
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,415
Are you two working together?

593
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,584
-We'll be helping each other.
-We're talking.

594
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,752
-Right.
-Yeah.

595
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,086
Aren't you in an alliance?

596
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,839
-It seems like you are.
-No, not really. I...

597
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,051
-Aren't you on See-won's side?
-I am.

598
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,552
But See-won is with Dong-jae.

599
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,430
{\an8}See-won and I are in an alliance,

600
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,140
but she has more Pieces.

601
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:26,102
<i>So there is a tight alliance between
the two that have a lot of Pieces.</i>

602
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,146
Look at them.

603
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,148
They're coming up with a plan.

604
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,816
As someone with one Piece,

605
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,152
<i>it's hard for me to fit in with them.</i>

606
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:38,031
So I had to find an alliance for myself.
That's why I approached them.

607
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,283
The losing players have to stick together

608
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,036
and try to fight for our survival

609
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,287
by working together.

610
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,955
If we have decided to form an alliance,

611
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,749
-I think we should share what we have.
-Okay.

612
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,336
Let's go to the kitchen.

613
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:59,260
<i>I've thought about this all morning,</i>

614
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,765
{\an8}but we're a minority
going against the majority.

615
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,770
I'm not sure how we're going to
overcome this problem.

616
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,816
Someone could go to prison
without rolling the dice, right?

617
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,443
Yes, someone's personal rule
can send them there.

618
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,113
<i>I'm trying to see</i>

619
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,657
{\an8}how I can utilize my personal rule

620
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,450
if that happens
to affect the entire group.

621
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,161
I have a solution.

622
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,375
This is the strategy.

623
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,170
-Let's see.
-After a certain condition is met,

624
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,965
"all players move to prison."

625
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,926
And if one of us has an escape ticket
after we've played this move,

626
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,805
all 12 of us
could start the game in prison.

627
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,392
<i>ORBIT's plan is to imprison
all the players</i>

628
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:51,312
<i>and only have those on his side escape.</i>

629
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,566
That's a good idea.

630
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,568
So everyone goes to prison

631
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,612
and we just aim to get escape tickets.

632
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,197
The question is, who will be the troll?

633
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,325
That person has to go to prison
after sending everyone else.

634
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,078
That means I need to include
"gain an escape ticket."

635
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:11,332
<i>For the plan to send all players
to prison to work,</i>

636
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,837
<i>the members of the alliance
need a way to get escape tickets.</i>

637
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,507
If we do this, I have no chance of
finishing in the top three.

638
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,886
I want to help others finish ahead

639
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,722
<i>while I keep the rest pinned down.</i>

640
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,767
Hello.

641
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,438
{\an8}"If the leading player
moves due to a personal rule..."

642
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,814
{\an8}-With this condition,
-Yes?

643
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,609
{\an8}even if one's personal rule is sending
a player to prison, they still move.

644
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,777
{\an8}-That's right.
-Okay.

645
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,737
I'll give you this.

646
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,530
-What is this?
-Give me yours.

647
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,823
{\an8}You use this.

648
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,450
{\an8}Mine is,

649
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:49,037
{\an8}"All players go to prison
if the leading player rolls a two."

650
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,539
{\an8}As soon as that happens,
you gain an escape ticket.

651
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,457
{\an8}Got it?

652
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,792
-Why?
-Change yours to this.

653
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,711
{\an8}"If the leading player
moves due to a personal rule..."

654
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,215
{\an8}If you do, you can gain an escape ticket.

655
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,093
<i>ORBIT has decided to
sacrifice himself for the team.</i>

656
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,096
If needed, we can save him later

657
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,140
since there are a lot of us.

658
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,436
What are you going to do?
Are you going to join forces?

659
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,188
-Us? We'd like to join.
-Okay.

660
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,940
That'll raise our chances of survival.

661
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,483
That's right.

662
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,486
<i>At first, I thought of being neutral</i>

663
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,239
{\an8}but after hearing
Kyeong-rim's experience of being one...

664
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,241
{\an8}I realized I need a team.

665
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,827
It's four against eight.

666
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,246
I think those with two or more Pieces

667
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:32,956
should talk.

668
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,917
Seok-jin, come sit with us.

669
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,585
The two or more Pieces club.

670
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,632
<i>I have a feeling ORBIT
will convince the masses</i>

671
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,176
and control the flow
of the game, yet again.

672
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,261
Scientifically, of course.

673
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,305
You all went with gaining an escape ticket
for the action phrase, right?

674
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,143
It looks like most of you
are trying to get escape tickets.

675
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,895
-Seok-jin, what's your rule?
-We have to consider prison.

676
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,023
<i>They seem to be playing it safe.</i>

677
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,358
And those who are doing so

678
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,237
will try to gain escape tickets.

679
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,573
Did you find out anything?

680
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,617
Most of them are trying to
gain escape tickets.

681
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,496
<i>Personal rule registration
ends in ten minutes.</i>

682
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,666
-What's your plan?
-Honestly,

683
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,919
this may or may not work.

684
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,797
We need the right rolls,
and I think we will.

685
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,554
Wait, I can't use this.

686
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,518
<i>Take a look at the green blocks.</i>

687
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,563
<i>The "player" block
used in the condition part</i>

688
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,482
<i>is essential for the rule to function.</i>

689
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,527
<i>The "all" block, which is also green,</i>

690
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,696
<i>could not be used in the first place.</i>

691
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,366
-We're in trouble.
-Are we good?

692
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,576
-Not at all.
-Why?

693
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,077
-The colors overlap.
-Really?

694
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,496
We wanted everyone to go to prison, right?

695
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,374
-That's not possible? But we need that.
-We need to go help him.

696
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,501
We need the "player" block,
but they only have it in green.

697
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,046
-This is green.
-Then we can't do this.

698
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,048
If it's not "all," then it's meaningless.

699
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:09,093
I hadn't realized the "all" block
couldn't be used.

700
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,136
<i>It was a trap.</i>

701
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,847
Our near-perfect plan

702
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,724
was about to collapse.

703
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,560
There's a problem with our plan.

704
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,396
-The colors overlap.
-Then what do we do?

705
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,689
Let me say this.

706
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,816
We could be doomed.

707
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,486
-There's no winning strategy here.
-There are too many variables.

708
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,613
What's going on?

709
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,074
-No!
-Why?

710
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,325
Cover it up!

711
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,743
Can't I look?

712
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,828
Dong-jae, our rules don't work.

713
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,456
We couldn't come up with a rule
because the colors overlapped.

714
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,666
-Let's go.
-Hang on.

715
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,334
-Are you sure about this?
-Yeah.

716
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,294
<i>If we know the condition
that triggers their rule,</i>

717
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,005
<i>we can make a plan to avoid it.</i>

718
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,257
So I thought it'd be
useful to know in advance.

719
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,011
Dong-jae, I'm changing mine again.

720
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,304
-Really?
-Yeah.

721
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,472
They told you to?

722
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,516
-They said
-Did they say something?

723
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,395
the probability
of everyone going to prison

724
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,480
is too low.

725
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,524
<i>Hye-sung told me that</i>

726
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,319
she had to change her rule
because those on her team said

727
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,030
it might be difficult
to enforce their rule.

728
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,283
<i>Having heard that,
I realized they would have</i>

729
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,120
<i>a hard time gaining escape tickets.</i>

730
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,414
We need them in prison.

731
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,083
They're all planning to escape.

732
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,626
I bet that's what everyone's going with.

733
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,879
No, they all changed their plan.

734
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,965
Hye-sung told me that

735
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,676
they weren't going through
with their plan.

736
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,429
That's why I'm trying to
send them to prison.

737
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,597
We have to send them to prison

738
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,641
and delay their progress.

739
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,603
Dong-jae, come here.
I think I have a decent plan.

740
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,605
Seok-jin.

741
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,774
Right now,

742
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,778
we can cover the group rule
with our personal rules.

743
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,113
I don't understand.

744
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,406
In other words...

745
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,532
<i>Our strategy</i>

746
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,367
<i>is having the leading player move</i>

747
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,246
<i>due to either personal rules
or the group rule.</i>

748
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,957
We'll make use
of the personal and group rules

749
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,210
to send the losing players to prison.

750
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,920
-We have a lot of Pieces.
-Right.

751
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,006
Even if we get sent to prison,

752
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,674
{\an8}we can modify the group rule to escape.

753
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,176
{\an8}-"Pay one piece,"
-Right.

754
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,261
{\an8}Then "gain an escape ticket."

755
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,598
We'll be leveraging their lack of Pieces
to pressure them.

756
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,267
<i>The time has expired.</i>

757
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,854
<i>Please enter the dealer room one by one</i>

00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,598
Rock, paper, scissors.

790
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,184
Rock, paper, scissors.

791
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,310
Rock, paper, scissors.

792
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,520
Rock, paper, scissors.

793
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,564
-You secured a good turn.
-I know, right?

794
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,357
I have the longest character count
on purpose.

795
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,819
The remaining five players,
please play rock, paper, scissors.

796
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,739
Should we go in a row or spread out?

797
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,074
We can send Seungkwan

798
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,450
either forward or backward.

799
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,785
-If we're going to send him forward,
-Right.

800
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,705
we need to play the same thing.

801
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,290
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
-Shoot!

802
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,041
Neat, right?

803
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,378
<i>The order has been determined.</i>

804
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,006
Everyone, let's have fun!

805
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,675
Let's go!

806
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,094
<i>Hye-sung, the first player,</i>

807
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,804
-<i>will start the game.</i>
-Okay.

808
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,931
Hye-sung, please roll the dice.

809
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,891
Here I go.

810
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:25,933
-Don't be nervous.
-You got this.

811
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,019
Prison.

812
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,103
Prison.

813
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,481
-Hye-sung moves two spaces.
-Great.

814
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,066
Yes! Let's go, Hye-sung.

815
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,152
Yeon-woo, please roll the dice.

816
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,321
I expect the pro Go player to roll well.

817
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,822
{\an8}-Okay.
-Escape.

818
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,032
{\an8}Nothing happens.

819
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,033
{\an8}-It's all right.
-Nothing.

820
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,911
Dong-joo, please roll the dice.

821
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,455
Just don't go to prison.

822
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,791
-Okay.
-Nice.

823
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,835
-Dong-joo moves one space.
-You're moving forward.

824
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,254
-I know how to not get prison.
-Joon-bin, show us how it's done.

825
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,131
Joon-bin, please roll the dice.

826
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,926
KWAK JOON-BIN, 2

827
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,844
-You never know what to expect.
-See? I'm not going to prison.

828
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,055
Kyeong-rim, please roll the dice.

829
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,265
-You got this.
-Let's go.

830
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,310
-Oh, no, Kyeong-rim.
-I'm going to prison again.

831
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,646
-It could be a good thing.
-Kyeong-rim moves to prison.

832
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,439
This might be good.

833
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,441
You and prison.

834
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:17,860
Yu-min.

835
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,403
-You got this.
-You got this.

836
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,450
{\an8}SUH YU-MIN, 3

837
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,285
-That was a one-in-six chance.
-Okay.

838
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,870
Same for Kyeong-rim.

839
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,830
-It's fine.
-Don't say that.

840
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,040
-Seungkwan.
-Oh, right.

841
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,291
Please roll the dice.

842
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,334
Let's go.

843
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,420
-Yes!
-Good job.

844
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,630
-We're together.
-Good job.

845
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,882
-Good job.
-Seungkwan, you move two spaces.

846
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,969
-You got this. Just don't go to prison.
-I got this.

847
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,512
Anything but prison.

848
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,348
I'm sorry but I think
it's going to be prison.

849
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,641
He's wearing prison clothes right now.

850
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,810
{\an8}GUILLAUME, 2

851
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,937
-Let's go, Guillaume.
-He's built for these games.

852
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,480
-You did well.
-Nice.

853
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,815
-You move two spaces.
-Good job.

854
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,233
So many people are there.

855
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,192
I'm sweating.

856
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,360
-Yes!
-I'm stressed.

857
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,904
-It's looking good so far.
-Dong-jae, please roll the dice.

858
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,827
{\an8}KIM DONG-JAE, 2

859
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,287
{\an8}A lot of people are rolling two.

860
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,538
Five people are at two.

861
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,248
No one's getting prison.

862
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,958
One did.

863
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,835
Well, not more people.

864
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,169
The odds are one-in-six.

865
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,588
The odds are one-in-six.

866
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,550
{\an8}-Prison.
-Welcome to prison.

867
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,635
"Welcome to prison."

868
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,679
As your senior in prison...

869
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,097
That was a one-in-six chance.

870
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,808
See-won moves to prison.

871
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,101
Try to get a Piece there.

872
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,562
{\an8}-Seok-jin rolled a two.
-That's a lot of twos.

873
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,896
{\an8}Seok-jin moves two spaces.

874
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,773
-ORBIT, please roll the dice.
-You got this.

875
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,693
{\an8}-One.
-Good job.

876
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,361
{\an8}-That's good.
-At least I got one.

877
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,368
-Hye-sung's turn.
-Please roll the dice again.

878
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,328
Okay.

879
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,330
{\an8}Nice!

880
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,748
{\an8}-Two.
-Well done!

881
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,915
{\an8}-Good job!
-Nice!

882
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,417
{\an8}Nice!

883
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,919
{\an8}-Nice, Hye-sung.
-You have landed on an office.

884
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,838
Which benefit will you choose?

885
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,506
I want to set a group rule.

886
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,675
Please register a group rule.

887
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,805
{\an8}"During their turn,

888
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,099
{\an8}all players may give up rolling the dice

889
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:17,146
{\an8}and transfer their escape ticket
to a player of their choice."

890
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,315
Okay.

891
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,400
-A game-changer.
-A group rule has been created.

892
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,902
Does someone already have a ticket?

893
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,945
Yeon-woo, please roll the dice.

894
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,908
-Okay.
-Escape!

895
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,909
-Okay.
-Escape!

896
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,702
-Wait...
-Nothing happens.

897
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,329
She's so happy.

898
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,663
Why do you keep escaping?

899
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,623
Dong-joo.

900
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,957
-Okay.
-One.

901
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,460
-Joon-bin, three.
-Okay!

902
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,461
Okay.

903
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,632
{\an8}Two. Kyeong-rim fails to escape prison.

904
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,549
Yu-min.

905
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,510
{\an8}SUH YU-MIN, 3

906
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,844
{\an8}-Another three?
-Nice.

907
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:49,970
Seungkwan.

908
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,222
I'll listen to the reactions.

909
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,974
{\an8}-Seungkwan...
-Goodbye.

910
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,311
-Prison.
-So many are imprisoning themselves.

911
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,646
-Next, Guillaume.
-Yes.

912
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,772
Please roll the dice.

913
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,109
{\an8}GUILLAUME, 2

914
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,068
{\an8}-Two.
-Nice roll.

915
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,820
-He's good.
-Ready?

916
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,737
-Hey.
-You moved two spaces

917
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,948
{\an8}and landed on an office.

918
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,658
{\an8}Which benefit will you choose?

919
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,326
Should I pay a Piece

920
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,954
and escape prison
so we can send them to prison?

921
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,872
If you do that, you could be in danger.

922
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,541
Eleventh place loses three Pieces.

923
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,085
-Let's go with what we can use right now.
-Okay.

924
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,253
I'll change the group rule.

925
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,255
{\an8}"During their turn,

926
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:28,050
{\an8}all players may pay one Piece

927
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:32,430
{\an8}and move to the space of the player
in front of them."

928
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,849
-Good.
-It's good for people with several Pieces.

929
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,184
{\an8}-The group rule has changed.
-Nice one.

930
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,437
-Dong-jae, please roll the dice.
-Okay.

931
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,065
{\an8}-Prison.
-Welcome.

932
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,235
{\an8}-Welcome to prison.
-Dong-jae moves to prison.

933
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,404
See-won, please roll the dice.

934
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,740
Could the dice be thrown
so that it falls straight down?

935
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,908
That is unclear.

936
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,077
Thank you.

937
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,287
That wouldn't be a roll.

938
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,455
Right. Go ahead.

939
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,206
Fall straight down.

940
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,374
It won't work.

941
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,586
{\an8}-One.
-You have failed to escape prison.

942
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,504
Seok-jin, please roll the dice.

943
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,340
{\an8}HA SEOK-JIN, 3

944
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,551
You roll it and walk off
in such a cool way.

945
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,969
Seok-jin moves three spaces.

946
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,179
Let's go.

947
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,305
Next, ORBIT.

948
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,807
{\an8}-One.
-Nice.

949
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,142
{\an8}-Take it slow.
-You move one space.

950
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,685
{\an8}-Take your time.
-Take it slow.

951
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,312
When do they tell us what happens

952
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,731
because of the personal rules?

953
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,107
-That's automatic.
-It's automatic.

954
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,192
It happens on its own.

955
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,319
-It's automatic.
-No rule has taken effect yet.

956
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,279
{\an8}Not a single rule out of the twelve?

957
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,574
<i>Currently, the dice
has been rolled 24 times</i>

958
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,035
<i>and the group rule has changed twice,</i>

959
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,954
<i>yet no personal rule has been triggered.</i>

960
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,290
-Here I go.
-Hye-sung, please roll the dice.

961
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,249
You got this.

962
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,211
{\an8}-Prison.
-Oh, no!

963
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,128
{\an8}So many people are in prison.

964
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,756
-It's overcrowded.
-It's the hot spot around here.

965
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,090
Is it a good spot for pictures?

966
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,385
-It's great for photos.
-It is.

967
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,345
Next, Yeon-woo.

968
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,472
I just want to roll a number.

969
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,640
Please roll the dice.

970
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,976
{\an8}-Again?
-Prison.

971
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,103
{\an8}-Seriously?
-This is the worst.

972
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,189
-Yeon-woo moves to prison.
-This is the worst.

973
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,150
-She got two escapes, and...
-She rolled escape, escape, then prison.

974
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,568
That's hell.

975
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,362
{\an8}-Just escape next time.
-Tell me about it.

976
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,072
{\an8}-How is this possible?
-How?

977
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,240
Next, Dong-joo.

978
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,285
{\an8}SUH DONG-JOO, 2

979
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,203
{\an8}-Good job.
-Let's change.

980
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,871
{\an8}-What should we do?
-Do this.

981
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,457
{\an8}-Which benefit will you choose?
-Give us a second.

982
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,917
Let me think.

983
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,585
I don't think you need to change it.

984
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,795
-Really?
-Get an escape ticket.

985
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,548
I'll just take an escape ticket.

986
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,259
Dong-joo gains one escape ticket.

987
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,385
Next, Joon-bin.

988
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,929
{\an8}-Prison.
-It was about time.

989
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,764
{\an8}I knew it.

990
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,392
How can so many be in prison?

991
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,394
-I want to escape!
-Let's go.

992
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,271
-Let me roll escape!
-Let's go.

993
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,277
You made it out.

994
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,112
Kyeong-rim!

995
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,990
-It feels like such a big win.
-Even I'm happy.

996
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:56,907
Nice escape.

997
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,869
{\an8}Dong-joo, due to your personal rule,
you gain one escape ticket.

998
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,330
-Yes!
-Congratulations!

999
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,373
So when someone escapes.

1000
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,874
Your personal rule!

1001
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,751
This is great.

1002
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,669
Change yours to this.

1003
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,589
{\an8}"If the leading player
moves due to a personal rule..."

1004
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,757
{\an8}Change it like this.

1005
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,883
{\an8}It's the same as mine.

1006
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,176
{\an8}We don't gain much from this.

1007
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,553
{\an8}Which one?

1008
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,597
{\an8}-That was mine.
-We get one for every escape.

1009
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,308
{\an8}You get an escape ticket
whenever someone escapes prison.

1010
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,145
"If someone escapes prison,

1011
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,315
I gain one escape ticket."

1012
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,442
<i>Dong-joo's plan was something</i>

1013
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,570
I had thought of alone.

1014
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:38,490
<i>She can gain
a lot of escape tickets this way.</i>

1015
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,950
This means no prison for us.

1016
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,244
We made a mistake.

1017
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,329
Why?

1018
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,039
<i>Until round three, I was uncertain.</i>

1019
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,000
I assumed no rules were triggered
as we had just started.

1020
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:52,004
<i>But observing how
the first three rounds went,</i>

1021
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,633
<i>I realized no one had a personal rule</i>

1022
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,886
about forcing the leading player to move.

1023
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,431
<i>If the other players don't have any
"move" blocks in the personal rules,</i>

1024
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,142
<i>their team's personal rules
do not get triggered.</i>

1025
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,852
"I"

1026
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,270
"Gain one."

1027
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,772
"Gain one."

1028
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,731
"Escape ticket."

1029
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,733
"I gain one escape ticket."

1030
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,276
"I gain one escape ticket."

1031
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,029
Someone had to include
movement in their rule

1032
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,782
for our personal rules to get triggered,

1033
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,867
but we all did the same thing.

1034
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,744
Why did we realize this just now?

1035
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,953
-Next, Guillaume.
-Guillaume.

1036
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,538
-Please roll the dice.
-Go ahead.

1037
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,044
{\an8}I should be happier for her
if she rolls an escape.

1038
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,379
Seok-jin,

1039
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,588
please roll the dice.

1040
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,925
{\an8}-Three.
-He's going to an office.

1041
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,593
{\an8}You have landed on an office.

1042
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,886
{\an8}-That's great.
-Not yet.

1043
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,929
{\an8}-Which benefit will you choose?
-What do we do?

1044
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,056
Let's talk about this.

1045
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,641
{\an8}We need to transfer tickets.

1046
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,726
{\an8}-Now?
-Or should we wait?

1047
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,896
Almost everyone is in prison
so use this chance

1048
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,398
to roll the special dice.

1049
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,817
{\an8}Change the last block to
"may roll the special dice"

1050
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,944
so you can finish as quickly as possible.

1051
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,946
Even if you have to pay a Piece,

1052
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,448
it's an advantage for you
to roll the special dice.

1053
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,742
{\an8}I would like to change the green block

1054
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,412
{\an8}to "can roll the special dice."

1055
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,747
ORBIT, please roll the dice.

1056
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:16,922
Next, Yu-min.

1057
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,090
-You got this, Yu-min.
-You got this.

1058
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,633
-Good luck.
-Let's go.

1059
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:21,969
Two.

1060
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,303
Two.

1061
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,430
{\an8}-That's it!
-Good one.

1062
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,348
{\an8}-Nice.
-Nice.

1063
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,891
{\an8}Go ahead.

1064
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,435
{\an8}You have landed on an office.

1065
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,311
Will you change the group rule?

1066
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,729
Yes, I will.

1067
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,065
There's a problem with our plan.

1068
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,943
-The colors overlap.
-Then what do we do?

1069
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,070
I'll try my best to imprison them.

1070
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,449
We have to take the lead
and take charge of the group rule.

1071
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,326
The first person to land on an office

1072
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,913
should choose
the first, last, and third blocks.

1073
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,625
{\an8}<i>Make a rule with
the first, last, and third blocks.</i>

1074
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,170
So we can create an advantage? Okay.

1075
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,713
"During their turn,

1076
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,424
{\an8}all players may give up rolling the dice

1077
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:04,845
{\an8}and give their escape ticket
to a player of their choice."

1078
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,472
Let's go.

1079
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,681
Dong-jae, please roll the dice.

1080
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,516
Stay in prison a little longer.

1081
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,809
I think I've had enough.

1082
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,061
{\an8}-Escape.
-Nice.

1083
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,105
{\an8}-Dong-jae, you have escaped prison.
-Roll again.

1084
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,356
-Oh, right.
-Roll again.

1085
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,193
Dong-joo, you have gained an escape ticket
due to your personal rule.

1086
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,444
-Okay.
-Nice.

1087
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,739
-Two spaces.
-Two. Nice.

1088
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,074
KIM DONG-JAE, 2

1089
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,118
I think we can
use the "gain one" block now.

1090
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,078
-By paying one Piece?
-Yeah.

1091
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,955
-Since we have only four players...
-Sure, if we can afford it.

1092
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,041
-If you don't want to be tied down...
-I'll pay then.

1093
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,292
-Use it when you can.
-I'll pay.

1094
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,877
I'd like to change the group rule.

1095
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,214
{\an8}"During their turn,
all players may pay one Piece

1096
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,049
{\an8}and gain an escape ticket."

1097
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,176
I will pay one Piece,

1098
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,053
receive an escape ticket,

1099
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,221
and escape prison.

1100
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,516
<i>Pieces are important
but I need to survive for now.</i>

1101
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,728
So I thought it was right to
spend my Piece in that situation.

1102
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:55,938
Must be nice having a lot of Pieces.

1103
00:46:56,813 --> 00:47:00,025
-I'm so jealous.
-She's too close to the starting line.

1104
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,777
Here is your escape ticket.

1105
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,153
I will use this to escape.

1106
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,696
Just a moment.

1107
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,740
Dong-joo, Seungkwan,

1108
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:10,577
and Seok-jin all gain an escape ticket
due to your personal rules.

1109
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,330
You and Seok-jin must share the same rule.

1110
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,915
Do I need to use that rule?

1111
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:15,832
You don't have to.

1112
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,419
{\an8}I went with gaining an escape ticket
if someone uses theirs to escape prison.

1113
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,462
{\an8}That's not bad.

1114
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,922
{\an8}I had to be safe.

1115
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,465
{\an8}-I'm the weakest.
-All right.

1116
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,050
<i>-"If a player in prison

{\an8}Here is your ticket.

1120
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,308
You two have the same rule.

1121
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,311
See-won, please roll the dice.

1122
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,231
{\an8}One.

1123
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,275
{\an8}See-won, you move one space.

1124
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,199
Next, Dong-joo.

1125
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,576
What's our plan?

1126
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,952
We should free Joon-bin.

1127
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,829
-I'd have to pay a Piece.
-You can't.

1128
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,163
{\an8}-Oh, it changed.
-It changed.

1129
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,123
{\an8}-I see.
-She can't.

1130
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,167
{\an8}-You want me to get eliminated?
-No, go ahead.

1131
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,753
{\an8}-Two. Good job
-Okay.

1132
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,006
{\an8}-Good job.
-You're leading the pack.

1133
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,674
{\an8}-You're first.
-The leading player.

1134
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,800
{\an8}Next, Kyeong-rim.

1135
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,303
{\an8}Two.

1136
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,306
{\an8}-Nice.
-You have landed on an office.

1137
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,974
-Change the rule back?
-Wait.

1138
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,559
We have enough tickets so change it back.

1139
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,519
-We have to get Joon-bin out.
-Let's get everyone out.

1140
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,771
You need to escape and move.

1141
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,106
I'll change the group rule.

1142
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:25,360
{\an8}"During their turn,
all players may give up rolling the dice

1143
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:30,198
{\an8}and transfer their escape ticket
to a player of their choice."

1144
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,241
Next, Seungkwan.

1145
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,409
I'd like to use my escape ticket.

1146
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,202
-You get another one, so it's fine.
-Please hand it to me.

1147
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,495
You have escaped prison.

1148
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,164
{\an8}It's fine if Seok-jin gets one.

1149
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,540
{\an8}Here is your escape ticket.

1150
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,667
{\an8}-Dong-joo, here is your escape ticket.
-Thank you.

1151
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,502
-Goodness me.
-You keep getting tickets.

1152
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,338
-For the first time...
-Wait a minute.

1153
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,505
You can give up your roll.

1154
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,673
-Give it up.
-Give it up and help Joon-bin.

1155
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,758
All right.

1156
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,217
Wait a minute.

1157
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:53,305
-We need to maximize our dice rolls.
-Right. That way we land on the offices.

1158
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,516
-The starting order is Hye-sung...
-Yeon-woo.

1159
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,144
Escape, then give an escape ticket
to someone else.

1160
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,604
-Okay? Understood?
-Okay.

1161
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,649
I'd like to
transfer my ticket to Hye-sung.

1162
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,276
{\an8}-Please transfer your ticket.
-This way all three of you can live.

1163
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,029
<i>We're doomed.</i>

1164
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:13,158
Now we can only survive
with the group rule.

1165
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,702
{\an8}Guillaume, you have rolled escape.

1166
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,953
{\an8}Nothing happens.

1167
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,081
{\an8}Next, Dong-jae moves one space.

1168
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,791
{\an8}Next, See-won rolls escape.

1169
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,334
{\an8}Nothing happens.

1170
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,002
{\an8}Next, Seok-jin rolls escape.

1171
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,004
{\an8}-Congratulations.
-Nothing happens.

1172
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,631
-Next, ORBIT.
-You got this.

1173
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,758
{\an8}-Nice.
-Two.

1174
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,927
-When did you get to first?
-Dong-joo.

1175
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,178
He's leading now.

1176
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,305
Lucky you.

1177
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,306
Next, Hye-sung.

1178
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,350
I'd like to use my escape ticket.

1179
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,769
Hye-sung escapes prison.

1180
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,146
{\an8}Dong-joo, Seok-jin, and Seungkwan.

1181
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,315
{\an8}You each receive tickets
due to your personal rules.

1182
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,316
Okay, great.

1183
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,693
Please roll the dice.

1184
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,194
Fly like a comet.

1185
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,278
-Let's do this.
-You got this.

1186
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,780
That's it!

1187
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:52,989
Let's go!

1188
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,324
-I'm jealous.
-You move three spaces.

1189
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,867
-Great job.
-Great job.

1190
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,536
-Is it Yeon-woo?
-Next, Yeon-woo.

1191
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,954
-Time to escape.
-I have to.

1192
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,706
-You do.
-The odds are with you.

1193
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,125
{\an8}-We'll get you out if needed.
-This is going to be the game-changer.

1194
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,130
{\an8}CHO YEON-WOO, 3

1195
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,840
-You have failed to escape.
-It's okay.

1196
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,550
-I'll free you.
-What do I do?

1197
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,718
-Dong-joo.
-Yes?

1198
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,928
Who do we free?
I think it should be Joon-bin.

1199
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,055
Free Joon-bin so he can play his turn.

1200
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,598
What about Yeon-woo?

1201
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,560
{\an8}CHO YEON-WOO

1202
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,937
How could the gods forsake me like this?

1203
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,647
-I'll use my ticket.
-Please hand it to me.

1204
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,941
Joon-bin, you have escaped prison.

1205
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,818
{\an8}Due to their personal rules,
the same three

1206
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,987
{\an8}-receive escape tickets again.
-Thank you.

1207
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,697
Joon-bin, please roll the dice.

1208
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,741
-That was the worst.
-Go that way.

1209
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,076
-Escape.
-What a shame.

1210
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,994
-Nothing happens.
-Can't he escape?

1211
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:39,911
-He already escaped.
-He's out.

1212
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,329
-When?
-Just now.

1213
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,082
-Show your teammate some love.
-I got an early release.

1214
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,500
-I'm sorry.
-Kyeong-rim.

1215
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,296
{\an8}Two. You move two spaces.

1216
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,297
Yu-min.

1217
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,508
-Three.
-Nice.

1218
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,634
You have landed on an office.

1219
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,719
-What do I do?
-Get an escape ticket.

1220
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,471
-Yeah, get one.
-I'll get one.

1221
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,890
{\an8}-I'd like an escape ticket.
-It's the safe choice.

1222
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,141
Should I free Yeon-woo?

1223
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,143
Isn't it better to just roll?

1224
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,144
She's too far back.

1225
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,021
-Seungkwan's behind as well.
-He's at risk too.

1226
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,272
He's also lagging.

1227
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,690
-I'm fine.
-What do you want to do?

1228
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,109
-It's your decision.
-You decide.

1229
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,903
I'm going to use a ticket
to free Yeon-woo.

1230
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,654
-Do you give up rolling?
-Yes.

1231
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,990
Please transfer your ticket.

1232
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,784
{\an8}-I won't forget this.
-It's nothing.

1233
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,327
{\an8}-How nice of him.
-Thank you.

1234
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,620
{\an8}Let's all be free.

1235
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,372
<i>Due to Dong-joo and Seungkwan's
personal rules,</i>

1236
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,792
<i>the team procured a lot of escape tickets.</i>

1237
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:28,835
<i>However,</i>

1238
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,964
<i>Seungkwan loses his chance to move
every time he transfers his ticket.</i>

1239
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,636
Honestly, two of us are being sacrificed,

1240
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,179
but that's our strategy.

1241
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,597
Next, Guillaume.

1242
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,890
-One.
-One.

1243
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:42,933
One.

1244
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,811
{\an8}-Escape.
-Escape.

1245
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,145
Nothing happens.

1246
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,063
Okay.

1247
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,273
{\an8}One.

1248
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,902
Dong-jae moves one space.
See-won, please roll the dice.

1249
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,823
{\an8}-Three.
-Okay.

1250
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,032
{\an8}-Nice.
-Nice!

1251
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,075
{\an8}I did it.

1252
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,619
You have landed on an office.
Which benefit will you choose?

1253
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,371
-How many tickets do you have?
-Four.

1254
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,539
-Four?
-Four?

1255
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,416
-Then use a Piece... No.
-No, don't do that.

1256
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,669
We can discard a ticket
and transfer one to someone else.

1257
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,004
-Wait. Do what with the ticket?
-That's a good one.

1258
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,631
We can discard a ticket
and transfer one to someone else.

1259
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,342
<i>The "discard ticket" block</i>

1260
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,637
<i>allows players to keep their Piece
and their turn.</i>

1261
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,182
I'm changing the group rule to

1262
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,352
{\an8}"During their turn,
all players may discard an escape ticket

1263
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:31,898
{\an8}and transfer an escape ticket
to a player of their choice."

1264
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,775
-We would like to use that.
-Okay.

1265
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,735
-Go ahead.
-I'm going to discard a ticket

1266
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,445
{\an8}and transfer one to Guillaume.

1267
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,738
{\an8}-Thank you.
-Okay.

1268
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,907
-I still have my turn, right?
-Yeah, you do.

1269
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,367
Please roll the dice.

1270
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,161
{\an8}-Okay!
-Three.

1271
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,288
-That's good.
-Nice.

1272
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,540
-We can change the group rule again.
-Change again.

1273
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,834
-Seok-jin's on a roll right now.
-He's good.

1274
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,419
I'm changing the group rule.

1275
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,672
{\an8}"During their turn, all players
may pay one Piece

1276
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,175
{\an8}and transfer an escape ticket
to a player of their choice."

1277
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,138
-That's something we can't really...
-We can't do that.

1278
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,931
It's a meaningless rule for us.

1279
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,435
{\an8}Three.

1280
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,437
{\an8}ORBIT moves three spaces. Next, Hye-sung.

1281
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,813
-There's science behind rolling the dice.
-You got this.

1282
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,231
-Hye-sung, go get it.
-Let's go.

1283
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,733
{\an8}-That's it!
-One.

1284
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,693
-You did great.
-Nice!

1285
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:17,611
-Yes!
-Good job!

1286
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,654
Group rules are good for everyone.

1287
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,489
-Hye-sung.
-Come here.

1288
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,408
-Change it to discard and transfer.
-Yeah, do that.

1289
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,492
-Yeah, do that.
-The escape ticket...

1290
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,785
You still keep your turn.

1291
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:26,870
-That's right.
-Okay then...

1292
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,830
-Change it to discard and transfer.
-Over there.

1293
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,917
-Will you change the group rule?
-Yes, I'd like to do that.

1294
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,376
{\an8}"During their turn,

1295
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:38,131
{\an8}all players may discard an escape ticket
and transfer an escape ticket

1296
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,425
to a player of their choice."

1297
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,885
-Okay. Nice.
-The rule has changed.

1298
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,553
-Okay.
-Next, Yeon-woo.

1299
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,971
-Let's go, Yeon-woo.
-Please roll the dice.

1300
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,848
-Escape
-Please hand it to me.

1301
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,350
Yeon-woo.

1302
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,976
-You're finally free.
-Last chance.

1303
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,394
She finally escaped.

1304
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,562
Time to shine.

1305
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,690
I got escape again.

1306
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,984
-Escape. Nothing happens.
-This is driving me nuts.

1307
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,361
-Why can't I...
-Oh, no.

1308
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,029
I can't get any numbers.

1309
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,197
-Only in prison...
-Let's give her one.

1310
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,323
-What?
-Wait.

1311
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,200
-I'll discard a ticket and transfer one.
-I escaped.

1312
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,785
Let's take a look.

1313
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,084
It's either me or Joon-bin.
Give it to him.

1314
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,419
-Give me one.
-I'm safe for now.

1315
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,171
First, I'll discard one ticket

1316
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,798
-and transfer one to Joon-bin.
-Please hand it to me.

1317
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,049
-And then...
-Okay.

1318
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,134
Kyeong-rim, you don't
have a ticket, right?

1319
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,928
-No.
-I'll discard a ticket

1320
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,263
-and transfer one to her.
-You have transferred an escape ticket

1321
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,265
-to Kyeong-rim.
-What about Yeon-woo?

1322
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,684
-But first,
-Yeon-woo?

1323
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,018
we need to move and get more tickets.

1324
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,312
It's dangerous for us
to get low on tickets.

1325
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,606
-I'll roll then.
-Next, Dong-joo.

1326
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,649
You got this.

1327
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,025
{\an8}-That's it. Nice!
-Two.

1328
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,485
Yes!

1329
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,779
Great job.

1330
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,322
I'd like an escape ticket.

1331
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,199
Joon-bin, please roll the dice.

1332
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,617
{\an8}Prison.

1333
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,660
I should go home.

1334
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,161
-Kyeong-rim.
-Office!

1335
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,204
I'd like a ticket.

1336
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,706
-You're choosing an escape ticket?
-Yes.

1337
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,416
They're a big group

1338
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,751
so they need twice the amount.

1339
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,462
Seungkwan, roll the dice.

1340
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,214
-You got this.
-Give me a two.

1341
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,300
{\an8}Escape. Escape. Prison.

1342
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:08,430
I'm giving out escape tickets
but people keep going to prison.

1343
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,723
<i>Joon-bin was there.</i>

1344
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,474
<i>When did Kyeong-rim get imprisoned?</i>

1345
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,767
<i>Yeon-woo's always there.</i>

1346
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,478
I don't know what to do anymore.

1347
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,772
-Next, Guillaume.
-I need a good roll.

1348
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,651
{\an8}-Nice.
-Good one!

1349
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,361
-He didn't get to the office.
-I need to move one more space.

1350
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,654
-I'll land on it.
-That's a shame.

1351
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,698
-Dong-jae, please roll the dice.
-You got this.

1352
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,324
Dong-jae is also pretty far ahead.

1353
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,703
{\an8}Two.

1354
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,913
-Office.
-You have landed on an office.

1355
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,373
What should we change it to?

1356
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,167
Should we pay a Piece?

1357
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,085
They're out of options now.

1358
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,671
They're going to do
their Piece thing again.

1359
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,798
"Pay one Piece and..."

1360
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,302
Instead of paying,
just discard an escape ticket.

1361
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,471
I only have one right now.

1362
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,347
-Ticket?
-Oh, I don't have one.

1363
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,390
You don't.

1364
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,268
In that case,

1365
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,895
I can't roll the special dice

1366
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,438
since I don't have a ticket to discard.

1367
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,357
I know, but that's not what I'm saying.

1368
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,026
-Seok-jin?
-There's Guillaume.

1369
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,237
-You want me to survive with the dice?
-That's a bit harsh.

1370
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,949
Of the players over there,
the most desperate is See-won.

1371
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,744
-Right.
-If we force her to go backward,

1372
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,496
-her alliance will be in trouble.
-Right.

1373
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,372
Let's shake them up later.

1374
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,167
-I think you're too being hasty right now.
-Am I?

1375
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:25,632
I understand why, so we won't stop you
from using a Piece.

1376
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,966
-But...
-It's a waste though.

1377
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,511
It isn't a waste from her perspective.

1378
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,179
You don't mind using more Pieces, right?

1379
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,847
-I just need to leave one.
-Right.

1380
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,683
We'll change the rule to
"During their turn,

1381
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,895
{\an8}all players may pay one Piece
and roll the special dice."

1382
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,649
I will use the group rule right now.

1383
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,442
-Please pay one Piece.
-Okay.

1384
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,737
The special dice shows itself
for the first time.

1385
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,073
-The dice that doesn't have prison.
-Here is the special dice.

1386
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,991
-Please.
-It's our first time seeing it.

1387
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,372
-There are three threes, right?
-There are a lot.

1388
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,333
It's a 50% chance.
The odds can't be against me.

1389
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,712
{\an8}-Nice!
-Nice!

1390
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,590
-Oh, no.
-That's great. Roll a one next.

1391
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,843
-Roll a one.
-That's my spot.

1392
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,261
Please roll the ordinary dice.

1393
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,555
One or three, we'll take anything.

1394
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,515
This is amazing.

1395
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,851
{\an8}-One.
-Nice.

1396
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,519
-We can change the group rule again.
-Nice!

1397
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,020
We need to decide whether she's going to

1398
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,356
get a ticket or change the group rule.

1399
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,816
{\an8}Get a ticket.

1400
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,276
They're going to change it again.

1401
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,570
Their only hope
is to rely on escape tickets.

1402
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,406
You're right.
I would like an escape ticket.

1403
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,907
She chose the ticket.

1404
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,075
She's good.

1405
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,411
Seok-jin, please roll the dice.

1406
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,331
{\an8}Two.

1407
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,085
{\an8}Next, ORBIT. Two.

1408
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,503
{\an8}Next, Hye-sung. Two.

1409
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,963
-Nice.
-Okay.

1410
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,214
-Let's go, Yeon-woo.
-Next, Yeon-woo.

1411
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,133
-You got this!
-Let's go, Yeon-woo.

1412
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,217
Just take a step.

1413
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,386
-Please just move forward.
-You got this. Please.

1414
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,056
-Are you serious?
-Seriously!

1415
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,683
How is this possible?

1416
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,186
-I shouldn't laugh.
-No way.

1417
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,813
-Dong-joo, please roll the dice.
-I'm sorry.

1418
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,441
{\an8}-Three.
-Nice.

1419
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,901
{\an8}I'll hurry along.

1420
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,236
Can I roll and then use my ticket?

1421
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,404
No, your turn ends.

1422
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,072
Really? I'll use my ticket.

1423
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,365
Rolling and then using it?

1424
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,658
-I wouldn't have if I rolled an escape.
-Joon-bin,

1425
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,243
-you have escaped prison.
-I'm trying to get out by any means.

1426
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,828
Congratulations!

1427
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,079
Joon-bin, let's go.

1428
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,123
{\an8}You two receive escape tickets
due to your personal rules.

1429
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,166
{\an8}-Thank you.
-Congrats.

1430
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:26,127
{\an8}-You get another one.
-I can only pay with a Piece right now.

1431
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,295
-Next, Joon-bin.
-Yes.

1432
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,505
Please roll the dice.

1433
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,424
{\an8}-Three.
-Nice!

1434
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,634
-Nice!
-Nice!

1435
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,010
-You have landed on an office.
-Nice!

1436
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,012
-Joon-bin!
-Which benefit will you choose?

1437
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,264
-Change it to "discard a ticket and..."
-Right, do that.

1438
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,557
How many do you have?

1439
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,392
We can go with
"discard a ticket," can't we?

1440
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,102
Will you change the group rule?

1441
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,397
-Tell us.
-I've thought about this.

1442
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,525
I'll go with
"During their turn, all players

1443
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,902
{\an8}may discard an escape ticket

1444
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,949
and move another player
one space backward."

1445
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,453
-The rule has been changed.
-Thank you.

1446
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,621
Next, Kyeong-rim.

1447
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,705
If someone moves back, aren't they done?

1448
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,332
{\an8}-Prison.
-I'm going to prison.

1449
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,750
-Kyeong-rim goes to prison.
-You have a ticket.

1450
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,168
We'll get one when you escape.

1451
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,211
-Right?
-So it's fine.

1452
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:12,423
Could you keep transferring tickets to me?

1453
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,550
Why?

1454
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,969
I only have two Pieces left.

1455
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,428
-Next, Seungkwan.
-You got this.

1456
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,638
-You got this.
-Let's go!

1457
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,099
-You got this!
-Come on!

1458
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,309
Wait, how many tickets do you have?

1459
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,895
-Three.
-Let's use two.

1460
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,146
-We can use two.
-Let's use two.

1461
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,523
You can use two in one turn?

1462
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,649
-Yeah.
-As much as you want.

1463
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,608
You could use all of them.

1464
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,569
-Hold on a second.
-No. Let's have a meeting.

1465
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,279
Gather up. Who are we sending backward?

1466
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,199
See-won has two Pieces.

1467
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,617
Even if she places third, she survives.

1468
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,662
But if she finishes last
or second to last, she'll get eliminated.

1469
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,331
So let's try not to make her finish last.

1470
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,499
What's the plan?

1471
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,751
-Let's avoid sending her home.
-Why two? Doesn't she have three?

1472
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,296
-That doesn't matter.
-You care too much.

1473
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,505
Look, it's the same...

1474
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,881
-Someone has to go home.
-Listen.

1475
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,759
Dong-jae and See-won
are in the same position right now.

1476
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,178
The thing with See-won is that

1477
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,514
-she's focused on saving herself.
-Exactly.

1478
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,141
-That's why we need to eliminate her.
-They have no other play.

1479
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,018
That's why we need to get rid of her.

1480
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,936
They're having a good time.

1481
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,438
This is so annoying.

1482
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,066
We've made a decision.

1483
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,776
I will...

1484
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,655
discard two escape tickets...

1485
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,369
and send See-won two spaces backward.

1486
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,371
You discard two escape tickets,

1487
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,791
and See-won moves two spaces backward.

1488
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,585
All right.

1489
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,628
Please roll the dice.

1490
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,672
{\an8}Prison.

1491
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,924
It's for sending me to prison.

1492
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,718
Seungkwan can't be in prison.

1493
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,261
Dong-jae, please roll the dice.

1494
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,517
{\an8}-Nice!
-Three.

1495
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,354
You have landed on an office.
Which benefit will you choose?

1496
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,648
You can use your tickets to finish first.

1497
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,359
Use up all your tickets
and finish the game.

1498
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,526
I don't need to.

1499
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,779
-You have to.
-Why?

1500
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,531
We can't have
someone from that team finish first.

1501
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,744
If Dong-joo finishes first,
she gets five Pieces.

1502
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,996
If that happens,
I lose the power to decide.

1503
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,206
-To decide who goes to prison?
-Yeah.

1504
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,083
The one with the most Pieces decides,

1505
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,418
so you absolutely need to finish first.

1506
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,045
I have a question.

1507
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:17,131
Can we discard several tickets at once
to roll multiple times?

1508
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,049
Yes, you may.

1509
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:21,260
{\an8}Then I'll change the rule to
"All players may discard an escape ticket

1510
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,804
{\an8}and roll the special dice."

1511
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,138
Darn it.

1512
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,306
We need to change that.

1513
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,058
This means they're going for it.

1514
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,434
I will discard a ticket.

1515
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,602
They're going for it.

1516
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,522
Here is the special dice.

1517
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,234
{\an8}-Okay, nice.
-Three.

1518
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,485
{\an8}Good.

1519
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,195
You move three spaces.

1520
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,822
Here is the ordinary dice.

1521
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,325
{\an8}Okay.

1522
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,827
{\an8}You have landed on an office.

1523
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,078
See-won.

1524
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,621
-That was the best outcome.
-It was.

1525
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,914
Seriously. This is it.

1526
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,374
-It's a miracle.
-This is it.

1527
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:54,460
-You have to use the tickets to...
-Just take one.

1528
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,962
-Take it? Okay.
-Which benefit will you choose?

1529
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,755
I will take an escape ticket.

1530
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:00,883
Seok-jin.

1531
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,385
{\an8}I will discard a ticket

1532
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,678
{\an8}and roll the special dice.

1533
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:04,846
He's going for it.

1534
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:09,851
{\an8}Three.

1535
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,603
The odds of landing a three
with the special dice are so high.

1536
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,688
In this case...

1537
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:14,772
This is it.

1538
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,482
You move three spaces.

1539
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:21,070
I will discard a ticket
and roll the special dice again.

1540
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,530
Please roll the dice.

1541
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:24,949
{\an8}Three.

1542
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,200
{\an8}-He made it.
-He did.

1543
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,578
I will discard a ticket
and roll the special dice.

1544
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,787
You'd like to discard it again?

1545
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,330
Seok-jin is going to make it.

1546
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,291
It's over.

1547
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,292
{\an8}One.

1548
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,544
Congratulations!

1549
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:41,215
Seok-jin, you have finished first.

1550
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,011
Gosh, this is nerve-racking.

1551
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,013
PARK KYEONG-RIM 10TH, KWAK JOON-BIN 9TH,

1552
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,806
SEUNGKWAN 11TH, CHO YEON-WOO 12TH,
HA SEOK-JIN 1ST

1553
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,601
They don't have escape tickets
and they can't get them anymore.

1554
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:52,810
Next, ORBIT.

1555
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:54,896
{\an8}Two.

1556
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,565
You receive an escape ticket
due to your personal rule.

1557
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,150
Okay!

1558
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,652
"If the leading player rolls a two,

1559
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,696
I receive one escape ticket."

1560
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,864
Next, Yeon-woo.

1561
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:05,990
-Don't sweat it.
-Please.

1562
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,992
-Just roll it.
-Please.

1563
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,202
-Roll it casually.
-Take it easy.

1564
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,203
Just roll it.

1565
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,245
Three would be good.

1566
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,705
Just roll it casually.

1567
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,624
{\an8}Escape.

1568
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:15,833
-This is insane.
-How?

1569
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,001
-Nothing happens.
-This is crazy.

1570
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,085
How is this possible?

1571
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,670
What are the odds?

1572
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:20,797
Next, Dong-joo.

1573
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,133
{\an8}Okay. It's fine.

1574
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,968
Joon-bin moves two spaces.

1575
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,720
I will use my ticket.

1576
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,263
You have escaped prison.

1577
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,015
{\an8}Due to their personal rules,

1578
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,434
{\an8}Dong-joo and Seungkwan
receive escape tickets.

1579
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,896
{\an8}Everyone's gathered here,
with Seungkwan and Yeon-woo lagging.

1580
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,065
-I'll use my ticket.
-Will you use your escape ticket?

1581
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,734
-Then you get one.
-Seungkwan, just get to the safe zone.

1582
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,194
Then you can roll
special, special, and ordinary.

1583
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,363
{\an8}-Utilize this rule before changing it.
-Right.

1584
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:46,405
{\an8}Use this rule.

1585
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:50,034
-Use this to roll the special dice.
-I will use this to roll the special dice.

1586
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,744
Here is the special dice.

1587
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,162
We have to save Seungkwan first.

1588
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,121
Let's get three!

1589
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,623
-Three.
-You got this.

1590
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:56,874
You got this.

1591
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:57,834
-Three.
-You got this.

1592
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:58,918
You got this.

1593
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,212
{\an8}That's good.

1594
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,340
-Good job.
-Roll again.

1595
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,384
-Get another ticket and roll again.
-Let's go.

1596
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,927
I will take an escape ticket.

1597
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,345
Will you take an escape ticket?

1598
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,972
I will use the group rule

1599
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,933
and discard my ticket
to roll the special dice.

1600
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,894
{\an8}Yes!

1601
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,605
-Now, roll the ordinary dice.
-You move three spaces.

1602
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,315
Try to get to the office.

1603
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,359
-But this...
-It depends on my luck.

1604
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,819
-You got this.
-You can do it.

1605
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,028
You got this.

1606
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:30,283
This is crazy!

1607
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,952
I'm about to cry.

1608
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,414
This is crazy!

1609
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,251
This is crazy!

1610
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,420
-How is that possible?
-Seungkwan!

1611
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,046
That's crazy.

1612
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,174
-Wait. What should we do now?
-Let's talk about this.

1613
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,010
-Let's decide.
-Wait, let's talk.

1614
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:49,927
What do I do?

1615
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,013
You need to send someone back.

1616
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,098
-Send someone back.
-There's no other way.

1617
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,727
There's a chance you finish eleventh.

1618
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,145
It seems plausible.

1619
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,521
I hope I don't though.

1620
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:05,776
{\an8}<i>Even if we assume
Yeon-woo ends in last place,</i>

1621
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,238
{\an8}<i>the eleventh-place player
loses three Pieces.</i>

1622
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,034
{\an8}<i>As See-won only has two Pieces
in her possession,</i>

1623
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,953
{\an8}<i>finishing eleventh means elimination.</i>

1624
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,788
Will you change the group rule?

1625
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,290
{\an8}"During their turn,

1626
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,959
{\an8}all players may discard an escape ticket

1627
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,630
{\an8}and send another player
one space backward."

1628
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,964
I'm changing it to that.

1629
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,215
Okay.

1630
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,634
-Next, Guillaume.
-Let's go.

1631
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,135
You got this.

1632
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,803
Is he rolling office again?

1633
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,263
-Please roll prison.
-Escape!

1634
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,473
-Please roll prison.
-Escape!

1635
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:36,599
-Escape.
-Office, please.

1636
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:37,767
-Let's end it.
-Escape.

1637
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,768
Okay!

1638
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:39,977
{\an8}Let's end it.

1639
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,395
{\an8}Okay!

1640
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,609
-It's okay.
-Let's go.

1641
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,277
-What's with that dice?
-Lucky guy.

1642
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,820
You have landed on an office.

1643
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,197
We need to make sure

1644
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,075
-they can't use escape tickets.
-Absolutely.

1645
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:55,451
How about this?

1646
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,328
-What?
-"All players who roll prison

1647
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:01,457
{\an8}may not go to prison
and instead move one space forward."

1648
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,043
There's only
a one-in-six chance of rolling prison.

1649
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,003
That doesn't matter.

1650
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,755
Can we do that for me?

1651
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:08,881
-Because...
-So you don't go to prison?

1652
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,966
I don't have an escape ticket.

1653
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,301
If I go to prison, I'm dead.

1654
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,637
I will change the group rule.

1655
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,349
{\an8}"All players who roll prison

1656
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,476
may not go to prison,

1657
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,854
{\an8}and instead move one space forward."

1658
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:24,855
It has been changed.

1659
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,441
-This poses no risk for us.
-Good.

1660
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:28,859
Dong-jae.

1661
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,738
Two. You move two spaces.

1662
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:33,948
Next, See-won.

1663
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,200
{\an8}-Two.
-Two.

1664
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:37,493
You move two spaces.

1665
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,454
{\an8}-ORBIT, please roll the dice.
-One, please.

1666
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,206
{\an8}-Roll a one.
-I need one.

1667
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,669
Nice!

1668
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:47,795
-Nice!
-How?

1669
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,172
-Nice.
-We have luck on our side.

1670
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,008
-Change it back?
-Yeah.

1671
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,594
"During their turn,
all players may discard an escape ticket

1672
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,723
{\an8}and send another player
one space backward."

1673
01:06:58,806 --> 01:06:59,932
It has been changed.

1674
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,892
Hye-sung, please roll the dice.

1675
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,439
{\an8}-Prison.
-Oh, she's going.

1676
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,149
{\an8}-Hye-sung goes to prison.
-I'm going to prison?

1677
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,109
-This isn't good.
-Oh, no.

1678
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,152
No!

1679
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,236
Do you have a ticket?

1680
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,320
I don't.

1681
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,949
Kyeong-rim, due to your personal rule,
you receive one escape ticket.

1682
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,286
"If a player in the same space
as me goes to prison,

1683
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,872
I receive one escape ticket."

1684
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,457
Thank you.

1685
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,624
Next, Yeon-woo.

1686
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,501
-Don't sigh.
-Please.

1687
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,919
Smile and roll the dice.

1688
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,254
-Let's go!
-You got this.

1689
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,547
-You can do it.
-Here I go.

1690
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,340
-Go ahead.
-You rolled so many escapes.

1691
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:34,592
-Go ahead.
-You rolled so many escapes.

1692
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:37,887
Nice!

1693
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,221
You did it.

1694
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,473
-Yeon-woo.
-I got a two.

1695
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,600
I got a two. I'm about to cry.

1696
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:43,893
It's your first time.

1697
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,478
Yeon-woo moves two spaces.

1698
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,812
I'm tearing up.

1699
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,189
-I got a two.
-This makes you emotional.

1700
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,356
-Tell me about it.
-It's my first time.

1701
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,108
Dong-joo, please roll the dice.

1702
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,862
{\an8}...DISCARD AN ESCAPE TICKET AND SEND
ANOTHER PLAYER ONE SPACE BACKWARD

1703
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,280
I'm...

1704
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:01,911
I'm...

1705
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,121
really sorry for doing this.

1706
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,292
But I'm sending our youngest member...

1707
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,169
Who's the youngest?

1708
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,716
...six spaces backward.

1709
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:19,136
Dong-jae moves six spaces backward.

1710
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,516
He has moved.

1711
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:09,121
