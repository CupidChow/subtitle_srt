1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,507
{\an8}Wait, what's going on?

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,676
{\an8}What did you do?

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,512
{\an8}-I'll tell you after.
-What did you do?

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,139
-I'll tell you after submitting it.
-What happened?

5
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,974
Why did you go in?

6
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,434
Let's submit ours.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,685
-Wait.
-Did you fill yours out?

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,022
Hurry. Let's go submit it.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,276
Here's my answer sheet.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,487
Yu-min, please submit your answer sheet.

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,406
-Yu-min wouldn't do that.
-What...

12
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,658
Then why did she go in there?

13
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,702
Go submit yours.

14
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,164
Dong-jae, please submit your answer sheet.

15
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,166
I don't think I played well today.

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,792
-You didn't?
-Yeah.

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,335
Do you think you'll be last?

18
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,087
I almost was.

19
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,881
Yu-min, let's talk.

20
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,053
Listen...

21
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,639
What are you doing?

22
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,475
Please submit your answer sheet.

23
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,394
-It's over.
-Can we go together?

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,771
Okay.

25
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,314
Yeah.

26
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,859
<i>All players have submitted
their answer sheets.</i>

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,736
What happened?

28
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,237
Yu-min went in

29
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,532
and used a ticket to help the other team.

30
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,494
Wait, did you leak our numbers?

31
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,455
Did you?

32
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,414
The thing is...

33
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,875
Did you tell them my number?

34
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,756
10 MINUTES EARLIER

35
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,673
Make contact with me.

36
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,926
I'll be honest since I trust you.

37
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,844
He might not have leaked your number.

38
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,471
We can't rule that out.

39
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,056
But I believe he did.

40
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,351
-Why is this situation happening to me?
-Why are you hesitating?

41
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,894
-I don't understand why.
-Exactly.

42
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,146
-What's stopping you?
-Do you want to be last?

43
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,607
-<i>Three minutes are remaining.</i>
-What do I do?

44
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>If you have not submitted
your answer sheet,</i>

45
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,862
-Go in right now.
<i>-please do so now.</i>

46
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,905
What do I do?

47
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,949
Dong-jae's number is 54.

48
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,910
-Fifty-four.
-Hye-sung's number is 84.

49
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,537
-Eighty-four.
-Mine is 11.

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,454
Okay.

51
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,915
{\an8}In the games we've played so far,

52
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:07,085
{\an8}Dong-jae's been part of a strong alliance

53
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,421
<i>but hasn't earned
the trust of most players.</i>

54
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,883
I wanted to trust him
but it was hard to do so.

55
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,718
So you leaked all of our numbers?

56
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,095
-Just answer me.
-ORBIT.

57
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,763
-Wait.
-ORBIT.

58
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,974
-Answer me.
-Did you know my number?

59
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,308
ORBIT.

60
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,396
What did you put as my number?

61
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,525
Weren't we supposed to be a team?

62
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,526
What?

63
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,823
Can't you at least tell me
if you know my number or not?

64
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,032
-Well...
-Tell me honestly.

65
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>The time has expired.</i>

66
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,874
<i>Here are the results of the game.</i>

67
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:50,336
<i>If Dong-jae did not leak
Yu-min and Hye-sung's numbers,</i>

68
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,048
<i>See-won and Seok-jin
would have five points each.</i>

69
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,634
<i>If Dong-jae did leak their numbers,</i>

70
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,136
<i>they would have seven points.</i>

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,605
{\an8}LEE SEE-WON & HA SEOK-JIN: 5 POINTS

72
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,534
{\an8}KIM DONG-JAE: 0 POINTS
LEE HYE-SUNG: 1 POINT

73
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,245
{\an8}I didn't think
this was how I'd get eliminated.

74
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,003
This is unbelievable.

75
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:59,197
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

76
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,293
{\an8}I remember seeing
Seok-jin and Dong-jae together.

77
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,711
Why were they in that room?

78
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,838
-Why were you there?
-What?

79
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,465
-You got yours?
-I did.

80
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,549
-Seok-jin.
-Yeah?

81
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,180
I predicted that they would team up
and exchange numbers.

82
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,600
There's nothing I can do about that.

83
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,601
See-won, come here.

84
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,230
Dong-jae and Seok-jin just made contact.
They told each other the numbers already.

85
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,691
See-won, Dong-jae,
and Seok-jin had every reason

86
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,527
<i>to play the game together.</i>

87
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,070
The odds were in their favor.

88
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,738
<i>There were three alliances today.</i>

89
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,366
<i>Just gather information from all three,</i>

90
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,534
and you can win.

91
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,329
<i>What did Dong-jae and Seok-jin discuss</i>

92
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,915
<i>during their conversation?</i>

93
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,418
-Yeon-woo betrayed you.
-What?

94
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,461
{\an8}-Yeon-woo betrayed you.
-What?

95
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,504
-She betrayed you.
-Who?

96
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,588
Yeon-woo betrayed you.

97
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,968
There's nothing I can do about that.

98
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,096
<i>I didn't hear it from someone else.</i>

99
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,557
It all happened
due to my misunderstanding.

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,559
I'll just trust See-won.

101
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,686
-This is an interesting duo.
-Give me this.

102
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,645
I'll give it to you later.

103
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,397
-This is just trash.
-It is?

104
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,065
-Let me look at it if it's trash.
-It's not trash.

105
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,400
If it's trash, let me see it.

106
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,654
Yeon-woo had a crumpled
piece of paper in her hand.

107
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:27,035
I saw her fidgeting with her pocket
when we were going into the room.

108
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:31,289
I knew she was going to
leak their numbers.

109
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,751
It's really annoying
to hear that from someone

110
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,170
after all the time and effort
I spent calculating our numbers.

111
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,546
What do you mean?

112
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,964
He said you betrayed us.

113
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,008
Me? I betrayed you two?

114
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,134
Did you give them the paper?

115
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,218
No, it's here.

116
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,928
I'll give it to you later.

117
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,805
Okay. I just wrote it down here.

118
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,265
Did she betray you?

119
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,725
Who told you that she betrayed us?

120
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,268
-I didn't hear it from someone.
-Okay.

121
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,399
-Why?
-Your number.

122
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,901
Dong-jae exposed your numbers.

123
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,028
-To whom?
-To Seok-jin.

124
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,698
Yeon-woo kept fidgeting
with her back pocket.

125
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,242
She was doing it in that room.

126
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,661
What if the paper
disappeared in the meantime?

127
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,163
-Then...
-It was in her pocket.

128
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,539
-You saw it?
-Yeah.

129
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,957
I was just worried.

130
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,459
-Okay.
-I was just concerned.

131
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,502
Write this down.

132
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,378
Dong-jae, 54.

133
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,963
What was that?

134
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,048
-Fifty-four.
-Fifty-four?

135
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,091
Hye-sung, 84.

136
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,094
-Don't write Yu-min's number.
-Okay.

137
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,178
-Okay.
-Okay.

138
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,554
{\an8}Hye-sung's number wasn't necessary.

139
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,140
<i>If I hadn't called it out,
no one would have written it.</i>

140
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,476
I'm conflicted,
but it seems like a mistake.

141
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,020
I used my Piece to save you.

142
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,606
I did all this to save you and Hye-sung.

143
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,566
You're right. I know.

144
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>I think I was hasty.</i>

145
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,071
Before I had even gained their trust,

146
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,990
<i>I tried to make something happen
with a new alliance.</i>

147
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,201
It was a hasty decision on my part.

148
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,537
Hye-sung.

149
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,373
I trusted you completely.

150
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,874
I didn't betray you.

151
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,709
-I didn't betray you either.
-We did well.

152
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,839
<i>Yu-min was probably taken advantage of.</i>

153
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,048
"You'll get eliminated."

154
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,552
"Do as we say and you'll survive."

155
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,304
-I'm sorry, Hye-sung.
-It's okay.

156
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,184
It's just a game.

157
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,603
<i>I felt so weak.</i>

158
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,148
<i>I was swayed by other people.</i>

159
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,733
<i>And I didn't know what to do.</i>

160
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,027
I wished the ground would swallow me up.

161
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,364
I didn't come here to show my bad side.

162
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,615
I didn't feel good.

163
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,409
Don't cry.

164
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,495
It's all right. Don't cry.

165
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,456
I'm not dead. I'm still alive.

166
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,584
I'm still alive.

167
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,842
<i>For gaining more than six points,</i>

168
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,429
{\an8}<i>Joon-bin, Kyeong-rim, ORBIT,</i>

169
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:56,100
{\an8}<i>Dong-joo, and Seungkwan
receive one Piece each.</i>

170
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,646
{\an8}<i>Players with four or fewer points
will be penalized.</i>

171
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,733
<i>Hye-sung, who has less than four points,</i>

172
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,735
<i>please return one Piece.</i>

173
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,238
{\an8}-Please return your pouch.
-We can take the pouches as souvenirs.

174
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,865
{\an8}Never mind, we have to return them.

175
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,327
{\an8}<i>Dong-jae, who finished
with the lowest points,</i>

176

{\an8}<i>please return all of your Pieces.</i>

177
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,373
{\an8}-Please return your pouch.
-Okay.

178
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:23,586
<i>Dong-jae and Hye-sung
have lost all of their Pieces.</i>

179
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,922
<i>As such, Dong-jae and Hye-sung</i>

180
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,968
{\an8}<i>are the second and third players
to get eliminated from</i> The Devil's Plan.

181
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,307
<i>Dong-jae and Hye-sung, please return
to the living area, pack your belongings,</i>

182
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,684
<i>and leave.</i>

183
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,649
<i>Ultimately,</i>

184
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,526
we would've been able to
at least spare Hye-sung

185
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,736
with a bit more planning.

186
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,948
-Good job. I'm sorry.
-Good job.

187
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,032
See you outside.

188
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,117
<i>It's inevitable.</i>

189
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,787
<i>If I didn't send her home,
she could've sent me home another day.</i>

190
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,539
If Hye-sung and Dong-jae

191
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,501
had grown closer and gained
each other's trust during the game today,

192
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,128
they could easily eliminate me
in tomorrow's game.

193
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,631
-Why are you crying?
-Don't cry.

194
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,258
-Why are you crying?
-Everyone's crying.

195
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,926
Why are you crying?

196
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,221
<i>Wasn't it his goal that
no one would get eliminated?</i>

197
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,140
Why are they crying?
I really don't understand them.

198
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,562
Stand with the underdogs, my foot.

199
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,648
I didn't realize your alliance was broken.

200
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,525
I'm sorry for going at you until the end.

201
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,443
-No, it's all right.
-I...

202
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,612
-You did well.
-I should've trusted you.

203
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,613
You did well.

204
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,449
I mean it.

205
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,952
What a bummer.

206
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,204
-I'm off.
-Well done.

207
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,540
-Bye.
-I'm so bummed.

208
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,584
-Bye.
-I'll go now.

209
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,668
Goodbye.

210
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,461
This was fun.

211
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,504
Let's go.

212
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,505
Let's head out.

213
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,173
-I'm sad.
-Good job.

214
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,105
Dong-jae.

215
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,153
You did well.

216
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,367
The Devil's Plan <i>was like a utopia for me.</i>

217
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,872
It was truly
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

218
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,248
That's why it felt more special.

219
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,876
-Good job, Hye-sung.
-You too.

220
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,712
I'm sad we won't ever get to
come back here.

221
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,006
Right? That's what's
really upsetting for me too.

222
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,467
When I saw my score on the screen,

223
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,889
what went through my head
wasn't "Oh, I was betrayed."

224
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,559
It was, "I don't want to go home."

225
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:45,936
Let's go pack.

226
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,482
The quicker we pack,
the more time we have to talk later.

227
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,650
-You're right.
-That's how it was yesterday.

228
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,195
{\an8}<i>Here is the current Piece count
of each player.</i>

229
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,238
{\an8}I'm the only one with one.

230
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,324
{\an8}<i>Having the least number of Pieces,</i>

231
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,660
<i>Yeon-woo will go to prison.</i>

232
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,577
Again?

233
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,457
<i>ORBIT, Dong-joo, and Seok-jin
currently have the most Pieces.</i>

234
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,709
<i>Please choose one player
who will go to prison</i>

235
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,629
<i>among Joon-bin, Kyeong-rim, Yu-min,</i>

236
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,923
<i>Seungkwan, and See-won,</i>

237
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,801
<i>who are tied for second least Pieces.</i>

238
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,388
I didn't think I'd send someone to prison.

239
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,306
So the person with the least Pieces goes?

240
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,934
-That person is going, right?
-Yeah, it's confirmed.

241
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,104
I'll go to prison.

242
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,939
Just send me.

243
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,400
<i>It was such an ugly win for me.</i>

244
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,486
I would've been fine
if I had betrayed others to win.

245
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,406
But I won by making someone else do that.

246
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,283
It's such a dirty thing to do
and it doesn't feel good.

247
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,370
<i>Please choose one player
who will go to prison.</i>

248
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,579
We choose

249
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,498
Joon-bin.

250
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,666
I'm excited.

251
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,584
-What?
-I'm looking forward to it.

252
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,794
You got this.

253
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,383
<i>Yeon-woo and Joon-bin,
please enter the prison cell.</i>

254
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,302
There's something you can solve there.
Yeon-woo knows.

255
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,345
Joon-bin, let's talk tomorrow.

256
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,055
-Please follow me.
-Okay.

257
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,974
-Yeon-woo.
-See you in 18 hours.

258
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,977
-Hang in there.
-Oh, no, Yeon-woo.

259
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,228
Seungkwan!

260
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,312
Yeon-woo...

261
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,522
I'll be back.

262
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,815
Help each other.

263
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,732
I'll be helping her.

264
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,733
Watch your arm.

265
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,988
-I'll send some money!
-Get a Piece in there.

266
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,241
<i>The players who won their bets</i>

267

270
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,336
{\an8}-I'm thinking of giving mine to Joon-bin.
-You bet right.

271
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,213
{\an8}-He used a Piece for me earlier.
-Yeah, he did.

272
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,716
Please enter.

273
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,967
This is my second time.

274
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,055
<i>I don't want to get used to this,</i>

275
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,642
but it feels more comfortable
now that it's my second time here.

276
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,644
I hate to feel this way.

277
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,687
This is it.

278
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,526
Please enter.

279
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,652
What is this?

280
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,280
-Welcome.
-It's pretty cozy.

281
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,157
<i>I also have an excuse not to shower.</i>

282
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,075
<i>I was so lazy to shower,</i>

283
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,077
but I had to since everyone here does.

284
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,872
<i>The main match has finished.</i>

285
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,209
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

286
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,419
-Good job.
-Good job.

287
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,636
You didn't go to prison?

288
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,180
That's a relief. I thought you went.

289
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,431
You did?

290
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,352
I can't believe this is happening.

291
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,479
Man, the brain of our team.

292
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,897
Good work, Seok-jin.

293
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,775
I depended on you a lot.

294
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,696
-I wasn't good enough.
-Don't say that.

295
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,156
-Don't say that.
-It's a learning experience.

296
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,324
-He's right.
-Right.

297
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,745
<i>I really hope Seok-jin or See-won wins.</i>

298
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,331
<i>They supported me more than anyone else.</i>

299
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,334
<i>And I depended on them a lot.</i>

300
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,461
There's nothing more

301
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,756
I could ask for than to see them win.

302
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,633
Let me help you.

303
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,969
-Are you done packing?
-Thank you. Yeah, I'm done.

304
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,304
I'm done.

305
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,098
I feel so bad.

306
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,350
-No, it's like you said.
-After what I told you yesterday...

307
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,726
No, it's all right.

308
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,396
I had a lot of fun playing the game today.

309
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,606
<i>For the first time,</i>

310
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,943
<i>I realized that not everything in life</i>

311
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,487
<i>can be achieved only through effort.</i>

312
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,991
Although it was short-lived,
it was a valuable opportunity

313
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,120
to think about life.

314
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,957
-Yu-min, stop crying!
-I know.

315
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,877
-You have to survive.
-Seriously.

316
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,129
Thank you for everything.

317
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,589
Good job, Hye-sung.

318
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,799
-Seungkwan.
-You're the best.

319
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,386
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say that.

320
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,848
Against everyone's doubts,
you kept your word.

321
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,933
I was the most honest player.

322
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,770
I hope no one hates me too much.

323
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:02,359
I was just a player
who did his best in the moment.

324
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,154
-Let's meet again outside.
-Okay.

325
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,238
Bye.

326
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,324
-Goodbye.
-Bye, you guys!

327
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,366
Bye!

328
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,494
-See you next time.
-Bye.

329
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,704
-We're off.
-Bye.

330
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,289
-Bye.
-See you next time.

331
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,291
-Okay.
-Bye, Dong-jae.

332
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,044
It's all right. You did well.

333
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,421
I'll just use the same bed.

334
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,422
Okay.

335
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,965
I have a new cellmate now.

336
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,968
So I think things will be different.

337
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:28,928
What's this?

338
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
We have to solve it.

339
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,098
We have to solve this?

340
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,602
If you solve the puzzle, you get a Piece.

341
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,271
<i>Only Kyeong-rim's been successful so far.</i>

342
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,357
Here we go again.

343
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,275
Seriously.

344
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,070
I'm in need of Pieces.
I need to solve this today.

345
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,905
You've never had two Pieces?

346
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,657
Just one the whole time?

347
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,783
I've always been destitute.

348
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,909
That's amazing.

349
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,119
Right? That's why I'm in prison again.

350
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,372
To be honest,

351
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,374
we wanted to show everyone

352
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,793
that we're reliable people
who can play fair.

353
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,711
-Me and Dong-jae, that is.
-Right.

354
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,174
-But we were already told something.
-What?

355
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,969
That you three
were sharing numbers with each other.

356
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,762
Sounds like a rumor Joon-bin started.

357
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,307
It's not entirely his fault
since we all speculated as well.

358
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,600
I misjudged.

359
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,269
Why is Yu-min crying?

360
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,438
It's my fault.

361
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,316
She just did what I told her to do.

362
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,194
If she didn't act,
five people could have gotten eliminated.

363
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,825
<i>Dong-jae himself is at fault
for that alliance's defeat</i>

364
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,536
<i>as are See-won and Seok-jin themselves.</i>

365
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,164
They haven't been able to
present themselves as trustworthy players.

366
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,792
<i>If Dong-jae had Yu-min's trust completely,</i>

367
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,254
she wouldn't have been swayed by us
and shared their numbers.

368
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,256
-ORBIT.
-Yeah?

369
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,134
-Stop explaining yourself.
-Yeah, stop doing that.

370
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,637
There were lots of inevitable moments.

371
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,265
-We all had to make choices.
-You're right.

372
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,060
-Exactly.
-You didn't make those choices alone.

373
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,479
We did so together.

374
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,315
What else could we have done
in such an uncertain situation?

375
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,235
It feels so empty and hollow here

376
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,112
now that two people left us at once.

377
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,072
This is hard to bear.

378
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,116
-It's...
-It's hard for me too.

379
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,994
Crying every time someone leaves
is kind of...

380
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,581
Then why eliminate someone
if you're going to cry about it?

381
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,125
See-won, we honestly didn't know.

382
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,627
We were working under that assumption

383
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,547
and acted based on the situation.

384
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,050
We thought your alliance was still strong.

385
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,011
So when Joon-bin told us
something was happening,

386
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,971
we thought it was highly plausible.

387
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,932
We all saw Dong-jae as a strong contender.

388
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,225
So there was no other choice.

389
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,103
-What else...
-Couldn't you just send him to prison?

390
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,108
I'd personally like to see
skill-based eliminations.

391
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,820
So you wanted Dong-jae to survive
since he's good at the games?

392
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,449
He was someone
who could've finished first or second.

393
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,992
It's such a shame he had to leave so soon.

394
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,328
You have a point.

395
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,914
On the first day,

396
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,500
I hoped most would survive
to the second or third day.

397
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,667
But I thought

398
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,296
those who didn't play well
should be the ones to get eliminated.

399
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,133
But we couldn't just leave the players
who can't even do basic math

400
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,135
and have them finish with zero points.

401
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,762
Thanks to that,
we lost the one who was best at it.

402
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,224
-Sorry?
-The one who's best at it got eliminated.

403
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,852
Well, I don't think it's that...

404
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,315
When I looked at the screen and saw

405
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,318
<i>that Hye-sung got one and Dong-jae zero,</i>

406
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,612
<i>I really resented the other team.</i>

407
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,823
To save five people,

408
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,952
<i>they eliminated an ace player too quickly.</i>

409
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,453
<i>It was very disappointing.</i>

410
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:46,041
In soccer terms, it's like Brazil
getting knocked out in the round of 16.

411
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,919
Have you talked to Seok-jin?

412
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,921
Yeah, I did.

413
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,381
I had to look out for myself.

414
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,341
-We all had to.
-Right.

415
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,845
Seok-jin doubted Yeon-woo too.
So we all had faults.

416
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,014
What if ORBIT, Seok-jin,
and you two teamed up?

417
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,599
That would be really interesting.

418
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,852
But See-won won't work with me.

419
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,562
-Why do you think that?
-The two of you...

420
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,690
I actually went to you first
and offered to team up.

421
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,775
But you go off as soon as the game starts.

422
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,070
-I didn't...
-Why offer to team up in the first place?

423
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,738
It's such a waste of time.

424
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,658
Why talk all morning
if it won't happen in the game?

425
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,368
You didn't let me come in.

426
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,163
So of course I'd assume
that your alliance is strong.

427
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,622
The three of us were talking.

428
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,166
-And we weren't done.
-It doesn't make sense.

429
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,293
So you can talk to them but I can't?

430
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,753
That was before the game started.

431
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,090
We should be able to finish talking
before someone comes in.

432
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,426
Or maybe wait until I left the room.

433
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,142
This is strangely uncomfortable.

434
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,233
Dong-joo, have some <i>tteokbokki.</i>

435
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,902
Just a moment.

436
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,369
Dong-joo, are you all right?
Something's bothering you, isn't it?

437
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,749
What's wrong?

438
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,626
I don't know.

439
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,838
I feel immature

440
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,007
being like this.

441
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,844
-Is reality hitting you?
-Yeah.

442
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,764
I looked back on myself

443
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,558
and all my actions and words.

444
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,353
<i>I kept thinking,
"How did we get into this situation?"</i>

445
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,271
I just looked back on things.

446
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,523
It was something
I could've said another time.

447
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,151
I didn't have to say all that
during this stressful time.

448
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,362
We're all mentally shaken right now.

449
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,113
I was just so upset.

450
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,490
-So I wasn't filtering myself.
-I know.

451
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,325
It happens to all of us.

452
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,328
You just need
to control yourself right now.

453
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,663
You're the only one with one Piece.

454
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,373
That's right.

455
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,708
My head hurts.

456
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,254
You're like the king of survival.

457
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,797
It's like you're in here for life.

458
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,383
It's killing me.

459
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,009
-You're the king of...
-Prison...

460
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,053
-You need to solve that puzzle.
-Sorry?

461
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,055
If I solve it, I'll give you the Piece.

462
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,431
Please solve it.

463
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,059
-Give it to me.
-I've spent hours on this thing.

464
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,269
I'll solve it for you.

465
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,603
Really? Solve it for me.

466
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,688
Yeon-woo.

467
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,023
-I won't forget this.
-Otherwise, you'll be back here.

468
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,942
You didn't solve the cast puzzle?

469
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,318
-I heard about it.
-I tried.

470
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,238
You have to unlock
these intertwined rings.

471
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,532
It's a wire puzzle? That sounds fun.

472
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,617
You would enjoy it.

473
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,079
-Time would fly by.
-I had no idea how to solve it.

474
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,664
I get how it works.

475
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,165
Get them in the hole together.

476
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,917
-Then snap to unlock it.
-Right.

477
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,090
I have a lot of respect for Kyeong-rim.

478
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,218
-Right?
-I rate Kyeong-rim higher now.

479
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,680
Damn, this is infuriating.

480
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,808
<i>I felt grateful to him.</i>

481
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,518
So I figured I should

482
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,688
<i>tell him about the safe.</i>

483
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,106
As your senior in prison,

484
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,734
-I'll show you a clue.
-Clue?

485
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,527
-I'll show you a clue.
-Really? Okay.

486
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,578
-What is that?
-It's a safe.

487
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,912
-There's a safe?
-Yeah.

488
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,082
No wonder people who've been to prison
keep quiet about it.

489
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,335
-They...
-I don't think Kyeong-rim saw it.

490
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,170
When they said
there were two puzzles in prison,

491
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,380
she said, "There were?"

492
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,590
She only found this.

493
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,675
You and Seungkwan
were going to keep this a secret?

494
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,761
-That's right.
-Okay.

495
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,471
There's one more thing.

496
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,015
I'm not sure about it. Did you see it?

497
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,683
Do you know what else there is?

498
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,851
What is it?

499
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,644
Yeon-woo...

500
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,105
found something.

501
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,732
Where? What is it?

502
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,775
It's...

503
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,361
After finding it...

504
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,615
We need to find the code.

505
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,742
We couldn't do it yesterday.

506
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,118
Oh, you couldn't find the code.

507
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,912
It must be related to
<i>The Devil's Plan</i>, right?

508
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:52,913
Have you tried 666?

509
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,331
Go try it out.

510
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,666
What can be related to <i>The Devil's Plan</i>?

511
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,588
There he goes.

512
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,099
-Should I break it open?
-Goodness.

513
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,102
He tried to use force to open the safe.

514
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,524
You're like a real convict.

515
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,825
I was alone in the main hall

516
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,576
and he said he was
going to use the bathroom.

517
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,995
-Let me use the bathroom.
<i>-After we made contact, that is.</i>

518
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,957
<i>But as I was leaving, I came back out</i>

519
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,251
<i>to see if he really was
going to the bathroom.</i>

520
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:43,296
<i>The fact that I was checking
made me feel so pathetic.</i>

521
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,383
-"What's this side of me?"
-"Is this necessary?"

522
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,968
"What's gotten into me?"

523
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,220
So I looked up at the sky and said...

524
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,222
I can't trust people anymore.

525
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,599
I used to be so happy.

526
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:02,357
I saw everyone cry their eyes out
when Guillaume and the others left,

527
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,609
but I couldn't shed one tear.

528
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,736
Is it because you don't get
why people cry over a game?

529
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,071
It's not that.

530
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,867
It's more like, "You caused
all of this to happen."

531
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,327
<i>"So why try to defuse it with your tears?"</i>

532
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,121
I was sad Dong-jae left.

533
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,708
I even choked up
when I spoke to him privately.

534
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,085
But I didn't understand

535
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,503
everyone crying in the main hall.

536
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,797
I thought, "Didn't you all
strategize to eliminate him?"

537
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,424
That's why Dong-joo didn't cry.

538
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,551
-She said she had no right to cry.
-Right.

539
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,025
Even if I'm not
in a four-person alliance tomorrow,

540
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,318
I'll team up with Yu-min.

541
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,361
She's your priority?

542
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,696
Tomorrow, she is.

543
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,782
It's fine for me to betray someone.

544
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,452
But I basically swayed her
and forced her to.

545
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,871
<i>I felt so bad for pressuring her</i>

546
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,122
to betray other people.

547
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,042
I only have one goal tomorrow.

548
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,502
I'm going to keep Yu-min alive.

549
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,129
I had her do something in my favor,

550
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,547
so I'll make it up to her.

551
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,300
I'm going to make sure
Yu-min survives tomorrow.

552
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,052
Now, I'm going to...

553
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,470
-What is it?
-Dinner's here.

554
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,472
Wow! Thank you!

555
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,932
Yesterday, it was just these two.

556
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,391
Is there anything in the bread?

557
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,352
Like paper or something?

558
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,394
Like a fortune cookie.

559
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,021
Are you serious?

560
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,359
It's just dry bread
with no filling at all.

561
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,364
It tastes horrible.

562
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,865
Is cream too much to ask for?

563
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,326
Prisons in Korea actually give meals.

564
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,327
Rice, soup, and kimchi.

565
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,662
This place is worse than that.

566
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,330
What did we do so wrong?

567
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,790
The food is making me mad.

568
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,791
Tell me about it.

569
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,792
Tomorrow,

570
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,586
I'll take some food from the game area.

571
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,680
The Pieces are slightly different.

572
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,223
-Really?
-Just slightly.

573
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,599
The one I received yesterday

574
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,519
is different from the ones
we received in the beginning.

575
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,770
Don't tell anyone.

576
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,021
I haven't told anyone.

577
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,774
Seok-jin's such a nice and naive person.

578
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,943
<i>He laid the Pieces out
on the carpet for all to see.</i>

579
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,279
Do you think this will be part of a game?

580
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,574
I think Seok-jin and I
need to discuss it first

581
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,161
because he has three different types
and I have two.

582
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,455
{\an8}There are three different shapes.

583
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,499
{\an8}You have all three.

584
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,877
{\an8}-You have them all.
-The shapes?

585
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:32,799
<i>Here are the shapes of the Pieces
given as rewards for the winning bets.</i>

586
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,848
I think there's a total of
three different shapes.

587
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,182
{\an8}-You knew already?
-Yeah.

588
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,142
{\an8}You kept track?

589
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,315
Is it starting?

590
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,775
-It's so brutal.
-I know.

591
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,486
It's betrayal in the morning
and teamwork in the afternoon.

592
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,865
-Everyone, let's do well.
-Let's do our best.

593
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,491
-We can do it.
-All right.

594
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,951
-Up or down?
-Up.

595
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,828
-One, two, three, let's go!
-One, two, three, let's go!

596
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,121
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

597
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,622
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

598
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,832
Can we do well?

599
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,334
Sure we can.

600
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,293
We'll crush it.

601
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,711
We should.

602
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,006
Something's going on.

603
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,799
What's this?

604
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,259
What is it?

605
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,428
-Do we take turns?
-What is it?

606
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,096
-What is it?
-Is it a card game?

607
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,432
-What's this?
-Are we competing?

608
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,684
It's a cooperative game, so probably not.

609
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,644
We have to work together, so I doubt it.

610
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,272
<i>Before the prize match begins,</i>

611
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,901
<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

612
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,153
I'm first?

613
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,112
-You are.
-You're first.

614
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,113
Oh, right.

615
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,448
-You bet correctly.
-I got the bet right.

616
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,909
-I'm going to be a target again.
-<i>Today's prize match</i>

617
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,744
<i>is Word Tower.</i>

618
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,953
"Word Tower"?

619
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,123
<i>In Word Tower,
players must use the letter blocks</i>

620
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,835
<i>to assemble words
related to the given topic.</i>

621
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,922
Fluent English speakers
will have an advantage.

622
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,632
We have people who have lived abroad.

623
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,218
<i>There will be a total of three rounds.</i>

624
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,511
<i>When a round begins,</i>

625
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,765
<i>the topic and a stack of letter blocks
will be given.</i>

626
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,975
-What was that?
-Doctor.

627
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,686
<i>Players must use the given letter blocks</i>

628
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,356
<i>to assemble words related to the topic.</i>

629
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,733
<i>Players will stack the blocks
on their mats</i>

630
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,277
<i>to complete their word towers.</i>

631
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,071
I can't think of a word.

632
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,075
<i>Within ten minutes,
players must work together</i>

633
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:26,287
<i>to assemble as many words
as participating players.</i>

634
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,082
<i>All the given letter blocks must be used.</i>

635
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,876
<i>If all letter blocks are used</i>

636
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,797
<i>to successfully assemble a word,
players will move to the next round.</i>

637
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,675
<i>And a new topic and letter blocks
will be given.</i>

638
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,343
Bus, train.

639
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,805
<i>If three rounds
are completed successfully,</i>

640
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,807
<i>100 million won
will be added to the final prize.</i>

641
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,185
-That's a lot.
<i>-If players</i>

642
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,104
<i>are unable to assemble words
within the time limit,</i>

643
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,481
<i>the prize match ends immediately.</i>

644
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,859
<i>In that case,
no prize money will be added.</i>

645
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,111
<i>If the prize match ends in failure,</i>

646
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,990
<i>players who do not have
complete words on their mats</i>

647
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,992
<i>must return one Piece.</i>

648
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,995
There's a penalty?

649
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,913
-Why do they take but not give?
-I know.

650
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,873
-Goodness.
-Wait...

651
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,958
<i>The prize match will begin</i>

652
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,585
<i>in ten minutes.</i>

653
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,588
I thought it wasn't as hard as expected.

654
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,673
But I shouldn't underestimate it.

655
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,592
I'll just add an "s"
to make the plural of the word.

656
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,219
Since the prize money is 100 million won,

657
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,431
it seems likely that the words
will be very difficult.

658
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,893
<i>We have two people who have lived abroad,</i>

659
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,978
<i>so I think we have a good chance.</i>

660
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,856
I think I can do better in this game

661
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,359
than I did in the games
based on math or puzzles.

662
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,988
The best strategy would be
for Yu-min and me to finish ours first,

663
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:46,367
and then help others assemble their words.

664
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,078
Do we draw numbers to determine our place?

665
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,748
-Players are free to choose their places.
-All right, then...

666
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,542
I think we should be
on opposite sides of the table.

667
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,920
That way we can help people beside us.

668
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,171
That sounds good.

669
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,339
That's what I think.

670
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,548
I don't mind doing that.

671
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,633
Yu-min, come here.

672
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,426
Let the former expats
stand on either side.

673
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,470
Former expats. I feel reassured.

674
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,515
It's disappointing that
Guillaume isn't here for this.

675
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,726
<i>-Right, he's a native speaker.
-If only he was here.</i>

676
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,937
-Guillaume would crush this.
-We should've saved him.

677
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,979
We had a native speaker.

678
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,106
-He could finish this alone.
-He should've been here.

679
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,526
Out of us, the person
who's been overseas the most is him.

680
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,194
-It's Seungkwan.
-You're right.

681
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,071
If we need to assemble airport names,
you need to take charge.

682
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,113
Airport names?

683
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,114
I can do it.

684
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,784
Trust me.

685
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,536
Keep saying what word you're assembling.

686
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,704
-So we don't get duplicates.
-Don't stack them yet.

687
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,956
We might have to start over.

688
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,124
We can lay them out
and then stack them later.

689
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,293
Why did they have to make us do towers?

690
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,795
They want us to take more time.

691
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,714
We need to stack the towers
a minute before time expires.

692
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,007
We need good topics.

693
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,635
I'm anticipating topics
like food and city names.

694
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,594
Fruits.

695
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,805
We're definitely getting country names.

696
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,056
I think we'll do good.

697
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,850
He has a good hunch so let's trust him.

698
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,935
I hope we get science.

699
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,645
-Science?
-Space.

700
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,981
-Planets.
-Yeah, the solar system.

701
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,901
We all went through a lot
during the main match

702
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:06,114
so I hope we have a good time
like we did yesterday.

703
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,741
Now that four people have left our side,

704
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,745
we need to make
everything that happened worthwhile.

705
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,206
So we're determined
to win the prize money.

706
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,875
-Everyone, bring it in.
-Let's go.

707
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,334
-Bring it in. One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

708
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,502
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

709
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,841
<i>The time has expired.</i>

710
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,302
<i>Word Tower begins now.</i>

711
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,847
<i>Within ten minutes,
use all of the letter blocks given</i>

712
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,475
<i>to assemble seven words
related to the topic.</i>

713
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,602
It's coming.

714
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,936
-It's here!
-There's not a lot.

715
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,396
-Let's go.
-Look at the letters.

716
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,023
-Look.
-There are many "A" blocks.

717
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,317
-Yeah?
-I'm guessing it's country names.

718
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,068
There are countries that end with "tan."

719
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,570
-Or maybe Argentina.
-That's right.

720
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,363
-Ones that start with "A," like America.
-There's Poland.

721
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,282
-Yeah, like Poland.
-Finland.

722
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,911
<i>Here is the topic for round one.</i>

723
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,454
-Countries!
-Let's go!

724
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,580
ROUND 1
COUNTRIES

725
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,167
{\an8}-Did someone use an "R"?
-I'm trying to make "Brazil."

726
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,419
{\an8}-I'll do "Italy."
-I'm done.

727
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,129
As soon as I saw the topic,

728
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,714
I knew what to do.

729
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,424
{\an8}-"Qatar."
-That's good.

730
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,092
{\an8}-Where's "J"?
-I'll do "Paris."

731
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,135
{\an8}I'll do "Japan."

732
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,887
{\an8}-"Paris" is a city.
-"Paris."

733
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,013
{\an8}I did "Japan."

734
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,681
{\an8}I had a feeling "Japan" would work.

735
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,934
{\an8}-We can do "India."
-"India"!

736
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,061
{\an8}-You do it.
-"India" works.

737
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,063
{\an8}-Where's "I"?
-That's good.

738
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,064
Where's "A"?

739
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,065
"India."

740
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:22,982
{\an8}I got "Brazil."

741
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,984
{\an8}-I did "Spain."
-You got "Spain"?

742
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,861
{\an8}-"Canada" could work.
-Do "Canada."

743
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,987
{\an8}-It works.
-That's it.

744
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,447
{\an8}-Where's "I"?
-"Canada."

745
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,907
{\an8}We have blocks left.

746
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,200
{\an8}-There are some left.
-"Finland."

747
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,035
{\an8}-"Finland."
-"Finland."

748
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,703
{\an8}-We got "Finland."
-Good job.

749
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,246
-Stack your blocks!
-Stack them!

750
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,415
-The first letter goes top.
-That's right. "India."

751
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,833
The order doesn't matter, right?

752
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,543
-You start from the top.
-It's from the top.

753
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,087
-"Qatar."
-"Spain."

754
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,463
-"Canada."
-"Canada."

755
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,006
-"Brazil."
-"Qatar."

756
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,591
-"Japan."
-"Finland."

757
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,510
-Are you stacking it?
-This looked hard so I chose it.

758
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,636
We only took a minute. No way.

759
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,971
-<i>You have succeeded.</i>
-That was crazy.

760
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,055
I'm amazed you got "Qatar."

761
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,473
I deliberately chose it.

762
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,100
I thought it would be the hardest.

763
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,393
-I'm glad you survived!
-Good job.

764
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,519
That's why I chose to do it.

765
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,938
-Country names rarely include "Q."
-Exactly.

766
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,274
I thought "Q" would be the hardest,
so I picked that block first.

767
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,987
That way the others
could use the easier letters.

768
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,988
Good job.

769
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,823
-His hunch was accurate.
-Yu-min, good job.

770
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,783
-Why is your hunch so good?
-Right?

771
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,994
-It was.
-All the time.

772
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,162
We're definitely getting country names.

773
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,247
It's highly plausible.

774
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,373
Finland.

775
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,416
It's coming.

776
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,792
Look at the letters.

777
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,004
The number of blocks
is 20 plus 12, which is 32...

778
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,380
-How many are there?
-Thirty-two...

779
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,216
-Thirty-two, thirty...
-I see "October."

780
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,301
-Five blocks each.
-Is the topic months?

781
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,929
-I'm guessing five each.
-It could be months.

782
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,181
-Five per word?
-Five on average.

783
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,516
About three to seven.

784
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,810
<i>Here is the topic for round two.</i>

785
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,186
Is it months?

786
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,104
{\an8}-Fruits.
-Fruits.

787
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,898
{\an8}-I'll do "apple."
-I got "banana."

788
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,899
{\an8}-"Apple"?
-I got "banana."

789
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,276
{\an8}-I'll do "orange."
-"Carrot"?

790
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,527
{\an8}What should I do?

791
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,237
{\an8}I'll try "watermelon."

792
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,114
{\an8}-"Watermelon."
-Where's "B"?

793
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,574
{\an8}-Where's "B"?
-What fruit are you doing?

794
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,826
{\an8}-"Apple."
-Oh, you are?

795
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,578
{\an8}-What else is there?
-I can't do "carrot."

796
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,954
{\an8}-Where's "N"?
-"Watermelon."

797
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,539
{\an8}-Where is it?
-We're out.

798
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,082
{\an8}-Is there a "G"?
-Is there an "A"?

799
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,042
{\an8}What starts with "U"?

800
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,251
{\an8}It suddenly got hard.

801
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,377
{\an8}-Do we have an "N"?
-I'll do orange.

802
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,378
{\an8}-All right.
-Okay.

803
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,796
{\an8}-"Y."
-This is tough.

804
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,214
{\an8}-"Coconut."
-"Coconut" works.

805
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,216
{\an8}-"Coconut."
-Here, "N, U, T."

806
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,509
{\an8}-"N, U, T."
-"N, U, T."

807
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,635
{\an8}-Take the "N."
-"N."

808
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,387
{\an8}-Do "kiwi."
-"Kiwi."

809
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,514
{\an8}-"Kiwi."
-We can do "kiwi."

810
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,849
{\an8}-Do "kiwi."
-"Kiwi."

811
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,059
{\an8}-"Banana."
-What about "peach"?

812
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,393
{\an8}-We can't do "banana."
-Does "peach" work?

813
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,895
{\an8}-It could work. "A."
-"Peach."

814
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,480
{\an8}-"Peach."
-"C" then "H."

815
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,106
{\an8}-We need to use "U."
-"C" then "H."

816
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,357
{\an8}-"H."
-"H."

817
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,234
{\an8}-"Peach" is done.
-"Y," "U."

818
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,236
{\an8}-"Pear."
-"Pear."

819
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,363
{\an8}-Okay. "E" and "R."
-"Pear."

820
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,948
{\an8}-"A" is here.
-"A, R."

821
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,075
{\an8}-Okay.
-"Pear."

822
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,451
{\an8}-Take it.
-We got it.

823
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,494
{\an8}This is the issue.

824
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,162
{\an8}-What has a "V"?
-Raspberry.

825
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,081
{\an8}-"V."
-Fruit?

826
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,499
{\an8}-What has a "V"?
-We have time.

827
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,917
{\an8}-Fruit that has a "V."
-Take your time.

828
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,587
"Avocado."

829
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,963
"Avocado" is a fruit?

830
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,840
{\an8}It's "avocado."

831
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,342
{\an8}-Where's the "V"? Oh, it's here.
-"V."

832
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,802
{\an8}-I see it.
-It's here.

833
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,595
{\an8}-All right.
-"Avocado."

834
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,888
-"Avocado" is a sure answer.
-There.

835
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,473
-Okay.
-Take it.

836
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,891
{\an8}-There's no "O."
-There isn't?

837
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,769
{\an8}-There's no "O" left.
-Take it from "coconut" or "orange."

838
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,146
{\an8}Let's get rid of "orange."
I think "avocado" is more likely.

839
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,106
{\an8}There's no "D" left, right?

840
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,066
{\an8}-What about "coconut"?
-"Orange" sounds right.

841
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,360
{\an8}Since we know "orange" works,
let's disassemble it.

842
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,402
{\an8}Disassemble it.

843
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,655
{\an8}-Let's assemble "avocado."
-Do "avocado."

844
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,366
{\an8}-Do "avocado" first.
-"V" only works with "avocado."

845
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,492
{\an8}-And then?
-I'm sure this is right.

846
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,327
{\an8}What can we do with "U" and "G"?

847
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,454
{\an8}-"Strawberry" doesn't work.
-Maybe "grapefruit"?

848
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,914
{\an8}-"Grapefruit"?
-I don't think so.

849
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,165
{\an8}-"Mango."
-"Grapefruit."

850
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,750
{\an8}-"Guava."
-"Guava"!

851
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,127
-"Guava."
-"Guava."

852
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,837
-"Guava."
-"Guava." Nice.

853
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,088
-"Guava."
-That's good.

854
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,798
-I can't think of any.
-What are these?

855
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,966
How many are left? Three?

856
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,592
We don't know what's right yet.

What has a "Y"?

861
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,102
Berries do.

862
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,770
{\an8}-Why don't we call out fruit names?
-Okay.

863
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,688
{\an8}-Mango.
-Mango.

864

{\an8}-Orange.
-Tangerine.

867

{\an8}"Tangerine" is too long.

868

{\an8}-Pineapple?

{\an8}It suddenly got really hard.

{\an8}What else is there?

872
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,787
They wouldn't have made an easy game
with 100 million on the line.

{\an8}-What has a "Y"?

{\an8}"Cherry"?

877
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,257
{\an8}-Right. "Cherry" has a "Y," right?
-"Cherry."

00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,300
-"Cherry."

-That's done.
-Okay.

886
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,352
-So we can't do "peach."
-Why?

887
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,353
There's no "H" left.

888
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,731
-Forget "peach."
-We need to use the "Y."

889
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,649
-We need two.
-Just two more.

{\an8}What other fruit is there?

891

{\an8}We have four minutes.

892
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,946
{\an8}Is it some strange fruit we don't eat?

893
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,074
This isn't a fruit, right?

894
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,659
-What's that?
-"Acorn."

895
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,077
I don't think it is.

896
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,704
The game suddenly got hard.

SUCCESS

936
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,777
You're the best!

937
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,987
That was amazing.

938
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,489
I'm so happy!

939
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,285
I racked my brain for fruit names
and even got to "rambutan."

940
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,954
<i>I looked at the blocks
and instantly made out "durian."</i>

941
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,956
That was a close one.

942
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,457
-"Durian..."
-That was beautiful.

943
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,917
-I don't even eat it.
-"Durian."

944
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,043
We can do it.

945
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,212
I think we can succeed.

946
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,839
-That was close.
-I got "kiwi."

947
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,132
-I got "kiwi."
-A fruit name with "W"?

948
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,425
-Good job.
-It's hard to find.

949
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,135
How could there be no "apple"?

950
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,637
-I know. We even got rid of "orange."
-Everyone loves apples.

951
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,972
Let's do our best in the last round.

952
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,473
-Let's go!
-This is hard.

953
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,558
It's a tough game.

954
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,601
-It'll probably get a lot harder.
-Right.

955
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,354
They won't be common words like "banana."

956
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,814
-It's more complicated.
-Exactly.

957
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,691
-They'll be really hard words.
-Like "guava."

958
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,942
-Think outside the box.
-Let's see.

959
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,860
It looks similar.

960
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,445
The number of blocks is similar.

961
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,113
-I guess they're about the same each time.
-Looks like it.

962
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,116
"B," "R," "F," "P."

963
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,868
There are a lot of "G"s and "U"s.

964
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,286
There's an "X."

965
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,537
-"X"?
-"X."

966
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,872
-What could it be?
-There's a "W."

967
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,956
-"F."
-Let's see.

968
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,168
<i>Here is the topic for round three.</i>

969
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,462
Animals!

970
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,921
{\an8}-Let's go.
-This has to be "fox."

971
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,048
{\an8}-"Fox."
-"Fox."

972
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,508
{\an8}-We got "fox."
-We could do "wolf."

973
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,385
{\an8}-"Wolf."
-"Wolf."

974
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,470
{\an8}Do the short ones first.

975
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,471
{\an8}There's "pig."

976
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,513
{\an8}-"Pig."
-"Pig."

977
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,765
{\an8}-"Elephant."
-"Elephant."

978
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,308
{\an8}-"Elephant."
-That's good.

979
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,601
{\an8}-"Elephant."
-We need an "H."

980
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,019
{\an8}-Where's "H"?
-There's no "H."

981
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,645
{\an8}-There's none.
-We can't do "elephant."

982
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,772
{\an8}This doesn't work.

983
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,898
{\an8}"Zebra"?

984
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,940
{\an8}-"Zebra."
-"Zebra."

985
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,359
{\an8}-"Zebra."
-"Zebra."

986
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,943
{\an8}Here's an "A."

987
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,445
{\an8}-Take "zebra."
-Okay, we got "zebra."

988
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,613
{\an8}We could do "turtle."

989
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,989
{\an8}-Do it.
-It works.

990
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,616
{\an8}-We can do "turtle."
-That's done.

991
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,784
-This is good.
-"Turtle."

992
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,369
-It works.
-Okay.

993
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,704
{\an8}-What about "rabbit"?
-"Rabbit"!

994
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,539
{\an8}-"Rabbit."
-"Rabbit."

995
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,624
{\an8}-"B."
-"Rabbit."

996
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,125
{\an8}-"B, I, T."
-But there's only one "B."

997
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,794
{\an8}-We have "zebra."
-Leave "zebra."

998
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,213
{\an8}-We have to keep this.
-"Zebra" is the only one for "Z," right?

999
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,340
{\an8}-It's the only "Z."
-Then...

1000
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,092
{\an8}-"Crocodile."
-"Jaguar"? Nevermind.

1001
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,511
-I don't know anymore.
-This is tough.

1002
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,471
-We can do it.
-This is a hard topic.

1003
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,223
-We can do it.
-We have time.

1004
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,558
-Try the Chinese zodiac signs.
-Don't give up.

1005
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,643
{\an8}-The signs...
-Rat!

1006
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,977
{\an8}-"Rat."
-"Rat."

1007
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,188
{\an8}-There's no "T."
-Our answers are too short.

1008
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,606
{\an8}-They're too short.
-They have to be longer.

1009
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,899
{\an8}There's rat and...

1010
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,943
{\an8}Could it not be "fox"?

1011
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,821
{\an8}Could there be something before "fox"?

1012
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,114
{\an8}There's "red fox."

1013
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,615
{\an8}-Right. Should we try that?
-Yeah, something like that.

1014
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,200
{\an8}-"Red fox."
-"Red fox."

1015
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,119
{\an8}-There's no "D."
-I see.

1016
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,453
{\an8}"Red panda"?

1017
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,454
{\an8}-"Panda"?
-"Panda"?

1018
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,414
{\an8}-"Red..."
-"Panda."

1019
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,790
{\an8}-"Panda."
-"D."

1020
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,291
{\an8}-There's no "D."
-That's right.

1021
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,668
{\an8}-It's not "panda."
-What else?

1022
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,545
-What else is there?
-This might not be right.

1023
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,296
-I'll put this here.
-Yeah, for now.

1024
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,090
-There are too many "F"s.
-Right.

1025
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,384
{\an8}-There are two more.
-That's a lot of them.

1026
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,677
{\an8}What has an "F"?

1027
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,720
{\an8}We already did "fox."

1028
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,973
"Giraffe"?

1029
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,349
-"Giraffe..."
-"Giraffe"?

1030
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,518
-Let's try.
-Since it has a lot of "F"s.

1031
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,936
-It works.
-"F, F."

1032
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,104
-It works.
-It's done.

1033
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,021
-It works.
-It's "F, F, E," right?

1034
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,606
-Hang on, "A." "Giraffe."
-"F, F, E."

1035
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,024
-It works.
-That's good.

1036
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,734
-Good job, Yu-min!
-Okay.

1037
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,695
-Good job!
-Next.

1038
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,780
{\an8}"Koala"? That doesn't work.

1039
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,031
{\an8}-Neither does "kangaroo."
-Right.

1040
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,408
{\an8}"Monkey"?

1041
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,993
{\an8}-"Monkey"?
-There's no "K."

1042
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,202
{\an8}-What about "buffalo"?
-"Buffalo"?

1043
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,204
{\an8}-It has two "F"s.
-That works.

1044
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,747
{\an8}-But...
-We need an "A."

1045
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,416
{\an8}-There's no "A."
-Right.

1046
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,792
{\an8}We have to take it from somewhere.

1047
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,961
{\an8}"Zebra" has to be an answer, right?

1048
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,087
{\an8}I think so.

1049
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,089
{\an8}-Not a lot of animals have "Z"s in them.
-That's right.

1050
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,924
{\an8}Is "wolf" too simple?

1051
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,426
{\an8}What else has a "W"?

1052
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,635
{\an8}-"Whale"?
-"Whale."

1053
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,137
{\an8}-"Whale"?
-Is there an "H"?

1054
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,597
{\an8}There's no "H."

1055
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,474
-"Buffoon."
-There's the "U."

1056
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,309
-And an "N." "Buffoon."
-What's that?

1057
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,685
-What's a buffoon?
-It's a type of monkey.

1058
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,061
A type of monkey?

1059
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,231
The production crew
probably didn't expect us to know.

1060
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,400
{\an8}-What has a "P"?
-I'm not sure about "buffoon."

1061
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,902
{\an8}Pig, panda...

1062
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,528
{\an8}-Does "penguin" work?
-"Penguin"?

1063
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,654
{\an8}-Does it work?
-It could work.

1064
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,406
{\an8}-Try it.
-Here's the "N."

1065
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,574
{\an8}-Good.
-We got "penguin."

1066
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,451
{\an8}-Let's go with that.
-This is a sure answer.

1067
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,536
-"Penguin" is definitely an answer. "Pig..."
-That's good.

1068
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,330
-We have to use all the blocks, right?
-Yeah.

1069
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,290
-Yeah.
-These are all right.

1070
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,791
{\an8}-Wait, "wolf."
-"Wolf."

1071
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,876
{\an8}We need one more.

1072
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,586
{\an8}-"Fox."
-Is there something before "fox"?

1073
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,545
{\an8}What kind of fox?

1074
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,839
{\an8}-We have to guess what comes before.
-What's this?

1075
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,257
{\an8}What foxes are there?

1076
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,842
Wait, do this.

1077
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,929
"FBY fox."

1078
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:56,764
"FBY."

1079
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,141
-Not "FBI"?
-No, "FBY fox."

1080
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,394
<i>The players have assembled
seven animal names.</i>

1081
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,980
<i>However, three letter blocks are left.</i>

1082
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,774
<i>To succeed in this round,</i>

1083
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:11,862
<i>the players must give up on
the words they currently have.</i>

1084
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,821
"Penguin" seems right.

1085
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,281
-I agree.
-I think so too.

1086
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:17,993
It might be something like this.

1087
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,454
This doesn't make any sense.

1088
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,541
-Is "turtle" wrong?
-We're doomed.

1089
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,879
I started to doubt whether we could do it.

1090
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,714
What word do we give up on?

1091
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,384
Humans generally have a tendency

1092
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,512
<i>to think the answer they thought of
is definitely right.</i>

1093
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,015
The worst-case scenario is when
that answer isn't the right answer.

1094
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,476
What else has an "X"? "Fox" seems right.

1095
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,562
It's hard to think of a name with "X."

1096
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,480
Let's leave the "fox."

1097
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,940
{\an8}-Should we try this again?
-"Turtle"?

1098
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,567
{\an8}We know it's an option.
Don't mess up the blocks.

1099
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,776
{\an8}-Just leave this.
-We have "fox."

1100
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,528
Leave "giraffe."

1101
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,697
These letters can't make anything.

1102
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,075
{\an8}-"Bird."
-"Bird"?

1103
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,994
{\an8}-It won't work.
-Maybe a type of bird. "Eagle."

1104
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,870
{\an8}What has a "Y"?

1105
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,622
{\an8}"Y..."

1106
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,380
-What about insects?
-That could work.

1107
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,801
{\an8}-"Fly."
-"Fly."

1108
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,094
{\an8}-"Butterfly"!
-"Firefly"?

1109
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,137
{\an8}-"Butterfly"!
-"Butterfly"!

1110
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,054
{\an8}-"Butterfly"!
-"Firefly"?

1111
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,681
{\an8}-"Butterfly"!
-"Butterfly"!

1112
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,642
<i>You're shining so bright</i>

1113
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,561
<i>-I'm in love with you</i>
-"Butterfly."

1114
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,771
-Take "pig."
-Hurry!

1115
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,939
-Stack them.
-We got it.

1116
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,278
-Does "butterfly" work?
-It should. Just give it a go.

1117
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,155
Stack them.

1118
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,700
-Are we good?
-Yeah.

1119
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,702
-Let's do it together.
-Can you help me with this?

1120
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,579
-Start from the bottom.
-Take it slow.

1121
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,205
-Slow down.
-Hold it.

1122
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,915
-It worked.
-"Butterfly"!

1123
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,709
-That was crazy.
-That was crazy.

1124
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,670
-Let's see if we got it!
-<i>Shining bright like the sun</i>

1125
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,297
<i>You have succeeded.</i>

1126
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,341
<i>You have passed all three rounds.</i>

1127
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,301
<i>The prize match has ended successfully.</i>

1128
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,679
-We did it.
-Who said "butterfly"?

1129
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,097
-It was me!
-Amazing!

1130
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,182
-Oh, my gosh!
-I'm so happy!

1131
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,683
-I'm so glad.
-This is great.

1132
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,310
I'm so happy.

1133
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,187
<i>100 million has been added
to the final prize.</i>

1134
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,191
<i>The final prize is now 150 million won.</i>

1135
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,109
Getting rid of "turtle" was huge.

1136
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,279
-"Butterfly"!
-"Butterfly."

1137
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,031
<i>When I heard "insects,"</i>

1138
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,741
I thought of "butterfly."

1139
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,534
<i>We were on the verge of giving up.</i>

1140
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,452
That was fun.

1141
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,372
We had great teamwork.

1142
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,124
It worked because everyone
was chipping in with suggestions.

1143
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,460
It's fun putting our heads together.

1144
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,380
It was good we left
"zebra," "giraffe," and "wolf."

1145
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,256
It was brave to get rid of "turtle."

1146
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,051
Very nice, very nice.

1147
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,427
That was dramatic.

1148
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,055
Good job, everybody.

1149
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,015
<i>The prize match has ended.</i>

1150
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,228
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

1151
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,064
I can go back with a light heart.

1152
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,274
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1153
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,151
Let's go!

1154
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,948
Anyone want a drink?

1155
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,991
-Why is your hunch so good?
-Success.

1156
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,285
It's pure good luck.

1157
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,830
-It was obvious what topics we'd get.
-"Butterfly." That was amazing.

1158
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,706
"Butterfly" and "durian" were amazing.

1159
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,291
-Good job.
-"Durian" was great.

1160
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,961
We lose our friendship in the main match.

1161
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,256
Then we salvage it during the prize match.

1162
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,591
It's such a brutal system.

1163
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,884
Anyone want a drink?

1164
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,012
-I should drink something.
-You should before you faint.

1165
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,098
Why don't we have ice cream?

1166
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,225
Sounds good. I could use something sweet.

1167
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,520
Good job, Yu-min.

1168
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,481
-You were of big help.
-We couldn't have done it without you.

1169
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,151
Our camaraderie is so high right now.

1170
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,277
I'll be honest.

1171
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,030
I thought I'd be gone in one or two days.

1172
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,740
So I didn't bring a lot of stuff.

1173
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,034
-You brought a lot of stuff.
-Well, I mean...

1174
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,329
-My stylist packed them for me.
-You have two massive bags.

1175
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,498
I only have one pair of underwear left.

1176
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,749
-Really?
-Really?

1177
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,501
I have a spare one from going to prison.

1178
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,003
I didn't change that day.

1179
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,058
-You're done?
-Yeah.

1180
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,810
Good.

1181
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,396
It's just like a hotel here.

1182
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,814
Everything is great except for the food.

1183
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,733
We have wet wipes.

1184
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,526
-We do?
-Yeah.

1185
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,361
-Someone gave it to you?
-Kyeong-rim did.

1186
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,238
Nice. This is just like a hotel.

1187
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,327
This is better than
most hostels I've been to.

1188
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,703
I love it here.

1189
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,580
<i>It's so cozy. I love it.</i>

1190
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,207
The bed is comfortable
and I have everything I need.

1191
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,251
-You're not married, are you?
-Sorry?

1192
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,377
You're not married, right?

1193
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,837
-Me? I'm married.
-Yeah.

1194
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,130
What?

1195
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,925
-Really?
-What's so surprising?

1196
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,468
-I assumed you were single.
-Really?

1197
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,637
Yeah. When did you get married?

1198
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,347
I'm single.

1199
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,185
You're so gullible.

1200
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,561
-You...
-You fell for it.

1201
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,980
You know how to lie?
I should be careful tomorrow.

1202
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,484
-Don't target me tomorrow.
-You're so gullible.

1203
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,615
Before prison,
Seungkwan and I didn't have any...

1204
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,950
You guys had no connection.

1205
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,536
-You didn't have connections with anyone.
-Right.

1206
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,913
You like to play alone like Seok-jin does.

1207
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,331
I sort of do.

1208
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,251
I guess prison is helping me create bonds.

1209
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,254
As a long-term convict...

1210
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,340
-As the prison leader...
-I'll bring everyone to my side.

1211
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,634
Which person getting eliminated
would sadden you most?

1212
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,718
Tomorrow?

1213
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,554
I'd say Yu-min.

1214
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,347
<i>-For tomorrow?
-Yeah.</i>

1215
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,475
It's going to get
a lot sadder from now on.

1216
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,936
To be honest,

1217
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,813
I thought I wouldn't cry.

1218
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,232
But I almost shed a tear a while ago,

1219
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,650
seeing everyone cry.

1220
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,612
As time passes,
we're getting really close.

1221
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,156
We'll all be together for a week at most.

1222
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,535
How do we feel so much camaraderie
with complete strangers?

1223
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,662
We spend the day
going through all sorts of emotions.

1224
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,830
That's really impactful.

1225
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,083
It's only been three days
and I miss everybody.

1226
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,710
<i>I miss Guillaume.</i>

1227
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,253
<i>I miss Dong-jae too.</i>

1228
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,630
He'd say, "Hey, Kyeong-rim!"
in Ryu Jun-yeol's tone.

1229
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,009
Dong-jae.

1230
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,478
-Hey.
-Seok-jin.

1231
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,105
Show me your Pieces.

1232
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,649
-Did you find something?
-Yeah.

1233
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,900
I think we can do something with them.

1234
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,152
Can we draw the curtains?

1235
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,697
We should just act natural.

1236
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,365
Let's not draw the curtains.

1237
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,117
Just pretend we're talking.

1238
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,719
I don't know when we should do this.

1239
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,971
This might not be the right time.

1240
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,601
We could talk later at night.

1241
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,769
-Should we?
-Yeah.

1242
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,855
All right.

1243
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,983
They might target us again tomorrow

1244
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,568
if they see us here.

1245
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,154
I honestly don't get it.
The whole alliance thing...

1246
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,947
-If they...
-If we're going to be in one,

1247
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,240
we should commit.

1248
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,827
They said they're going to
target people in alliances.

1249
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,872
-But they're the ones in an alliance.
-You're right.

1250
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,499
The betrayal itself isn't wrong.

1251
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,043
They took on the risk by trusting you.

1252
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,337
That's why I told you
not to think that way

1253
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,463
when you were crying.

1254
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,839
-We all took risks.
-Don't think that way.

1255
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,466
We're all at risk.

1256
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,260
Everyone here can betray anyone.

1257
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,097
And at some point,
we'll all have to betray each other.

1258
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,932
-Right.
-Everyone except ourselves.

1259
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,313
I'll go out in a bit.

1260
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,957
What's that?

1261
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,917
"Nine Men's Morris"?

1262
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,627
The board game?

1263
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,505
It's like a connect-three game.

1264
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,383
<i>Nine Men's Morris.</i>

1265
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,427
<i>Known to be one of the oldest board games,</i>

1266
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,887
<i>it is said to have been enjoyed
by ancient Romans.</i>

1267
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,015
<i>Each player begins with nine pieces.</i>

1268
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,309
<i>By placing pieces on the dots
and forming a row of three,</i>

1269
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,687
<i>a player can remove an opponent's piece.</i>

1270
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,106
<i>It is a very simple but strategic game</i>

1271
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,316
<i>played by two people against each other.</i>

1272
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,862
If I place three pieces in a row,
I take one of my opponent's pieces.

1273
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,905
-Any piece?
-Yeah.

1274
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,534
You get rid of your opponent's pieces
by placing three of yours in a row.

1275
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,078
This...

1276
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,290
This could be the final match.

1277
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,458
That's possible.

1278
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,501
Right?

1279
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,809
The most important thing is...

1280
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,394
It's eleven o'clock already?

1281
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,191
-Lights out?
-That's scary.

1282
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,526
-They're turning the lights off.
-Do these lights go out?

1283
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,986
I think so. Yeah, they do.

1284
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,655
-How about that one?
-It doesn't go out.

1285
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,823
How do we sleep?

1286
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,116
We have sleeping masks.

1287
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,410
Sleeping masks?

1288
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,957
Why won't that go out?

1289
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:30,170
Once again, I've failed
to solve this puzzle.

1290
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,173
I hope we get a good game tomorrow.

1291
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,675
On the first day,
we played a game of lying.

1292
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,803
On the second day, we had a race.

1293
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,721
On the third day,
we played a game based on information.

1294
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,889
What game will be next?

1295
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,517
I think it might be an auction.

1296
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,518
Auction?

1297
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,896
Yeah. It could be an auction
where we make a bid with our Pieces.

1298
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,899
Seok-jin has four Pieces right now.

1299
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,109
-He initially only had three.
-Right.

1300
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,778
But he bet that I was going to prison,
so he got one.

1301
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,279
Really?

1302
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,698
-That's why he has four now?
-Yeah.

1303
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,575
I thought about writing my name down.

1304
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,202
But I didn't

1305
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,621
because I knew I wouldn't lose the game.

1306
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,623
Seok-jin is probably
the only one who got it.

1307
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,042
I don't think anyone else wrote my name.

1308
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,502
<i>-Joon-bin.
-Joon-bin.</i>

1309
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,006
-Good work today, everybody.
-Let's go to bed.

1310
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:15,924
-Is this mine?
-Let's go.

1311
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:16,925
Good night, everyone.

1312
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,635
-Good night.
-Sleep well.

1313
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:21,096
-Good night.
-See you tomorrow.

1314
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,394
Dong-jae...

1315
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,021
It feels like he's still here.

1316
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,232
How ridiculous.

1317
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,861
1:10 A.M.

1318
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,792
-You startled me.
-I'm sorry.

1319
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,044
-That's all right.
-I didn't see.

1320
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,630
I was about to leave.

1321
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,007
-You were?
-Yeah.

1322
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,842
-I couldn't wait.
-Right.

1323
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,637
This Piece right here.

1324
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,348
This is the first type of Piece we got.

1325
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,935
In the second round,
you finished first and got this Piece.

1326
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,146
-This is from back then.
-Right.

1327
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,647
This is from round three.

1328
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,566
One, two, three.

1329
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,986
We might be able
to do something with these.

1330
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,824
-So...
-What can we do?

1331
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,995
I wanted to see what
Kyeong-rim's Piece looked like.

1332
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:31,041
-When you were with her, I brought it up.
-Right.

1333
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,500
What do you have in here?

1334
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,211
My lip balm and earplugs.

1335
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,923
-She got a Piece in prison.
-Right.

1336
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,341
I didn't get a look though.

1337
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,468
She didn't take hers out.

1338
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,054
The Pieces are slightly different.

1339
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,013
Really?

1340
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:48,183
-Kyeong-rim is very sharp.
-She is.

1341
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,686
I think she got a feeling about her Piece.

1342
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,901
Why are you so intent
on figuring this out?

1343
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,195
I want to survive.

1344
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,960
{\an8}Is there a significance to the pattern?

1345
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,212
Look here.

1346
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,839
Doesn't it look like
we can make a door of some sort?

1347
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,093
-These lines here?
-Or are these just part of the design?

1348
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,636
The Pieces fit.

1349
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,888
-The Pieces fit.
-Like this?

1350
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,767
I don't think we can
complete the puzzle just yet.

1351
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,436
-I think we can.
-With just three?

1352
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,355
With Pieces just from three rounds?

1353
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,943
I'm going to solve this
even if I have to sleep here.

1354
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,780
I knew the Pieces would be key.

1355
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,659
<i>We succeeded in the prize match,
but overall, it was a bad day for me.</i>

1356
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:52,414
<i>I needed something
that could make things better.</i>

1357
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,708
You know what you look like?

1358
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,959
You're like a mad scientist.

1359
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,964
You're like a lone scientist
who was driven mad by her research.

1360
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:07,345
2:30 A.M.

1361
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,264
{\an8}These are from rounds one and two.

1362
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:14,019
{\an8}The Piece from round three
is asymmetrical.

1363
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,771
{\an8}What significance
does the asymmetry hold here?

1364
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:08,091
