1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>Today's the last day.</i>

2
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,815
<i>My nerves are shot and I'm in a bad state.</i>

3
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,444
<i>I got a nosebleed
for the first time in a while.</i>

4
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,572
<i>I'm not in the best condition right now.</i>

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,450
{\an8}Let's still give it my best.

6
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,622
<i>I slept so well.</i>

7
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,832
<i>I really did.</i>

8
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>My shoulders are a bit stiff</i>

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,419
<i>but I think I'm the fittest person here.</i>

10
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,336
Did you wash up?

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,630
-I did.
-You did?

12
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,591
They want us ready by 9:30 a.m.

13
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,885
-By 9:30 a.m.?
-The makeup team will be here.

14
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,527
Were you reading?

15
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,529
I wanted to calm my mind down.

16
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,739
-I got a nosebleed.
-Really?

17
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,074
Yeah, in the bathroom.

18
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,034
-Due to exhaustion?
-I'm not sure.

19
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,870
-Is it due to the dry air? Stress?
-Maybe.

20
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,081
We've been through a lot,
but today's the last day.

21
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,791
After this, we can go home.

22
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,418
There used to be a lot of food.

23
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,796
This is still a lot though.

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,714
-It's a lot for us two.
-Yeah.

25
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,090
I hope they get here soon.

26
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,884
Me too.

27
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,720
We can't leave any records of this.

28
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,263
We don't have our phones.

29
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,390
I don't think we would've been allowed
to take pictures anyway.

30
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,768
I really want to remember all of this.

31
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,685
Same.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,461
{\an8}We'll get started soon.

33
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,546
{\an8}All right.

34
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,756
{\an8}-Have a seat.
-Okay.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,342
{\an8}FIRST INTERVIEW

36
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,137
Hello.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,138
Hello.

38
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,347
-Hello.
-Hello.

39
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,516
<i>With people like ORBIT,</i>

40
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,729
I immediately realized
no one here can be underestimated.

41
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,189
I'm Ha Seok-jin.

42
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,399
Nice to meet you.

43
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,317
A player that caught my attention?

44
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,028
Well, personally...

45
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,990
I would have to say Seok-jin.

46
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,366
I'm the officer.

47
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,742
I'm the officer!

48
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,202
<i>He's the most intimidating opponent.</i>

49
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,829
{\an8}He's a leader.

50
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,956
<i>And he has his own style of playing.</i>

51
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,457
<i>For having the least Pieces,</i>

52
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,543
<i>Seok-jin and See-won</i>

53
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,670
<i>-will go to prison.</i>
-What? That's how it is?

54
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,339
<i>He tends to lead by action, not words.</i>

55
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,884
<i>He's also quite reserved.</i>

56
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,722
In the same way
that I play by my principles,

57
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,725
<i>he also did the same.</i>

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,934
<i>You have won.</i>

59
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,520
...for 13 Pieces.

60
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,772
I'd personally like to see
skill-based eliminations.

61
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,983
Is this <i>The Devil's Plan</i>
or The Moocher's Plan?

62
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,902
It was a high-quality game.

63
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,069
If only we played individually.

64
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,696
<i>I fear players like him.</i>

65
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,323
Let me tell you the winning strategy.

66
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>ORBIT is amazing at playing games
he's never played before</i>

67
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,538
<i>as if he's familiar with them already.</i>

68
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,415
<i>He's adept at understanding games.</i>

69
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,791
I'm the first player to go.

70
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,293
Then I should place my piece here.

71
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,171
The order is R, P, Y, B, then G.

72
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,424
<i>He tends to create codes
and formulas beforehand.</i>

73
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,093
{\an8}And I expect him to display
such skills again today.

74
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>His weakness?</i>

75
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,721
No!

76
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:46,684
<i>When he makes a mistake,
he tends to react a bit sensitively.</i>

77
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,270
-I thought you could save him.
-No, it's not possible.

78
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,356
It's like I'm watching
the fall of the welfare state.

79
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,899
This wasn't my intention.

80
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,651
<i>I was able to maintain composure</i>

81
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,488
due to all the lessons
my life has taught me.

82
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:03,117
<i>I've learned that it's better
to hide my emotions in certain situations.</i>

83
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,453
<i>I wonder if I survived this long
because of that.</i>

84
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:10,166
We're both on the older side
compared to the others

85
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,585
<i>and we made it to the finals.</i>

86
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,296
<i>This could give hope
to people in their forties.</i>

87
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,257
We can take on new challenges.

88
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,716
<i>I'll do everything I can.</i>

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,260
I want to see how far I can go.

90
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,719
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

91
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,014
Oh, boy.

92
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,871
{\an8}ELIMINATED ON DAY 2
GUILLAUME

93
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,498
{\an8}Wow. Seriously?

94
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,917
-Guillaume.
-Congratulations.

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,712
Hey, roommate!

96
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,088
My roommate!

97
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,591
I knew you'd make it.

98
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,885
-How have you been?
-I knew you would.

99
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,096
The two brains made it.

100
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,472
You didn't know it was us?

101
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,890
-I didn't.
-You had no idea?

102
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,267
-I had no idea.
-What?

103
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,396
You would've loved some of the games.

104
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,691
-I wish you were here yesterday.
-You would've dominated it.

105
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,067
-Really? I'm curious.
-We were amateurs.

106
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,110
-I'm curious.
-We played Hi-Lo.

107
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,194
Amongst amateurs.

108
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,321
-You did?
-Yeah.

109
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,655
You would've beaten us all.

110
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,115
It would've been child's play for you.

111
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,491
-Exactly.
-Yeah?

112
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,868
-That's great.
-Have a seat.

113
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,162
-You guys did great.
-You left your underwear, didn't you?

114
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,289
-When I got home, my socks were missing.
-Were they?

115
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,419
ELIMINATED ON DAY 3
LEE HYE-SUNG, KIM DONG-JAE

116
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,754
-Dong-jae and Hye-sung.
-Hello.

117
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,796
Dong-jae.

118
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,881
Hello.

119
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,968
-Who are the finalists?
-I'm sorry, Hye-sung.

120
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,720
It's me and Seok-jin.

121
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,680
-Really?
-Yeah.

122
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,015
You two are the finalists?

123
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,226
-Congratulations!
-I'm sorry.

124
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,437
I still feel so bad.

125
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,521
I really do.

126
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,024
-I'm going to make you feel bad forever.
-Exactly.

127
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,526
{\an8}You did great.

128
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,321
One, two, three.

129
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,033
Someone's here.

130
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,702
Goodness.

131
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,287
{\an8}ELIMINATED ON DAY 5
CHO YEON-WOO, LEE SEE-WON

132
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,498
{\an8}-See-won.
-Hello, everyone.

133
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,666
-We're here.
-What happened to you?

134
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,919
-Hye-sung.
-Long time no see.

135
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:18,836
-It's been a while.
-Dong-jae.

136
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,463
I was so surprised.

137
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,882
See-won, Seok-jin made it to the finals.

138
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,095
-Did something good happen?
-Guillaume!

139
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,056
How did you get eliminated?

140
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,767
I had a glorious death.

141
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,228
I really needed you in prison.

142
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,938
-You did?
-You would've helped me a lot.

143
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,855
Why?

144
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,357
Seok-jin.

145
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,859
I made it.

146
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,237
You said you didn't get
why people cry during games.

147
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,740
After you left,

148
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,118
I sobbed my eyes out.

149
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,744
{\an8}I'm proud of you. Thank you.

150
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,913
Thank you.

151
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,332
I cried so much alone.

152
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,626
I thought you couldn't understand.

153
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,087
No way. I don't get to say goodbye?

154
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,181
I thought I was a heartless bastard.

155
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,432
I broke you.

156
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,352
I guess you do have a heart in there.

157
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,896
-It was tough.
-So you made it to the finals?

158
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,441
-I made it here by sacrificing you.
-How could you...

159
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,402
-Seriously, Seok-jin. Did you hear?
-How could you?

160
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,446
It's time for our guest singer.

161

ELIMINATED ON DAY 6
PARK KYEONG-RIM, SEUNGKWAN

162
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,789
-Kyeong-rim!
-Welcome.

163
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,209
ELIMINATED ON DAY 6
SUH YU-MIN

164
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,711
-Yu-min!
-Seungkwan!

165
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,546
-Yeon-woo!
-Long time no see.

166
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,090
-You said you weren't going to the finals!
-Did you get Korean barbecue?

167
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,885
Why is it you two?
It should be Dong-joo and Seok-jin.

168
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,554
-Joon-bin.
-You did a great job.

169
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,806
Good job.

170
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,184
Why are you two the finalists?
What happened to Dong-joo?

171
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,519
How could you just leave us like that?

172
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,356
-Do you know how shocked I was?
-I still succeeded in a way.

173
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,484
-Dong-jae, I'm sorry.
-How was life without me?

174
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,360
I wanted to win for you.

175
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,154
You three should make up.

176
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,864
Hey, Seungkwan.

177
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,948
What happened?

178
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,075
Who are the finalists?

179
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,619
-Are you one of them?
-Yeah.

180
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,120
Are you serious?

181
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,914
-How could you?
-It's going to be intense.

182
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,874
-Curse me all you want.
-Who's the other one?

183
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,626
-I'm so excited.
-I'm not going to curse you.

184
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,836
Seok-jin, you can win this!

185
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,630
-Seok-jin, you got this!
-Wait a minute.

186
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,633
Is Dong-joo not here yet?

187
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,009
Wait.

188
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,177
Dong-joo's not here.

189
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,679
-She's the only one who's not here, right?
-Why isn't she here?

190
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,724
{\an8}ELIMINATED ON DAY 6
SUH DONG-JOO

191
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,100
{\an8}Dong-joo!

192
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,977
{\an8}-Dong-joo.
-Dong-joo!

193
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,604
Why did you get eliminated?

194
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,398
You should've been
the first female winner.

195
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,775
Joon-bin was giving me a hard time.

196
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,444
-At the end...
-What happened at the end?

197
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,865
ORBIT made a big mistake.

198
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,118
-No, I'm sure he did it on purpose.
-So I got eliminated.

199
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,246
-Really? You're not joking?
-I'm serious.

200
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,997
There's no way he would've made a mistake.

201
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,290
-I'm serious.
-ORBIT.

202
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,708
Was it really a mistake?

203
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,377
-Watch the show later.
-So...

204
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,128
-I lost my mind.
-He bawled his eyes out.

205
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,964
See-won, I had no chance to say goodbye.

206
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,423
-I heard you had a tough time.
-Things were hectic.

207
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,133
-I heard you did.
-No, it was fine.

208
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,219
-Are you okay?
-Now that it has passed, I'm fine.

209
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,762
I'm excited for today.

210
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,932
Me too. We'll get to watch with no stress.

211
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,141
Did you bring the suit?

212
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,184
Yeah.

213
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,687
-I had them keep it for me.
-So you were set on making it here.

214
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,273
-I wasn't.
-Stop trying to fool us now.

215
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,901
-You were set on making the finals.
-Just be like Joon-bin.

216
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,736
-I wore this during the poster shoot.
-Be openly ambitious.

217
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,489
Just be honest.
You were set on making it to the finals.

218
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,533
-I swear I wasn't.
-You wanted to get rid of us.

219
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,784
You pretended to help.

220
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,327
Sure, you're right.

221
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,370
Go win then.

222
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,581
-Should we sit like we did on day one?
-Should we?

223
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,999
-Like we did on the first day?
-Yeah.

224
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:43,916
I remember where I was.

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,544
-Dong-jae knows how these shows work.
-Just like the first day.

226
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,337
It's such a shame
that you had to go home so quickly.

227
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,923
Should we introduce ourselves?

228
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,341
Shall we?

229
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,343
-We started from there.
-That's a good idea.

230
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,637
Hello, I'm Cho Yeon-woo
and I'm a pro Go player.

231
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,558
Did you say pro inmate?

232
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,101
-Pro inmate.
-Pro inmate.

233
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,855
Hello, I'm Suh Dong-joo
and I'm a lawyer based in America.

234
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,401
I'm Guillaume
and I'm a pro gamer from Canada.

235
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,071
I'm ORBIT and I'm a science communicator.

236
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,657
The great strategist.

237
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,992
I united the weak.

238
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,369
There he goes again.

239
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,330
But I played for my own self-interest.

240
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,625
I'm sorry for having been
such a selfish person.

241
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,127
-Don't say that.
-Is that also science?

242
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,088
Hello, I'm Kwak Joon-bin
and I'm a travel YouTuber.

243
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,966
-You're handsome.
-Your voice sounds great.

244
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,593
-You look great.
-So cool.

245
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,846
Hello, I'm Seungkwan
and I'm a member of SEVENTEEN.

246
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,265
He's an idol.

247
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,059
-Seok-jin.
-Hello, everyone.

248
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,811
I'm Ha Seok-jin
and I'm an actor and YouTuber.

249
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,068
When I first came here,
my goal was to survive the first day.

250
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,029
It's hard to believe
that I survived this long.

251
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,115
Anyways, ORBIT and I
made it to the finals.

252
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,368
It will be the final battle

253
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,621
between the grand strategist
and the person who opposed him.

254
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,082
-I'll do my best.
-What a speech!

255
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,085
Dong-jae!

256
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,336
Hello.

257
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,506
I'm Kim Dong-jae.
I'm a college student and poker player.

258
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,928
Hello, I'm Lee See-won and I'm an actress.

259
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,266
I'm Park Kyeong-rim
and I'm a TV personality and MC.

260
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,564
I'm Lee Hye-sung
and I'm a freelance announcer.

261
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,153
Hello, I'm Suh Yu-min
and I'm an orthopedist.

262
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,241
It's like we're back on day one.

263
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,826
Do you feel better now?

264
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,037
There are countless things
I would do differently if I could go back.

265
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,164
-That's enough.
-Please just stop!

266
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,126
-What are you on about?
-There he goes again.

267
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,586
Stop thinking
that you have to do everything.

268
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,089
He feels bad
that his strategy went astray.

269
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,216
-And then...
-He's trying to lower Seok-jin's guard.

270
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,884
-If he wins...
-If that's the case,

271
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,137
-I have to support Seok-jin then.
-Okay.

272
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,848
Several people have fallen for his ploy.

273
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,184
It seems they've prepared
a last supper for us.

274
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,104
Let's all go and eat.

275
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,981
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

276
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,023
Eat up.

277
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,859
I'm excited about the finals.

278
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,569
It's the dramatic ending I wanted.

279
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,404
Seriously.

280
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,281
Most of all,

281
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,158
this is an exciting matchup.

282
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,701
You need to win this for us.

283
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,411
Even if you make a mistake,

284
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,121
try to keep your composure.

285
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,956
You've already played Nine Men's Morris.

286
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,458
You can win if you stay calm.

287
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,543
I want you to play confidently.

288
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,753
So many people support you,
so you have to win.

289
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,214
If you don't,
it would be embarrassing for me.

290
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,049
<i>We have a love-hate relationship.</i>

291
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,552
{\an8}I know he pretends to be weak,

292
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,387
{\an8}but he's the most complete player
in my opinion.

293
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,222
Yeon-woo was really weird.

294
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,349
I couldn't forget your glare.

295
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,601
Is that how I looked?

296
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,146
So I did an impression of you.

297
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,940
What is that?

298
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,692
{\an8}Are you serious?

299
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,569
{\an8}-That's hilarious.
-"What are you talking about?"

300
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,530
When you got eliminated,

301
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,283
your crying face
was just like your laughing face.

302
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,577
"Seungkwan."

303
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,580
That's hilarious.

304
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:14,210
"Why do you think it's always just me?"

305
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,795
Oh, that's what that is.

306
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,506
-See-won said that to Dong-joo.
-"Why..."

307
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,424
"So you can be
in an alliance but I can't?"

308
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,134
"That doesn't make sense."

309
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,720
"I don't think that's right."

310
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,515
Then Dong-joo went,
"You always say you want to team up,

311
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,350
but then you don't."

312
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,768
"You abandon me."

313
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,436
Are you imitating me?

314
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,647
-I think he is.
-Hey!

315
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,441
Is it all right to make light
of you two fighting?

316
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,277
I love it.

317
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,654
ORBIT.

318
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,864
-Good luck.
-Dong-joo.

319
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,200
-Dong-joo.
-It's all right if you lose though.

320
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,535
-You know that, right?
-Is it okay to lose?

321
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,869
-Of course.
-I disagree.

322
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,412
-I want you to win.
-Don't pressure me.

323
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,413
Don't pressure him.

324
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,998
You don't have to play well.

325
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,000
-You really don't.
-You saw how I was yesterday.

326
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,293
-I did.
-Crush your enemy.

327
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,836
My goodness, Joon-bin.

328
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,838
-Don't pressure...
-Don't give Seok-jin room to breathe.

329
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,423
Don't pressure him.

330
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:09,098
<i>There's an item of clothing
I wear for good luck.</i>

331
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,808
{\an8}It's this hoodie from the first day.

332
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,393
{\an8}KIM DONG-JAE
COLLEGE STUDENT

333
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,729
{\an8}Every time I wore this hoodie,

334
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,023
<i>I won something or achieved good results.</i>

335
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,985
<i>I've never failed at anything
while wearing this.</i>

336
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,571
<i>I wanted to give Seok-jin all my luck.</i>

337
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,530
-Seok-jin.
-Yeah?

338
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,158
For the first time ever,
I'm wearing this for someone else.

339
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,788
I want all my good luck to go to you.

340
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,415
I'm going to cheer you on.

341
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,709
ORBIT, it's all right to lose,
so take it easy.

342
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,085
I just hope I don't make
any more mistakes.

343
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,088
It's fine if you do.
You don't have to play well.

344
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,841
There's no need
to feel pressured, so take it easy.

345
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,509
I'll do my best and have fun.

346
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,595
-Yeah, enjoy it.
-I'm going to do my best

347
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,471
-It's your last game.
-to make it fun.

348
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,683
-It's time for them to go.
-Oh, dear.

349
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,851
Good luck.

350
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,145
-Good luck.
-<i>The final match will begin soon.</i>

351
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,774
<i>Finalists, please gather in the game area.</i>

352
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,942
Good luck.

353
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,193
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

354
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,486
You got this!

355
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,823
I won't let you down.

356
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,242
You better not let science down.

357
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,037
-ORBIT, you can do it.
-I'll try my best.

358
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,288
You got this.

359
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,873
-I'll do my best.
-We're with you in spirit.

360
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,543
-Good luck.
-You got this, big brain bro.

361
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,420
-Good luck.
-Make sure to win.

362
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,631
I'm so excited for this.

363
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,715
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

364
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,716
Good luck!

365
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,884
-Good luck!
-You got this.

366
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,136
I'll go put on a show.

367
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,263
-Do your best, guys!
-Let's do this.

368
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,848
This is a scene to remember.

369
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,433
Good luck. Bye!

370
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,392
It's like a movie.

371
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,394
-I want to take a photo of this.
-Good luck!

372
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,897
I'm so jealous of them.

373
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,482
All of a sudden?

374
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,235
I forgot to bring my film camera again!

375
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,500
Were the lights always like this?

376
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,418
It feels a bit different.

377
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,217
<i>Greetings.</i>

378
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,096
<i>Congratulations on coming this far.</i>

379
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,019
<i>The final match
of</i> The Devil's Plan <i>will begin now.</i>

380
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:40,165
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

381
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,752
<i>Dong-joo got eliminated
in yesterday's prize match.</i>

382
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,589
<i>As a result, ORBIT and Seok-jin
have advanced to the final match.</i>

383
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,550
-This is so cool!
-It's like a movie!

384
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,801
They look so cool.

385
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,011
It's like we're at the movies.

386
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,180
<i>The final prize accumulated
from all prize matches is...</i>

387
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,058
<i>250 million won.</i>

388
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,101
250 million won.

389
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,395
I can't imagine how nervous they must be.

390
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,356
<i>Three games
will be played for the final match.</i>

391
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,944
<i>Whichever player wins two games first
will be the final winner</i>

392
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,531
<i>and they will receive
the prize of 250 million won.</i>

393
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,951
<i>The final match will proceed as follows.</i>

394
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,621
{\an8}<i>The first game of the final match
is Nine Men's Morris.</i>

395
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,208
-I knew it.
-That's why they had that here.

396
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,877
I knew this would happen.

397
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,087
<i>Nine Men's Morris
is a strategy board game</i>

398
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,923
<i>that has a long history
dating to the Roman Empire.</i>

399
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,134
<i>The second game is...</i>

400
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,053
<i>Hexagon.</i>

401
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,304
-What?
-What's that?

402
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,557
<i>This game requires memorization
and arithmetic skills.</i>

403
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,896
<i>The third game is dice poker.</i>

404
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,024
<i>This is a betting game
that involves mind games.</i>

405
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,151
This is going to be tough.

406
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,570
-This is stressful.
-It's going to be a long day.

407
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,074
<i>Here is the final Piece count
of the finalists.</i>

408
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,992
<i>ORBIT has 14.</i>

409
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,453
<i>And Seok-jin has 22.</i>

410
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,080
-He has a lot.
-Twenty-two?

411
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,333
<i>As Seok-jin has more Pieces,</i>

412
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,003
<i>he will be given a slight advantage
in the three games.</i>

413
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,592
<i>Here is the first game of the final match.</i>

414
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,387
<i>The first game is</i>

415
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,556
<i>Nine Men's Morris.</i>

416
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:24,603
<i>In this game,
players must place their markers</i>

417
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:29,191
<i>on three dots in a straight line
to remove an opponent's marker.</i>

418
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,612
<i>One player is given nine black markers</i>

419
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,157
<i>and the other is given nine white markers.</i>

420
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,743
<i>The player with more markers</i>

421
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,954
<i>will choose who goes first in each round.</i>

422
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,001
<i>Once the game begins,
the player going first</i>

423
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,005
<i>must place one marker
on one of the 24 empty dots</i>

424
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,174
<i>within 90 seconds.</i>

425
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,053
<i>The players will take turns
placing their markers</i>

426
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,430
<i>until all of them are on the board.</i>

427
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,184
<i>A player may not move a marker
that has already been placed</i>

428
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,895
<i>until all markers are on the board.</i>

429
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,400
<i>If a player ends up
with three markers in a straight line</i>

430
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,443
<i>while placing their markers on the board,</i>

431
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:18,157
<i>they may choose and remove
one of the opponent's markers.</i>

432
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:24,246
<i>However, if the opponent's markers
are in a row of three in a straight line,</i>

433
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,249
<i>those markers may not be removed.</i>

434
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,334
<i>The player must choose a different marker.</i>

435
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,297
<i>If all markers
have been placed on the board,</i>

436
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,758
<i>players must move
their markers during their turn.</i>

437
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,093
<i>When doing so,</i>

438
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,848
<i>players may move their markers
to a neighboring dot on the same line.</i>

439
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,934
<i>While taking turns doing this,</i>

440
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,397
<i>if a player's markers end up
in a row of three in a straight line,</i>

441
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,359
<i>they may remove an opponent's marker
from the board.</i>

442
00:19:56,069 --> 00:20:00,407
<i>If a player only has
three markers left on the board,</i>

443
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,077
<i>they do not have to move their markers
to a connected dot.</i>

444
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,915
<i>They may move their markers
to any empty dot on the board.</i>

445
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,667
-You're trying to survive at that point.
-<i>As per the rule,</i>

446
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,922
<i>if a player's markers end up
in a row of three in a straight line,</i>

447
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,759
<i>they may remove an opponent's marker
from the board.</i>

448
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,680
<i>If a player is unable
to move their markers</i>

449
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,641
<i>or is left with only two markers,</i>

450
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,810
<i>the game ends in the said player's defeat.</i>

451
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,732
<i>If one player is left with three markers</i>

452
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,526
<i>and the stalemate continues
for more than ten turns,</i>

453
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,655
<i>the player with fewer markers
loses the game.</i>

454
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,491
<i>The game will last for three rounds.</i>

455
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,577
<i>The player who wins
two rounds first will win.</i>

456
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,913
<i>In a moment,</i>

457
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,539
<i>the first game of the final match</i>

458
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,750
<i>will begin.</i>

459
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,919
I anticipated that we would
play this game.

460
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,796
<i>We played it for a bit last night.</i>

461
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,967
<i>ORBIT is a much faster learner
in terms of understanding games,</i>

462
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,385
so I can't take this lightly.

463
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,136
We both have to play to win.

464
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,348
So I'll try to avoid making mistakes
and give it my all.

465
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,559
I have several strategies in mind
to turn things in my favor.

466
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,563
<i>But Seok-jin has survived hell
by winning a game of Gomoku,</i>

467
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,315
so I'm not sure if I have the upper hand.

468
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,698
I have a headache.

469
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,991
-I threw up.
-You threw up?

470
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,200
I threw up in the bathroom.

471
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,290
This is exhausting.

472
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,085
<i>The first game of the final match,
Nine Men's Morris,</i>

473
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,337
<i>will begin now.</i>

474
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,090
-It's starting.
-Here they go.

475
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,927
Why am <i>I</i> nervous?

476
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,805
<i>As Seok-jin has more Pieces,</i>

477
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,057
<i>he will get to decide who plays first.</i>

478
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,892
<i>Going first is a definite advantage.</i>

479
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,563
If you go second, you have to
play defensively and wait for mistakes.

480
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,316
<i>Unless they make a mistake,
the player to go first will always win.</i>

481
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,234
I will go first.

482
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,239
<i>Seok-jin will go first
and play with the black markers.</i>

483
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,451
<i>ORBIT will go second
and play with the white markers.</i>

484
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,411
<i>Round one begins now.</i>

485
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,249
<i>Seok-jin, please place one marker
within 90 seconds.</i>

486
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,043
-Good luck!
-Good luck, ORBIT!

487
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,465
Please let me go first in round two.

488
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,193
I have no choice but to defend.

489
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,089
I don't know if I'm doing it right.

490
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,091
What?

491
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,383
I think he made a mistake.

492
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,053
Seok-jin is on the defensive now.

493
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,846
-ORBIT can attack now.
-That's right.

494
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,641
-He made a mistake.
-ORBIT is on the offensive now.

495
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,279
That would make three in a row.

496
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,011
ORBIT, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

497
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,304
He can remove a black marker now.

498
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,681
And they can't remove markers

499
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,141
-that are in a row.
-Okay.

500
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,572
-He's going to get a row too.
-What?

501
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,698
That was a good move.

502
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,159
{\an8}You have 30 seconds left.

503
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,593
Seok-jin, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

504
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,988
They have to move their markers now.

505
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,240
This is so stressful.

506
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,868
-It's no joke.
-I can't calculate anymore.

507
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,595
Seok-jin, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

508
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,014
This is amazing for Seok-jin.

509
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,516
-White is in a bad spot.
-That area is hell for white.

510
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,810
Black can just move
that marker up and down.

511
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,421
ORBIT, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

512
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,227
That black marker is in the way.

513
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,478
But it's pointless

514
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,022
because Seok-jin can't attack right now.

515
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,045
That was good.

516
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,297
White can't do anything.

517
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,677
ORBIT, you have 30 seconds left.

518
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,307
Come on, ORBIT.

519
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,641
You have ten seconds left.

520
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:01,077
Seok-jin, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

521
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,386
Seok-jin, you have 30 seconds left.

522
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,016
You have ten seconds left.

523
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,603
Five...

524
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,655
ORBIT, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

525
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:43,953
That's good.

526
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,206
-He can go either way.
-Right.

527
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,624
Seok-jin's against a wall.

528
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,501
-He's on the defensive.
-Seok-jin's in trouble.

529
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,794
ORBIT got him.

530
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,253
It's all right.

531
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,964
Seok-jin is good under pressure.

532
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,386
You have 30 seconds left.

533
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,684
Five, four...

534
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,320
ORBIT, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

535
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,547
You have 30 seconds left.

536
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,397
That was a deep sigh.

537
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,695
Please remove...

538
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,430
Seok-jin, you have 30 seconds left.

539
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,526
He's playing confidently.

540
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,821
This is tough.

541
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,989
It's difficult.

542
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,784
It really is.

543
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,286
This is hard.

544
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,303
Please remove a marker.

545
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,389
Seok-jin, you have three markers left.

546
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,433
You may now move your markers freely.

547
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,364
You have 30 seconds left.

548
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,870
-My head hurts.
-Five,

549
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,330
four...

550
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,177
What was that?

551
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,379
<i>The reason why Seok-jin
isn't going on the offensive</i>

552
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,590
<i>when he can move his markers freely</i>

553
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:27,635
<i>is that if he gets his markers
in a row of three</i>

554
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,263
<i>and removes one of ORBIT's markers,</i>

555
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:34,267
<i>that means ORBIT
can also move his markers freely.</i>

556
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,853
<i>If ORBIT moves his markers as shown,</i>

557
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,899
<i>Seok-jin can't stop ORBIT from winning.</i>

558
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,818
Let's end this round.

559
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,904
You need to remove this.

560
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,032
That's right.

561
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,159
I think white won.

562
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,545
If I do this, it's over regardless of
where you place yours.

563
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,714
I get three in a row.

564
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,886
<i>Round one ends with ORBIT's victory.</i>

565
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,599
He went second and won.

566
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,142
That was amazing.

567
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,355
-You're so good at this.
-This is tough.

568
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,733
I was waiting for him to make a mistake.

569
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:28,404
When it looked like he would,
I pounced just in time.

570
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,406
For the first round,

571
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,450
I was nervous about facing ORBIT.

572
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,744
But now I'm just exhausted.

573
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,245
My brain is fried.

574
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,082
This is an intense battle
right from the start.

575
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,085
<i>Round two begins now.</i>

576
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,045
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

577
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,880
-Let's follow their moves.
-Okay.

578
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,175
ORBIT, please decide on the order.

579
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,593
I will go first.

580
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,221
You have an advantage if you go first.

581
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,224
-But he just won going second.
-That's ORBIT.

582
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,059
ORBIT, please place your marker.

583
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,588
<i>I focused on placing my markers
in a rhombus shape in the middle area.</i>

584
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,425
<i>It makes moving my markers easier,
so I thought it would be an advantage.</i>

585
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,594
-It's different from how Seok-jin played.
-Exactly.

586
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,805
ORBIT's using a new strategy.
What is that?

587
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,451
Round two is going to be quick.

588
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,910
Let's be quick. My head hurts.

589
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,970
<i>Creating L shapes in the corners
is very advantageous.</i>

590
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,807
Going first is too advantageous.

591
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,725
Is it?

592
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,987
ORBIT, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

593
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,790
-What?
-Why didn't he form a row first?

594
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,895
You have 30 seconds left.

595
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:06,938
Okay.

596
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:14,987
The game just started.

597
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,657
-This is the real beginning.
-It is.

598
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:26,958
Wait.

599
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,212
Every option is blocked now.

600
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,547
-Black is...
-There's no option here.

601
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,756
And this area is completely blocked.

602
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,383
He can't attack here either.

603
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,261
-Whatever happens...
-Seok-jin has a slight advantage.

604
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,971
He's in a good position right now.

605
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:40,972
How did this happen?

606
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,979
You have 30 seconds left.

607
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,403
I think I made a mistake.

608
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,409
Please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

609
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,502
You have 30 seconds left.

610
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,630
I'm out of options.

611
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,425
I really am.

612
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,388
<i>I realized how the game was progressing.</i>

613
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,892
And I saw a way
to keep my opponent in check.

614
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,268
<i>I trapped him in the middle</i>

615
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,895
<i>and saw that he couldn't move.</i>

616
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,939
<i>He'd have to take
several turns just to form a row.</i>

617
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,441
<i>So I decided to remove his markers
one by one</i>

618
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,693
<i>as he moved his markers
trying to form a row.</i>

619
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,863
It was like choking his neck
while hitting him in the stomach.

620
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,587
Please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

621
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,981
Please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

622
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,489
This is...

623
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,824
a complete victory for Seok-jin.

624
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,409
{\an8}It's over.

625
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,169
ORBIT, you are unable
to move your markers.

626
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,422
<i>Round two ends with Seok-jin's victory.</i>

627
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,384
He couldn't move anymore.

628
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,387
-He trapped him completely.
-That was great.

629
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,014
<i>I got too confident
while forming my territory.</i>

630
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,976
I should've looked at the big picture
but I made a mistake.

631
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,186
<i>I didn't look at the bigger picture.</i>

632
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,105
The first players have lost so far.

633
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,189
Exactly.

634
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,234
Maybe the pressure's too much
since the first player usually wins.

635
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,070
Going first is advantageous
but I let my guard down.

636
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,322
Did we have to drag this into round three?

637
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,657
I'm tired.

638
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,286
<i>Round three begins now.</i>

639
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,789
Usually, whoever wins
the second round has momentum.

640
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,249
It's fun watching
our most cautious players play.

641
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,458
It is.

642
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,836
Seok-jin, please decide on the order.

643
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,004
I will go first.

644
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,924
This isn't easy, is it?

645
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,718
Seok-jin, please place your marker.

646
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,060
<i>I thought of it as Gomoku.</i>

647
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,980
<i>But it was more about
crowding my opponent out.</i>

648
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,073
I'm not sure what to do.

649
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,252
<i>I had to choose between taking over
the outer area or the middle area.</i>

650
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,712
<i>If Seok-jin was going to take the middle,</i>

651
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,131
<i>I was going to block him first
and take over the outer area.</i>

652
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,468
<i>And based on the
remaining number of markers,</i>

653
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,345
<i>I calculated which one I should remove.</i>

654
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,305
You have 30 seconds left.

655
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:17,229
Five, four, three, two, one.

656
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,319
I have to block this.

657
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,697
It's still an open game.

658
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,383
This is playing out beautifully.

659
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,387
Their markers are more spread out
in this round.

660
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,473
They realized it's hard to move
when the markers are clumped up.

661
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,641
So they spread out.

662
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,059
I can't tell who has the upper hand.

663
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,062
I think they're pretty even so far.

664
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,939
They're both thinking clearly now.

665
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,708
I need to block this.

666
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,130
I'm out of options.

667
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,566
I have to place a new marker, right?

668
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,817
That's right.

669
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,026
I don't want to.

670
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,793
All right, here we go.

671
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,212
They've placed
all of their markers on the board.

672
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,590
-All their markers are on.
-The game begins now.

673
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,426
I hope Seok-jin wins.

674
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,969
Let's see.

675
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,015
<i>I realized something in round two.</i>

676
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,602
<i>I was suddenly able to see
when and where to block him off</i>

677
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,479
to be able to remove his markers.

678
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,981
<i>I learned how to take control of the game.</i>

679
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,025
You have 30 seconds left.

680
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,780
This is driving me crazy.

681
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,033
That was a good move.

682
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:38,829
Seok-jin will be able to
move his markers around more easily.

683
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,747
It seems so.

684
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,339
Darn it. What do I do?

685
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,718
I have nowhere to go.

686
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,761
Exactly.

687
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:59,808
Five, four, three, two, one.

688
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,034
Seok-jin, please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

689
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,685
Please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

690
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,649
<i>I knew that I had lost</i>

691
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,276
<i>as soon as the first marker was removed.</i>

692
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,111
This game is over.

693
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,862
He can't turn the tides anymore.

694
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,698
I think ORBIT realizes that.

695
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,032
-Yeah.
-Whatever he does...

696
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,910
Seok-jin has it all figured out.

697
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,006
Please remove
one of your opponent's markers.

698
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,344
-It's over.
-Yeah.

699
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,305
It seems so.

700
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,391
I just felt for the pulse of the game

701
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,476
to understand how it would go.

702
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,521
<i>And I realized
that it's actually quite simple.</i>

703
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,107
<i>But ORBIT overcomplicated his strategy.</i>

704
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,151
<i>He tried to calculate all of the outcomes.</i>

705
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,444
I've lost completely.

706
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,863
I'm out of options.

707
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,244
There's nothing I can do.

708
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,916
This is a crushing defeat.

709
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,757
ORBIT has two markers left.

710
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,966
-It's over.
-Good job.

711
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,176
Well played.

712
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,427
Seok-jin played well.

713
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,892
<i>Round three ends with Seok-jin's victory.</i>

714
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:05,851
You're so good at this.

715
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,561
<i>The first game of the final match</i>

716
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,438
<i>ends with Seok-jin's victory.</i>

717
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,525
<i>The second game
of the final match will begin soon.</i>

718
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,445
It was a matter
of who made fewer mistakes.

719
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,281
<i>I'm tired but I'll do my best again
in the second game.</i>

720
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,533
<i>I lost the first game.</i>

721
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,786
<i>But we still have
the second and third games.</i>

722
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,329
I will give it my all.

723
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,540
-You're amazing.
-The second game involves numbers.

724
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,710
<i>Here is the second game
of the final match.</i>

725
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,671
<i>The second game of the final match</i>

726
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,381
<i>is Hexagon.</i>

727
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:39,468
<i>In this game, players must remember
the combination of three numbers</i>

728
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,805
<i>that add up to the target number.</i>

729
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,893
This is amazing.

730
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,897
<i>Once the game begins, the number board
will be shown for 30 seconds.</i>

731
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,402
<i>The number board is made up
of 19 smaller hexagons with random numbers</i>

732
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,821
<i>that together form one large hexagon.</i>

733
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:03,367
<i>After 30 seconds,
the numbers will be replaced with letters</i>

734
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,911
<i>and the target number will be shown.</i>

735
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,665
<i>Players must recall
the combination of three hexagons</i>

736
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:13,877
<i>either in a horizontal or diagonal row</i>

737
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,047
<i>that add up to the target number.</i>

738
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,340
How is that possible?

739
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,011
<i>When giving their answers,</i>

740
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,472
<i>players must recite the letters,
not the numbers.</i>

741
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,601
<i>For example, if the target number is ten,</i>

742
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,438
<i>the answers would be ABC</i>,

743
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,481
<i>FJN,</i>

744
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,402
<i>GKO, or JNQ.</i>

745
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,490
<i>Players who wish to answer
may press the buzzer at any time</i>

746
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,118
<i>and answer within ten seconds.</i>

747
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,289
<i>If correct, the player
will earn one point.</i>

748
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,167
<i>If incorrect, they will lose one point.</i>

749
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,130
<i>The number of potential answers
for each round will not be revealed.</i>

750
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,467
<i>Once all answers have been found,
the next round will begin</i>

751
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,344
<i>and a new number board
and target number will be shown.</i>

752
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,057
<i>If no player presses their buzzer
within 90 seconds,</i>

753
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,310
<i>that round will end immediately,</i>

754
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,061
<i>and the next round will begin.</i>

755
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,982
<i>The game will last for ten rounds.</i>

756
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:21,153
<i>The player with more correct answers
wins the game.</i>

757
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,324
<i>The second game of the final match
will begin soon.</i>

758
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,367
This is torture.

759
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,537
<i>He's an intelligent person.</i>

760
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,456
<i>So I'm sure he's good at memorization.</i>

761
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,626
<i>And in that sense,
I feel that I'm at a big disadvantage.</i>

762
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,669
<i>I don't think I'm at a disadvantage.</i>

763
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,672
<i>It all comes down to
who keeps a cool head until the end.</i>

764
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,801
I can't imagine
how stressful that must be.

765
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,221
Seungkwan, good thing we got eliminated.

766
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,639
-We can't handle that game.
-I agree.

767
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,433
If we were the finalists,
we'd be struggling the whole game.

768
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,560
We'd be like, "What's the target number?"

769
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,231
Apparently, Joon-bin has
a photographic memory.

770
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,233
Then why did he suck at Montage?

771
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,984
I couldn't press the buzzer on time.

772
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,278
What are you saying?
The same goes for me then.

773
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,405
You...

774
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,910
<i>The time has expired.</i>

775
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,745
<i>Please return to the main hall.</i>

776
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,251
-They look great!
-Good luck!

777
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:23,173
<i>Seok-jin has a one-game lead on ORBIT.</i>

778
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,842
<i>If Seok-jin also wins this game,</i>

779
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,346
<i>he will become the final winner
of</i> The Devil's Plan.

780
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,851
<i>As Seok-jin has more Pieces,</i>

781

<i>he will begin the game with one point.</i>

782
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,897
That's his advantage?

783
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,357
Yeah, he gets a point.

784
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,527
<i>My focus was to try to
catch up as much as possible.</i>

785
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,947
But his one-point lead did feel daunting.

786

<i>Here is the number board for round one.</i>

787

I feel like it'll be 11 or 12.

788
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,805
Maybe ten or nine?

789
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,224
Probably nine.

790
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,809

-Five?
-Seriously?

794
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,714
Seok-jin.

795
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,215

I'm hesitant
because I don't trust my memory.

815

It might be better
to not say anything if unsure.

816

822
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,933

I agree.

-It's still fresh.
-Maybe they forgot the upper numbers.

The Devil's Plan
<i>was a miniature version of society.</i>

1117
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,898
<i>It was like a village
made up of people with good hearts</i>

<i>We did make alliances,</i>

1123
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:05,164
<i>but no one tore anyone else down
or isolated themselves.</i>

1124
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,124

1127
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:16,550
<i>I made good memories with good people.</i>

1128
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,302
<i>Even though the show is over,</i>

1129
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:21,180
<i>I hope we can maintain our friendships.</i>

1130
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,349

Where else would I be?</i>

01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,372
<i>This week felt like a dream
and I don't know</i>

1139
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,707
<i>how I could possibly forget it.</i>

1140
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,669
<i>As a member of the cast,
I learned a lot about life.</i>

1141
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,547
One, two, three!
