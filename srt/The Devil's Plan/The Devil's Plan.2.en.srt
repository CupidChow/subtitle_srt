1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,217
-We...
-Wait, is this for real?

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,219
-I trusted Yeon-woo.
-My last...

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,097
I saw them leaving the room first.

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,017
<i>Yeon-woo has died.</i>

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,144
-Please!
-Please!

6
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,729
<i>Yeon-woo's character was...</i>

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,733
<i>an ordinary citizen.</i>

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,277
It's Dong-jae then.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,820
-It's not me!
-It's Dong-jae.

10
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,447
-I swear it's not me!
-This is all because of you.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,198
-She's dead because of you!
-Who is it?

12
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,616
It's not me!

13
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,910
Why did the officer kill Yeon-woo?

14
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,371
<i>Round four begins now.</i>

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,833
<i>This is the current status of the game.</i>

16
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,502
<i>The cure is in the preparation stage.</i>

17
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,758
<i>The antibody card
was marked from the beginning.</i>

18
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,260
<i>The secret was in the font.</i>

19
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>Of all the players</i>

20
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,099
<i>who picked the ordinary citizen cards,</i>

21
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,560
<i>Hye-sung picked the antibody card
with the secret font.</i>

22
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>The following players have died
due to the virus.</i>

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>Yu-min has died.</i>

24
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,778
<i>Yu-min was an ordinary citizen.</i>

25
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,530
<i>Dong-joo has died.</i>

26
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,366
{\an8}<i>Dong-joo was a researcher.</i>

27
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,204
<i>Currently, there are
four infected players.</i>

28
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,455
What do we do now?

29
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>Having been infected in round three,</i>

30
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,046
<i>Seok-jin will die
at the end of this round.</i>

31
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,923
<i>With both researchers dead,</i>

32
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,761
<i>the officer's last bullet
is the citizens' only hope.</i>

33
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,095
I'm upset.

34
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,222
Do you want to die?

35
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,432
You don't?

36
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,229
{\an8}The result was obvious.
We had to choose between the two.

37
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,563
<i>It was either Guillaume</i>

38
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,898
<i>or Dong-jae.</i>

39
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,441
I'm not a terrorist.

40
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,484
So it's Hye-sung?

41
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,777
I don't know anymore.

42
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,029
-Then...
-Honestly.

43
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,906
It's a pity Yeon-woo died.

44
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,241
-Tell me about it.
-But seriously,

45
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,618
-I knew it wasn't Yeon-woo.
-Your hunch was horrible.

46
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,744
Was it? I'm sorry.

47
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,621
-Never mind.
-At least we discussed it.

48
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,164
Trust is useless.

49
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,084
I believed that Guillaume
was the officer to the very end.

50
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,212
<i>I grew more certain
as the game progressed.</i>

51
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,756
My bet was on Dong-jae
being a terrorist from the beginning.

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,050
-He's shown us nothing so far.
-It's my fault?

53
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,469
-Shouldn't we hold him accountable?
-He should take fault?

54
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,596
We've all suspected him.

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,015
Guillaume, this is your last chance.

56
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,642
-Tell us the truth.
-He's probably the fanatic.

57
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,852
-About what?
-You never said a word

58
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,228
-Your identity.
-about your job.

59
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,857
Claiming to be the officer is the
easiest lie for a terrorist to tell.

60
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,651
Is it you?

61
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,446
What do we do?

62
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,907
-Is it me?
-Yes.

63
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,952
So killing Yeon-woo wasn't enough?

64
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,122
Now you're trying to start
a witch-hunt to get me killed?

65
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,128
At least Guillaume
didn't blindly accuse anyone.

66
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,713
-What am I going to do?
-Meanwhile,

67
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,090
you've accused Yeon-woo and now me,

68
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,926
so there's a big chance
you're a terrorist.

69
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,387
-Guillaume is neutral.
-I...

70
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,889
Dong-jae.

71
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,223
I think it's him.

72
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,683
I disagree. It's not me.

73
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,642
-Dong-jae.
-Yeah?

74
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,269
-It's time.
-I can't cover for you anymore.

75
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,607
-Seriously...
-You shouldn't have accused me.

76
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,650
Even if it is you,
I think you put up a great fight.

77
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,444
-Let's go.
-I can't believe this.

78
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,737
Let's kill him.

79
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,031
<i>Dong-jae has died.</i>

80
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,700
<i>Dong-jae's character was...</i>

81
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,663
Dong-jae, choose a character card.

82
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,790
It wasn't your choice to be a terrorist.

83
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,709
I'm not a terrorist.

84
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,880
-Are you a terrorist?
-I swear I'm telling the truth.

85
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,132
PLAYER DEATH

86
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,969
You've accused Yeon-woo and now me,

87
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,639
so there's a big chance
you're a terrorist.

88
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,349
<i>Dong-jae's character was...</i>

89
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,145
<i>the fanatic.</i>

90
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:10,041
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

91
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,211
<i>...the fanatic.</i>

92
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,545
We were all wrong.

93
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,423
Wait, Dong-jae!

94
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,466
<i>I endured it</i>

95
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,010
{\an8}to keep my alliance's trust.

96
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,347
-Hello.
-Congratulations.

97
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,683
-Congratulations.
-Which round did you die in?

98
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,850
-See-won.
-Congratulations.

99
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,143
I kept my promise.

100
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,692
6 HOURS EARLIER

101
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,653
You have to find someone trustworthy.

102
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,113
Let's work together.

103
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,490
Without being obvious?

104
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,867
I trust you.

105
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,830
Dong-jae, you are the fanatic.

106
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,667
<i>Before the game started,</i>

107
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,586
<i>See-won and I agreed
to tell each other our identities.</i>

108
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,381
Guillaume, you are a terrorist.

109
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,216
Is this player infected?

110
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,385
Are you asking if I'm a terrorist?

111
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,012
See-won and I are on the same team.

112
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,015
I didn't think I was flustered at all.

113
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,433
Really?

114
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,228
{\an8}LOOK AT THE MIRROR IN THE KITCHEN
AND INDICATE PLAYER NUMBER TO INFECT

115
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,521
{\an8}I got number two.

116
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,319
Kyeong-rim, very thankfully,

117
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,362
<i>offered to help me.</i>

118
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,656
<i>She told me she was the journalist.</i>

119
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,575
-You've been caught.
-What?

120
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,035
Kyeong-rim is the journalist

121
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,120
and she revealed your identity
to everyone.

122
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,331
-Are you the officer?
-The officer...

123
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,541
Right, you said
you're an ordinary citizen.

124
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,128
{\an8}The officer can kill
one player each round.

125
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,672
{\an8}MAKE A FINGER GUN AND POINT
AT PLAYER TO KILL FOR 3 SECONDS

126
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,717
But considering the likeliest options,

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,427
unfortunately, I think
See-won is a terrorist.

128
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,680
Since he's defending her,
Dong-jae is suspicious too.

129
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,684
<i>In a way, putting myself under suspicion
is the best scenario.</i>

130
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,353
I'm not a terrorist.

131
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,397
I say this because I feel bad.

132
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,733
<i>I tried to survive as long as possible</i>

133
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,612
and cause a distraction
so Guillaume could carry out his task.

134
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,584
<i>Seungkwan has died.</i>

135
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,668
Seok-jin.

136
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,837
You're the officer, right?

137
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,548
I'm pretty sure Seok-jin is the officer.

138
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,551
I realized that someone died
when he went off alone.

139
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:30,181
And because I tried to figure out
everyone's identity from the start,

140
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,226
<i>I realized he had to be the officer.</i>

141
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,602
It's you, isn't it?

142
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,437
It has to be you. That's why I'm here.

143
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,356
-It has to be you.
-Why?

144
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,274
I'm just going to
place all my bets on him.

145
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,443
I swear I'm telling the truth.

146
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,195
You're the only one I can trust.

147
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,117
<i>-Seungkwan has died.</i>
-What?

148
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,327
<i>Seungkwan's character...</i>

149
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,037
{\an8}They're not.

150
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,414
{\an8}No? Why not?

151
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,751
{\an8}I saw him pointing the finger gun.

152
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,045
Guillaume, you killed Seungkwan, right?

153
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,964
-I did.
-Why?

154
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,174
{\an8}I played dumb throughout the whole game.

155
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,259
I understood about 50% of the game.

156
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:10,138
I'm a beginner at this game,
so I'll be quiet to start.

157
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,057
You're getting too stressed.

158
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,725
So the officer has to be bad at this game.

159
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,893
And it has to be him.

160
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,479
I just need to do what I've been doing.

161
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,480
He was a terrorist.

162
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,482
-You thought he was?
-He was.

163
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,526
-Who will you kill?
-I'm not the officer.

164
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,194
-So you lied to us?
-Dong-jae.

165
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,863
-I did.
-I mean...

166
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,074
I basically lied the entire time,
although I didn't say much.

167
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,160
-I'm killing Guillaume.
-No, it's not him.

168
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,578
What I thought of at that moment was...

169
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,080
He has to be the fanatic,
judging by what he's saying.

170
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,915
<i>I spent a lot of time persuading everyone.</i>

171
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,751
<i>Yeon-woo has died.</i>

172
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,919
I'm not a terrorist.

173
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,296
I don't know anymore.

174
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,840
<i>I tried my absolute best</i>

175
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,800
to come off as a terrorist.

176
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,385
Is it you?

177
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,596
You've accused Yeon-woo and now me,

178
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,390
so there's a big chance
you're a terrorist.

179
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,975
<i>My obsession with survival</i>

180
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,270
<i>motivated me to portray myself</i>

181
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,189
<i>as a terrorist to everyone else.</i>

182
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,817
<i>Dong-jae's character was the fanatic.</i>

183
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,319
We were all wrong.

184
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,074
-Congratulations.
-Why?

185
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,451
-You won.
-I did?

186
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,410
You're a terrorist.

187
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,120
-I'm a terrorist?
-Yeah.

188
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,331
<i>Round five begins now.</i>

189
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,584
<i>This is the current status of the game.</i>

190
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,544
<i>Seok-jin has died.</i>

191
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,173
<i>Seok-jin's character was the officer.</i>

192
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,009
{\an8}LEE HYE-SUNG
ANNOUNCER

193
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,136
<i>I'm upset at myself.</i>

194
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,388
I think my focus shifted from
"Dong-jae must be a terrorist"

195
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,641
<i>to "Guillaume can't be a terrorist"
at some point in the game.</i>

196
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,226
That was my biggest mistake.

197
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,729
<i>Currently, two players are infected.</i>

198
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,105
What now?

199
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,233
-Do we just wait to die?
-Yeah.

200
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,192
Really?

201
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,361
<i>Only three players are left.</i>

202
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,821
<i>After being infected in round four,</i>

203
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,658
<i>Hye-sung has recovered
due to her antibodies.</i>

204
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,870
{\an8}<i>Guillaume, the terrorist,
has used a healing bandage.</i>

205
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,040
<i>The only other surviving citizen,</i>

206
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,794
<i>Joon-bin, died of the virus
in round seven.</i>

207
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,921
<i>All citizens have died.</i>

208
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,132
<i>The terrorists claim victory.</i>

209
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,930
I feel so dejected.

210
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,516
<i>With all citizens dead,</i>

211
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,394
<i>the game ends
with the terrorists' victory.</i>

212
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,691
{\an8}<i>Terrorists See-won and Guillaume
receive four Pieces each.</i>

213
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,069
{\an8}<i>Dong-jae, the fanatic
who died in round four,</i>

214
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,488
{\an8}<i>receives one Piece.</i>

215
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,823
{\an8}You did that for one Piece?

216
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,076
<i>Here is the current Piece count
of each player.</i>

217
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,204
-Five?
-That's right.

218
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,123
They have five, two, and five.

219
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,960
<i>The two players with the most Pieces,
See-won and Guillaume,</i>

220
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,170
<i>must choose two players</i>

221
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,257
<i>who will go to prison, excluding Dong-jae.</i>

222
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,633
Right now?

223
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,343
I helped you two a lot.

224
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,178
-Guillaume, I helped you out so much.
-I'm going through a lot.

225
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,847
-This is brutal.
-I know.

226
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,015
I really...

227
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,350
I helped you wholeheartedly.

228
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,645
-I have a favor to ask.
-Sure.

229
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,605
Where should we go?

230
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,689
Over there.

231
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,109
{\an8}I hope it's not me.

232
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,527
{\an8}But I deserve it though.

233
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,820
I'm so nervous.

234
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,739
<i>It's either me or Seungkwan.</i>

235
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,033
{\an8}I'm so annoyed.

236
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,034
I think it's going to be me.

237
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,411
<i>I'm so ashamed of how badly I did.</i>

238
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,288
I need to self-reflect in prison.

239
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,207
The results of the prize matches

240
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,835
-determine the final prize amount, right?
-That's correct.

241
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,919
Thank you.

242
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,465
We need to cut off the deadweight here.

243
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,050
Deadweight?

244
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,426
Those who didn't do much

245
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,888
or those we don't really need.

246
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,890
Who would that be?

247
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,849
{\an8}I think...

248
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,478
{\an8}<i>It's Yeon-woo, Dong-joo,</i>

249
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,979
{\an8}<i>and Yu-min.</i>

250
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,773
{\an8}<i>So out of those three?</i>

251
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,857
Out of those three...

252
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,819
You two should discuss and decide.

253
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,655
I'm not supposed to be
a part of this anyway.

254
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,783
-It's a shame.
-It's such a shame.

255
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,242
He's coming.

256
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,827
-I'm scared.
-Why?

257
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,663
There's no need to be.

258
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,122
I only have two Pieces.

259
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,333
-Let's each choose one person.
-Okay.

260
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,003
We each chose one person

261
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,423
-but took your criteria into account.
-Okay.

262
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,384
That's up to you two.

263
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,512
<i>See-won and Guillaume,
the players with the most Pieces,</i>

264
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,473
<i>please choose two players
who will go to prison.</i>

265
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:26,352
We really didn't want to
send anyone to prison.

266
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,270
But we each chose one player.

267
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,398
I've decided on...

268
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,776
{\an8}<i>It's Yeon-woo, Dong-joo,</i>

269
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,985
{\an8}<i>and Yu-min.</i>

270
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,153
{\an8}I've decided on...

271
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,155
Yu-min.

272
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,910
I thought you contributed the least
to the game.

273
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,787
That's my opinion.

274
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,205
I'm sorry.

275
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,666
This is tough.

276
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,002
I feel horrible,

277
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:57,425
and I'd go to prison instead if I could.

278
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,929
But I've decided on Kyeong-rim.

279
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,349
Yeah, I'm sorry.

280
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,851
<i>This is for the best.</i>

281
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,812
It's for everybody's benefit

282
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,898
<i>that the best players play the games</i>

283
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,236
so we decided on Yu-min and Kyeong-rim.

284
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,280
That was brutal.

285
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,574
-I got shivers.
-I think I'm going to cry.

286
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,951
-This is crazy.
-I didn't think they'd choose Kyeong-rim.

287
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,495
<i>Kyeong-rim and Yu-min,</i>

288
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,289
<i>please enter the prison cell.</i>

289
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,291
-Right away?
-Please follow me.

290
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,126
-I'm getting chills.
-Bye, everyone.

291
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,170
-I'm sorry, Kyeong-rim.
-Kyeong-rim...

292
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,296
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,256
What do I do? I'm so scared.

294
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,175
-Yu-min, my roommate.
-Oh, no.

295
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,760
-Seriously.
-My roommate.

296
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,977
-So that's the prison.
-Oh, no.

297
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,228
-No way.
-What the...

298
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,521
-It's an actual prison.
-Oh, no.

299
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,440
-No, stop them.
-It's an actual prison.

300
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,649
This isn't right.

301
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,193
No, stop them.

302
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,319
It's an actual prison.

303
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,278
Oh, my god.

304
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,447
-Oh, no.
-No way.

305
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,616
-What is this?
-Please follow the path.

306
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,117
Oh, they have to walk down there.

307
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,248
-No way.
-Everyone else, please leave.

308
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,500
Please leave.

309
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
-This is crazy.
-It's scary.

310
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,258
This is so cruel.

311
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,639
Guillaume's decision
still has me scratching my head.

312
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,474
-He's really something.
-Seriously.

313
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,475
-He's scary.
-It's crazy.

314
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,310
I feel so bad.

315
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,562
<i>The main match has finished.</i>

316
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,358
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

317
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,443
That's so harsh. Do they get to eat?

318
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,362
-They wouldn't starve...
-I'm sure they will.

319
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,739
-Where do we go?
-Please wait a moment.

320
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,162
-There's a way.
-Please go up.

321
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,634
Please wait a moment.

322
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,718
Okay.

323
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,557
-My heart's beating so fast.
-Really?

324
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,230
Please enter.

325
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,148
-Thank you.
-Thank goodness we have beds.

326
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,947
So we're stuck here

327
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,407
until when tomorrow?

328
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,785
I'm not sure but they said we're going
to be in here for about 18 hours.

329
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,870
So that means...

330
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,789
they'll let us out
tomorrow morning, right?

331
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,583
We have to participate
in the main match tomorrow.

332
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,834
You're right, but...

333
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,004
So we don't get to change our clothes?

334
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:44,133
{\an8}Honestly, I thought they would at least
give us prison uniforms.

335
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,510
-There has to be a bathroom here, right?
-I hope so.

336
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,804
They'll give us food, right?

337
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,182
There's a johnny house here.

338
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,726
This is an actual prison.

339
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,686
I wish they gave us something to read.

340
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,397
-At least we have water.
-Right.

341
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,358
They gave us the essentials for survival.

342
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,486
We might as well rest now.

343
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,115
Let's rest.

344
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,242
<i>I had a long day.</i>

345
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,121
I died right away in round one.

346
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,291
<i>The dealer room
was basically prison for me.</i>

347
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,877
<i>I'm now here in prison on day one,</i>

348
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,087
<i>so it's like I've been imprisoned twice.</i>

349
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,840
I never expected this.

350
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,177
I thought, "Guillaume could choose me,
but then again, he might not."

351
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,179
Why did you think he'd choose you?

352
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,847
I died too quickly.

353
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,724
-I see.
-I should have

354
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,435
kept my cards close to my chest

355
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,480
and played the game more interestingly,

356
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,023
but I revealed it too soon.

357
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,360
I think I was the only person who saw

358
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
Guillaume kill Seungkwan

359
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,696
<i>because no one mentioned it.</i>

360
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,990
<i>I knew it the second I saw it.</i>

361
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,326
If I had told Seok-jin right away,

362
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,911
we would have won.

363
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,039
I regret that I wasn't more clever

364
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,584
about putting the crucial information
to good use.

365
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,129
<i>I wish I had worked with others sooner</i>

366
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,507
<i>and played the game more proactively.</i>

367
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,846
I'm exhausted right now.

368
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,515
We're home.

369
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,016
-We're back.
-I need water.

370
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,434
-Everyone, grab a drink.
-Me too.

371
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,602
I'm worn out.

372
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,479
-I want water too.
-I want yogurt.

373
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,397
Have some.

374
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,399
Let's settle our accounts.

375
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,318
{\an8}Dong-jae mentioned it right away.

376
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,404
-Nice doing business with you.
-You're really something.

377
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,697
We're settled.

378
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,365
I thought it was reasonable.

379
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,951
-Guillaume, let's make a deal.
-What kind of deal?

380
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,244
You won.

381
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,912
-You did help me a lot.
-I want a Piece.

382
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,498
I gave him a Piece out of gratitude

383
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,542
<i>and told him I'd repay the favor later.</i>

384
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,003
-We're tied.
-We're tied for first.

385
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,004
Should we retrace our steps?

386
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,547
-We all made mistakes.
-Let's do it.

387
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,965
It's understandable though.

388
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,426
It's amazing Seok-jin
hid his identity until the end.

389
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,970
Had someone found out,
the game would've been over.

390
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,304
In the dealer room...

391
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,515
-Gosh.
-Welcome.

392
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,975
-This is so hard.
-See-won.

393
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,143
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

394
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,061
-Who do you suspect?
-Dong-jae.

395
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,271
-It's not him.
-It's not him.

396
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,148
-Really?
-So that's why...

397
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,067
Thankfully, the officer...

398
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,360
Who's the officer?

399
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,447
I can't believe it.

400
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,657
-This is...
-Guillaume is a terrorist.

401
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,658
Really?

402
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,577
He thought Guillaume was the officer.

403
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,621
-Oh, that clears things up.
-Unbelievable.

404
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,998
<i>I thought, "Damn, we lost."</i>

405
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,126
I'm not sure I'd do well
even if we played this again.

406
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,754
-You're bad at lying, aren't you?
-I am.

407
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,589
<i>The two most obvious liars</i>

408
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,216
<i>-being the researchers was not ideal.
-Right.</i>

409
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,343
In the beginning, ORBIT said

410
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,262
<i>that we should distance ourselves.</i>

411
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,722
<i>But we had to proceed
with the testing somehow.</i>

412
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,057
-We...
-We had to reveal our roles

413
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,059
-so people would hold our hands.
-You're right.

414
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,644
-ORBIT brought that up too quickly.
-Right.

415
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,396
-You did well.
-Right.

416
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,440
-It's in the past now.
-You're right.

417
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,193
-I was the worst player.
-No, it was me.

418
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,488
I talked a big game during my interviews.

419
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,405
The game is over.

420
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,449
But if that happens,
the episode might get cut short.

421
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,492
You know what I said?

422
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,869
It was a one-man show by me.

423
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:02,289
I apologize if the game
got too easy because of me.

424
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,500
-I apologized for making the game easy.
-Same here.

425
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,461
Tune in for episode two.
This is it for episode one.

426
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,297
From now on...

427
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,215
We have to shut up.

428
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,716
...let's be humble.

429
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,302
We were the trolls.

430
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,930
I thought someone
would get eliminated today.

431
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,306
I think two will be eliminated tomorrow.

432
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,432
-Two or three people.
-Right.

433
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,600
What games are there?

434
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,936
I hope there's a game that involves math.

435
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,313
I really hope there isn't one
that involves math.

436
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,108
-I just hope none of them involve lying.
-It's tough.

437
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,401
You were the best at lying.

438
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,486
He was the best liar.

439
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,113
The world's best liar.

440
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,240
I'm good at avoiding questions,
but not lying.

441
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,910
It was really hard to read you.

442
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,247
Seok-jin, I'll make it up to you one day

443
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,332
in any way I can.

444
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,875
Well, I also...

445
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,836
I just feel bad.

446
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,671
If you were a citizen...

447
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,341
If I were a citizen, it would've been fun.

448
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,176
-We could've worked together.
-Right.

449
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,346
We could've worked out
how to get more Pieces.

450
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,181
What I'm worried about

451
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,183
is doing badly again in the next match.

452
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,519
-Me too.
-I'm likely to do that.

453
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,979
What if I do badly in the prize match?

454
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,772
Can you lose in the prize match?

455
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,233
-We work together to increase the money.
-We have to cooperate.

456
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,360
So we get it as close to
500 million as we can?

457
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,404
-I assume so.
-Yeah, that's the maximum amount.

458
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,157
We should get it up to the maximum then.

459
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,953
Going to prison together would really
bring the two close together.

460
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:29,585
Actually, being isolated while the others
are all socializing sounds awful to me.

461
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,338
-Is there something?
-A box.

462
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,840
Try opening it.

463
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,886
There's something in here.

464
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,846
Let's try this cast puzzle.

465
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,265
"This cast puzzle box

466
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,017
contains a metal puzzle for one."

467
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,437
"The metal pieces of the puzzle
are firmly interlinked,

468
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,522
and it is also called a 'cast radix.'"

469
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,525
{\an8}"One Piece will be rewarded

470
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,652
{\an8}to the player that solves the puzzle."

471
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,114
Can I do whatever it takes to solve it?

472
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,411
<i>All right. I'll do my best
to solve this puzzle.</i>

473
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,705
I wish there was another one.

474
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,507
Will it open?

475
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,556
That's just trash, right?

476
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,141
I like that.

477
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,768
I like your curious attitude.

478
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,394
Well, just in case

479
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,188
we find something else.

480
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,898
Is that it?

481
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,668
They must be having fun socializing

482
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,461
and eating a lot of good food.

483
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,545
I bet.

484
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,175
-Amazing.
-That was awesome.

485
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,718
-That was crazy.
-That was amazing.

486
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,136
That's possible?

487
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,304
It's science.

488
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,348
This game involves elastic collisions.

489
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,308
-Per the impulse-momentum theorem,
-Right.

490
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,394
the last stone
is least likely to fall off.

491
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,771
The black stone is favorable to win.

492
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,189
Due to its mass,

493
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,275
-it's more stable.
-Correct.

494
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:22,114
I feel like time has stopped.
I don't even know what time it is.

495
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,991
Let's use this experience in prison

496
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,493
-and try to survive until the end.
-Okay.

497
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,412
They say you never forget your cellmate.

498
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,790
You're with them until the end.

499
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,627
I'm so hungry.

500
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,170
I wish they would give us food.

501
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,880
Someone's coming.

502
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,133
They're here. I think the food is here.

503
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,426
Time to eat.

504
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,512
It's a buffet.

505
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,264
The food is amazing.

506
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,725
They're feeding us so well.

507
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,310
-Seaweed soup?
-Seaweed soup?

508
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,562
Coincidentally, it's Seungkwan's birthday.

509
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,022
Really?

510
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,898
-Happy birthday!
-I think that's why we have this soup.

511
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,901
-Really?
-Happy birthday!

512
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,778
I'm thankful I don't have to
spend my birthday in prison.

513
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,448
Imagine how funny that would've been.

514
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,699
<i>I wasn't expecting this.</i>

515
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,535
This is a birthday I'll never forget.

516
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,786
This is so good.

517
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,288
It's so good.

518
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,372
It's delicious.

519
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,373
Amazing.

520
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,382
I hope being in prison isn't too bad.
It's really weighing on me.

521
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,843
I wonder if they get something like tofu.

522
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,638
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

523
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,474
Take this.

524
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,684
-We get the same thing.
-I was worried

525
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,728
-we had to share this one meal.
-Thank you.

526
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,397
I also thought we had to share.

527
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,192
-Better than nothing, right?
-You're right.

528
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,902
I was expecting one potato.

529
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,031
I guess this is
what they call "bread of tears."

530
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,867
This bread contains sunflower seeds.

531
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,411
It's whole grain bread.

532
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,081
I want to eat meat.

533
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,832
Will we get to eat outside tomorrow?

534
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,751
For tomorrow's main match,

535
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,377
-I might bring a book or game console.
-I know.

536
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,046
We should leave them in the cell.

537
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,131
Maybe a Nintendo console and comic books.

538
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,841
We should all rest

539
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,468
and handle our food coma.

540
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,638
Do you want to try this?
No one else seems interested.

541
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,264
{\an8}THIS MORNING

542
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,307
{\an8}-Can I open this?
-Open it.

543
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,391
{\an8}"Nine Men's Morris"?

544
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,812
{\an8}-They prepared these board games for us.
-It's a board game.

545
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,313
{\an8}-Looks fun.
-Looks fun.

546
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,564
Let's see.

547
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,818
First, here are our pieces.

548
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,570
Choose one color then place one,

549
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,948
two, or three.

550
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,783
Joon-bin.

551
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,494
-What are you up to?
-Just playing games.

552
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,788
They seem to be playing a game.

553
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,998
-They're playing a board game.
-What kind?

554
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,543
-I think they were down there.
-Really?

555
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,670
Hello.

556
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,630
-Yeon-woo left for an interview.
-You're playing?

557
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,423
We were playing this game.

558
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,925
Do you want to try?

559
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,468
-How?
-It's a connect-three game for four

560
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,555
so we play as two players per person.

561
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,889
It's like they're studying.

562
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,975
I can't keep my mind off their game.

563
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,394
-Same here.
-Will that benefit them?

564
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,354
-Should we also play something?
-Us?

565
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,565
Let's just talk about science.

566
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,818
The food was good.

567
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,821
I'm hungry but I can't seem to eat.

568
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,116
It's because you have
too much on your mind.

569
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,409
You're right.

570
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,953
I'm going to get a good night's sleep

571
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,454
and do my best tomorrow.

572
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,165
Goodness.

573
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,833
-All right.
-That startled me.

574
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,335
<i>The prize match will begin soon.</i>

575
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,213
<i>Please return to the game area.</i>

576
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,173
Let's go.

577
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,424
-Let's do this!
-Let's go.

578
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,800
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.

579
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,094
I wonder what they're going to play.

580
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,846
Do we need to bring this?

581
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,306
This? I think we should.

582
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,016
Yes, they're like our lives.

583
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,560
Can I try holding it?

584
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,644
-Sorry?
-Can I hold it?

585
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,146
-Just to feel it.
-Sure you can.

586
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,106
It's likely to be
a cooperative game, right?

587
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,692
-I think so.
-We need to increase the prize money.

588
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,113
-What's this?
-It changed.

589
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,323
-Are we spinning on that?
-What?

590
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,409
I know what this is. It's really fun.

591
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,619
What's this?

592
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,037
Don't they have these at playgrounds?

593
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,455
-Yeah, it's similar.
-Kids play on it.

594
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,081
-You're right.
-Kids spin on this.

595
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,041
-What exactly is it?
-Does it spin?

596
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,918
-It's different from the one I tried.
-It doesn't spin.

597
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,753
-That's not it.
-My experience won't help much.

598
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,214
Can we go in? Do we just stand here?

599
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,174
-It might start spinning...
<i>-Before we begin,</i>

600
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,636
<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

601
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:18,058
<i>Guillaume, See-won, and Dong-jae</i>

602
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,227
<i>have the most Pieces.</i>

603
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,228
CURRENT PIECE COUNT

604
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,938
They exchanged Pieces.

605
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,775
<i>Now, here is the first prize match.</i>

606
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,362
The Devil's Plan's <i>first prize match</i>

607
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,738
<i>is Cooperative Puzzle.</i>

608
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,782
I like it.

609
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,158
<i>For this puzzle,</i>

610
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,161
<i>players must solve
the given puzzle together</i>

611
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,789
<i>on the spinning wheel
before time runs out.</i>

612
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,874
<i>Players will draw numbers</i>

613
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,752
<i>to determine their place on the wheel.</i>

614
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,422
<i>Then they will stand
in their corresponding place.</i>

615
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,882
-Okay.
<i>-The game</i>

616
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,384
<i>will last ten rounds.</i>

617
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,760
<i>When a round begins,</i>

618
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,221
<i>a box containing a puzzle</i>

619
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,139
<i>will be placed on the table.</i>

620
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,102
<i>The box will contain
puzzle pieces and a picture.</i>

621
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,062
<i>Using all pieces,</i>

622
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,065
<i>the puzzle must be solved
to match the picture.</i>

623
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,942
-I forgot what they said.
-You forgot?

624
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,779
<i>Once the box is opened,
the wheel will start to spin.</i>

625
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,949
<i>Starting with player one,
each player will solve the puzzle.</i>

626
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,161
<i>If a player cannot reach the puzzle table</i>

627
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,414
<i>and can no longer solve the puzzle,</i>

628
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:26,376
<i>the next player will take their turn
and continue working on the puzzle.</i>

629
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,003
I get it.

630
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,922
<i>Applying these rules,
a puzzle must be solved</i>

631
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,383
<i>within three minutes.</i>

632
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,552
<i>Once a puzzle is solved,</i>

633
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,178
<i>the wheel will stop in place,</i>

634
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,056
<i>ending the round.</i>

635
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,225
<i>When the wheel stops,</i>

636
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,352
<i>the player in front of the table</i>

637
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,105
<i>will be considered
the solver of the puzzle.</i>

638
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,400
<i>Once the next round begins,</i>

639
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,902
<i>a new puzzle box will be given.</i>

640
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,406
<i>When the box is opened,
the wheel will spin again.</i>

641
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:02,829
<i>Players with more than
two solved puzzles will receive a Piece.</i>

642
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,126
<i>For every additional puzzle solved,</i>

643
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,545
<i>another Piece will be rewarded.</i>

644
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:16,259
<i>For example, two solved puzzles
will be rewarded with one Piece.</i>

645
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,388
<i>Three solved puzzles
will be rewarded with two Pieces.</i>

646
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,058
<i>If all ten puzzles are solved</i>

647
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,018
<i>and the prize match is successful,</i>

648
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,520
<i>fifty million won
will be added to the final prize.</i>

649
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:32,067
<i>However, if a puzzle is not solved
within the time limit,</i>

650
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,194
<i>the prize match ends immediately</i>

651
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,197
<i>and no money will be added
to the final prize.</i>

652
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,407
So it'll be zero won?

653
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,700
We're doomed.

654
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,787
<i>The game will begin in ten minutes.</i>

655
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,122
Who feels confident here?

656
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,957
Who's good at puzzles?

657
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,709
<i>I'm not confident at all.</i>

658
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,920
And I get dizzy easily.

659
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,923
<i>I was thinking, "Lord, why would you
challenge me like this?"</i>

660
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,341
<i>I think the younger people
would be good at this</i>

661
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,760
<i>like Dong-jae and Seungkwan.</i>

662
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,512
Don't we do something similar

663
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,264
at the military physical examination?

664
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,518
Isn't there a puzzle involving shapes?

665
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,145
Puzzles like this? It'll be a cakewalk.

666
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,022
<i>Seok-jin might be good at this</i>

667
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,108
since he studied mechanical engineering.

668
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,568
<i>I think he'll be good at
working with shapes.</i>

669
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,986
<i>Being good at games</i>

670
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,322
<i>will be advantageous in this game.</i>

671
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,117
So this game is advantageous
for people like me.

672
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,952
The wheel makes
a full spin every 60 seconds,

673
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,162
which means it would rotate
six degrees per second.

674
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,914
If this is 90 degrees...

675
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,332
Is there a winning strategy for this too?

676
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,500
I'm sorry for not knowing my place.

677
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,668
Why are you sorry?

678
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,752
I want to apologize in advance.

679
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,922
It's okay, I'm horrible at puzzles.

680
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,257
Yu-min might be missed

681
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,925
<i>since she's an orthopedist</i>

682
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,218
who puts bones back in place.

683
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,639
First of all, I don't think
the individual prizes matter.

684
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,266
We need to solve all ten rounds.

685
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,225
You're right.

686
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,061
-We need to succeed.
-To succeed, however,

687
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,897
we all need to play like
we're playing for ourselves.

688
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,817
Succeeding at this game is the least
we can do for the two in prison.

689
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,735
-Right.
-Right.

690
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,027
-We send them to prison
-Seriously.

691
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,404
<i>and reduce our prize money.</i>

692
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,698
{\an8}The Piece is an individual award.

693
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,408
{\an8}The prize money is for the group.

694
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,076
The higher the prize money, the better.

695
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,828
The prize money is the priority.

696
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,621
Getting Pieces is not as important.

697
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,873
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

698
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,960
I think I can get
both the prize money and the Pieces.

699
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,670
I'm going to be greedy.

700
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,131
<i>I don't really care about the prize money.</i>

701
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,674
<i>I just want another Piece.</i>

702
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,260
<i>For my own survival,</i>

703
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,180
<i>I plan on getting at least one Piece.</i>

704
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,681
We need to communicate.

705
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,642
Let them know if they're doing it wrong.

706
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,269
-That'll help our teamwork.
-Right.

707
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,105
Keep communicating with each other.

708
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,607
<i>Time is up.</i>

709
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,525
<i>First, we will draw numbers</i>

710
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,360
<i>to determine placement on the wheel.</i>

711
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,820
-Seungkwan.
-Yes?

712
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,238
Please draw your number.

713
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,240
I got one!

714
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,075
-Two.
-Three.

715
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,535
-Four.
-Five.

716
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,287
-Six.
-Seven.

717
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,914
-Eight.
-Nine.

718
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,040
Ten.

719
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,251
<i>Players, please move to your place.</i>

720
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,295
-Joon-bin, please move aside.
-Okay.

721
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,338
I guess it opens up.

722
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,466
This is high-tech.

723
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,176
-I was just going to go over it.
-Same.

724
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,928
This is really high-tech.

725
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,055
<i>Round one begins now.</i>

726
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,598
<i>Ready...</i>

727
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,058
-We start right away?
-Let's go.

728
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,392
<i>-...set,</i>
-Let's do this.

729
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,436
<i>-go.</i>
-I can see it.

730
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,605
-Oh, my, this is...
-All right.

731
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,689
It's on the screen.

732
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,900
-It's not easy.
-Go on.

733
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,735
-It's a tough puzzle.
-What?

734
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,821
That doesn't look right.

735
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,198
-That shouldn't go there.
-I agree.

736
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,324
That's not right.

737
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,952
<i>This game is advantageous
for people like me.</i>

738
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,495
Being good at games.

739
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,249
-That's right.
-Nice!

740
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,626
-You got it.
-Wow.

741
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,586
-Great, that's it.
-We got it.

742
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,547
-Yes!
-Let's go!

743
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,091
-Yes!
-Bravo!

744
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,342
Bravo.

745
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,301
Guillaume did well.

746
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,553
-Nice.
-He was the best.

747
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,471
-He's good.
-Nice.

748
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,765
<i>Joon-bin, you have solved the puzzle.</i>

749
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,683
Me?

750
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,560
-Great, that's it.
-We got it.

751
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,727
Yes!

752
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,145
-Yes!
-Let's go!

753
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,315
-The wheel spun.
-The arrow is pointing at you.

754
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,320
I helped you. Don't forget.

755
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,780
Joon-bin, you're good at this.

756
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,157
It was pretty easy.

757
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,284
This is annoying.

758
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,495
Keep this up.

759
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,580
Let's do this.

760
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,292
It would be great if Joon-bin won again.

761
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,214
They only give Pieces
for two or more solutions.

762
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,800
<i>With more Pieces in our hands,</i>

763
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,719
we could share them among us

764
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,388
because I heard we could
make negotiations in the living area.

765
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,056
<i>What's his plan?</i>

766
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,809
Is he trying to get a Piece for himself?

767
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,271
I thought about it but then stopped.

768
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,523
<i>I decided to just focus on the puzzles.</i>

769
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,109
-Six seconds is pretty fast.
-It's fast.

770
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,652
So you have to move quickly.

771
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,070
A lot faster than you think.

772
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,364
<i>Round two begins now.</i>

773
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,866
Let's do this.

774
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,326
<i>Ready,</i>

775
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,994
<i>set,</i>

776
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,162
<i>go.</i>

777
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,208
-That's good.
-That's good.

778
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,251
-Great start.
-Great start.

779
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,670
-What do I do?
-No, not like that.

780
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,466
That's not right.

781
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,592
It's this.

782
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,635
No.

783
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,846
Okay, that's it.

784
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,808
-That's not it.
-This isn't it.

785
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,435
What do I do now? This isn't it.

786
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,979
-The green piece was at its place.
-No.

787
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,814
The green has to go on top.

788
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,316
Green on top.

789
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,234
That's it.

790
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,861
Does this fit here?

791
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,905
-You start panicking when you're there.
-That's it.

792
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,573
-You got it!
-Okay, that's it!

793
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,033
-Okay.
-We got it!

794
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,787
-Oh, I'm sorry!
-No, it's okay.

795
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,955
-I'm sorry.
-<i>Dong-joo,</i>

796
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,581
<i>-you have solved the puzzle.</i>
-I wasn't thinking straight.

797
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,166
-It's all right.
-I'm sorry.

798
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,919
It would be great if Joon-bin won again.

799
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,255
They only give Pieces
for two or more solutions.

800
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,132
-High-five.
-I'm sorry.

801
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,842
-It's fine.
-We can solve more.

802
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,594
These things are bound to happen.

803
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,262
-I'm sorry.
-Not at all.

804
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,847
-I wasn't thinking at all.
-It's fine.

805
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,140
We can't sweat the small stuff.

806
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,934
-All right.
-Don't worry about it.

807
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,978
<i>Round three begins now.</i>

808
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,063
<i>Ready,</i>

809
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,982
<i>set,</i>

810
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,400
<i>go.</i>

811
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,735
Okay. Fit the green piece first.

812
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,698
Look at the pointy edges.

813
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,075
-Wait.
-Fit the pointy edges first.

814
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,244
Where does this go?

815
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,287
-We have to fit the pointy edges.
-No.

816
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,539
Green on top.

817
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,748
-Over here.
-That's it.

818
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,708
-Flip it.
-That's it.

819
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,710
No, fit the green piece.

820
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,005
-Doesn't the green go here?
-Okay, we're close.

821
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,423
-It's done.
-It's done.

822
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,674
-We got it.
-It's done.

823
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,010
Take it slow. Don't forget our strategy.

824
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,262
Take it slow. Don't forget our strategy.

825
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,555
-That's it.
-Wow.

826
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,933
<i>-Dong-jae, you have solved the puzzle.</i>
-Nice.

827
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,852
Everyone else did the work.

828
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,311
Okay.

829
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,690
<i>Dong-jae is greedy for more Pieces.</i>

830
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,985
<i>If someone like that solves the puzzles,</i>

831
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,570
it can ruin our teamwork.

832
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,946
If this goes on,

833
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,033
it'll be hard to gain more Pieces.

834
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,953
Pieces are important.

835
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,331
However, we might not get more Pieces

836
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,542
if someone doesn't solve
two puzzles or more.

837
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,585
Okay.

838
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,465
{\an8}The three puzzle solvers
are on each side, right?

839
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,674
{\an8}As the wheel spins,

840
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,303
if it gets close to them, give them
a chance to complete the puzzle.

841
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,679
<i>Personally, I thought</i>

842
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,390
it might not be a bad thing
to let me and Joon-bin get the Pieces,

843
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,352
<i>seeing as how we had
worked together with ORBIT before.</i>

844
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,271
<i>But Dong-jae already had four Pieces</i>

845
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,441
<i>so I didn't want Dong-jae to get any more.</i>

846
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,443
<i>Round four begins now.</i>

847
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,779
<i>-Ready,</i>
-Let's go.

848
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,238
<i>-set,</i>
-Let's go.

849
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,156
<i>go.</i>

850
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,617
-What is this?
-There are curved edges.

851
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,035
Separate the pointy edges

852
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,412
and the curved edges.

853
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,456
That's good.

854
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,667
-Nice.
-Now fit the curved edges.

855
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,128
Is that one not curved?

856
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,880
That's good.

857
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,256
We need to fit one more curved edge.

858
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,928
The yellow one. The curved piece.

859
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,972
-The yellow one.
-There are extra pieces this time.

860
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,100
-You got it.
-The pink one.

861
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,684
-The isosceles? Is that it?
-The perpendicular one.

862
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,936
Use the pink piece.

863
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,230
We tried that one. Try the pink one.

864
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,565
Leave it as is.

865
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,359
-Let it spin?
-Don't solve it.

866
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,152
Why not?

867
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,904
<i>I'm really bummed.</i>

868
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,782
I needed one or more Pieces

869
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,660
to increase my chance of surviving,

870
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,286
<i>but I got caught up in the moment</i>

871
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,914
<i>and acted too passively.</i>

872
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,666
Let it stop in front of me.

873
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,209
Let's see.

874
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,752
I'm not solving it.

875
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,921
I'll leave it like this.

876
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,422
Don't solve it. Let it spin.

877
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,799
-Like this...
-Why do that?

878
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,219
-Solve it now.
-Should I solve it?

879
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,137
Go ahead.

880
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,471
Done.

881
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,556
Yes.

882
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,268
<i>Dong-jae, you have solved the puzzle.</i>

883
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,812
<i>For solving two puzzles,</i>

884
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,772
<i>Dong-jae gains one Piece.</i>

885
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,857
Thank you.

886
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,985
<i>Of course, I want Pieces,</i>

887
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,363
{\an8}but being greedy in a cooperative game
could make me a target

888
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,365
<i>so I'll leave that for another time.</i>

889
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,741
I'm very annoyed.

890
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,452
I'm so irritated.

891
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,913
<i>ORBIT wanted Dong-jae to solve the puzzle,</i>

892
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,040
<i>so Seok-jin graciously</i>

893
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,294
<i>let the puzzle pass so Dong-jae could win.</i>

894
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,254
<i>As we all know, however,</i>

895
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,881
<i>Dong-jae is very cunning</i>

896
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,217
<i>and poses a significant threat
to the group, yet he has the most Pieces.</i>

897
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,970
<i>So this is not an ideal situation.</i>

898
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,477
<i>To be honest, we were dejected</i>

899
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,980
and lost our will to win.

900
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,442
<i>There's no guarantee
the winner will share their Pieces.</i>

901
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,861
We should discuss this again.

902
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,572
Let's say we get a lot of Pieces
using this strategy.

903
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:43,242
Then we'll be able to use
those Pieces for a good cause.

904
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,785
Perhaps for the players in prison.

905
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,412
No one got eliminated today,

906
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,497
but what if we need to make a deal
with Pieces later on?

907
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,916
So instead of getting no Pieces at all,

908
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,460
having a lot at hand would help
save people from elimination.

909
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,378
Who does that benefit though?

910
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,839
Sure, let's cooperate and do our best,

911
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,760
but the puzzle solver
should be rewarded fairly.

912
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,928
Right, but so far

913
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,763
there were times when the solver

914
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,642
didn't actually get rewarded for doing so
because the wheel kept spinning.

915
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,895
That allows the next person to solve it
instead of the actual solver.

916
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,439
What do you think about randomly

917
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,566
giving out the Pieces won in this match?

918
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,569
-I don't like that idea.
-That's not the way to go about this.

919
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,241
<i>I didn't like ORBIT's communist plan.</i>

920
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,659
<i>This is a competition.</i>

921
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,536
<i>It seems like ORBIT
is trying to prevent people</i>

922
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,998
from getting eliminated before day three.

923
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,375
That can get complicated.

924
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,002
We should aim to win all ten rounds.

925
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,128
Let's just do our best

926
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,422
-and play according to the original rules.
-You're right.

927
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,092
-All right, let's do that then.
-Okay.

928
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,219
<i>It was disappointing.</i>

929
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:47,181
I just wanted us to all work together
to gain Pieces.

930
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,183
Let's do that then.

931
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,019
-Dong-jae, good for you for snagging one.
-Yeah, good for you.

932
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,020
-Good for you.
-I'm sorry.

933
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,063
You were lucky.

934
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,773
<i>It's a matter of luck.</i>

935
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,984
Pieces are important,

936
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:02,405
but having a lot of them at the start
could put a target on your back.

937
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,949
<i>I'm not going to dwell on it too much.</i>

938
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,367
Okay, let's keep this up.

939
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,994
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

940
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,537
It's round five already. Let's go.

941
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,830
I feel like it'll be easy.

942
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,666
<i>Round five begins now.</i>

943
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,917
<i>Ready,</i>

944
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,919
<i>set,</i>

945
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:17,837
<i>go.</i>

946
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,964
-There are a lot of curved edges.
-This looks tough too.

947
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:20,881
What the...

948
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,800
Fit the green piece first.

949
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,593
I have no idea how to do this.

950
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,892
The yellow doesn't go there.

951
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,519
I think we need to start from scratch.

952
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,354
Maybe put the green on there.

953
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,189
-Green goes on top.
-Green goes on top.

954
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,482
-That's good.
-Like this.

955
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,026
-That's it.
-That looks right.

956
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,902
Okay.

957
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,362
The two long ones.

958
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,239
-Okay.
-Nice.

959
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,700
-Nice, one at a time.
-Wait.

960
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,076
Darn it. What do I do?

961
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,495
Flip the green piece.

962
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,706
-Follow the curve. Flip the green.
-The green piece.

963
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,291
-Like this. Your turn.
-Okay.

964
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,630
Finish it up.

965
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,341
Flip the blue one.

966
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,592
Flip it.

967
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,968
He got it.

968
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,345
He got it.

969
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,721
It's done.

970
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,139
What?

971
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,350
Flip the blue one.

972
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,601
-The blue?
-The blue one.

973
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,019
Flip it.

974
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,355
-I think you'll get this one.
-Okay.

975
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:18,981
It's done.

976
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,358
Okay.

977
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,902
<i>Seungkwan, you have solved the puzzle.</i>

978
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,028
That was...

979
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,696
Nice.

980
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,656
I got nervous fitting two pieces.

981
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,494
-It can be hard to tell which one to flip.
-We made it through round five.

982
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,996
<i>Round six begins now.</i>

983
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,539
-We got this.
<i>-Ready,</i>

984
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,125
<i>set,</i>

985
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,210
<i>go.</i>

986
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:43,589
-Seriously? It's getting harder.
-Curved edges first.

987
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,883
-That one's very pointy.
-Is there a piece pointy enough for that?

988
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,094
-The green is very pointy.
-Nothing will fit above the green.

989
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,887
Take out the green piece.
We need to flip it.

990
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,597
Get rid of the green. It won't fit.

991
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,598
Okay.

992
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,141
-He's so good.
-Nice.

993
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,102
-Guillaume, you're the best.
-Curved edges first.

994
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,396
Guillaume is so good at this.

995
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,980
-Like this.
-Nice.

996
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,273
-That piece doesn't fit.
-That's not it.

997
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,608
-It doesn't go there.
-It's not it.

998
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,485
-It doesn't fit on the top left.
-The top doesn't fit.

999
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,569
It's all right.

1000
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,072
-It doesn't fit here either.
-Because it doesn't...

1001
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,908
-How about over there?
-It doesn't fit there either.

1002
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,827
-We've spun once.
-That's not it.

1003
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,122
That purple piece isn't right.
No, leave the green one.

1004
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,165
-Just move the purple and yellow.
-It doesn't fit.

1005
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,589
-You got it.
-That's right, you got this.

1006
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,591
-That's it.
-Okay. It's done.

1007
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,136
-We got it!
-Is the green piece in the wrong place?

1008
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,595
-Here. That's it.
-Come on.

1009
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,305
-You did it!
-You got it!

1010
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,682
-Nice!
-Nice!

1011
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,183
We got it!

1012
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,435
Why the long face?

1013
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,019
You again!

1014
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,646
You again!

1015
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,483
<i>-Joon-bin, you have solved the puzzle.</i>
-Thank you.

1016
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,526
Hey.

1017
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,610
I solved two.

1018
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,696
You and I need to talk.

1019
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,948
-He got two without doing anything.
-Dong-joo...

1020
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,324
-Whatever.
-You really came through.

1021
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,284
That was amazing.

1022
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,244
That was crazy.

1023
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,662
We created love.

1024
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,664
-Seriously.
-This is competition.

1025
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,334
Dong-joo, you're showing your skills
in this game.

1026
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,670
<i>Having solved two puzzles,</i>

1027
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,839
<i>Joon-bin gains one Piece.</i>

1028
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,924
You're so lucky.

1029
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,342
-Tell me about it.
-Nice.

1030
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,428
<i>Guillaume and Dong-joo did all the work.</i>

1031
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,180
<i>I really didn't do anything.</i>

1032
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,431
<i>I didn't even touch it.</i>

1033
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,682
I'm a bit annoyed.

1034
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,310
I'm happy but also annoyed.

1035
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,311
It's annoying to do all the work.

1036
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,812
I'll buy you lobster.

1037
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,147
Forget it.

1038
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,191
Those two are our aces.

1039
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,234
Guillaume is so good.

1040
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,402
Good job.

1041
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,613
-We three did it.
-We did well.

1042
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,323
We're solving the difficult ones.

1043
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,033
-You're right.
-Let's keep going.

1044
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,035
<i>Round seven begins now.</i>

1045
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,288
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.

1046
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,333
<i>Ready, set, go.</i>

1047
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,377
-Okay.
-It looks easy but it isn't.

1048
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,379
-Fit the big pieces first.
-The green one is difficult.

1049
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,381
-This isn't it.
-The bottom part looks hard.

1050
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,467
Is that blue piece correct?

1051
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,844
We need to figure out
the bottom middle edge.

1052
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,055
If I put the triangle here...

1053
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,224
-I don't think that'll work.
-It won't work.

1054
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:03,979
That's not right.

1055
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,314
It isn't? This...

1056
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,566
The rhombus goes in the middle.

1057
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,818
In the middle? Wait, is this right?

1058
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,279
-I think that's it.
-We have to fit the rhombus in.

1059
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,241
<i>These puzzles are easy at first,</i>

1060
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,909
<i>but suddenly get tough.</i>

1061
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,160
This isn't right.

1062
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,455
<i>I couldn't even fit the large pieces.</i>

1063
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,457
This piece should go in.

1064
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,084
That's not it.

1065
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,211
We can't make it fit.

1066
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,712
We can't make it fit.

1067
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,506
It has to be the rhombus.

1068
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,049
-It has to be the rhombus.
-Isn't this it?

1069
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,801
-This seems right.
-It is.

1070
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,052
-This is it.
-We got it.

1071
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,596
-We got it.
-That's it!

1072
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,848
Nice!

1073
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,184
-Okay.
-Nice.

1074
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,602
-He got it right away.
-He's good.

1075
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,812
-You solved it.
<i>-Dong-jae,</i>

00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,648
He's so smart.

1078
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,941
I just got lucky.

1079
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,902
<i>Having solved three puzzles,</i>

1080

00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,073
Dong-jae.

1082
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,825
He's far ahead at first.

1083
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,993
{\an8}Here is your Piece.

1084

00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,704
{\an8}-Good job.
-Seriously.

1086
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:02,955
{\an8}Nice play.

1087
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:03,956
-Three rounds left.
-Almost there.

1088
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,624
-It's getting harder.
-Let's go!

1089
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,418
-Round seven was tough.
-Three more.

1090
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,545
-Fit the edges first.
-Don't get fooled by the obvious solution.

1091
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,963
It's never the obvious solution.

1092
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,965
-Go the unusual way.
<i>-Round eight begins now.</i>

1093

<i>go.</i>

1096
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,972
Don't do the obvious ones.

1097
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,015
Fit the big pieces first.

1098
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,517
-That's not it.
-It's not this, right?

1099
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,019
-That's too obvious.
-What the...

1100
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,396
The rhombus seems like a tough one.

1101
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,773
The rhombus needs to fit.

1102
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,487
-Good.
-That's a good approach.

1103
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,074
What about the triangle?

1104
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,868
-This won't work. I'm sorry.
-The triangle.

1105
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,202
-I made a mistake.
-It's okay.

1106
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,203
-That's not it.
-It's okay.

1107
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,371
That was completely wrong.

1108
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,581
The square is tricky.

1109
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,624
Take it out.

1110
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,878
-The square is a problem.
-Rotate the...

1111

-Rotate the rhombus.
-That looks...

1112
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,340
-This doesn't seem right.
-It doesn't work.

1113
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,924
-It doesn't fit.
-Take them out.

1114
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:56,884
Take them all out.

1115
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:57,801
Oh, no.

1116
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,429
Does it go like this?

1117
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,265
-Like this.
-Fit the rhombus.

1118
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,892
We've spun once.

1119
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,477
I have no clue.

1120
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,978
The rhombus has to fit.

1121
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,356
<i>It was utter chaos.</i>

1122
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,816
<i>I couldn't stand.</i>

1123
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,986
It won't fit vertically.

1124
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,446
-Maybe it isn't the green.
-I guess not.

1125
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,864
We spun one and a half times.

1126
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,699
-We got this.
-Take your time.

1127
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,242
We have time.

1128
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,828
I don't think the triangles
go on the sides.

1129
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,413
-I think we have it.
-They fit a bit too well.

1130
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,623
We need another rhombus for that to work.

1131
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,416
-It might work if we do this.
-That's it.

1132
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,710
-The big triangle isn't right.
-The big triangle?

1133
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,295
-This isn't right.
-The triangle isn't right.

1134
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,880
This is tough.

1135
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:35,964
On the left?

1136
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,717
-If we put the purple on the left...
-That's not it.

1137
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,469
The rhombus won't fit.

1138
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,720
-Wait.
-Wait.

1139
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,222
The rhombus won't fit.

1140
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,599
-The rhombus is a problem.
-The rhombus...

1141
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,267
That rhombus is the issue.

1142
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,687
We just need the rhombus to fit.

1143
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,938
Is time almost over?

1144
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,398
I think this is our last spin.

1145
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,983
We're almost there.

1146
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,154
-Should we start over?
-We need to start again.

1147
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,572
Put the rhombus down there.

1148
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,698
How? What if...

1149
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,409
<i>-Thirty seconds remaining.</i>
-Oh, no.

1150
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,786
-The yellow piece. I think that's it.
-I think that's it.

1151
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,331
-Is that not it?
-The triangle...

1152
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,125
-The purple piece won't fit.
-Oh, no.

1153
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,255
<i>-Ten seconds remaining.</i>
-Oh, no.

1154
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,807
-That isn't it.
-It doesn't work.

1155
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,101
These two...

1156
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,811
<i>The time has expired.</i>

1157
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,939
<i>The prize match ends in failure.</i>

1158
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,900
<i>Due to failure in the prize match,</i>

1159
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,694
<i>no prize amount is added.</i>

1160
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,906
<i>It was disappointing.</i>

1161
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,367
We were moving at a good pace,

1162
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,078
<i>so I felt like we had
a good chance of succeeding.</i>

1163
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,997
Round eight was too difficult.

1164
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,040
<i>It took us a while to figure it out
even after the match.</i>

1165
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,210
The two triangles.

1166
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,546
Then this piece doesn't fit.

1167
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,756
-Like this? Try it.
-Wait.

1168
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,341
Like this.

1169
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:03,594
This is how it fits.

1170
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,513
So we might end up going home
with zero won after all this?

1171
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,849
I feel rage bubbling inside me.

1172
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,392
Seriously.

1173
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,519
We needed the 50 million won.

1174
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,563
-What a shame.
-So now

1175
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,023
our maximum prize decreases...

1176
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,399
-To 450 million won.
-450 million?

1177
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,526
Seok-jin, you were great at the puzzles.

1178
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,280
Me? I just happened to get lucky.

1179
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,365
-You're smart.
-I didn't get any Pieces.

1180
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,160
Aside from Dong-jae and Joon-bin,

1181
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,037
no one else received any Pieces.

1182
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,955
Dong-jae got two, right?

1183
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,207
Dong-jae got two.

1184
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,291
He has six now.

1185
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,881
I'll give you one, Dong-joo.

1186
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,508
Let's talk.

1187
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,926
<i>That game wasn't the end.</i>

1188
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,345
I thought gaining someone's trust
was more important.

1189
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,679
It's a symbol of my trust.

1190
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,516
You know what I mean, right?

1191
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,560
<i>How can I be so happy
with just two Pieces?</i>

1192
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,978
I felt so reassured.

1193
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,524
How was today?

1194
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,900
Today?

1195
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,569
I honestly don't know.

1196
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,073
I get what ORBIT is trying to do,

1197
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,742
but it goes against
the purpose of these games.

1198
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:11,870
It would be great if Joon-bin won again.

1199
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,623
They only give Pieces
for two or more solutions.

1200
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,793
I completely understand his intentions

1201
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:22,130
and I'm grateful,
and he's a nice person and all, but...

1202
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,551
It's all luck.
If Joon-bin solves the puzzles

1203
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,427
and has a conflict with Dong-joo...

1204
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,347
-Then that's their problem.
-Right.

1205
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,141
I get that he wants
to maximize our Pieces,

1206
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,643
but it's too...

1207
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,686
Who gets the Pieces?

1208
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,312
-If only certain people get to win,
-Right.

1209
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,440
do we divide the Pieces evenly between
those that let other people win?

1210
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,775
It's impossible.

1211
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,569
It's too vague.

1212
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,195
-There's no set rule.
-Right.

1213
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:49,074
It feels like one person
is acting like a dictator.

1214
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,117
And commanding

1215
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,494
-the others to do what he says.
-I feel that too.

1216
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,831
I'm sure there are others
that agree with us.

1217
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:56,832
Honestly,

1218
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,294
I was fine with everything,
but one thing I couldn't agree with was

1219
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,921
when you said we should

1220
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,383
give our Pieces to the people in prison.

1221
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,094
Then we'll be able to use
those Pieces for a good cause.

1222
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,721
Perhaps for the players in prison.

1223
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,723
-It was just an example.
-I get that.

1224
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,601
But I didn't like that idea at all.

1225
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,979
That's because
you already have a lot of Pieces.

1226
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,939
Even with that aside,

1227
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,735
they aren't in prison
because they were good at the game.

1228
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,613
I don't want us
to be the bad guys just because

1229
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,740
we didn't look out for those in prison.

1230
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,241
Of course.

1231
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,620
I wasn't trying
to force anyone to do this.

1232
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,956
I thought it would help us cooperate,

1233
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,375
but in reality, that didn't work.

1234
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,003
It's like how MMA fighters

1235
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,796
beat the hell out of each other

1236
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,465
and bleed out,

1237
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,551
but hug it out at the end of the match.

1238
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,803
-Nothing else matters.
-You're right.

1239
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,721
Nothing else does.

1240
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,057
I want the winners to be rewarded more.

1241
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,558
Right.

1242
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,978
I think the winners should benefit more.

1243
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,194
I'm exhausted.

1244
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,238
Is ORBIT there?

1245
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:11,948
Yeah.

1246
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,951
-Could I borrow your table clock now?
-Sure.

1247
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,828
Can I go in? Are you too naked?

1248
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,121
Underwear...

1249
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,373
Do you want to wear your pants?

1250
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,166
-Underwear is fine.
-It's okay.

1251
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,209
-Is it okay?
-I have it on.

1252
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,543
It's the American way.

1253
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,587
-It's the American mindset.
-The American way.

1254
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,506
It's all right. It's like wearing shorts.

1255
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,217
Lift this and press this.

1256
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,886
<i>I lack intelligence,</i>

1257
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,055
so I wanted a smart ally

1258
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,974
<i>and ORBIT seemed to
take on the leadership role</i>

1259
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,810
during the games we played.

1260
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,770
Let's do this tomorrow.

1261
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,689
{\an8}Let's go for a shared victory.

1262
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,357
{\an8}-Sorry?
-Let's go for a shared victory.

1263
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,317
{\an8}-Then tomorrow...
-Sounds good to me.

1264
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,318
{\an8}Honestly,

1265
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:52,864
{\an8}<i>if Kyeong-rim and Seok-jin
had been allies earlier,</i>

1266
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,157
{\an8}the game would've been so easy.

1267
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,826
{\an8}-Right.
-I doubt the game tomorrow

1268
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,870
{\an8}will set us against each other as much.

1269
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,955
{\an8}-Joon-bin.
-Yeah?

1270
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,039
{\an8}Will you join us tomorrow?

1271
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,874
{\an8}We can be a team

1272
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,334
{\an8}if the three of us work together.

1273
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,752
{\an8}The three of us can.

1274
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,715
{\an8}-We can't let the others know though.
-Don't make our alliance obvious.

1275
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,091
{\an8}-Sounds good.
-Alliance? Okay.

1276
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,676
{\an8}Let's do this right.

1277
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,220
<i>I had an alliance with Dong-joo,</i>

1278
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:18,014
<i>and now Joon-bin is part of that.</i>

1279
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,684
Kyeong-rim and Yu-min's
return tomorrow would...

1280
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,768
It would change things.

1281
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,437
We need to see the bigger picture.

1282
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,190
It's likely they'll be hostile to me.

1283
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,026
To be honest,

1284
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,655
I think they'll have an advantage since
they're the first ones to go to prison.

1285
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,157
They might not tell us, but...

1286
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,825
-Some sort of reward?
-Right.

1287
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,994
There might be a benefit

1288
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,871
for the first imprisoned players.

1289
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,373
For example, a secret code or something.

1290
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,376
It might not be a bad thing
to go to prison once.

1291
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,503
Who knows what's in there?

1292
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,546
Exactly.

1293
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,339
Something could be hidden there.

1294
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,049
They say

1295
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,720
the sweetest honey is inside the hive.

1296
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,770
I'm sleepy. I can't focus.

1297
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,854
Do you want to try?

1298
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,859
You should sleep.
I'll wake you up in an hour.

1299
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,152
-Will you?
-Yeah.

1300
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,491
How do I solve this?

1301
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,579
It seems possible.

1302
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,248
What is it?

1303
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,046
Did you solve it?

1304
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,430
Almost there.

1305
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,938
<i>The best part of sports</i>

1306
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,733
or survival games is turning the tables.

1307
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,585
Time for bed.

1308
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,087
-Is it 11 already?
-Lights out?

1309
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,046
Oh, lights out.

1310
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,589
I love dim lights.

1311
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,966
-This is nice.
-The night's just begun.

1312
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:19,386
-You look prettier in this lighting.
-Really? Thanks.

1313
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:23,682
Today and tomorrow
are going to be so memorable.

1314
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,017
I won't forget when I first sat here.

1315
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,937
I'm a bit of an introvert,
but we've grown close to each other.

1316
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,939
<i>And we're like a family,
so if someone leaves,</i>

1317
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,941
I might cry but I'll try not to.

1318
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,609
Talking informally helps you
get close to one another.

1319
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,027
-That's true.
-Interestingly enough.

1320
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,279
I'm not good at it.

1321
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,822
Joon-bin, just talk comfortably.

1322
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,783
I prefer using honorifics
with older people.

1323
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,829
-He's being half formal though.
-He doesn't use honorifics a lot.

1324
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:46,913
That's why I joined.

1325
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:47,831
He didn't kill anyone.

1326
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,332
The officer twisted it that much?

1327
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,250
He was the best liar.

1328
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,294
He's right. You're only half formal.

1329
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,254
He's right.

1330
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,714
He's a cutie.

1331
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,591
Is it almost midnight?

1332
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,509
Why don't we all head to our rooms?

1333
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,344
-Let's all go to bed.
-Let's go.

1334
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,888
-See you tomorrow.
-Good job, everyone.

1335
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:03,972
Great job.

1336
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,765
It was fun.

1337
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,933
I had a great time.

1338
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,310
-I had fun.
-Great job.

1339
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,644
That was fun.

1340
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,397
-Show us your smart side tomorrow.
-I'll try my best.

1341
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,858
-Let's try hard.
-No, I won't just try. I'll do well.

1342
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,109
Good night, everyone.

1343
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,319
-Good night.
-Good night.

1344
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,528
-See you in the morning.
-Good night.

1345
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,988
-Good night.
-Sleep well.

1346
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:20,989
-Happy night.
-Good night.

1347
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:21,990
"Happy night"?

1348
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,366
Let's do well tomorrow.

1349
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,451
See you tomorrow.

1350
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,601
Joon-bin.

1351
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,354
-It's pretty bright in here.
-It is.

1352
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,022
-Let's turn it off.
-We can probably turn this off.

1353
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,107
We can turn these off.

1354
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,817
It's dark.

1355
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,694
This should do.

1356
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,779
Are you going to sleep?

1357
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,031
-I'm not sleepy.
-Should we read?

1358
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,115
Sure.

1359
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,327
-We have to do most of tomorrow's game.
-I know.

1360
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,162
{\an8}If we fail to carry the game...

1361
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,164
Our reputation as YouTubers will suffer.

1362
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,207
You're right.

1363
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,000
We were too dumb today.

1364
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,294
Let's keep a distance tomorrow

1365
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,796
and claim victory.

1366
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,048
An ugly win is still a win.

1367
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,843
Tomorrow, no matter what happens,

1368
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,553
-will you trust me?
-I will.

1369
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,347
I'll trust you too.

1370
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,557
-We're allies tomorrow, okay?
-Yeah.

1371
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,476
Either we both go to prison,

1372
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,228
or we both go home.

1373
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,730
Dong-jae really wants to
win the whole thing,

1374
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,982
so we should coax him.

1375
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,608
And then betray him.

1376
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,859
-Dong-jae?
-Yeah.

1377
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,611
Because I have a grudge against him.

1378
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,697
I got owned by him today.

1379
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,992
-Well, we both got destroyed.
-Exactly.

1380
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,327
We need a strong alliance.

1381
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,954
Two of us aren't enough.

1382
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,163
<i>I'm sure of Dong-joo.</i>

1383
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,289
<i>I trust Dong-joo.</i>

1384
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,582
<i>Me too.</i>

1385
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,835
Who else can we trust?

1386
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:57,752
Seungkwan.

1387
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:58,920
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1388
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,047
I trust Seungkwan,

1389
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,425
but he and Dong-jae
could be planning something.

1390
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,260
-Exactly.
-That worries me.

1391
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,761
Who's Seungkwan's roommate?

1392
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:07,887
<i>Dong-jae.</i>

1393
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,350
I think I can sweet-talk Seungkwan.

1394
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,977
Let's try it then.

1395
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,937
Of the people left,

1396
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,814
who else can we bring in? Hye-sung?

1397
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:18,982
<i>That's an option.</i>

1398
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,400
<i>Hye-sung, Seungkwan...</i>

1399
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,693
Dong-joo...

1400
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,111
And...

1401
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,904
<i>maybe Yeon-woo,</i>

1402
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,364
<i>but she's with See-won.</i>

1403
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,449
<i>-It'll be tough.
-Right.</i>

1404
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,367
I think they're already allies.

1405
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,662
Instead, maybe Yu-min.

1406
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,624
Yu-min and I trusted each other
as citizens today.

1407
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,626
We have some trust, but...

1408
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,964
Then let's aim for a six-person alliance
and try to survive.

1409
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,215
-All right.
-So we have

1410
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,426
<i>-Seungkwan...
-Dong-joo,</i>

1411
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,719
<i>Yu-min, and Hye-sung.</i>

1412
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,387
-That makes six including us.
-Okay.

1413
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,847
With our alliance

1414
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,640
-we'll stand a chance.
-We wouldn't lose.

1415
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:57,312
12 HOURS LATER

1416
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,148
-You want me to survive with the dice?
-That's a bit harsh.

1417
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:02,859
This is crazy!

1418
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,653
This is crazy!

1419
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,655
Dong-jae, you move to prison.

1420
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,990
This isn't good.

1421
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,034
This isn't ideal.

1422
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,079
Damn, wait a minute.

1423
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:57,307
