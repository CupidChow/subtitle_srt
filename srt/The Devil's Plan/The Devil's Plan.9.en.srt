1
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:26,317
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

2
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,116
{\an8}Joon-bin.

3
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,410
{\an8}Please place a grass tile.

4
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,704
{\an8}Just a moment. I need time to think.

5
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,541
-I'll take this square.
-No.

6
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,918
We lost this square.

7
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,463
{\an8}I know what to do.

8
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,464
I'll use this.

9
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,965
Will you use your coupon?

10
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,513
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,931
I'll take the blows.

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,725
You just play the game peacefully.

13
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,351
I'll protect you. Don't come this way.

14
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,145
All right, protect me.

15
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,063
Seungkwan.

16
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,564
-Yes?
-Please place a grass tile.

17
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,734
{\an8}He's using a small tile.

18
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,152
{\an8}Only three squares?

19
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,445
{\an8}Yeah, it's pretty small.

20
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,907
{\an8}Seungkwan, I want to
take the robbery square.

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,117
{\an8}So place your tile on the other side.

22
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,744
{\an8}-You don't want me here?
-No.

23
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,079
{\an8}-Why?
-If you place a tile here,

24
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,330
{\an8}I can't take that square.

25
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,040
{\an8}Our tiles can't touch.

26
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>Round three begins now.</i>

27
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,503
See-won, please place a grass tile.

28
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,088
Thank you.

29
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,423
I want to place my tile like this.

30
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,050
{\an8}Would it be too risky for this space?

31
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,301
{\an8}It could be hard to fill it.

32
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,219
{\an8}Right?

33
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,262
{\an8}-You have one minute left.
-Okay.

34
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,972
{\an8}Why are you expanding that way?

35
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,599
{\an8}I want to go this way.

36
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,934
-Not backward?
-Not yet.

37
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,061
If you do that, you'll be open to attacks.

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,775
{\an8}Are you finished?

39
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,610
-Yes.
-Kyeong-rim.

40
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,028
Please place a grass tile.

41
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,404
Thank you.

42
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,489
{\an8}That's a good tile.

43
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,658
{\an8}You're getting great tiles.

44
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,910
{\an8}-I'll go the safe route.
-That's a safe choice.

45
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,453
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

46
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,038
You're getting it done quickly.

47
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,125
Three more tiles
and you'll get a five-by-five square.

48
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,418
One, two, three, four, five.
Oh, I'm getting tile 45.

49
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,795
I hope the order stays.

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,421
It would be bad if someone changes it.

51
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,965
You can form a line with that tile.

52
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,634
Yeah, I can place it right here.

53
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,302
-Will you use your coupon?
-Yes.

54
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,470
Please submit your coupon.

55
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,722
Please choose a tile.

56
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,308
I'll take this.

57
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,685
It changed again?

58
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,562
-She took yours.
-I lost mine again.

59
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,397
-That's really annoying.
-You get the robbery square.

60
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,692
I think this is the best move.

61
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,943
This is getting crazy.

62
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,363
-She's creating a huge territory.
-See-won and Yeon-woo

63
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,573
are killing it right now.

64
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,908
Seok-jin, please place a grass tile.

65
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,785
Do I take that horrible tile?

66
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,954
{\an8}Just take the bad tile.

67
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,247
{\an8}Should I exchange it?

68
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,291
{\an8}I think it'll be better to do that.

69
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,294
{\an8}-Seriously?
-You have one minute left.

70
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,129
{\an8}-Will you use your coupon?
-Yes.

71
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,630
{\an8}Please choose a tile.

72
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,430
This way, I won't lose
the robbery square to Joon-bin.

73
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,307
Just take the square. I won't.

74
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,183
As he said, the robbery square is a curse.

75
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,894
That's what he thinks.

76
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,146
It's the best one
since you can steal a tile.

77
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,063
-Dong-joo.
-Yes.

78
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,440
Please place a grass tile.

79
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,566
It's not a bad tile.

80
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,067
Look.

81
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,028
-It's not bad.
-Do I just go for it?

82
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,572
-Dong-joo, that's a good tile.
-I shouldn't waste my coupon now.

83
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,574
It would be a waste. Thank you.

84
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,118
-Your territory looks nice.
-It does.

85
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,621
Yu-min, please place a grass tile.

86
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,955
Is this the best move?

87
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,540
Keep turning the tile and see.

88
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,043
You could take this square
if you put it here.

89
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,711
That's a risky move.

90
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,838
I don't think I want to do that.

91
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,925
It's not bad and you're not
playing too aggressively.

92
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,092
-That looks good.
-Okay.

93
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,677
I'll place the tile here.

94
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,179
Next player.

95
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,348
ORBIT, please place a grass tile.

96
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,641
This tile is absolutely horrible.

97
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,769
Put it there.

98
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,062
What about like this?

99
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,813
-If I take this square,
-Yeah?

100
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,315
-Dong-joo is affected.
-I see.

101
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,650
Even better then.

102
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,693
-Or...
-Seungkwan, how could you?

103
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,278
What about this, Seungkwan?

104
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,488
No!

105
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,240
-Our poor Seungkwan.
-Do what you want.

106
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,366
I'm just going to kneel.

107
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,035
-I'm kidding.
-Wait.

108
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,620
That would be a great move.

109
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,956
-You could take that square.
-That could be an option.

110
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,999
-I could do something like this.
-Goodness.

111
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,126
You're declaring war on me.

112
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,419
See-won, let's go.

113
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,046
Be bold like a man.

114
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,297
Is that okay, See-won?

115
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,966
-Of course.
-If that's your choice,

116
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,634
I'll just have to accept my fate.

117
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,390
No, I can't do this.

118
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,058
I'll just place it here.

119
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,101
That looks good.

120
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,271
I have a better chance
of taking the stone square.

121
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,440
If someone attacks me,
I'll use a stone tile on them.

122
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,650
-All right.
-That's all I'll say.

123
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,026
It's a declaration of war.

124
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,947
{\an8}I'm bluffing by telling everyone
that I'll use the stone tile

125
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,075
<i>on anyone who attacks me.</i>

126
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,370
See-won is dangerously close
to going home.

127
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,206
So she'll get more desperate to survive
later in the game.

128
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,333
Joon-bin, please place a grass tile.

129
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:55,920
I can only do this.

130
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,672
You have earned a tile exchange coupon.

131
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,091
Seungkwan, please place a grass tile.

132
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,094
Seungkwan, you and I are
in the same situation.

133
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,139
-You're right.
-We're citizens living on small lands.

134
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,016
-I'm done.
-Let's just try to survive.

135
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,976
{\an8}Seungkwan, you have earned
a tile exchange coupon.

136
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,894
-Congratulations.
-This game is fun.

137
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,855
<i>Round three has ended.</i>

138
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,025
<i>Round four will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

139
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,528
Kyeong-rim's territory
is the safest so far.

140
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,280
-She's playing safe.
-She's making safe moves.

141
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,199
Kyeong-rim's prime goal is to survive.

142
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,826
I have no intention of attacking anyone.

143
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,454
But Yeon-woo is very much
on the offensive.

144
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,581
You consider this part
your territory, don't you?

145
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,999
-Either I get it or I don't.
-Exactly.

146
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,543
If Yeon-woo had expanded this way,

147
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,961
we would all be fine.

148
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,213
-But she's going this way.
-She went that way.

149
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,882
So if and when
she takes the robbery square,

150
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,425
she has to steal someone's tile.

151
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,094
The Piece square protects you,
and the robbery square harms others.

152
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,846
The robbery square is better then.

153
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,847
It is.

154
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,432
But you could die in the next turn

155
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,892
as others will target you.

156
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,144
-This is my plan.
-Yeah?

157
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,771
I'm going to steal someone's tile.

158
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,938
Who will you attack?

159
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,941
I looked to see
which tile could be useful to me.

160
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,651
But there's a risk.

161
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,154
-Because I...
-I'll help you.

162
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,072
Okay.

163
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,406
-Let's see how it goes.
-Let's go together.

164
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,076
-You and I are quite similar.
-Right.

165
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,993
We may seem defensive,

166
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,661
-but we're very offensive.
-That's true.

167
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,955
<i>Round four begins now.</i>

168
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,583
See-won, please place a grass tile.

169
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,169
I'm going to neutralize
the threat of the stone square,

170
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,213
just in case ORBIT takes it.

171
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,714
Is someone trying to take it?

172
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,299
I'm a pacifist.

173
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,636
-This means you're attacking me.
-No, it doesn't.

174
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,638
I'm just taking preemptive action.

175
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,556
-I'm neutralizing your threat.
-No.

176
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,557
See-won.

177
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,476
-I have to do this.
-We should trust...

178
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,522
Now, I'm much more
of a pacifist than you are.

179
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,191
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

180
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,902
-Kyeong-rim, please place a grass tile.
-Okay.

181
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,403
Thank you.

182
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,449
{\an8}-I'm placing it here.
-That's a smart move.

183
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,952
Kyeong-rim, it looks like you're just

184
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,870
{\an8}-laying tiles down on a floor.
-Exactly.

185
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,457
{\an8}I'm just growing lettuce
in my little garden.

186
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,251
You're playing a game of your own.

187
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,419
-I'm playing Tetris.
-You really are.

188
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,047
{\an8}-Her territory's solid.
-She's taking care of a garden.

189
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,091
Yeon-woo, please place a grass tile.

190
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,722
Nice, Yeon-woo.

191
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,266
You took the tile exchange square.

192
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,517
Yeon-woo's on a roll.

193
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,853
You have earned a tile exchange coupon.

194
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,147
Seok-jin, please place a grass tile.

195
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,402
Today's not my day.

196
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,528
Isn't this too much?

197
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,779
Did I cross the line?

198
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,323
I thought I could use this
to threaten others.

199
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,909
How could you do that when I'm being
attacked on this side as well?

200
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,703
All right, I'll cut you some slack.

201
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,912
Thank you.

202
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,913
Thank you.

203
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,291
-I'll expand just until here.
-You have a four-by-four square.

204
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,418
Dong-joo,

205
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,961
please place a grass tile.

206
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,046
Your tile isn't bad.

207
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,673
It fits perfectly.

208
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,799
Yu-min.

209
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,595
You could put it there.

210
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,180
It's a perfect fit.

211
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,849
{\an8}Yu-min, you have earned
a tile exchange coupon.

212
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,017
ORBIT.

213
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,439
You already completed
a four-by-four square.

214
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,065
-Joon-bin.
-Thank you.

215
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,359
That's a good move.

216
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,694
-Good.
-That's right.

217
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,113
Seungkwan, please place a grass tile.

218
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,700
I'm done.

219
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,289
<i>Round five begins now.</i>

220
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,708
See-won, please place a grass tile.

221
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,002
{\an8}I have to use this.
Should I take this square?

222
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,712
{\an8}See-won's territory is huge.

223
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,882
{\an8}-Are you going for a nine-by-nine?
-It'll be hard to fill though.

224
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,259
-Are you finished?
-Yes, I'm done.

225
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,969
{\an8}You have earned a tile exchange coupon.

226
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,722
-Kyeong-rim, please place a grass tile.
-Okay.

227
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,183
-This is your best option.
-It is.

228
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,435
-You have a four-by-four square.
-I do.

229
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,979
Yeon-woo, please place a grass tile.

230
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,190
-See-won, can you come here?
-Yeah?

231
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,195
{\an8}What if I take tile 65
and fill this space?

232
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,530
{\an8}If you're confident,

233
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,323
{\an8}you should use your coupon.

234
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,367
{\an8}-But it's risky.
-But aside from this move,

235
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,494
{\an8}-there's not much I can do.
-You're right.

236
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,870
{\an8}You have 30 seconds left.

237
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,330
Will you use your coupon?

238
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,289
Are you exchanging your tile?

239
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,501
She did.

240
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,463
She's going for it.
She got the knife square.

241
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,423
Do what you think is right.

242
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,967
I had no choice.

243
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,761
{\an8}Yeon-woo, you have earned
a robbery square.

244
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,888
Please take another player's tile

245
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,390
and place it as you wish.

246
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,725
Who should I rob?

247
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,353
Yeon-woo, I don't want to
use a stone tile on you.

248
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,814
-On me?
-If I do, you'll need three Pieces.

249
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,941
-It'll be a war then.
-That would be a war.

250
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,109
-That's fun.
-Well...

251
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,611
Yeon-woo, don't feel bad for anyone.

252
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,698
ORBIT has helped me so much so far.

253
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,783
So I've grown into a better player.

254
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,076
I'm sorry.

255
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,244
-Take it.
-I'll take this tile.

256
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,004
She's in a great position now.

257
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,006
-I'll place it here.
-Look at that monstrosity.

258
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,593
{\an8}Today, my goal
is to play more proactively.

259
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,304
<i>And ORBIT is my number one target.</i>

260
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,473
<i>If I succeed, then I can send
a strong contender home.</i>

261
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,976
If I fail, then I might go home.

262
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,937
<i>It's a very aggressive strategy.</i>

263
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,272
-Yeon-woo.
-Yes?

264
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,523
You ready to go home?

265
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,774
Should we go together?

266
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,069
I made it clear that I'm going to attack
anyone who attacks me.

267
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,325
Seok-jin, please place a grass tile.

268
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,411
This is crazy.

269
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,955
If I do this,
this side becomes too long, doesn't it?

270
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,208
I'll place my tile here.

271
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,210
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

272
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,838
Dong-joo, please place a grass tile.

273
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,923
I could just do this.

274
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,133
That's a safe move.

275
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,802
-I'm done.
-You have finished your turn.

276
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,220
Next, Yu-min.

277
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,097
Please place a grass tile.

278
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,685
-It's not bad.
-Right.

279
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,854
But it'll be hard to fill this space.

280
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,481
I don't think so.

281
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,565
See how it goes then.

282
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,235
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

283
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,820
-Next, ORBIT.
-Okay.

284
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,156
-Your tile doesn't look good.
-It's fine.

285
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,240
Besides,

286
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,242
I have a plan.

287
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,204
See? He has a solution.

288
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,664
-That's good.
-Good move.

289
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,540
That's too harsh.

290
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,750
I have rights too.

291
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,002
-I'm done.
-You have finished your turn.

292
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,797
Joon-bin, please place a grass tile.

293
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,923
How do I even use this?

294
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,175
I have nowhere to place this.

295
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,843
What can you do?

296
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,969
Should I place it here?

297
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,513
-Can you take the robbery square?
-Can I get a five-by-five?

298
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,306
Yeah, I can still take it.

299
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,016
-I can't if you do that.
-He can't take it then.

300
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,684
I'll have to make things
harder for you, Joon-bin.

301
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,854
Come on.

302
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,273
I'm so afraid of foreign invasions.

303
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,484
Hey, you could take this approach.

304
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,112
Do this and fill these two spaces
by using your Pieces.

305
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,279
I'm lacking Pieces right now.

306
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,407
I need to save it for later.

307
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,575
If you do that, I can't take this square.

308
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,160
You're telling me I can't do anything.

309
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,079
He has to think for himself.

310
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,455
You have 30 seconds left.

311
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,290
This is your only option.

312
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,875
Why does this rotten tile even exist?

313
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,168
Is there no other way?

314
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,628
Don't you have a coupon?

315
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,048
I'll use it.

316
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,341
Please choose a tile.

317
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,385
Who's going to get that rotten tile?

318
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,304
This changes everything.

319
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,347
That's crazy.

320
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,975
-That's great.
-He's making it work.

321
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,101
He made it.

322
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,353
Seungkwan, please place a grass tile.

323
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,980
I need a five-by-five square.

324
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,941
{\an8}Right. Fill this space here.

325
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,943
{\an8}That way, you get a four-by-four square.

326
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,529
If you do that, Kyeong-rim could take
all the robbery squares.

327
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,947
{\an8}-That's not necessarily true.
-On both sides...

328
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,407
{\an8}-Really?
-Yeah.

329
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,701
{\an8}I'm not in a position to care about that.

330
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,161
I don't want to die

331
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,204
-while helping you.
-Okay.

332
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,083
Even if I take this robbery square,
I won't use it on you.

333
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,836
Thank you for saying that
and I'm sorry for taking it

334
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,421
{\an8}if you wanted to use it.

335
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,380
{\an8}Right.

336
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,717
See-won has to use that robbery square
or else she can't make a square.

337
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,093
{\an8}-By robbing at the end,
-Really?

338
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,595
{\an8}she'll make that square hers.

339
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,013
-No.
-See-won...

340
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,307
I have a plan for my own territory.

341
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,350
See-won's definitely robbing someone.

342
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,108
<i>Round six begins now.</i>

343
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,693
It's my turn.

344
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,201
You two are really going for it today.

345
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,827
You have earned a robbery square.

346
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,748
Please take another player's tile
and place it as you wish.

347
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,507
I've always wanted to
face off against ORBIT.

348
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,386
A two versus one fight? Great.

349
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,138
-That's crazy.
-This is intense.

350
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,392
-Are you finished?
-She's taking over the game.

351
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,938
ORBIT has always taken charge,
and I saw a chance to shake him.

352
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,815
<i>And he was close to
surrounding the stone square,</i>

353
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,734
<i>so I had to take it
before things got dangerous.</i>

354
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,987
If ORBIT uses a stone tile
on either me or Yeon-woo,

355
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,072
we both could die.

356
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,077
Kyeong-rim, please place a grass tile.

357
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,787
{\an8}This is my only option.

358
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,081
{\an8}I just need to get a five-by-five square.

359
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,333
{\an8}So don't hesitate too much
to expand this way.

360
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,543
I'm done.

361
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,711
Yeon-woo, please place a grass tile.

362
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,130
-You can take the stone square.
-I could do this.

363
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,049
We can't let him take that stone square.

364
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,301
-You're done if you place it here.
-You're right.

365
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,387
Wouldn't it be safer
to not let him take the stone square?

366
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,932
I'll place my tile here.

367
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,185
Look at Yeon-woo's territory.

368
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,646
Seok-jin, please place a grass tile.

369
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,691
I'm going for the safe option.

370
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,943
Dong-joo, please place a grass tile.

371
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,403
Should I exchange mine?

372
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,572
There aren't any tiles with flat sides.

373
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,198
Should I just cover this space?

374
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,910
Or I could exchange it for tile 83.

375
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,537
-That would be safe.
-It's a safe move.

376
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,372
I'm going to be cautious today.

377
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,833
Then I can fill this space later.

378
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,294
Just place your tile like this then.

379
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,838
Then your square gets bigger.

380
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,339
-That way...
-You're right.

381
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,216
Okay. I'll change mine to this one.

382
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,676
Please take the tile.

383
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,970
You're being selfish, Yeon-woo.

384
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,348
-Me? Am I going to die then?
-Personally, I hoped you wouldn't be.

385
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,226
-It's time for her to be selfish.
-Am I being selfish?

386
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,519
She has to be selfish for once.

387
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,480
Sorry Yeon-woo,
but I need to fill this space.

388
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,233
-I'm sorry.
-That's how you're expanding?

389
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,068
In that case, this space...

390
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,862
-It's dead.
-It's no man's land.

391
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,822
Couldn't you have gone that way?

392
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,866
Yeah, you could've just gone this way.

393
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,368
I'll show you why I couldn't.

394
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,746
-I see what you mean.
-I'd have to fill that space.

395
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,456
-I only have two turns left.
-You had to fill it now.

396
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,708
-I had to take the chance.
-Right.

397
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,002
-That's right.
-The remaining tiles are horrible.

398
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,671
Aim for a safe six-by-six square.

399
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,298
And if possible, expand this way.

400
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,883
If you fill this space
and expand until here,

401
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,551
you could even get a seven-by-seven.

402
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,511
What size square can you get?

403
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,513
{\an8}If I fill the empty space...

404
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,307
{\an8}-Four-by-four.
-Four-by-four?

405
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,727
If I fill the two spaces,
I get a five-by-five square.

406
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,729
-But it won't be easy.
-Exactly.

407
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,773
-You see those robbery squares?
-Yeah.

408
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,108
{\an8}What if they use them on us?

409
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,111
{\an8}I'm worried about
those three robbery squares.

410
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,405
We'd just have to accept our fate then.

411
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,407
Yu-min, please place a grass tile.

412
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,290
-I'll...
-Will you use your coupon?

413
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,458
Yes.

414
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,377
It's Yu-min's turn?

415
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,045
What did you choose?

416
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,130
I don't really have other options.

417
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,174
-That's what you're going to do?
-I just tried it out.

418
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,842
This is best.

419
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,219
Yeah, that's better.

420
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,720
You'll find a way to fill the space.

421
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,722
-What if I can't fill it?
-Exactly.

422
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,016
ORBIT, please place a grass tile.

423
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,894
Thanks to Yu-min, I got an amazing tile.

424
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,396
I'm sorry.

425
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,522
-It's not bad.
-It's okay.

426
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,440
It just ruins my plan.

427
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,194
Wow, he got the Piece square.

428
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,154
I can't go home yet.

429
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,490
{\an8}ORBIT, you have earned a Piece.

430
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,616
Good job.

431
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,575
Joon-bin.

432
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,452
-How do I use this?
-Please place a grass tile.

433
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,037
What do I do with this?
Do I place it like this?

434
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,998
You would have to spend two Pieces.

435
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,333
-I can't do that.
-You have a lot.

436
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,459
What are you talking about?

437
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,211
Do you want me to go home or something?

438
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,463
You can't place it on this side.

439
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,632
You can't do that either.

440
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,051
-My territory is so small.
-It's cramped.

441
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,511
This is unfair.

442
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,097
-This is getting tough.
-Please don't do that to me.

443
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,141
-I have nowhere to put this.
-He has no choice.

444
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,475
-He has no option.
-Seriously.

445
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,893
-This is brutal.
-I have no option.

446
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,979
The game is getting brutal
as it progresses.

447
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,190
I thought it would be a peaceful one.

448
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,942
-I'll give up.
-If you can't switch...

449
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,528
He's going to spend two Pieces.

450
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,780
-He is?
-Yeah.

451
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,157
I'll help the weak.

452
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,034
That's meaningless.

453
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,201
You tried to look chivalrous,

454
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,370
but you get a five-by-five square
by filling this spot.

455
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,289
-Don't ruin this for me.
-I knew it.

456
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,540
Oh, please.

457
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,001
Seungkwan, please place a grass tile.

458
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,878
-What can we do?
-His tile is great.

459
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,004
{\an8}Seungkwan.

460
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,338
You got this.

461
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,757
{\an8}Fill that space first,

462
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,717
{\an8}-before someone gets to it.
-Right there.

463
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,219
{\an8}If someone blocks that side,
expand this way.

464
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,513
{\an8}-Then you can get a six-by-six.
-Just fill this space.

465
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,182
{\an8}-You can avoid going to prison.
-A six-by-six square?

466
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,184
-I'm done.
-Are you finished?

467
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,311
<i>Round six has ended.</i>

468
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,022
<i>Round seven will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

469
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,024
What's your plan?

470
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,359
-Just let me know. I'm confused.
-It's fine.

471
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,527
{\an8}-I want to know.
-Don't cross this line.

472
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,237
{\an8}-Okay.
-That's all I need from you.

473
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,655
Your territory is very neat.

474
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,075
{\an8}-Exactly.
-You have the best-shaped land.

475
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,785
-Goodness.
-You could finish first.

476
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,831
{\an8}After placing two straight tiles,

477
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,794
<i>I placed my tiles mainly
around the tile exchange square.</i>

478
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,880
<i>But because I did that, there was a gap</i>

479
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,590
<i>between the square and the straight tile.</i>

480
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,176
And the other players kept telling me

481
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,386
that it would be hard to fill that space.

482
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,429
The next tile...

483
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,099
Kyeong-rim, could you steal
that cross tile?

484
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,809
-That cross tile?
-Yeah.

485
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,061
I'm asking her
to get rid of the cross tile.

486
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,230
If I remove that tile,

487
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,940
Joon-bin would...

488
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,191
-It would be good.
-It'd benefit him too.

489
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,152
-That's why I'm asking you.
-I'd be happy. I'd cry tears of joy.

490
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,987
{\an8}You'd be helping both of us.

491
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,782
{\an8}You could just place that tile
on this empty space.

492
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,033
Just a second.

493
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,994
The others think of me as a weak player

494
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,455
and tend to want to help me.

495
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:48,043
And I think I've been able to
take advantage of that during the games.

496
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,004
Yu-min, don't worry too much about
this tile Joon-bin placed.

497
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,715
Because he'll get a five-by-five square
by filling this space.

498
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,552
Regardless of that,
I'm worried about getting my own square.

499
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,803
I've got nothing.

500
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,596
I'll transfer this to you.

501
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,431
Use it when you need it.

502
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,558
-Kyeong-rim.
-Yeah, do that.

503
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,143
-I can transfer it to you.
-Kyeong-rim.

504
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,894
-This is amazing.
-Right.

505
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,646
This would be the best thing to do.

506
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,190
-I didn't know you had one.
-We're cellmates.

507
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,775
I didn't know you had one.

508
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,236
Ultimately, it benefits me

509
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,240
that someone wants to help me
because they think I'm not good.

510
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,325
<i>Round seven begins now.</i>

511
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,703
See-won, please place a grass tile.

512
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,623
{\an8}I could do this.

513
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,376
{\an8}Let's see.

514
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,712
{\an8}Or I could do this.

515
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,754
You're a devil.

516
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,256
We got so close yesterday.

517
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,632
{\an8}-Exactly.
-Come on, See-won.

518
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,010
{\an8}I'm pleading again.

519
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,305
Kyeong-rim, please place a grass tile.

520
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,516
{\an8}Look at her territory.

521
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,977
{\an8}Your territory is just so beautiful.

522
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,312
{\an8}She could get a six-by-six square.

523
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,647
Yeon-woo, please place a grass tile.

524
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,566
-That's a good tile.
-You got a great one.

525
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,026
Things would've been bad
had it not been this one.

526
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:54,943
Exactly.

527
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,530
Seok-jin, please place a grass tile.

528
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,867
Everyone, take a look at my horrible tile.

529
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,577
Can you even fit that anywhere?

530
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,204
It looks like a T-rex.

531
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,456
I can't exchange it.

532
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,546
Who has a use for this tile?

533
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,298
I'll lend it to you.

534
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,175
-Be cool and use it.
-You can't transfer tiles.

535
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,221
-Well, I have a plan.
-Amazing.

536
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:27,559
-I had a plan.
-Well played, <i>Problematic Man</i>.

537
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,477
As expected.

538
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,896
-He saw the big picture.
-What a smart man.

539
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,814
I wondered where the tile could fit.

540
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,941
Dong-joo.

541
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,609
It's not bad.

542
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,693
What do I do?

543
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,695
This is better than a straight long tile.

544
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,614
-I have no choice. I'm sorry, Kyeong-rim.
-It's fine.

545
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,450
Or you could flip it over.

546
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,119
Then if you're in danger,
take this robbery square.

547
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,371
Sounds good.

548
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,415
If you do, you could steal
a perfect tile for this space.

549
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,417
-Dong-joo, are you finished?
-Yes.

550
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,462
Yu-min, please place a grass tile.

551
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,047
Where could you fit that?

552
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,590
-Are you going to exchange it?
-Yeah.

553
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,175
{\an8}-I'll change it.
-Will you use your coupon?

554
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,261
{\an8}-Yes.
-Please choose a tile.

555
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,264
-Nice, Yu-min.
-That's good.

556
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,515
Good job.

557
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,392
-You got it.
-It's a five-by-five.

558
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,269
-She changed hers.
-What's the order?

559
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,770
We're back to tile eight.

560
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,647
-Tile eight?
-Again?

561
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,149
We can't use tiles two or six?

562
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,318
ORBIT, please place a grass tile.

563
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,486
Give me a moment.

564
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,738
This isn't how it should be.

565
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,366
This completely goes against my plan.

566
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,118
I'm in trouble.

567
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,870
Tile 16 would be perfect for ORBIT
if he can get it.

568
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,331
-Should I use it now?
-You have one minute left.

569
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,166
Should I? No, I'll just take this.

570
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,543
-Place your tile.
-Seriously?

571
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,627
I have no option.

572
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,254
That tile is perfect for me.

573
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,922
I can't do that.

574
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,341
-Why don't you take the exchange square?
-There's no point.

575
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,469
I can't do this either,
so this is my only option.

576
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,471
Don't you just need to fill in the square?

577
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,766
If I do, it might
get tough for me later on.

578
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,311
I need to make a winning move.

579
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,105
<i>I had calculated what my next
and following block would be.</i>

580
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,358
<i>I also knew how many
exchange coupons were left.</i>

581
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,277
So I placed the tile with confidence

582
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,195
that the order wouldn't change.

583
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,116
<i>Currently, ORBIT is in need of
a two-by-two square</i>

584
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,493
<i>to fill an empty square space.</i>

585
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,248
{\an8}<i>Only See-won, Seungkwan, and ORBIT
have tile exchange coupons.</i>

586
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:18,420
<i>If no one uses their coupons
until the next round,</i>

587
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,631
<i>ORBIT will get tile 28 on his turn.</i>

588
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,635
<i>Even if someone uses their coupon,</i>

589
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,138
<i>he can simply wait
for his turn to get tile 43,</i>

590
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,931
<i>which is perfect for him.</i>

591
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,145
<i>He has made a winning move</i>

592
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,065
<i>to save his exchange coupon
until the last round.</i>

593
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,443
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

594
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,154
Joon-bin, please place a grass tile.

595
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,489
I give up.

596
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,365
That's crazy.

597
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,409
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

598
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,660
Seungkwan.

599
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,079
Please place a grass tile.

600
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,123
Hang on. Do you have an exchange coupon?

601
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,834
-He does.
-You do? Wait.

602
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,337
{\an8}What if you place tile 16 here?
Will that work?

603
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,214
{\an8}It could.

604
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,425
{\an8}If I place tile 16 here,
I could fill this space later.

605
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,303
{\an8}But if you can't fill that space later,
then you're dead.

606
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,554
I'm going crazy.

607
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,389
This won't work.

608
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,100
You could jam it into the corner.

609
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,684
{\an8}Could I fill this space?

610
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,228
-There are two more rounds.
-You have time.

611
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,312
-Okay.
-We have two more rounds.

612
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,022
{\an8}We have two rounds left.

613
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,857
{\an8}-I'm done.
-You have placed your tile.

614
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,946
<i>Round eight begins now.</i>

615
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,448
See-won, please place a grass tile.

616
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,117
I will use my coupon.

617
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:32,953
This is driving me crazy.

618
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,039
See-won took the tile I wanted.

619
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,541
That's unfortunate.

620
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,167
I'm also running out of options.

621
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,132
-That's solid.
-Great.

622
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,258
-Good job.
-That's good.

623
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,552
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

624
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,303
-Kyeong-rim.
-That's your tile.

625
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,721
I'm getting tile 26?

626
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,390
-Did she exchange hers?
-She did.

627
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,516
She did?

628
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,101
What do I do with that?

629
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,519
Please place a grass tile.

630
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,896
I gave away my exchange coupon earlier.

631
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,274
{\an8}Goodness, this is insane.

632
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,733
{\an8}There's nothing I can do.

633
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,943
{\an8}Cover this space.

634
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,236
{\an8}-Place it there.
-Should I?

635
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,530
{\an8}-I can't use this space anyways.
-Okay.

636
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,448
-Are you finished?
-I'm done.

637
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,868
Yeon-woo, please place a grass tile.

638
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,871
Fill this space
to block off the robbery square.

639
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,581
-So I place it here?
-Yeah.

640
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,957
-Then it becomes useless.
-No one can use it.

641
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,295
This is getting more and more difficult.

642
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,463
Seok-jin, please place a grass tile.

643
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,632
Why do you keep getting difficult tiles?

644
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,092
Well, he's a smart man.

645
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,135
He figures out what to do.

646
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,678
That's what's interesting.

647
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,471
Can you make it work?

648
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,640
He can.

649
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,976
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

650
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,228
Dong-joo, please place a grass tile.

651
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,105
-Not bad. Place it vertically.
-That's a good tile.

652
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,356
-Great tile.
-Good.

653
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,818
Yu-min, please place a grass tile.

654
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,487
She finally got her square.

655
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,448
-She got a six-by-six.
-Yeah.

656
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,284
Is she the first person to get that?

657
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,702
Dong-joo has to fill a space.

658
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,621
Seok-jin has to fill two spaces.

659
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,289
-They'll definitely get it though.
-They'll get a six-by-six.

660
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,499
A seven-by-seven square
is almost impossible.

661
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,710
ORBIT, please place a grass tile.

662
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,962
-I will exchange tiles.
-Will you use your coupon?

663
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,176
-Nice.
-Four-by-four?

664
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,679
-Good job.
-You made it.

665
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,848
-The game's not over yet.
-It isn't.

666
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,600
Will no one rob from ORBIT?

667
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,311
No one can rob now.

668
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,438
Joon-bin, please place a grass tile.

669
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,606
What is this?

670
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,107
I think I'll have to discard this.

671
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,567
He has to discard it.

672
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,402
-There's no space.
-It's impossible.

673
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,695
This is the first discarded tile.

674
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,447
As there is no space left,

675
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,907
the tile will be discarded.

676
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,950
Yes!

677
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,910
Seungkwan, please place a grass tile.

678
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,286
This is insane.

679
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,663
This is so frustrating.

680
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,290
-What about here?
-Where?

681
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,001
-Exchange it and fill this space.
-Right, I should do that.

682
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,378
I'll exchange my tile.

683
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,504
Just get a five-by-five.

684
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,339
There aren't any tiles you can place.

685
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,299
I'm glad I saved this until now.

686
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,759
So much for finishing first.

687
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,552
-I'll exchange my tile for this one.
-You may take it.

688
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,054
This is hard.

689
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,389
-It's not easy.
-Good job.

690
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,682
{\an8}-Good job.
-Thank you.

691
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,810
{\an8}-You got a five-by-five square.
-I got it.

692
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,815
<i>Round nine begins now.</i>

693
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,109
See-won, please place a grass tile.

694
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,568
Are you skipping your turn?

695
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,780
{\an8}I can't really place a tile anywhere.

696
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,991
{\an8}Your square is five-by-five so you can't.

697
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,534
I'll discard my tile.

698
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,703
As there is no space left,

699
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,871
the tile will be discarded.

700
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,873
Kyeong-rim, please place a grass tile.

701
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,458
Tile 82 could work for you.

702
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,751
-Can it?
-Yeah.

703
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,545
{\an8}It could fit in the middle.

704
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,338
{\an8}You could because there's enough space.

705
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,966
She has a lot of space
because I didn't expand there.

706
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,259
So like this?

707
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,677
It's pointless.

708
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,637
-At least you can place it.
-Right.

709
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,889
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

710
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,309
Yeon-woo, please place a grass tile.

711
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,731
What if I place it here?

712
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,940
-I could get a six-by-six square.
-There?

713
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,233
It would take two Pieces.

714
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,318
Oh, that's right.

715
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,111
I guess I'll have to end it
with a five-by-five square.

716
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,031
-Yeon-woo, are you finished?
-Yes.

717
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,283
Seok-jin, please place a grass tile.

718
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,576
In the middle right here.

719
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,340
-Seok-jin.
-Yeah?

720
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,924
-It works.
-Which one?

721
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,634
-Tile 84?
-You can rob someone.

722
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,053
You can rob someone.

723
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,637
When I looked at the table,

724
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,349
<i>only Dong-joo and Yu-min
had six-by-six squares.</i>

725
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,934
If Seok-jin robbed a tile from Dong-joo,

726
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,729
Yu-min would finish first alone
and get four Pieces.

727
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,272
You can win if you rob.

728
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,150
If this space is covered,
this square can be used at the end.

729
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,402
And then if you get rid of the six-by-six,
you'd finish first alone.

730
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,488
-Can we try placing the tile?
-Yes, you can.

731
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,448
Do this, and then just fill this space.

732
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,742
I would need two Pieces.

733
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,744
One of each of ours.

734
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,705
Right.

735
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,415
-You want to try it?
-All right.

736
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,834
I'll pay one Piece
to buy an exchange coupon.

737
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,878
-Use it.
-Will you buy an exchange coupon?

738
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,546
Yes, and I'll use it.

739
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,632
Oh, they bought an exchange coupon.

740
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,179
What's happening?

741
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,640
By filling that space with a Piece,
they can take the robbery square.

742
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,601
That's a twist.

743
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,646
Dong-joo, please place a grass tile.

744
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,231
Make a six-by-six square.

745
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,690
All right.

746
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,860
You got it.

747
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,986
Are you finished?

748
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,113
-Yes.
-Six-by-six.

749
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,949
Yu-min, please place a grass tile.

750
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,826
Can you make a seven-by-seven?

751
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,787
-This is crucial. Where do I place it?
-It's either there or here.

752
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,289
You can't really do anything new now.

753
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,791
{\an8}There's one option.

754
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,626
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

755
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,045
ORBIT, please place a grass tile.

756
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,046
Okay.

757
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,214
It was fun, everybody.

758
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,049
After constant attacks,

759
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,176
I made a five-by-five square.

760
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,428
Good job.

761
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,180
ORBIT, you're amazing.

762
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,932
You resisted all those attacks
and still made it.

763
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,518
-I can't believe you still made it.
-You're admirable.

764
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,019
You really are.

765
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,148
It's amazing how
all nine territories fit here.

766
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,400
Joon-bin, please place a grass tile.

767
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,944
You have nowhere to place it.

768
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,488
-I can't place this.
-As there is no space left,

769
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,407
the tile will be discarded.

770
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,243
Lastly, Seungkwan,
please place a grass tile.

771
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,497
The game doesn't let up.

772
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,582
Seriously.

773
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,673
I should've given my tile exchange coupon

774
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,926
to Seungkwan instead of Yu-min.

775
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,012
I thought she was in trouble.

776
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,848
No, she just wanted
to get a six-by-six square.

777
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,934
-She even has three Pieces.
-Exactly.

778
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,270
<i>Seungkwan has one Piece
while Yu-min has three.</i>

779
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,774
<i>She could've used a Piece
to dig herself out of her hole.</i>

780
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,359
But she seemed desperate
and because we were cellmates,

781
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,028
I felt compassionate.

782
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,198
-We can buy an exchange coupon for you.
-Should I buy you one?

783
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,449
You don't have to.

784
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,326
-It's fine.
-Get a six-by-six square,

785
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,577
-and just pay me back.
-Right.

786
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,579
You can pay me back
without going to prison.

787
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,332
-That's a good idea.
-Do you want to do that?

788
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,750
-Just promise
-He can't go to prison again.

789
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,877
-to pay me back.
-He needs a six-by-six square.

790
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,755
I want to buy an exchange coupon.

791
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,756
Thank you.

792
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,757
Seungkwan.

793
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,342
I'll pay this back right away.

794
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,551
You need an L-shaped tile.

795
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,719
{\an8}Tile 37 works.

796
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,678
{\an8}-Get it.
-Take tile 37.

797
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,639
{\an8}-Good.
-Tile 37 works.

798
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,890
-I'll use this.
-Will you use your coupon?

799
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,933
Yes.

800
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,100
You may take a tile.

801
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,103
{\an8}What a relief.

802
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,688
Did you fill your spaces, Yeon-woo?

803
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,940
I'm headed to prison.

804
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,192
<i>As all rounds have ended,</i>

805
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,487
<i>players may now buy one square grass tile.</i>

806
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,324
<i>Pay one Piece
if you wish to buy grass a tile.</i>

807
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,536
-See-won, will you buy a grass tile?
-No.

808
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,704
Kyeong-rim, will you buy a grass tile?

809
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,872
No.

810
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,583
Yeon-woo, will you buy a grass tile?

811
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,543
Yes.

812
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,127
Please pay one Piece.

813
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,547
You have bought a tile.

814
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,218
Seok-jin, will you buy a grass tile?

815
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,594
Yes, and...

816
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,179
-He's going to rob someone.
-No, Seok-jin.

817
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,931
-Come on.
-This is crazy.

818
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:50,849
{\an8}Who has a six-by-six square?

819
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,891
{\an8}-Seungkwan and Yu-min?
-Seungkwan...

820
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,017
{\an8}And Dong-joo.

821
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,436
We had a lot of fun.

822
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,857
-Exactly.
-It's due to the two six-by-six squares.

823
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,984
He has to rob someone
to get a five-by-five.

824
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,612
-That's unfortunate.
-Try to get a six-by-six square.

825
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,073
But even if you don't,
you still played well.

826
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,409
Seok-jin, you have earned
a robbery square.

827
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,452
Please choose a tile.

828
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,079
Take it from whoever's going to prison.

829
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,455
That's right.

830
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,665
Whoever has the least Pieces.

831
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,208
Yeon-woo is definitely going.

832
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,459
-I'm going for sure.
-She's going.

833
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,169
-She used a Piece.
-She has one Piece left.

834
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,547
Choose another person to send to prison.

835
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,340
By taking a tile,

836
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,051
you could send somebody to prison or home.

837
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,137
It isn't about going to prison or not.

838
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,931
It's about eliminating somebody.

839
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,725
{\an8}<i>No one has three or more Pieces.</i>

840
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,935
{\an8}<i>So by taking someone's tile,</i>

841
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,312
{\an8}<i>he can eliminate someone.</i>

842
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,606
{\an8}<i>He could also take mine.</i>

843
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,403
Where's he going?

844
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,238
-No way.
-Come this way.

845
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,616
-I'm nervous.
-I prepared dinner for you.

846
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,700
Come have some.

847
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,744
-Dinner?
-Dinner's ready.

848
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,788
There's celery and kale.

849
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,249
-Nothing too tasty.
-It's Mediterranean cuisine.

850
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,547
Look at him putting on a show.
He's such an actor.

851
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,257
He keeps walking around.

852
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,675
This is driving me crazy.

853
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,721
<i>The plan was to take it
from Dong-joo or ORBIT.</i>

854
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,181
There's a lot to send to prison.

855
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,016
It's just going to prison,
not getting eliminated.

856
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,188
-I'm sorry, Yeon-woo.
-Yeon-woo?

857
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,231
-I'm sorry, Yeon-woo.
-Yeon-woo?

858
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,442
Is he being serious?

859
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,157
You're trying to eliminate me, aren't you?

860
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,118
Seriously?

861
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,420
I may have trusted Seok-jin too much.

862
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,339
<i>Throughout</i> The Devil's Plan,

863
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,634
<i>this was probably
the most inexplicable betrayal.</i>

864
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,886
I can't believe I helped him.

865
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,763
He crossed a line.

866
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,808
I guess I'm going home.

867
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,103
-I'm sorry.
-It is what it is.

868
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,646
To be honest...

869
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,281
-Yeon-woo.
-Yeon-woo.

870
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,535
-No, don't do this.
-We played really well.

871
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,246
Why are you crying?

872
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,415
Kyeong-rim, why are you crying?

873
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,042
-Seungkwan, why are you crying?
-I cry when I see others cry.

874
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,044
It's not because I'm sad, all right?

875
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,589
We were great in the end.

876
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,717
-I have no regrets.
-You shouldn't.

877
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,927
I can go home with no regrets.

878
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,053
You were great.

879
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,680
I was trying to make Yu-min finish first.

880
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,808
I didn't realize
someone would get eliminated.

881
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,893
There's nothing to regret.

882
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,395
We played amazingly today.

883
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,939
-We did great. Thank you.
-I'm glad I was able to play well.

884
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,566
You were amazing.

885
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,734
-Yeon-woo.
-Yeah?

886
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,235
You were great at attacking.

887
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,445
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

888
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,280
All I did was receive help.

889
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,240
I wish I could've helped you too.

890
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,117
I didn't know
someone would get eliminated.

891
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,287
It didn't have to be this way.

892
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,791
You did this just for entertainment.

893
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,004
You knew she and I were a team.

894
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:15,053
<i>I was honest
about everything with Seok-jin.</i>

895
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,139
<i>I realized you really can't trust anyone.</i>

896

<i>Here are the results of the game.</i>

897
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,395
{\an8}<i>With their six-by-six squares,
these players had the largest territories.</i>

898

{\an8}<i>Dong-joo, Yu-min, and Seungkwan</i>

899
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,817
{\an8}<i>each receive two Pieces.</i>

900
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,903
<i>Yeon-woo, who finished
with a four-by-four square,</i>

{\an8}<i>please pay one Piece.</i>

902
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,743
{\an8}<i>Yeon-woo has lost all of her Pieces.</i>

903
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:43,539
<i>As such, Yeon-woo is the fourth player
to get eliminated from</i> The Devil's Plan.

904
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,083
<i>Please return to the living area,</i>

905
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,836
<i>pack your belongings, and leave.</i>

906
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,754
Okay.

907
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,881
This is it for us.

908
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,218
-I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

909
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,386
-I'm sorry.
-First, you sent me to prison.

910
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,596
And now you're sending me home.

911
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,389
I know. I'm sorry.

912
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,809
Bye, everyone.

913
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,768
I had a great time.

-Bye.
-Bye.

915
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,855
Goodbye.

916
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,362
-This gets tougher towards the end.
-It's brutal.

917
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,241
There were so many other choices
you could have made.

918
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,536
<i>Here is the current Piece count

<i>-will go to prison.</i>
-What? That's how it is?

923
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,172
-Please enter the prison cell.
-Who's going?

924
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,257
-Who?
-You're going?

925
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,300

-Seok-jin, you're going to prison?

926
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,426
What's going on?

927
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,846
Depending on my decision,

928
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,014
either Yeon-woo
and See-won will go to prison

929
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,725
or Yeon-woo will get eliminated
and I'll go to prison with See-won.

930
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,853
Yeon-woo is definitely going to prison.

931

-I'm going for sure.
-She's going.

932
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,439
Choose another person to send to prison.

933

<i>It's unfortunate
that Yeon-woo got eliminated.</i>

934
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,695
But as the game progressed,
all the pieces fell into place.

935
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,530
Yeon-woo didn't want to go to prison,

<i>while See-won and I
have a mission to complete in prison.</i>

<i>I wanted to see it for myself.</i>

939

-It is what it is.

942
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,549
-See Yeon-woo off.
-Okay.

943
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,844
-Well played. You did great.
-Send Yeon-woo my regards.

944
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,053
All right.

945
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,722
See-won, make sure
to wash your face tonight.

946
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,682
I really need to.

947
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,602
-Remember what we talked about.
-I will.

948
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,187
-Good luck!
-Good luck.

949
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,856
That was eventful.

950
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,608
<i>The main match has ended.</i>

951
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,320
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

952
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,990
Seriously!

953
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,825
You should've told me!

954
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,077
Why didn't you tell me?

955
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:49,332
I had absolutely no understanding or idea

956
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,168
that Seok-jin was aiming
for something bigger.

957
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,837
I'll guide you to the cell
as your prison senior.

958
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,882
You really had so many other options.

959
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,508
Do you not trust me?

960
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,510
I do, but I wanted to
see this through with you.

961
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,305
I also didn't want
Yeon-woo to go to prison again.

962
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,975
Seok-jin, but seriously...

963
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,393
-This is prison?
-Yeah.

964
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,478
This is it.

965
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,399
If you wanted to play the game properly
instead of trying to make it entertaining,

966
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,239
you should've
eliminated Dong-joo or ORBIT.

967
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,074
So you're saying saving Yeon-woo

968
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,660
and eliminating Dong-joo or ORBIT
would've been the solution?

969
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,705
Either way, Yeon-woo played well today.

970
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,583
Either See-won or I

971
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,669
could solve the puzzle here.

972
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,879
But the possibility of solving it together

973
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,132
was too tempting to ignore.

974
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,510
The door's open.
I guess I'm really leaving.

975
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,845
-Let me say my final goodbye.
-Yeon-woo.

976
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,847
Why do you keep tearing up?

977
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,183
-I don't know.
-Come on, Seungkwan.

978
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,852
-You're making me tear up.
-You two got close in prison.

979
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,813
-See you soon.
-Okay.

980
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,856
You played so well today.

981
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,983
I wanted to leave my mark.

982
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,651
-You did.
-Good job.

983
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,819
You were so cool

984
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,070
-that my tears dried up.
-Really?

985
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,405
-Seriously.
-That's good then.

986
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,824
I can't cry hideously
when you're being this cool.

987
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,243
-Right. Wait, cry hideously?
-No, I mean...

988
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,412
What does that make me?

989
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,372
Joon-bin.

990
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,500
-I got to know you in prison.
-You're cellmates.

991
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,418
This is sad.

992
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,795
-It's time to go.
-Help her with her bag.

993
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,588
-Thank you.
-Get some good food.

994
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,465
-Order delivery.
-I'm going to eat so much.

995
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,634
-Get fried chicken.
-I'm never eating bread again.

996
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,885
Get pizza.

997
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,262
Bye, everyone.

998
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,847
-Bye, Yeon-woo.
-Goodbye.

999
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,310
Now, there are only
the semifinals and finals.

1000
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:36,772
And naturally, the games will get
much more competitive.

1001
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,149
<i>There's only one winner.</i>

1002
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,610
<i>But each person can leave this place</i>

1003
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,779
<i>knowing they created their own story.</i>

1004
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,657
I hope everything ends well.

1005
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,201
-I feel so bad about Yeon-woo leaving.
-I know.

1006
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,245
But I wanted to send her off with a smile.

1007
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,498
I really wanted to do that too.

1008
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,543
-But once I saw her eyes...
-She had such a tough time here.

1009
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,005
She went to prison twice.

1010
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,173
Exactly.

1011
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,008
She almost went three times.

1012
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,135
That's why

1013
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,846
I felt so bad for her.

1014
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,766
Gosh, this is so ridiculous.

1015
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,893
I wanted to send her off with a smile.

1016
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,312
So I held my tears.

1017
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,230
I'm so upset.

1018
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,774
Seriously.

1019
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:24,570
Do you think it was Seok-jin's grand plan
to go to prison?

1020
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,783
If it was,
then that's amazing on his part.

1021
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,578
But I haven't seen him
play well at all recently.

1022
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,455
Not once.

1023
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,833
Last night, I decided to
team up with Seok-jin for today's game.

1024
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,961
So I was hoping he'd play amazingly.

1025
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,715
-But he's always steadfast.
-Exactly.

1026
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,175
-He has an aura.
-He does.

1027
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,719
-I'm envious of that.
-That's why I still have hope.

1028
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,678
That he'll shine?

1029
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,890
That he still has something up his sleeve
and that's why he went to prison.

1030
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,475
-He's on to something?
-Yeah.

1031
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,939
Seriously, how could you?

1032
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,567
How could you keep things from me
when I tell you everything?

1033
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,154
You know how sly you are, right?

1034
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,284
-What's this?
-I'm going to work on that.

1035
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,619
-This is the puzzle?
-Yeah.

1036
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,455
It's time to let my specialty shine.

1037
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,456
My persistence.

1038
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,336
Today was...

1039
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,549
If this was all part of your plan,
then fair play to you

1040
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,260
because you might have the answer
to what's really important.

1041
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,554
When do you want to try it?

1042
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,764
-Give me time to calm down.
-Okay.

1043
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,809
I didn't know anything so I was shocked.

1044
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,186
Honestly, I resented him for a moment.

1045
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,605
But I realized
this was all part of his plan.

1046
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,358
I thought you were trying to
keep me out of prison

1047
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,360
and send Joon-bin here instead.

1048
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,320
So I assumed you were betraying me

1049
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,031
and you and Joon-bin
would crack the safe together.

1050
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,158
That's what I thought.

1051
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,993
You really don't know me.

1052
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,162
Betrayal isn't my thing.

1053
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,415
I knew that but I still thought
you betrayed me.

1054
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,709
See-won's really amazing.

1055
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,377
Didn't she solve the cast puzzle?

1056
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,629
-She told me she did
-She did?

1057
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,715
<i>and threw the puzzle at me.</i>

1058
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,216
<i>It took her eight hours.</i>

1059
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,468
How did she do that?

1060
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,386
-That's amazing.
-She's smart.

1061
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,513
I'll give you an hour.

1062
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,556
Is this different from yesterday?

1063
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,016
It is. According to Seungkwan,

1064
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,101
the puzzles get more complicated.

1065
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,728
Can you get lucky and solve it?

1066
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,521
No, there are certain hints.

1067
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,900
For example,
there were grooves in yesterday's puzzle.

1068
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,818
<i>So I twisted them</i>

1069
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,946
<i>and barely managed to untangle the rings.</i>

1070
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,325
The rings only untangle
at a certain angle.

1071
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,659
That's how it was.

1072
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,724
No way.

1073
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,695
-See-won.
-Yeah?

1074
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,243
It's a gift.

1075
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,664
Take it.

1076
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,458
No way!

1077
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,668
Are you a genius?

1078
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,796
-Are you a genius?
-You can start with more Pieces than me.

1079
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,173
-You must be a genius.
-It just untangled.

1080
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,883
-You solved it this quickly?
-I know.

1081
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,927
I stayed up until 2 a.m. solving mine.

1082
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,845
Did you use brute force?

1083
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,347
To some degree, I needed to.

1084
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,349
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I had to pull.

1085
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:44,353
That was one romantic way
to give someone a gift.

1086
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,773
Getting the prize money yesterday
would've been amazing.

1087
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,567
Will it be 100 million won again?

1088
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,193
Yeah, and 100 million won tomorrow.

1089
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,571
-What game do you think we'll play?
-I wonder too.

1090
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,282
Maybe something related
to Korean or memory puzzles.

1091
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,410
My gosh!
I get startled by that every time.

1092
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,788
-Let's go!
<i>-The prize match will begin soon.</i>

1093
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,082
<i>Please return to the game area.</i>

1094
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,417
Let's earn 100 million won.

1095
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,627
I played horribly yesterday.

1096
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,587
Today might be...

1097
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,381
I had a hard time understanding the rules.

1098
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,799
Because of the scales?

1099
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,426
-You're pretending to be weak.
-Let's go.

1100
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,595
Hello.

1101
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,971
-Something's there.
-Hello.

1102
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,723
-There are buzzers.
-Hello.

1103
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,765
It must be a quiz.

1104
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,100
There are only six.

1105
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,101
There are six.

1106
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,394
Just enough for all of us.

1107
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,022
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

1108
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,066
{\an8}<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

1109
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,944
{\an8}<i>Currently, Dong-joo and Yu-min</i>

1110
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,989
<i>have the most Pieces.</i>

1111
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:41,577
<i>Now, here is the fifth prize match.</i>

1112
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,329
<i>Today's prize match is</i>

1113
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,039
-<i>Montage.</i>
-Montage?

1114
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,624
-It's a memory game.
-It has to do with memory.

1115
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,461
<i>In Montage, players must remember
the pictures of faces shown on screen</i>

1116
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,464
<i>and find duplicate faces.</i>

1117
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,758
It's that one.

1118
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,885
<i>The game will last for five rounds.</i>

1119
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,762
-Five rounds?
<i>-When the game begins,</i>

1120
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,140
<i>all players will be given buzzers.</i>

1121
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,476
<i>When the round begins,</i>

1122
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,187
<i>pictures of faces
will be shown on the screen</i>

1123
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,815
<i>one at a time for three seconds each.</i>

1124
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,528
<i>Players must remember the faces shown</i>

1125
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,531
<i>and when a duplicate picture is shown,</i>

1126
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,367
<i>they must press the buzzer.</i>

1127
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,328
<i>If even one player presses the buzzer</i>

1128
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,664
<i>when a duplicate picture is shown,</i>

1129
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,584
<i>the round is a success
and players move on to the next round.</i>

1130
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,212
<i>The player who presses
the buzzer the fastest</i>

1131
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,047
<i>will be given one Piece.</i>

1132
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,173
-What?
-No way.

1133
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,675
That's a lot of Pieces.

1134
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,803
<i>If a player presses the buzzer
on a non-duplicate picture,</i>

1135
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:44,014
<i>it will be considered an incorrect answer.</i>

1136
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,308
<i>And the player will be penalized
with one point.</i>

1137
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,727
<i>Even if a player answers incorrectly,</i>

1138
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,730
<i>the round will continue
until someone answers correctly.</i>

1139
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,066
Not bad.

1140
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:58,779
<i>However, if the total points tally
drops below negative ten points,</i>

1141
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,156
<i>the game ends immediately.</i>

1142
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,950
<i>And the prize match ends in failure.</i>

1143
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,284
The game isn't too strict.

1144
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,578
-Right, and no Pieces are taken.
-Exactly.

1145
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,207
<i>If a duplicate picture
is shown on the screen</i>

1146
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,584
<i>and no one presses their buzzers</i>

1147
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,711
<i>as the screen moves to the next picture,</i>

1148
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,297
-Penalty?
-<i>the game ends immediately.</i>

1149
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,675
<i>And the prize match ends in failure.</i>

1150
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,592
Right away?

1151
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,177
Someone has to press the buzzer.

1152
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,637
It's better to get penalty points.

1153
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,721
-Right.
-If unsure, just press it.

1154
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:25,681
We have until it reaches
negative ten points.

1155
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,600
-And there are five rounds total.
-<i>If all five rounds are successful,</i>

1156
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,978
<i>the prize match ends in success</i>

1157
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,272
<i>and 100 million won
will be added to the final prize.</i>

1158
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,316
-It must be difficult.
-We really need to focus.

1159
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,402
<i>To help you understand,</i>

1160
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,029
<i>a practice round will be played now.</i>

1161
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:41,989
A practice round?

1162
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,116
-This is a game we can all be good at.
-Thank you.

1163
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,284
Or the opposite.

1164
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,494
-I like that it's simple.
-Same.

1165
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,289
<i>The pictures will be shown now.</i>

1166
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,583
<i>Please focus on the screen.</i>

1167
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,026
So cute.

1168
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:41,924
That was quick.

1169
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,008
We buzzed together.

1170
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,176
-But you were quicker.
-<i>Kyeong-rim.</i>

1171
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,511
<i>-You are correct.</i>
-Wow, Kyeong-rim.

1172
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,638
It's because you meet a lot of people.

1173
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,265
<i>In the actual game,
players who answer correctly</i>

1174
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,059
<i>will receive one Piece.</i>

1175
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,977
Do you have any tips?

1176
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,979
Look for notable features such as hats,

1177
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,315
eyes, or moles.

1178
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:02,069
Meeting various people comes with my job.

1179
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,197
So I will use that experience to help us

1180
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,824
<i>succeed in the game
and add to the final prize.</i>

1181
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,993
I can play well in this prize match.

1182
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,078
I'm confident.

1183

-He's a travel YouTuber.
-You've been all over the world.

1184
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,373
You've met a lot of people.

1185
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,041
-Show us what you've got.
-Yeah.

1186
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,669
It's a team game,
but I want to get Pieces for myself.

1187
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,087
I want all five Pieces.

1188
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,088
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

1189
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,382
-100 million won!
-100 million won!

1190

<i>Montage will begin now.</i>

1191
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,135
Thank you.

1192
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,679
I'm going to step back.

<i>Please focus on the screen.</i>

1195
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,911
This is driving me crazy.

1196
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,885
-It's wrong. I'm sorry.
-I don't think it's this one.

1197
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,220
-It's fine.
-You could be right.

1198
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,513
-It's okay. They looked similar.
-Right.

1199
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,056
It's fine.

00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,772
-They looked similar.
-Focus.

1204
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,524
-They looked so similar.
-Focus.

1205
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,152
Their hairstyles are different.

1206
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,495
They're all wearing glasses.
That's not right.

1207
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,247
That's not right.

1208
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,207
-It's not?

-It's fine.

1212
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,546
I was too hasty.

1213
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,927
-That's wrong.
-That's wrong.

1214

This person came out earlier.

1215
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,263
-No.
-No?

1216
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,264
-She didn't.
-No.

-No.

-What about this one?
-No.

1224
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,489
-Looks familiar.
-No, because of earrings.

1225
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,657
-This one.
-No.

1226
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,949
-It's not.
-It's not.

1227

-What's wrong with me?

1230

Call it out before you buzz.

00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,707
-Not this person.
-No.

1232
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,793
They made the faces look similar.

1233
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,545
They edited the pictures
so they look similar.

1234
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,756
-This is it.
-It's not.

1235
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,508
-Kyeong-rim, please. It's not.
-It's not.

-It's not.

-It's not.
-Not this one.

-Not this one.

-Is it? No?
-No, it's not.

-Then...
-Not this person.

1243
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:43,271
Someone should press their buzzer.

1244
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,648
-I think this is it.
-It is.

1245
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,235
It is.

1246
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,195
It is.

<i>The current points tally is four points.</i>

Four in just round one?

00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,832
The difficulty probably won't change.

-There are five rounds, right?
-Yeah.

1254
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,086
It'll be impossible
if they show 30 or 40 faces.

1255
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,170
-Let's go.
-We got this.

1256
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,922
-Let's go.
-I lost us 40 million won.

1257
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,090
-It's all right.
-It's okay.

1258
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,967
-We just have to communicate.
-Okay.

1259
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,302
Let's talk more. We were too quiet.

1260
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,721
We're ready.

1261
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,433
We're ready.

1262
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,184
They're ignoring you.

1263
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,978
We're ready to begin.

1264
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,397
-They're ignoring you too.
-It's okay.

1265
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,024
We're ready to begin round two.

1266
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,862
-They listened to Seungkwan.
-<i>Here are the pictures for round two.</i>

1267
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:32,821
Focus.

1268
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,240
Should we communicate?

1269
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,450
No, it'll get hectic.

1270
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,201
-It'll be confusing.
-Keep talking.

1271
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,328
-They're kids.
-Kids with big eyes.

1272
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,164
-Red shirt.
-He's handsome.

1273
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,331
I can't focus.

1274
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,126
Comments like that seem unnecessary.

1275
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,757
Blonde.

1276
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,550
-Curly hair.
-Say it in your head.

1277
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,307
It's not this kid.

1278
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,268
Not this one either.

1279
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,978
Right. It's not this kid.

1280
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,357
No.

1281
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,527
Not this one.

1282
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,614
No.

1283
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,283
No.

1284
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,912
It suddenly changed to an adult.

1285
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,206
Not this one.

1286
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,000
Not this one.

1287
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,963
-Not this one.
-No.

1288
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,048
-No.
-No.

1289
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,176
-No.
-No.

1290
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,137
Not this one.

1291
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:41,848
Not this one.

1292
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,439
-Is it this kid?
-I feel like It is.

1293
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,399
-Is... It passed.
-I should've buzzed.

1294
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,194
No, we'd lose a point. Not this one.

1295
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,280
Is it this one?

1296
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,281
No.

1297
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,076
-Definitely not this one.
-It's not.

1298
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,162
-I've never seen this kid.
-No.

1299
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,372
This round is so long.

1300
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,748
-It's this kid.
-It is.

1301
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,416
-It's this kid.
-It is.

1302
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,669
I don't think it is.

1303
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,711
Or is it?

1304
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,629
I think I saw this kid.

1305
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,632
<i>You are incorrect.</i>

1306
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,925
I told you it wasn't.

1307
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,094
-They're all so similar.
-It wasn't.

1308
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,929
-Wait.
-This is it!

1309
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,055
-It's this kid!
-This is the one!

1310
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,056
It's right.

1311
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,057
This is the one.

1312
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:24,975
<i>You are incorrect.</i>

1313
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,518
-What?
-No, it can't be!

1314
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,646
-This is the one.
-The hair is different.

1315
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,564
-They're all very similar.
-Not this one.

1316
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,690
Let's calm down.

1317
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,526
-This is it.
-Yes, it is.

1318
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,861
-This is it.
-Yes, it is.

1319
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:36,903
-This is it.
-It's not?

1320
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:37,946
It is.

1321
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,072
Is it correct?

1322
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,532
<i>-You are correct.</i>
-See?

1323
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:44,035
<i>Dong-joo earns one Piece
for her correct answer.</i>

1324
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,537
-Well done, Dong-joo.
-Good job.

1325
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,663
This isn't easy.

1326
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,748
It's hard to tell the kids apart.

1327
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,001
It's only natural that we get confused.

1328
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,128
<i>The current points tally is six points.</i>

1329
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,129
We lost two fewer points.

1330
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,422
It's going to be old people now.

1331
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,549
-That would be hard.
-Here's what I noticed.

1332
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,884
First, it was people with glasses.

1333
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,802
-Then, a bunch of kids.
-Right.

1334
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,305
We have to remember
who stands out among the others.

1335
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,849
-It could be bearded men or old people.
-Just remember that.

1336
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,392
Look out for unique features.

1337
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,061
We're ready for round three.

1338
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,606
They only listen to Seungkwan.

1339
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,941
<i>Here are the pictures for round three.</i>

1340
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,156
-She's pretty.
-It's a woman.

1341
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,657
She has earrings on.

1342
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,493
-They're all women.
-All wearing earrings.

1343
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,661
Women with earrings.

1344
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,622
Just memorize the faces.
We have no other choice.

1345
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,054
-Not her.
-We can't lose points here.

1346
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,805
-It's an easy round.
-Right.

1347
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,307
Just stay calm.

1348
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,061
-Talk before you buzz.
-Okay.

1349
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,021
-Stay calm.
-It's not her.

1350
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,064
I don't think so either.

1351
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:55,982
It's not her.

1352
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,573
Goodness.

1353
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,200
It's not her.

1354
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,660
Definitely not her.

1355
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,079
-It's not her.
-I haven't seen her.

1356
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,413
It's not her either.

1357
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,498
I haven't seen her yet.

1358
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,750
It's not her.

1359
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,045
It's not her.

1360
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,048
It's not her.

1361
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,635
It's not her.

1362
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,554
It's not her.

1363
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,599
It's not her.

1364
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,686
It'll appear when you start losing focus.

1365
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,820
-Isn't it her?
-Is it?

1366
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,737
It's right.

1367
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,947
-Isn't it her?
-Is it?

1368
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:44,864
It's right.

1369
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,075
-It's her.
-You're right.

1370
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,159
It's her.

1371
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,745
<i>You are correct.</i>

1372
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,999
-Kyeong-rim!
-Okay!

1373
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,750
You did it, Kyeong-rim!

1374
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,754
<i>Kyeong-rim earns one Pieces
for her correct answer.</i>

1375
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,423
I wasn't sure so I didn't buzz in.

1376
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,966
It's working because we're putting

1377
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,426
-our heads together.
-Right. Just stay calm.

1378
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,177
-Only two more rounds to go.
-Okay.

1379
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,888
<i>The current points tally is six points.</i>

1380
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,766
There are rules to this whole thing.

1381
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,892
So try it out.

1382
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,353
Feel the thrill of the Pieces fitting.

1383
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,980
You don't know the code, do you?

1384
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,524
All right.

1385
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,278
Such strange things are happening.

1386
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,659
You're almost there, right?

1387
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,787
"Year"?

1388
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:34,914
"Next year"?

1389
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,332
What year is it now?

1390
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,543
<i>Here are the pictures for round four.</i>

1391
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,297
-Old people.
-It's the elderly.

1392
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,673
It's the elderly now.

1393
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,425
I need to see the whole screen.

1394
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,802
Look at it from afar.

1395
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,597
-Is it...
-Not him.

1396
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,182
-It's not him.
-It's not.

1397
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,684
-Not her.
-Haven't seen her before.

1398
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,104
-It's not him.
-Not him.

1399
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,732
It's definitely not him.

1400
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,610
-It's him.
-It is?

1401
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,528
It's him, right?

1402
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,821
-It's him.
-It is?

1403
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,572
-It's him, right?
-It is.

1404
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,118
-Is it correct?
-<i>You are incorrect.</i>

1405
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,577
-He looked familiar.
-I hadn't seen him yet.

1406
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,912
-It wasn't him?
-It's okay.

1407
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,413
-He did look familiar.
-It's fine.

1408
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,706
He was familiar.

1409
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,750
-I swear I saw him before.
-It's okay.

1410
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:02,460
-It's her.
-It's her.

1411
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,587
-It's definitely her.
-It has to be her.

1412
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,256
-<i>You are correct.</i>
-I got it right!

1413
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,259
-Kyeong-rim!
-Kyeong-rim.

1414
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,176
Last round.

1415
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,302
Nice!

1416
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,846
-Okay.
-We got this.

1417
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,305
-We can do it.
-We got this.

1418
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,016
<i>The current points tally is seven.</i>

1419
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,018
-We have a chance.
-We do. Let's do it.

1420
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,062
This is where it is.

1421
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,397
All right.

1422
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,275
There's an outlet
when there are no electronics.

1423
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,612
Let me hold this for you.

1424
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,199
That's perfect.

1425
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,284
Nice.

1426
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,747
It's good that you're strong.

1427
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,958
<i>Here are the pictures for round five.</i>

1428
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,340
-Elderly again?
-Men, this time.

1429
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,425
-They're men now.
-Hairy...

1430
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,802
-Men with beards.
-Bearded men.

1431
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,722
He looks like Ryan Reynolds.

1432
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,335
It's not him.

1433
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,046
-It's not him.
-No.

1434
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,257
-No.
-It's not him.

1435
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:33,843
It's not him.

1436
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,971
-It's not him.
-Not him.

1437
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,058
Not him.

1438
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:43,728
Not him.

1439
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:45,855
Not him.

1440
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,898
Is that Mohamed Salah?

1441
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,816
Is it him?

1442
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,318
-No.
-It's not.

1443
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,278
-No.
-It's not him.

1444
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,198
Not him.

1445
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,327
-Is it him?
-No.

1446
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,746
-It's him.
-It is.

1447
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,122
-It's him.
-It is.

1448
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,166
-It is. I remember him.
-I'm sure of it.

1449
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,129
Finally, here we go.

1450
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,173
I wonder what's inside.

1451
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,509
I'm excited.

1452
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,718
Isn't it crazy?

1453
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,595
They put this here?

1454
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,932
-Okay, next year.
-That would be 2024.

1455
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,392
{\an8}Try it.

1456
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,187
-It is. I remember him.
-I'm sure of it.

1457
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,647
-You're so good.
-<i>You are correct.</i>

1458
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,653
-I knew you could do it!
-This is amazing.

1459
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,906
-Kyeong-rim!
-<i>Players have passed all five rounds.</i>

1460
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,325
<i>-The prize match ends in success.</i>
-We did it!

1461
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,248
No way!

1462
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,666
We got 100 million won!

1463
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,792
We did it!

1464
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,212
No way! This is it.

1465
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,422
It opens?

1466
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:36,025
