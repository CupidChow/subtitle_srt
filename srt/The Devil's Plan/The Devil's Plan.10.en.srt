1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,758
-That was good.
-We got it because of you.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,802
Our communication was so good.

3
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,055
{\an8}<i>Here is the current Piece count
of each player.</i>

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:20,729
{\an8}<i>Yu-min, Dong-joo, and Kyeong-rim
have the most Pieces with six Pieces each.</i>

5
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,150
<i>The prize match has ended.</i>

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,361
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

7
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,363
The kids and elderly were hard.

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,991
-Yeah, they all looked similar.
-Exactly.

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,577
The kids were the most difficult.

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,079
A prize of 250 million won isn't bad.

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,080
-It is.
-It's not bad.

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,750
-It's better than most survival shows.
-250 million won for a week's work.

13
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,961
-You want it?
-Not when the prize was 150 million won.

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,379
But I want 250 million won.

15
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,132
Joon-bin really wants it.

16
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,009
I'm yawning so much.

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,386
We all need to get a good night's sleep.

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,472
That way we can play the last game well.

19
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,849
I'm sad that this might be my last night.

20
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,477
This could be our last night here.

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,897
Six people will get eliminated,
so we can't work together tomorrow.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,440
Six people are going home tomorrow?

23
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,776
Aside from a few leading players,
everyone else goes home.

24
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,069
Four players go to the finals.

25
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,153
Why?

26
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,822
The final game will be
a connect-three game for four.

27
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,784
-It really could be.
-There's no way it isn't.

28
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,952
Is it easy? I should know how it's played.

29
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,538
-Teach us. How do you play it?
-In the final,

30
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,291
it'll be a connect-three game for four.

31
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,086
Then the two winners
will play Nine Men's Morris.

32
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,004
Really? Teach us.

33
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,506
Could it be the final game?

34
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,007
How do you play it?

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,300
It's similar to Gomoku.

36
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,177
But you only need three in a row.

37
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,222
And you can also stack your pieces

38
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,682
up to three at a time.

39
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,893
You can also move them.

40
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,311
That's what you do.

41
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,813
-It's a strategy game.
-Yeah.

42
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,689
You can't place more than three,

43
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,192
so the other player
can't block your pieces.

44
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,151
That's right.

45
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,154
So as soon as someone places pieces,
you can take them.

46
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,824
You could. Right, it's similar to Gomoku.

47
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,075
-That's how it is.
-Okay.

48
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,285
Then the other player
can't move until I move mine.

49
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,662
-That's right.
-Is that it?

50
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,789
You can't move
if someone's piece is on yours.

51
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,084
You can move your piece
one space in any direction.

52
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,293
-Only one space.
-Okay.

53
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,545
Yeah.

54
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,421
Did we eat dinner?

55
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,090
-I'm so hungry.
-Me too.

56
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,551
Should we have some <i>ramyeon</i>
before our semifinals?

57
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,303
Down for a noodles party?
Maybe <i>tteokbokki</i>?

58
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,555
Let's make both.

59
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,103
I got goosebumps.

60
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,481
No way.

61
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,275
What is this?

62
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,193
What is this?

63
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,779
Is that a flashlight?

64
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,614
Turn it on.

65
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,995
Why is it so deep? Can we even go inside?

66
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,207
There was a secret space here?

67
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,667
-What?
-There we go.

68
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,879
-Amazing.
-This is crazy.

69
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,047
What is this?

70
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,426
It's so deep.

71
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,011
Let's go down.

72
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,890
Watch your head.

73
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,351
Oh, my goodness.

74
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,270
I wonder what's at the end of this.

75
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,271
Treasure?

76
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,856
Hopefully a hundred Pieces.

77
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,651
Or a way for me to eliminate someone.

78
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,153
-Who?
-All of them.

79
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,533
It's pretty spacious.

80
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,080
-This is crazy.
-There's another room.

81
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,417
"Playing one game in this chamber

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,836
will give you an opportunity
to change your fate."

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,298
"If by the grace of the gods
you miraculously succeed,

84
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,342
your downtrodden fate

85
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,345
will blossom into radiant glory."

86
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,722
"However, if you lose this game,

87
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,142
your journey will end here

88
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,894
and your name will disappear."

89
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,690
"Only one person per day
will be allowed in this chamber."

90
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,944
"If you are prepared to face death,
knock on the door."

91
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,864
So you play a game inside.

92
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,408
And we could also die here.

93
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,701
{\an8}To summarize,

94
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,455
{\an8}it was basically telling us
to put our lives on the line.

95
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:11,459
Why is only one person
allowed inside per day though?

96
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,378
So two people can't go together.

97
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,838
Wait, Seok-jin.

98
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,173
It's one per day.

99
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,217
So if one goes today,
another can go tomorrow.

100
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,385
-Tomorrow morning?
-Yeah.

101
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,220
Today and tomorrow.

102
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,514
It's one person per 24 hours.

103
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,558
We can do that.
Why didn't I think of that earlier?

104
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,602
-I'm smart, aren't I?
-Good job.

105
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,813
Ultimately, we both can go.

106
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,316
Seok-jin, I'm prone to making mistakes.

107
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,693
-And I'm clumsy, right?
-Yeah.

108
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:41,030
So I'll miss things
that could easily be missed.

109
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,617
If I tell you about them,
your chances of winning can increase.

110
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,120
My heart is pounding like crazy right now.

111
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,790
-What would be better?
-We figured out the code

112
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,709
and now we're given another grand mission.

113
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,919
We need to put our lives on the line.

114
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,754
We wouldn't have had a shot at it
if it wasn't today.

115
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,716
-Today was our last chance.
-Right. There's no more prison after this.

116
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,011
What if we both get eliminated?

117
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,138
It'll be all right because we would be

118
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,181
dying as brave pioneers.

119
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,142
-Right.
-It'll be a meaningful death.

120
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,144
Let's leave a note.

121
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,770
-Let's leave a will.
-Yeah.

122
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,986
"Live gloriously, or die."

123
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,114
That's been our principle this whole time.

124
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,699
What are you writing?

125
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,576
"To everyone who passed through this cell,

126
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,369
we have found the key."

127
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,414
"Next year, 2024."

128
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,085
-Let's go.
-We're prepared, aren't we?

129
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,463
-I'm taking it easy.
-Sounds good.

130
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,505
Let's go.

131
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,385
If I die,

132
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,849
do whatever it takes to win for me.

133
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,976
-You'll survive.
-If I survive,

134
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,686
make sure you survive as well.

135
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,937
-Got it?
-Okay.

136
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,821
Are you ready to face death?

137
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,239
Yes, I am.

138
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,366
Good luck.

139
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,246
-You can die with no regrets.
-That's true.

140
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,331
You can be proud.

141
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,457
I'm going.

142
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,042
Bye, Seok-jin.

143
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,085
Good luck.

144
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,170
Let's meet again in good spirits.

145
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,262
-My goodness!
-That startled me.

146
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,932
Is it a person?

147
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,688
What is it?

148
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,816
There's someone back there.

149
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,447
What's that?

150
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,074
Can only one person go in?

151
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,451
I guess not.

152
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,577
Can we both go in?

153
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,459
Hold on a minute. What's going on?

154
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,294
-What is that?
-Is this a real person?

155
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,254
Is that Gomoku?

156
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,381
There are colored stones.

157
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,427
They were standing so still.

158
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,304
I got so scared.

159
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,348
Good luck.

160
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,483
<i>Welcome.</i>

161
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,069
<i>This is the Secret Chamber.</i>

162
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,241
<i>You may not leave this chamber
until the game is finished.</i>

163
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,951
Okay.

164
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,828
<i>If you win the game,</i>

165
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,915
<i>you will earn ten Pieces
and return to the game area tomorrow.</i>

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,502
<i>However, if you lose the game,</i>

167
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,130
<i>you will lose all of your Pieces</i>

168
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,132
<i>and get eliminated immediately.</i>

169
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,802
<i>Breaking the rules or using tricks</i>

170
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,429
<i>will also lead to elimination.</i>

171
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,184
<i>The game that will determine your fate</i>

172
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,685
<i>is Blind Gomoku.</i>

173
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,024
<i>In this game,
you must remember the placement</i>

174
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,901
<i>of your and your opponent's stones.</i>

175
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,322
<i>The stones are black and white,</i>

176
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,533
<i>but the top and sides
are covered in different colors.</i>

177
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,660
<i>Whether they are black or white</i>

178
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,330
<i>can only be differentiated by the bottom.</i>

179
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,752
<i>In other words,
the player must play the game</i>

180
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,588
<i>while disregarding
the color of the stones on the top,</i>

181
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,175
<i>and remembering
the stones' colors on the bottom.</i>

182
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,762
<i>You will play as Black.</i>

183
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,098
<i>You may use winning strategies</i>

184
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,226
<i>such as three and three or connect six.</i>

185
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,021
<i>The game begins now.</i>

186
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,856
Hello.

187
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,276
<i>There are two games I rarely lose.</i>

188
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,737
They are Gomoku and arm wrestling.

189
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,246
My memory

190
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,748
isn't that good.

191
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:05,670
{\an8}THE NPC'S MOVES WERE MADE
BY A GOMOKU GAME AI

192
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,217
<i>I wanted to use the same colors
as much as possible,</i>

193
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,219
<i>so I separated them.</i>

194
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,204
This is confusing.

195
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,778
<i>When playing Gomoku,
I like using different strategies.</i>

196
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,738
I like setting up traps

197
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,324
and playing defensively,
striking at the right time.

198
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,159
That's my style of play.

199
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,918
Wait.

200
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,586
Wait.

201
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,205
Did you place it here?

202
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,374
You did, right?

203
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,710
Whose stone is this?

204
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,171
{\an8}Whose is this?

205
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,089
{\an8}Is it mine?

206
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,156
The virus game was so long ago.

207
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,825
It feels like it happened years ago.

208
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,827
That's an exaggeration.

209
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,205
-Don't you think so?
-It does feel like a long time ago.

210
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,498
I liked Dong-jae

211
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,168
because he cared so much
about entertainment the way I do.

212
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,211
-Well...
-What's going on?

213
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,378
Hello.

214
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,466
-What?
-What's going on?

215
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,051
-A special event?
-Something's happening.

216
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,552
-What's happening?
-The lights are off.

217
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,221
What time is it?

218
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,139
-What?
-What?

219
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,307
-Why?
-Why?

220
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,433
-What?
-What's going on?

221
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,643
-What?
-What?

222
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,311
-This can't be.
-What?

223
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,771
-This can't be.
-What is this?

224
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,314
-Suddenly?
-I got goosebumps.

225
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,524
What's happening?

226
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,526
ELIMINATED PLAYER
LEE SEE-WON

227
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:58,921
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

228
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,223
So this stone wasn't mine.

229
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,685
<i>Towards the end,
I didn't know which stones were mine.</i>

230
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,895
But when my opponent played their turn,

231
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,188
<i>I instantly knew
which stones weren't mine.</i>

232
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,607
<i>I realized I had lost.</i>

233
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,499
<i>You have lost.</i>

234
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,213
<i>See-won, please leave</i> The Devil's Plan.

235
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,967
Good game.

236
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,559
<i>What an experience.</i>

237
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,313
These were the most
intense five days of my life.

238
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,481
Do I leave like this?

239
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,693
No way. I don't get to say goodbye?

240
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,782
<i>The Devil's Plan</i>?

241
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,411
<i>The show taught me about life.</i>

242
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,788
<i>It taught me about myself.</i>

243
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:20,419
<i>And it also taught me about
the complicated nature of human beings.</i>

244
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,421
I stuck to my principles

245
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,173
and had a great time.

246
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,176
<i>This was a valuable experience
and I think I played well.</i>

247
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,771
Wait a moment.

248
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,564
-What's going on?
-I got goosebumps.

249
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,650
I'm going to tear up. I'm shocked.

250
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,360
-What's going on?
-What happened?

251
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,987
-I'm so upset.
-Wait.

252
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,781
How did she get eliminated in prison?

253
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,991
My stomach is getting upset.

254
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,952
I feel sick in the stomach.

255
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,788
-I wondered why the staff came in.
-I'm so shocked.

256
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,041
Is See-won not coming back?

257
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,502
-I guess not.
-Excuse me.

258
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,505
-Is See-won not coming back?
-Is she gone?

259
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,631
What's going on?

260
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,345
Let us say goodbye to her.

261
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,515
What did she do?

262
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,599
What's going on?

263
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,978
Let us say goodbye to her.

264
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,732
-What is this?
-What's happening?

265
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,943
They can't just let her go like this.

266
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,152
What's going on?

267
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,862
Seok-jin, how did this happen?

268
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:48,048
<i>The friend who acted
as my guide had to go.</i>

269
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,014
{\an8}Thinking back,
maybe I should've gone first.

270
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,974
<i>I keep regretting that.</i>

271
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,025
I didn't think you could
get eliminated in prison.

272
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,277
This is shocking because to us,

273
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,362
-prison was a tough but safe place.
-Exactly.

274
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,072
You're not supposed to
get eliminated in prison.

275
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,866
-But she did.
-But that false sense of safety

276
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,909
is part of <i>The Devil's Plan</i>.

277
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,120
-They gave us false hope.
-Prison is a place of punishment.

278
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,330
But we kept thinking of it
as a place of hope.

279
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,708
Something happened in prison.

280
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,793
Maybe Seok-jin did something

281
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,754
to get See-won eliminated.

282
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,840
Or maybe See-won attempted to do something

283
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,301
-and failed on her own.
-That's possible.

284
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,510
I think

285
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,055
both of them were given a chance

286
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,098
to play a game but not against each other.

287
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,558
If they did, that would be brutal.

288
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,144
It might've been a cooperative game.

289
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,854
Maybe Seok-jin won alone

290
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,648
-and she had to go home.
-She had two Pieces though, not one.

291
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,026
-This really shakes you up.
-How could this happen?

292
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,781
I never imagined
someone would get eliminated in prison.

293
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,493
-I'm not sure if I can say this.
-Yeah?

294
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,787
Just tell me. What is it?

295
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,915
I don't think I should say this.

296
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,208
What can't you say?

297
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,336
Well...

298
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,379
Tell us what you did
with See-won last night.

299
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,007
See-won seemed to know something.

300
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,967
-So we talked.
-Yesterday?

301
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,137
-In prison?
-Yeah, we were talking.

302
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,931
I showed her the safe.

303
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,015
<i>Right.</i>

304
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,019
<i>And she got so excited.</i>

305
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,271
-"This is it."
-She was like, "This is it."

306
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,483
She had found something
in the living area.

307
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,984
So...

308
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,736
-And?
-See-won found something?

309
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,863
See-won shared it with Seok-jin.

310
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,073
I think they found a code.

311
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,617
I don't know the specifics.

312
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,035
But they didn't find the code.

313
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,286
If she had,

314
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,205
-she would've tried it right away.
-Right.

315
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,706
-But...
-But she came back out.

316
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,292
She said she needed
one more Piece to figure it out.

317
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,130
I got it. Yesterday,
I thought Seok-jin might be down

318
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,091
and struggling emotionally.

319
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,177
<i>So I visited his room
but he got really startled.</i>

320
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,846
-Seok-jin completed it.
-Right.

321
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,473
Seok-jin and See-won figured it out.

322
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,934
She said they did it together.

323
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,979
Seok-jin had no choice
but to eliminate Yeon-woo.

324
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,314
He had to go to prison with See-won.

325
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,316
They figured they could solve it together.

326
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,484
-Right.
-Exactly.

327
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,112
So one, two, and three.

328
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,239
We need to use these three Pieces.

329
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,365
This is crazy.

330
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,075
They had the Pieces.

331
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,869
-I got it.
-How?

332
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,786
I assembled it.

333
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,247
This should show us numbers.

334
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,416
There's something about the grooves here.

335
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,084
The fact that they
figured this out is crazy.

336
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,502
-It is.
-It's amazing.

337
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,129
I'm worried about Seok-jin.

338
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,089
-He's in prison alone.
-Me too.

339
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,383
Your cellmates all got eliminated.

340
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,428
-Don't say that.
-It's the curse of Seungkwan.

341
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,015
-My goodness.
-Wait!

342
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,475
-My goodness.
-Wait!

343
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,477
-Don't do this.
-It's lights out.

344
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,812
That startled me.

345
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,230
That scared me.

346
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,648
Stop doing this to us.

347
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,192
My heart can't take this.

348
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,499
I had a look from behind.

349
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,752
I saw what awaited her.

350
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,836
Is that Gomoku?

351
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,546
There are colored stones.

352
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,340
It seemed like
it would be played from memory

353
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,758
without being able to
differentiate the stones.

354
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,552
<i>I had to make a plan.</i>

355
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,764
<i>I took the three sheets of paper
I brought with me</i>

356
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,099
<i>and made a grid</i>

357
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,227
<i>to play some games on my own.</i>

358
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,235
Make sure you all
get a good night's sleep.

359
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,028
I'm off to bed first.

360
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,488
-Good luck tomorrow.
-Good night.

361
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,697
-Good night.
-Good night.

362
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,037
Good night.

363
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,413
-Good night.
-Good night.

364
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,167
I can't imagine
what Seok-jin is going through.

365
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,919
He's probably in shock.

366
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,630
-He'll come out of this stronger.
-That's right.

367
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,006
Guillaume is gone.

368
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,716
Dong-jae is gone.

369
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,552
Now, See-won is gone too.

370
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,845
He's alone now.

371
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,431
The members of his alliance
somehow all ended up this way.

372
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,850
Who would've imagined
things would turn out this way?

373
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,731
<i>I'm going to do my best.</i>

374
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,609
But I'm only average at Gomoku

375
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,569
<i>and the colors can't be differentiated.</i>

376
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,446
<i>If I need to use my memory,</i>

377
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,992
there's nothing I can do
but face it head-on.

378
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,760
Darn it.

379
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,933
Let's sleep.

380
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,989
<i>I slept for one or two hours.</i>

381
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,576
I couldn't fall asleep
knowing the game that awaited me.

382
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,912
<i>If I had no idea
whether See-won succeeded or not,</i>

383
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,415
I could've slept somewhat better.

384
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,958
<i>Knowing she lost</i>

385
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,378
<i>and knowing what game
caused her to get eliminated</i>

386
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,088
scared me out of sleep.

387
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,269
What time is it right now?

388
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,272
It's 6:40 a.m.

389
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,484
You should get some more sleep.

390
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,152
I have a lot on my mind.

391
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,279
So I can't sleep.

392
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,489
You can't?

393
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,700
I'm thinking if I should

394
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,328
just play against ORBIT

395
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,289
whether I win or not.

396
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,375
You do seem to have a lot on your mind.

397
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,796
{\an8}ROOM 201

398
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,292
My heart is heavy,
but the past is in the past.

399
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,793
I have to focus on myself.

400
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,838
<i>Until now, I played
without a particular plan.</i>

401
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,090
<i>I assumed things
would work out on their own</i>

402
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,051
<i>while I tried my best to play clean.</i>

403
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,137
But I'm going to play dirty this time.

404
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,930
Let's do this.

405
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,903
Here I go.

406
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,781
My goodness.

407
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,582
I told you.

408
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,169
I want you to be the first female winner.

409
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,837
Help me make that happen.

410
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,172
Let's do our best.

411
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,716
-Let's have fun.
-I want to give it a go.

412
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,926
-Really?
-Yeah.

413
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,514
{\an8}I want to face ORBIT
in the finals and beat him.

414
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,015
{\an8}That's my dream.

415
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,475
What's your plan?

416
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,685
I don't know.

417
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,938
I don't know what I should do.

418
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,773
Should I make alliances until the end?

419
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,109
-I know what you mean.
-That's all I've done.

420
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,860
{\an8}I have made a lot of mistakes.

421
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,988
{\an8}Looking back, there were so many moments

422
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,615
{\an8}when I should have done
just one thing differently.

423
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,118
There was always something lacking.

424
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,995
Today, I'm going all the way

425
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,664
to test myself
to see if I can get to the finals.

426
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,375
Even if the game
makes an alliance necessary,

427
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,085
I'm not teaming up with Dong-joo or ORBIT.

428
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,378
-Really?
-Yeah.

429
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,337
Why not?

430
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,589
I need to beat one of them
to make the finals.

431
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,801
I think it's pointless
for me to make the semi-finals

432
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,304
by teaming up with them.

433
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,097
If I lose, I lose.

434
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,640
If I win, that's good.

435
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,934
-I should play for myself.
-Yeah.

436
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,853
It's our last opportunity.

437
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,022
And it'll be every man for himself
in the last game.

438
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,982
I really want to play like that.

439
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,654
<i>Welcome.</i>

440
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,365
<i>This is the Secret Chamber.</i>

441
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:02,912
<i>You may not leave this room
until the game is finished.</i>

442
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,125
<i>Hand over all of your Pieces.</i>

443
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,507
<i>If you win the game,</i>

444
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,428
<i>you will earn ten Pieces
and return to the game area.</i>

445
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,474
<i>However, if you lose the game,</i>

446
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,642
<i>you will lose all of your Pieces</i>

447
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,269
<i>and get eliminated immediately.</i>

448
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,897
<i>You will play as Black.</i>

449
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,565
I go first then.

450
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:44,204
{\an8}THE NPC'S MOVES WERE MADE
BY A GOMOKU GAME AI

451
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,955
Why place the same color?

452
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,848
<i>I placed a yellow stone for my fourth play</i>

453
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,934
<i>so I could tell
which stone I attacked with.</i>

454
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,895
And I assumed they would
also place a yellow stone,

455
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,397
<i>and they did exactly that.</i>

456
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,661
Darn it.

457
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,549
Wait a minute.

458
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,384
What in the world...

459
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,272
I think it's this one.

460
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,538
<i>You have won.</i>

461
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,922
<i>I started simply
by creating two lines of four.</i>

462
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,675
Then I realized the opponent's play
was a bit too simple.

463
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,926
<i>So I left a gap in a row.</i>

464
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,511
<i>I knew the three were mine.</i>

465
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,971
<i>And when I made a line of four,
they didn't block me</i>

466
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,597
<i>and made a line of four
for themselves.</i>

467
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,643
I knew I couldn't have
made a mistake and placed a stone.

468
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,355
<i>You have won.</i>

469
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,986
<i>You will be given ten Pieces as a reward.</i>

470
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,571
Oh, fuck!

471
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,993
<i>Please return to your cell.</i>

472
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,676
<i>As soon as they said I won,</i>

473
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,137
I thought of See-won leaving yesterday.

474
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,061
No way. I don't get to say goodbye?

475
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,777
You suck at this game.

476
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,911
Good luck.

477
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,749
-You can die with no regrets.
-That's true.

478
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,833
You can be proud.

479
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,294
I'm going.

480
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,546
<i>It felt like I avenged her.</i>

481
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,839
It did.

482
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,763
It really did.

483
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,348
Let's do it this way.

484
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,808
If we need to eliminate someone
from the get-go,

485
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,101
it should be Seok-jin.

486
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,979
-I agree.
-That's hilarious.

487
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:20,939
Seok-jin?

488
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,482
We all agree deep inside, don't we?

489
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,776
-But the Pieces...
-Seungkwan has changed.

490
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,319
-He's our...
-We need to take him down.

491
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,781
He's our biggest rival
in terms of the number of Pieces.

492
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,449
Please come out.

493
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,534
I solved this.

494
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,786
As your reward, here is a Piece.

495
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,870
Thank you.

496
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,584
<i>The main match will begin soon.</i>

497
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,337
<i>Please gather in the game area.</i>

498
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,798
-Let's have a good game.
-We got this.

499
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,132
-We got this.
-We got this.

500
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,135
That was a tough night.

501
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,179
It's open.

502
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,889
It's poker!

503
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,974
-Amazing.
-No way.

504
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,934
-No, please.
-No way.

505
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,769
-I don't know how to play this.
-It's a card game.

506
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,772
-I don't know how to play poker.
-Me neither.

507
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,940
They're number cards.

508
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,401
-It's math, darn it.
-Goodbye then.

509
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,444
It was nice knowing you all.

510
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,530
-What?
-Seok-jin. What happened?

511
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,615
-What happened?
-Tell us.

512
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,660
We saw that See-won
suddenly got eliminated last night.

513
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,829
-We couldn't even say goodbye.
-We had a meltdown.

514
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,205
-You look like you cried.
-Tell us what happened.

515
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,540
What happened?

516
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,000
It was a long night.

517
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,543
-Tell us.
-Seok-jin.

518
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,044
It's a long story.

519
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,462
Just tell us.

520
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,964
Was there a game?

521
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:32,051
-Was there a battle?
-Tell us when you're ready.

522
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,302
Did you play against See-won?

523
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,722
No, See-won played the game first.

524
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,558
And she got eliminated because she failed?

525
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,226
Only one person could play per day.

526
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,646
-What was the reward?
-So you didn't get to play the game?

527
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,815
-I played this morning.
-Did you win?

528
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,816
I won.

529
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,902
-It was so emotionally draining.
-Only one per day?

530
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,739
-Being there alone was...
-<i>Greetings.</i>

531
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,367
<i>The sixth main match
of</i> The Devil's Plan <i>begins now.</i>

532
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,871
<i>Yeon-woo and See-won
got eliminated yesterday,</i>

533
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,540
<i>leaving seven surviving players.</i>

534
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,126
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

535
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,004
<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

536
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,090
{\an8}HA SEOK-JIN: 13 PIECES

537
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,925
Thirteen?!

538
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,385
That's amazing.

539
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,678
So he won 11 Pieces.

540
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,513
You're amazing, Seok-jin.

541
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,017
{\an8}KWAK JOON-BIN & PARK KYEONG-RIM: 4 PIECES
SEUNGKWAN: 3 PIECES

542
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,146
{\an8}We were able to add 100 million won
to the final prize by working together.

543
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,648
{\an8}<i>And I wanted to share the joy.</i>

544
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,486
<i>Now, here is the sixth main match.</i>

545
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,739
<i>Today's main match is Equation Hi-Lo.</i>

546
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,698
Hi-Lo.

547
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,908
<i>In Equation Hi-Lo,</i>

548
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,368
<i>players must use
the number and symbol cards</i>

549
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,371
<i>to formulate an equation that leads
to a value close to one or twenty</i>

550
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:47,627
<i>and make a bet on high or low
based on the results of the equations.</i>

551
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:52,173
<i>Players will exchange
their Pieces for chips</i>

552
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,508
<i>to play the game.</i>

553
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,803
<i>Each Piece is worth five chips</i>

554
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,931
<i>and players must exchange
all of their Pieces.</i>

555
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,644
{\an8}<i>Each player will receive
one set of symbol cards,</i>

556
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:10,066
<i>which includes an addition,
subtraction, and division card.</i>

557
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,611
<i>The number cards range from zero to ten</i>

558
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,322
<i>and players will receive
four sets of cards</i>

559
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,574
<i>made up of gold,
silver, bronze, and black cards</i>

560
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,701
<i>for a total of 44 cards.</i>

561
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,997
<i>The gold card has the highest value,</i>

562
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,459
<i>followed by the silver,
bronze, and black cards.</i>

563
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,628
<i>In addition to the number cards,</i>

564
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,548
<i>four square root and multiplication cards
will also be used.</i>

565
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,715
<i>When the game begins,</i>

566
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,803
<i>all players must bet one chip
as an ante bet.</i>

567
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,221
<i>Once the ante bet is made,</i>

568
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,474
<i>the dealer will shuffle 52 cards</i>

569
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,394
<i>and distribute the first card</i>

570
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,895
<i>to each player face down.</i>

571
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:53,151
<i>The first card is a hidden card
that will not be shown to other players.</i>

572
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:57,655
{\an8}<i>If a player's hidden card
is a square root or multiplication card,</i>

573
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,031
{\an8}<i>they must return it</i>

574
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,534
{\an8}<i>and receive cards
until they get a number card.</i>

575
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,912
<i>Once the hidden cards are dealt,</i>

576
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,208
<i>the dealer will pass out
two cards to each player.</i>

577
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,753
<i>These are open cards
that will be shown to other players.</i>

578
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,048
<i>If a player receives
a square root for their open card,</i>

579
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,968
<i>they will receive
an additional number card.</i>

580
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,888
<i>If a player receives multiplication
for their open card,</i>

581
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:26,559
<i>they must discard one of their addition,
subtraction, or multiplication cards</i>

582
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,061
<i>and receive one additional number card.</i>

583
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,356
<i>Division cards may not be discarded.</i>

584
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,403
<i>If a player receives a square root
or multiplication for their open card</i>

585
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,240
<i>and receives another symbol card,
that symbol card must be discarded</i>

586
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,743
<i>and they will receive cards
until they get a number card.</i>

587
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,330
<i>Once each player receives two open cards,</i>

588
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,998
<i>the first bet will begin.</i>

589
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,919
<i>During their turn,
a player may take three actions.</i>

590
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,213
<i>First,</i>

591
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,466
<i>they can bet the same amount of chips
as the previous player.</i>

592
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,301
<i>Second,</i>

593
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,721
<i>they can bet more chips
than the previous player.</i>

594
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:09,101
<i>Betting will continue until all players
have bet the same amount of chips.</i>

595
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,103
<i>Third, folding.</i>

596
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,899
<i>A player who folds
is excluded from that round.</i>

597
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,026
<i>In addition,</i>

598
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,696
<i>the first player doesn't have to
place a bet and may pass their turn.</i>

599
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,032
<i>The next players may also pass their turn</i>

600
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:28,829
<i>only if no one has opened the round
by placing a bet.</i>

601
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,164
This is like poker.

602
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,290
I think so.

603
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,542
<i>The maximum bet cannot exceed</i>

604
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,630
<i>the chip count of the player
with the least chips.</i>

605
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,384
<i>After the first round of betting,</i>

606
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,303
<i>each player will receive
one new open card.</i>

607
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,764
<i>Once the open cards are given,</i>

608
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,518
<i>players must use
all of their number and symbol cards</i>

609
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,938
<i>to create an equation that leads to
a value close to either one or twenty.</i>

610
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:59,193
<i>The square root card
may only be used on one number.</i>

611
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,988
<i>Once the equations are made,</i>

612
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,740
<i>the final bet will be made
starting with the first player.</i>

613
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,868
<i>The rules remain the same
as the first round of betting.</i>

614
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,037
<i>After making the final bets,</i>

615
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:14,417
<i>players must decide
to bet on either high or low</i>

616
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,460
<i>and hold the betting marker
in their hands.</i>

617
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:21,173
<i>All choices will be revealed
at the end along with the hidden cards.</i>

618
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,134
<i>High betting.</i>

619
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,928
<i>If a player wants to bet on "high,"</i>

620
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,889
<i>in which those with final value
closest to 20 wins,</i>

621
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,433
<i>they must choose the marker labeled 20.</i>

622
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,393
<i>Low betting.</i>

623
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,187
<i>If a player wants to bet on "low,"</i>

624
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,690
<i>in which those with final value
closest to one wins,</i>

625
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,525
<i>they must choose the marker labeled one.</i>

626
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,860
<i>Swing betting.</i>

627
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,196
<i>If a player wants to bet
on both high and low,</i>

628
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,032
<i>they may choose to place a swing bet.</i>

629
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,491
<i>If they do,</i>

630
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,077
<i>the player must rearrange their cards</i>

631
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,788
<i>and show two equations to the dealer.</i>

632
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,292
<i>They must then choose both markers.</i>

633
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,045
This game is advantageous
for those who are good at math.

634
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,047
<i>Once all players are finished,</i>

635
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,591
<i>all equations
and betting markers will be revealed</i>

636
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,178
<i>and players with the same choices
will go against each other.</i>

637
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,139
<i>Based on the results of that,</i>

638
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,392
<i>the player with a result
closest to 20 who bet on high</i>

639
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,436
<i>and the player with a result</i>

640
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,481
<i>closest to one who bet on low</i>

641
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,442
<i>will each receive half of the pot.</i>

642
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,571
<i>If the chips add up to an odd number,
the remaining chip will be discarded.</i>

643
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,824
<i>If there are ties,</i>

644
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,952
<i>the player with the highest number card
among those who bet high</i>

645
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,581
<i>and the player with the lowest number card
among those who bet low</i>

646
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,999
<i>will be the final winner.</i>

647
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,755
<i>If two players are tied again
with the same highest number card,</i>

648
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,132
{\an8}<i>the player with the
higher value card will win</i>

649
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,010
{\an8}<i>based on the order
of gold, silver, bronze, and black.</i>

650
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,889
So you could lose even if you make a 20.

651
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,684
<i>If two players are tied again
with the same lowest number card,</i>

652
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,063
{\an8}<i>the player with the
lower value card will win.</i>

653
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,358
<i>Players who bet on swing</i>

654
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,985
<i>will first show one completed equation.</i>

655
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,947
<i>Then they will rearrange it
to show their other equation.</i>

656
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,783
<i>Their equations must win</i>

657
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,702
<i>both the high and low bets.</i>

658
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,415
<i>If one of their equations fails to win,</i>

659
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,458
<i>the player's swing bet will fail.</i>

660
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,545
<i>The game will continue
until three players remain.</i>

661
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,963
Only three?

662
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,714
<i>Players who run out of chips</i>

663
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,467
<i>will be considered to have
no remaining Pieces</i>

664
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,094
<i>and get eliminated.</i>

665
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,263
<i>When the game ends,</i>

666
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,724
<i>the chips will be exchanged for Pieces
and returned to the players.</i>

667
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,937
<i>Five chips will be exchanged
for one Piece.</i>

668
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,605
<i>The remaining chips will be discarded.</i>

669
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,151
<i>Players with less than four chips</i>

670
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,361
<i>will also be given one Piece.</i>

671
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:52,116
<i>To help you understand,
a practice round will be played.</i>

672
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,326
<i>Please sit at the table.</i>

673
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,164
<i>Kyeong-rim will start the practice round.</i>

674
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,542
<i>Chips will be distributed randomly.</i>

675
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,545
-First, please pay your ante.
-Okay.

676
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,882
-It feels like I'm at a casino.
-I know.

677
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,550
-I like this.
-I wanted to try this.

678
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,885
I'm the master of Hi-Lo.

679
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,386
-Really?
-Really?

680
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,804
I played it a lot online.

681
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,473
Here are your hidden cards.

682
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,977
You can see your own, right?

683
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,020
You have to look at it.

684
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,897
-Of course you can.
-You have to.

685
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,690
-I thought you played this a lot.
-Didn't you?

686
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,733
I did play it often.

687
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,404
Does the first bet start now?

688
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,948
How can we make
an equation with just one card?

689
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,201
{\an8}<i>The order of betting is as follows.</i>

690
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,077
{\an8}<i>The forced bet with no cards.</i>

691
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,623
{\an8}<i>The first bet after receiving three cards.</i>

692
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:44,001
{\an8}<i>Lastly, the final bet
after receiving another card.</i>

693
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,128
-You will each receive two open cards.
-Okay.

694
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,214
Eight.

695
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,131
Seven.

696
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,049
Six.

697
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:50,966
Zero.

698
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,926
Three.

699
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,010
Five.

700
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,136
Six.

701
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,971
-Here are your second open cards.
-Okay.

702
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,765
Four. Square root.

703
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,183
Here is another card.

704
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,143
Nine.

705
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,228
Square root.

706
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,188
One.

707
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,272
Zero.

708
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,441
You got two zeroes?

709
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,277
-Three.
-I got a pair of cards.

710
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,820
Seven. Nine.

711
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,490
You have each received two open cards.

712
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,283
{\an8}The first bet will begin now.

713
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,952
{\an8}Kyeong-rim, please place your bet.

714
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,330
{\an8}Everyone has to match my bet, right?

715
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,958
-they either have to match or raise.
-Right.

716
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,377
But she can't bet more than two, can she?

717
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,337
Right, I can only bet two.

718
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,255
Here.

719
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,216
-Kyeong-rim, you have bet two chips.
-All in.

720
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,760
Seok-jin and Yu-min,
you have bet two chips.

721
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,222
The first round of betting has ended.

722
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,932
Here are your open cards.

723
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,642
{\an8}-Nine.
-Nine?

724
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,394
{\an8}Nine. Seven.

725
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,271
{\an8}Eight. Eight.

726
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,981
Four. Five.

727
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,108
-This is tough.
-As no more bets can be placed,

728
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,193
we will now give you time
to write equations.

729
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:58,284
{\an8}PLAYERS HAVE 90 SECONDS
TO WRITE EQUATIONS AFTER THE FINAL BET

730
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,744
{\an8}Time is up.

731
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,829
{\an8}Already?

732
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,082
Please choose a betting marker
and place your hand on the table.

733
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,586
Once your hand is on the table,
you may not change markers.

734
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,130
Starting with ORBIT,
who made the last bet,

735
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,381
please reveal your markers.

736
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,800
{\an8}You have bet on low.

737
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,385
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

738
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,511
I'll do my best.

739
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,932
{\an8}-What does that make?
-Two point something.

740
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,143
He bet on low with that number?

741
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,060
{\an8}Next, Seungkwan.

742
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,520
{\an8}You have bet on low.

743
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,855
Please complete your equation.

744
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,233
{\an8}Seungkwan is doing well.

745
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,611
{\an8}-He is.
-Joon-bin, please reveal your marker.

746
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,362
You have bet on low.

747
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,072
Please complete your equation.

748
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,699
Why is everyone so competitive?

749
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,578
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

750
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,581
{\an8}Wouldn't you have a higher chance
if you switched five and seven?

751
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,832
That's what I did.

752
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,751
{\an8}I tried it both ways.

753
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,545
<i>Ten divided by eight
and eight divided by ten</i>

754
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,631
<i>may look similar at first glance,</i>

755
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,466
<i>but their results are different.</i>

756
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,803
<i>Eight divided by ten is closer to one.</i>

757
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,432
<i>Based on how a player places two cards,</i>

758
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:06,810
<i>a slight difference in decimal place
could determine whether they win or lose.</i>

759
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,395
They don't know this.

760
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,773
I'm going to remove my cards quickly
so others don't catch on it.

761
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,441
Or else I lose.

762
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,943
Joon-bin has won
the low bet in this round.

763
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,696
I thought it would be me.

764
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,698
-I should keep that in mind.
-Exactly.

765
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,785
<i>The game will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

766
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,830
We need to start by taking Seok-jin out.

767
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,876
We need to get rid of Seok-jin now.

768
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,295
<i>He has too many chips.</i>

769
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,339
Once we get rid of him,

770
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,384
we can play against each other.

771
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,427
This sounds so cruel, doesn't it?

772
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,681
Don't think too badly of me.
I just really want to win.

773
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,891
-Thank you, Kyeong-rim.
-For what?

774
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,768
-Oh, for that.
-If it weren't for you...

775
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,228
No worries, you have a chance.

776
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,063
<i>-She gave me a Piece.
-So do your best.</i>

777
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,272
<i>You didn't have a Piece?</i>

778
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,524
I only had three.

779
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,401
This is my game.

780
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,027
I just wish I had more Pieces.

781
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,946
That's how I felt.

782
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,783
-Joon-bin, can you help me?
-Okay. I'll help you.

783
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,078
I'm not really good at math.

784
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,248
So multiplication, division, and addition.

785
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,374
-Should we leave?
-What?

786
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,917
-Let's go to a different room.
-Okay.

787
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,170
-I had pretended to be bad at math.
-I know.

788
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,047
So I don't want others to see me help you.

789
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,508
It seems like that act
is working in your favor.

790
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,136
If I get a multiplication card,
one of these two will be discarded, right?

791
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,262
-Yeah.
-I discard one, right?

792
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,555
From what I gathered,

793
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,557
there's a higher chance
of getting low than high.

794
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,183
So keep the subtraction card.

795
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,810
I should discard the addition then.

796
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,813
{\an8}-Multiplication makes the number too big.
-You need the subtraction card.

797
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,106
{\an8}Otherwise, it gets difficult.

798
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,275
-So it's better to get rid of addition.
-Yeah.

799
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,860
But also take your numbers into account.

800
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:42,072
<i>Players generally bet on low
in the game of Equation Hi-Lo</i>

801
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,158
<i>because of the symbol cards.</i>

802
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,577
<i>Of the three symbol cards given,</i>

803
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,745
<i>two decrease numbers</i>

804
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,914
<i>and only one card increases numbers.</i>

805
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,207
<i>With no multiplication card...</i>

806
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,959
You have bet on low.

807
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,921
<i>...equations will more likely
result in numbers closer to one,</i>

808
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,924
<i>which is why low betting is preferred.</i>

809
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,345
I feel like it's easier than expected
to win the high bet.

810
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,806
So if you can
get a number higher than ten,

811
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,851
it would make sense to go for a high bet.

812
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,352
<i>Time has expired.</i>

813
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,481
<i>Equation Hi-Lo will now begin.</i>

814
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,733
The order will be determined now.

815
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,818
Please draw a number card.

816
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,695
Players will go in descending order.

817
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,700
<i>The order has been determined.</i>

818
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,786
Now, I will exchange
your Pieces for chips.

819
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,955
Thank you, Kyeong-rim.

820
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,207
No problem.

821
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,126
Seungkwan, you have three?

822
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,252
{\an8}Yeah.

823
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,254
{\an8}SEUNGKWAN: 15 CHIPS

824
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,049
{\an8}ORBIT, you receive 20 chips for 4 Pieces.

825
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,385
{\an8}Joon-bin, you receive 20 chips
for 4 Pieces.

826
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,303
{\an8}Thank you.

827
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,764
{\an8}Kyeong-rim, you receive 20 chips
for 4 Pieces.

828
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,015
{\an8}Thank you.

829
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,101
{\an8}Yu-min, you receive 30 chips for 6 Pieces.

830
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,478
{\an8}Thirty is a lot.

831
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,979
{\an8}It is.

832
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,273
{\an8}Seok-jin, you receive 65 chips

833
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,108
{\an8}for 13 Pieces.

834
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,237
{\an8}Take a look at Seok-jin's chips.

835
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,740
Why is he here?

836
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,242
He's the casino king.

837
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,495
The game will begin with the forced bet.

838
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,664
-Please pay your ante.
-It's going to be fun.

839
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,415
You wouldn't notice a change.

840
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,542
Exactly.

841
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,586
Hidden cards will be given
starting with Joon-bin.

842
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:21,797
It's beginning.

843
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,591
Joon-bin, roll up your sleeves.

844
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,718
I think you might steal something.

845
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,178
That's just strategy.

846
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,429
Here is your hidden card.

847
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,565
Here are your first open cards.

848
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,482
Five.

849
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:42,943
{\an8}Eight.

850
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,570
{\an8}Square root.

851
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,238
{\an8}Eight.

852
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,699
{\an8}Seven.

853
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,492
{\an8}-Ten.
-Thank you.

854
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,577
{\an8}Square root.

855
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:53,996
{\an8}Eight.

856
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,872
{\an8}Multiplication card.

857
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,292
{\an8}Please discard one symbol card
except for division.

858
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,711
{\an8}You have discarded addition.

859
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,670
{\an8}One.

860
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,589
{\an8}That's good.

861
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,382
{\an8}Here are your second open cards.

862
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,508
{\an8}Zero.

863
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,509
{\an8}Three.

864
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,510
{\an8}Zero.

865
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,974
I basically got a one.

866
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,519
{\an8}<i>ORBIT received a six for his hidden card.</i>

867
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,439
{\an8}<i>As he received seven
and zero for his open cards,</i>

868
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,942
{\an8}<i>he could assemble
his symbol cards in this way.</i>

869
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,320
<i>As long as his next card is not a zero,</i>

870
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,156
<i>he will be able to create
an equation resulting in one.</i>

871
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,741
I was so thrilled.

872
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,076
<i>It was a game fit for the sixth day.</i>

873
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,453
{\an8}-Multiplication card.
-Okay.

874
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,955
{\an8}You have discarded addition.

875
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,915
{\an8}-Five.
-Okay.

876
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,083
{\an8}Square root.

877
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,209
{\an8}Again?

878
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,669
{\an8}I hate square roots.

879
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,670
{\an8}Nine.

880
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,213
{\an8}Five.

881
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,549
{\an8}Your open cards are dealt.

882
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,260
{\an8}Starting with Joon-bin,
please place your first bets.

883
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,428
{\an8}I'll bet two.

884
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,679
{\an8}You have bet two.

885
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,847
{\an8}Dong-joo.

886
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,557
{\an8}It's the first round.

887
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,392
{\an8}-Here.
-You have bet two.

888
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,353
{\an8}You have bet two.

889
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,562
{\an8}ORBIT.

890
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,522
Kyeong-rim. Seok-jin.

891
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,732
Seungkwan, you have bet two.

892
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,651
All players have bet the same amount.

893
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,653
Here are your third open cards.

894
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:09,905
{\an8}Multiplication card.

895
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,074
{\an8}You have discarded addition.

896
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,325
{\an8}Four.

897
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:14,993
{\an8}Four.

898
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,161
{\an8}One.

899
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:20,832
{\an8}Seven.

900
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,627
I decided to go all in
if I got twenty or one.

901
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,128
{\an8}<i>And I got one.</i>

902
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,341
{\an8}-Five.
-Okay.

903
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,384
{\an8}One.

904
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,010
{\an8}Four.

905
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,762
{\an8}Your open cards are dealt.

906
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,764
Time will be given
to complete your equations.

907
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,614
<i>Seok-jin has almost
four times more chips than I do.</i>

908
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,408
{\an8}<i>And because of that,</i>

909
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,993
{\an8}<i>it makes sense to target him.</i>

910
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,838
Time is up.

911
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:11,299
Starting with Joon-bin,
please place your final bets.

912
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,384
Three.

913
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,177
-So I have to bet three or more.
-You have bet three.

914
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,430
-Dong-joo.
-Can I raise the bet?

915
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,889
Yes, you may.

916
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,893
{\an8}She's betting that many?

917
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,061
What is she doing?

918
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,566
Whatever, I'm just going to do it.

919
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,153
{\an8}You have bet seven more
for a total of ten.

920
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,363
Yu-min, please make your bet.

921
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,698
I'm going to fold.

922
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,866
Are you folding?

923
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,201
{\an8}Please flip over your number cards.

924
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,036
{\an8}ORBIT, please make your bet.

925
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,373
<i>I think Dong-joo had the same idea.</i>

926
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,168
<i>She was trying to go against Seok-jin.</i>

927
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,507
{\an8}-I'll bet ten.
-Ten?

928
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,343
My heart's going to explode.

929
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,261
You got this.

930
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,347
Kyeong-rim, you must match
or raise the bet.

931
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,641
-You bet ten?
-I had no choice.

932
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,976
I'm sorry, I raised the bet.

933
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,269
We need to match yours?

934
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,771
-You have to go for it.
-This is...

935
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,356
-There's no other way.
-Am I going home in the first round?

936
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,442
If you aren't confident, you can fold.

937
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,278
I'm confident when it comes to betting.

938
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,990
It's all basically just mind games.

939
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:19,951
<i>From what I saw,
many were going to bet on low.</i>

940
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,120
Seok-jin has two square root cards.

941
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,581
<i>I saw he had two square roots
and no multiplication.</i>

942
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,168
{\an8}<i>I realized I could
win the high bet alone if I was lucky.</i>

943
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,377
I'm going for it.

944
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,630
I didn't know
we were all big players here.

945
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,007
You're all so cool.
I'm the only one who folded.

946
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,759
{\an8}-Amazing.
-I'm betting ten.

947
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,802
{\an8}I'm just a spectator.

948
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,053
{\an8}You have bet ten.

949
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:38,970
{\an8}Next, Seok-jin.

950
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,139
{\an8}I'll match her bet.

951
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,390
Seok-jin has the means.

952
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,517
You have bet ten.

953
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,434
Next, Seungkwan.

954
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,061
Just give me ten seconds.

955
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,398
-Take your time. No pressure.
-All right.

956
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,900
Ten, nine...

957
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,277
-Seven.
-Just fold.

958
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,196
-You're horrible.
-It's just the first round.

959
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,697
<i>Am I going big?</i>

960
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,324
Will Seungkwan do it?

961
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,827
Should I show what I've got
in the semifinals?

962
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,954
-Let's do it.
-Really?

963
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,708
This is driving me crazy.

964
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,669
You coward.

965
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,046
Folding wouldn't make you a coward.

966
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,422
-She's right.
-Exactly.

967
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,424
-You could be the smart one.
-Do what you want.

968
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,176
-This isn't the only chance.
-Do as you wish.

969
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,804
I'm folding.

970
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,305
Seungkwan, you have folded.

971
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,140
Please flip over your number cards.

972
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,017
<i>My lack of chips was a big factor.</i>

973
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,603
<i>I wasn't sure if I could
afford to bet so much.</i>

974
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,729
I'm folding.

975
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,648
Betting has finished.

976
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:35,068
Please choose a betting marker
and place your hand on the table.

977
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:39,114
Seok-jin, who made the last bet,
will reveal first.

978
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,657
Please reveal your marker.

979
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,785
{\an8}You have bet on high.

980
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,037
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

981
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,964
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

982
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,008
You can do square root of one.

983
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,510
{\an8}Kyeong-rim, please reveal your marker.

984
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,845
{\an8}You have bet on high.

985
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,638
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

986
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,392
{\an8}This is nerve-racking.

987
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,645
{\an8}Oh, nice.

988
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,361
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes, I am.

989
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,655
ORBIT, please reveal your marker.

990
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,408
{\an8}You have bet on low.

991
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,246
{\an8}He got exactly one.

992
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,208
Dong-joo, please reveal your marker.

993
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,503
{\an8}You have bet on low.

994
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,880
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

995
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,007
{\an8}There's no way.

996
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,301
{\an8}-There's no way.
-ORBIT made a clean one.

997
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,095
{\an8}Wait.

998
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,183
{\an8}Darn it.

999
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,935
{\an8}You might have to compare card values.

1000
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,354
{\an8}-We'll have to.
-What happens now?

1001
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,689
{\an8}ORBIT, I'm sorry but I won.

1002
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,825
{\an8}ORBIT, I'm sorry.

1003
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,243
{\an8}It's all right.

1004
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,329
I feel for ORBIT though.

1005
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,455
How can you lose with a one?

1006
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,665
Right.

1007
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,833
{\an8}The winner of this round's high bet

1008
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,210
{\an8}is Seok-jin.

1009
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,591
{\an8}The winner of the low bet is Dong-joo.

1010
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,344
{\an8}A total of 64 chips were bet.

1011
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,221
You each receive 32 chips.

1012
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,975
-We will move on to the next round.
-Okay.

1013
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,143
Please place the betting markers
in your pouches.

1014
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,104
ORBIT & PARK KYEONG-RIM: 7 CHIPS

1015
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,981
-Please pay your ante.
-I'm nervous.

1016
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,816
{\an8}Dong-joo will start this round.

1017
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,651
-Here are your hidden cards.
-Okay.

1018
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,070
Your hidden cards are dealt.

1019
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,155
{\an8}Here are your open cards.

1020
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,573
{\an8}Zeroes are scary.

1021
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,658
{\an8}Zero.

1022
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,659
{\an8}Ten.

1023
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,954
{\an8}-Multiplication.
-I could make use of that.

1024
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:53,873
{\an8}Six.

1025
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,500
{\an8}Eight.

1026
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,293
{\an8}Four.

1027
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,546
{\an8}Your open cards are dealt.

1028
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,339
The first round of betting begins now.

1029
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,633
{\an8}-Dong-joo.
-I'll go small.

1030
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,926
{\an8}You have bet two.

1031
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,511
{\an8}Is two small to you?

1032
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,554
{\an8}Yu-min.

1033
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,722
{\an8}You have bet two.

1034
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,889
I'm folding.

1035
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,141
I'll also fold.

1036
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,308
Same here.

1037
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,685
{\an8}I'm betting two.

1038
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,437
{\an8}All players have bet the same amount.

1039
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,939
{\an8}Here are your third open cards.

1040
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,607
{\an8}Eight.

1041
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,067
{\an8}Square root.

1042
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,861
{\an8}-You keep getting square roots.
-One.

1043
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,612
{\an8}Multiplication.

1044
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,573
{\an8}You have discarded subtraction.

1045
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,949
{\an8}-Six.
-Darn it.

1046
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,368
{\an8}Your third open cards are dealt.

1047
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,037
{\an8}I can't do the math right now

1048
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,329
{\an8}because of the square root.

1049
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,290
{\an8}This won't work.

1050
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,377
{\an8}Time is up.

1051
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,880
Starting with Dong-joo,
please make your final bets.

1052
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,799
You have bet one.

1053
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,384
Can I bet one more?

1054
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,427
You can.

1055
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:52,891
I can't.

1056
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,392
-You can't?
-I'll match if you bet one.

1057
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,810
What about you, Yu-min?

1058
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,270
It's fine with me.

1059
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,772
It was scary how you said that.

1060
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,523
Dong-joo, bet however you want.

1061
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,567
Dong-joo, you have bet two.

1062
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,902
Next, Yu-min.

1063
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,404
I'm betting ten.

1064
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,531
She's going for it.

1065
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,034
You have bet two and eight more.

1066
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,827
Seok-jin.

1067
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,079
I'm folding.

1068
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,955
{\an8}Joon-bin, please make your bet.

1069
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,665
{\an8}I'm folding, but not because I'm a coward.

1070
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,209
{\an8}Please flip over your number cards.

1071
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,294
Dong-joo, please make your bet.

1072
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,088
Are you betting high or low?

1073
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,174
Is it high?

1074
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,594
I'm going for it.
How many do I have to bet?

1075
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,429
You must bet eight or more chips.

1076
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,102
You two can win a high or low bet each.

1077
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,145
-That's what I want to do.
-You have matched the bet.

1078
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,314
Please decide on your betting markers.

1079
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,443
Dong-joo, who made the last bet,
will reveal her marker first.

1080
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,612
{\an8}You have bet on low.

1081
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,532
{\an8}Yu-min, please reveal your marker.

1082
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,368
{\an8}-You have bet on high.
-We both win.

1083
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,873
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is Yu-min.

1084
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,417
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is Dong-joo.

1085
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,962
{\an8}You receive 17 chips each.

1086
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,381
{\an8}Yu-min will start the next round.

1087
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,883
{\an8}It's time for me to go home.

1088
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,510
You got this far.

1089
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,011
I was prepared for it.

1090
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:14,848
I feel so...

1091
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,892
You'll see him tomorrow. It's okay.

1092
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,770
If you're sad and feel like giving up,

1093
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,313
support me.

1094
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,274
-I'm not sad at all.
-You're annoying.

1095
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,483
I really want to win.

1096
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,777
{\an8}The amount of chips is important.

1097
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,279
{\an8}I would be dead if not for Kyeong-rim.

1098
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,822
{\an8}I'm glad she gave me a Piece.

1099
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,949
Kyeong-rim saved you.

1100
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,410
I would've gone home first otherwise.

1101
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,162
You each received two open cards.

1102
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,038
The first bet will begin now.

1103
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,166
{\an8}You have bet one.

1104
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,918
{\an8}-ORBIT.
-This is hard. Gosh, this is bad.

1105
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,757
{\an8}We're in the same situation.

1106
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,551
{\an8}-We are.
-Yeah.

1107
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,557
I'll fold.

1108
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,726
Please flip over your number cards.

1109
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,062
Kyeong-rim, please make your bet.

1110
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,982
-Let's assume I make a bet here.
-Okay.

1111
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,861
And say a person before me
bets an extra ten chips

1112
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,279
for the final bet

1113
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,780
but I only have four left.

1114
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,866
-What happens then?
-They can only bet four.

1115
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,577
-They can only bet as many as you have.
-So my fate depends on it.

1116
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,079
-We're all playing with your life.
-Yeah?

1117
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,040
So you're all playing with me?

1118
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,459
{\an8}All right, I'm going for it then.

1119
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,252
{\an8}-You have bet one.
-Yes.

1120
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,337
{\an8}Seok-jin.

1121
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,255
{\an8}You have bet one.

1122
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,215
Seungkwan.

1123
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,967
I'm folding.

1124
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,844
{\an8}Joon-bin, you have bet one.

1125
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,012
{\an8}Dong-joo.

1126
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,931
{\an8}-I'll bet one.
-You have bet one.

1127
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,476
{\an8}All players have bet the same amount.
Here are your third open cards.

1128
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,561
{\an8}-Four.
-How does Yu-min

1129
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,104
{\an8}-keep getting lucky?
-She gets good cards.

1130
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,022
{\an8}Eight.

1131
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,607
{\an8}Multiplication.

1132
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,942
{\an8}You have discarded subtraction.

1133
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,485
{\an8}-Five.
-Interesting.

1134
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,614
{\an8}I have just enough for maybe two rounds.

1135
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,824
{\an8}ORBIT, how many do you have left?

1136
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:57,951
Five.

1137
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,702
How long can you survive?

1138
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,789
I'll be out within three rounds.

1139
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,290
You can last three rounds?

1140
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,376
If I keep folding, I could.

1141
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,377
I see.

1142
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,922
But I'm as good as dead.

1143
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,715
The final bet will begin now.

1144
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,176
Yu-min, please place your bet.

1145
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,679
Is five the most I can bet?

1146
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,930
No, four.

1147
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,391
If you do that, I have to go home.

1148
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,434
Kyeong-rim dies if you win.

1149
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,571
Do it.

1150
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,030
{\an8}Do it.

1151
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,574
{\an8}You have bet four.

1152
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,617
{\an8}It would be a plot twist
if Kyeong-rim wins.

1153
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,035
{\an8}-You have bet four.
-Yes.

1154
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:41,953
{\an8}Seok-jin.

1155
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,830
{\an8}You have bet four.

1156
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,540
{\an8}I've already made a twenty.

1157
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,624
{\an8}Really?

1158
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,088
Joon-bin.

1159
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,257
You have bet four.

1160
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,258
Dong-joo.

1161
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,843
You're betting on low.

1162
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,595
{\an8}Yes, super low.

1163
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,055
{\an8}-Let's do it.
-You have bet four.

1164
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,682
All players have bet the same amount.

1165
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,225
Please place your hands on the table.

1166
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,143
Okay.

1167
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,026
Dong-joo, who bet last,
please reveal your marker.

1168
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,111
{\an8}You have bet on low.

1169
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,406
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

1170
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,408
{\an8}My hand is shaking.

1171
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,578
{\an8}I'm trembling.

1172
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,208
{\an8}Are you finished?

1173
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,293
{\an8}-Yes.
-What does that equal?

1174
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,586
Joon-bin will win.

1175
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,671
Joon-bin, please reveal your marker.

1176
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,174
{\an8}You have bet on low.

1177
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,759
{\an8}-Please complete your equation.
-He really bet on low.

1178
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,846
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

1179
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,307
{\an8}Good job.

1180
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,434
{\an8}Seok-jin, please reveal your marker.

1181
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,645
{\an8}You have bet on high.

1182
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:49,896
{\an8}You're bold.

1183
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,272
{\an8}He bet on high.

1184
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,273
{\an8}He's good at this.

1185
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,358
{\an8}Darn it.

1186
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,281
{\an8}-He's good.
-He is.

1187
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,450
{\an8}Yu-min, please reveal your marker.

1188
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,577
{\an8}You have bet on high.

1189
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,412
{\an8}Please complete your equation.

1190
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:08,873
{\an8}Twenty-two?

1191
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,417
{\an8}She's two away from twenty.

1192
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,335
Kyeong-rim.

1193
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,172
-Yes.
-Please reveal your marker.

1194
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,007
{\an8}You have bet on low.

1195
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,885
{\an8}-Please complete your equation.
-Okay.

1196
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,473
{\an8}It's time for me to go home.

1197
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,399
-I'll be right behind.
-Okay.

1198
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,901
{\an8}The winner of this round's
high bet is Seok-jin.

1199
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,903
{\an8}And the winner of the low bet is Joon-bin.

1200
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,655
{\an8}Good game.

1201
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,115
It's time for me to go.

1202
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,242
Kyeong-rim.

1203
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,243
-Right now?
-I'm done.

1204
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,954
-See you tomorrow.
-I lost all my chips.

1205
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,374
<i>Kyeong-rim has lost all of her Pieces.</i>

1206
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,761
Oh, no.

1207
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,389
<i>As such,</i>

1208
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,266
-<i>Kyeong-rim is the sixth player</i>
-Hey.

1209
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,226
<i>to get eliminated from</i> The Devil's Plan.

1210
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,728
I'm sorry, Joon-bin.

1211
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,981
<i>Kyeong-rim, please return
to the living area, pack your belongings,</i>

1212
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,816
<i>and leave.</i>

1213
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,199
-This isn't right.
-Why is he crying?

1214
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,744
-Joon-bin, it's my fault. I'm so sorry.
-It's not funny, Joon-bin.

1215
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,412
You don't have to be sorry.

1216
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,207
Several players
had to get eliminated today,

1217
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,752
so I ended things quickly on purpose.

1218
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:36,878
Guys, it's...

1219
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,672
I'll go now, so don't cry.

1220
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,258
What's happening to you all?

1221
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,761
I made it this far. I'll see you tomorrow.

1222
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,471
Why are you crying?

1223
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,891
-I'm sorry.
-Towards the end... No, you did well.

1224
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,392
I'm very happy that my roommate

1225
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,853
and my cellmate both survived.

1226
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:58,024
You were all like gifts to me.

1227
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,276
I had such...

1228
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,575
a pleasant and happy time with you all.

1229
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,744
-Bye, Kyeong-rim.
-I'm so glad I got to play with you all.

1230
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,621
-Goodbye.
-We feel the same.

1231
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,664
Bye!

1232
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,957
Bye.

1233
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,853
What a great experience.

1234
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:40,066
This was my first time
staying with others for a week

1235
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,528
<i>since I graduated from school
and became an adult.</i>

1236
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:47,740
<i>It felt like I went on a great trip.</i>

1237
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:51,285
Whatever plan the Devil may have set up,

1238
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:56,207
we trusted and relied
on each other until the end.

1239
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,416
Thank you, everyone.

1240
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,719
I wasn't going to cry
no matter who got eliminated.

1241
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:09,929
I was always cold,

1242
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,266
saying we should eliminate people
since this is a survival show.

1243
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,978
But coincidentally, I beat Kyeong-rim.

1244
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,021
<i>And I had five chips,</i>

1245
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,690
<i>worth as much as the Piece she gave me.</i>

1246
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,819
I felt so bad for Kyeong-rim,
who was trying her best today.

1247
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,822
I cried because I felt really bad.

1248
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,701
She wanted to support you.

1249
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,994
-So do well.
-She wanted you to advance.

1250
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,996
If you play well, then that's it.

1251
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,581
We will move on to the next round.

1252
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,542
I hate that I'm counting the chips
after all that.

1253
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,254
We still have to do our best.

1254
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,298
This is a painful game of poker.

1255
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,758
{\an8}ORBIT will start this round.

1256
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:48,759
{\an8}Let's do this.

1257
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:52,889
MOMENTS LATER

1258
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,015
I'm folding.

1259
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,099
You have folded.

1260
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,225
I'm folding.

1261
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,518
Please reveal your marker.

1262
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,936
You have bet on low.

1263
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,855
The winner of the low bet is Seok-jin.

1264
