1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,431
My hunch was right!

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,558
I was right!

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,602
How did you know
there would be a secret to the prison?

4
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,396
I guessed from the first day.

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,565
-Guessed what?
-That there would be something in prison.

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,526
It might not be a bad thing
to go to prison once.

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,945
Something could be hidden there.

8
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,530
Who discovered this?

9
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,699
-Yeon-woo.
-Yeon-woo?

10
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,951
<i>She rummaged around and found it.</i>

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,453
-When you were here together?
-Yeah.

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,496
<i>It's a bit disappointing and odd</i>

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,790
{\an8}that Yeon-woo didn't tell me about this.

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,126
<i>If she had given me the slightest hint</i>

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,254
<i>about the code or safe or whatever,</i>

16
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,007
I would've looked for numbers
after solving this Piece puzzle.

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,095
If Joon-bin or Yeon-woo
find a clue regarding the code,

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,555
they agreed to tell me.

19
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,973
They probably haven't found it.

20
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,641
I don't think they will.

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,810
But I know how to solve the code.

22
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,562
This or that?

23
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,189
-This?
-No.

24
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,356
-That?
-Yeah.

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,941
Really?

26
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,568
I came to prison to find that.

27
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,904
-That's crazy.
-I'm here for that.

28
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,031
I'm telling you because it's you.

29
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,449
You discovered something?

30
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,117
I'm keeping it a secret.

31
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,161
What is it?

32
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,330
Give me the puzzle.

33
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,706
I should at least solve the puzzle.

34
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,045
If we solve the puzzle,
we can open that safe.

35
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,047
-Really?
-Yeah.

36
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,592
I need three Pieces to open that safe.

37
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,177
-If you solve this,
-Please.

38
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,054
you get a Piece as you leave prison.

39
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,101
You don't get the Piece right away?

40
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,106
Have you played this before?

41
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,862
<i>Yeon-woo and Joon-bin.</i>

42
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,573
{\an8}Those two are such an unlikely duo.

43
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,826
<i>Yet they were playing Nine Men's Morris.</i>

44
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,286
I knew they weren't into board games.

45
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,746
<i>So I went over.</i>

46
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,208
-This is Nine Men's Morris.
-Let's tell him.

47
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:06,793
Don't you think so?

48
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,712
{\an8}Seungkwan, Yeon-woo, and I
are trying to find the code

49
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,841
{\an8}so that it can help us win the game.

50
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,939
I know Yeon-woo and I
are going to struggle.

51
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,693
<i>So I thought it would be good
to let a smart player in on it.</i>

52
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,736
Tell who? Oh, okay.

53
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,988
I agree.

54
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,197
-This is a secret.
-Okay.

55
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,449
There's a safe in prison.

56
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,909
Is it hidden in prison?

57
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,994
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

58
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,747
-There's a clue in the living area.
-But I can't find it.

59
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,332
Could it be in the game area?

60
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,792
I looked but it's not there.

61
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,335
It's in the living area.

62
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,467
So we need to find numbers for it?

63
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,554
We're not sure if it's a hint or numbers.

64
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,847
We don't know how many digits?

65
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,974
-No, but it is made up of numbers.
-We don't know.

66
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,936
-So the safe has a number pad?
-Yeah, with numbers.

67
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,271
-Like on a phone?
-Yeah.

68
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,638
This is driving me crazy.
I think I'm almost there.

69
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,765
I need a pen.

70
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,643
Nice.

71
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,283
Something like this.

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,493
THE DEVIL'S PLAN

73
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:46,995
It's sort of...

74
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,038
-It's going slow, isn't it?
-Yeah.

75
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,707
-Kyeong-rim.
-It's a bit... Yeah?

76
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,209
I noticed something.

77
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,753
Let's draw the curtains.

78
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,046
What's going on?

79
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,172
What is it?

80
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,300
-Why draw the curtains?
-I noticed

81
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,801
that when we first got these Pieces,

82
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,386
we got ones shaped like this.

83
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,472
So I thought we had to
do something with them.

84
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,057
But since they're all the same,

85
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,935
I didn't really think much of it.

86
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,645
Now that we all have more Pieces,

87
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,814
-I noticed that they're different.
-Right, they are.

88
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,608
But on the first day, I assumed
they would keep giving us the same Piece

89
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,068
because they all looked the same.

90
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,196
By fitting these
different Pieces together,

91
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,450
-I think we can assemble something.
-Exactly.

92
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,494
{\an8}The Pieces were different
and had grooves of different sizes.

93
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,580
{\an8}There must be a reason
for the differences.

94
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,339
{\an8}They look like letters.

95
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,776
I'm almost there.

96
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,293
-Are you studying?
-Oh, hey.

97
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,713
-That would help us a lot.
-Please.

98
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,881
We have a minute left.

99
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,467
It's starting.

100
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,511
We got this!

101
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,513
-We got this!
-Let's go.

102
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,431
Let's go.

103
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,184
<i>The prize match will begin soon.</i>

104
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,603
<i>Please gather in the game area.</i>

105
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,813
Let's go, everyone.

106
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,192
You startled me.

107
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,235
Let's go.

108
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,570
Hello.

109
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,867
There's nothing here.

110
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,786
What can it be?
They'll probably show it on the screen.

111
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,371
There it is.

112
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,956
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

113
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,917
<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

114
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:03,464
{\an8}<i>Currently, Joon-bin and Dong-joo
have the most Pieces.</i>

115
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,843
<i>Before the prize match begins,</i>

116
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,470
<i>players will be divided into three teams.</i>

117
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,430
What?

118
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,975
<i>Please divide yourselves into</i>

119
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,644
<i>teams of three, two, and two.</i>

120
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,021
Teams? I guess they're taking Pieces.

121
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,773
If that's the case,

122
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,775
those with the most Pieces

123
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,652
-should spread out.
-Which three have the most?

124
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,862
-Me and...
-The two of us.

125
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,779
After you two?

126
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,407
Me. The three of us have three each.

127
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,410
-You three need to split up.
-Okay.

128
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,037
Kyeong-rim, Seok-jin,
and Yu-min stand here.

129
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,457
Then we can decide who goes where.

130
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,041
-Three, two, and two.
-Right.

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,585
Let's say I'm here.

132
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,670
-Four and three Pieces.
-Four and three. So we have seven.

133
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,046
-Joon-bin go here.
-I have four.

134
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,632
-That makes seven.
-Then you three can be a team.

135
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,675
-Okay.
-That way,

136
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,802
the damage won't be too bad
even if we lose Pieces.

137
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,095
<i>Once the game begins,</i>

138
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,431
<i>the teams may not communicate
with other teams.</i>

139
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,640
-What?
-What?

140
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,350
Teams can't communicate with other teams.

141
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,688
<i>Each team must go to
the work room, kitchen, or dealer room.</i>

142
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,107
This is a mind game.

143
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,442
-No way.
-What do we do?

144
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,651
-Don't betray each other.
-We have a chance.

145
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,861
-Please go to the kitchen.
-We have a chance.

146
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,196
-No betrayals.
-Why? Because we have many Pieces?

147
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,615
-Don't betray us.
-No, because you're good.

148
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,408
Don't break under pressure.

149
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,409
What is this?

150
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,328
I'm so worried all of a sudden.

151
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,330
I trust you.
It's our first time playing together.

152
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,456
I'm touched.

153
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,499
I'm excited.

154
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,958
Same here.

155
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,335
-Are those scales?
-My gosh.

156
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,920
-Scales?
-What's this?

157
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,296
Are we going against each other?

158
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,717
<i>Now, here is the fourth prize match.</i>

159
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,762
<i>Today's prize match is Scale Game.</i>

160
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,888
-What?
-Scale Game?

161
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,139
-What's that?
-What's that?

162
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,683
<i>In this game,
players must balance the scale</i>

163
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,228
<i>by placing minerals
of different weights on it</i>

164
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,397
<i>while also finding out
the weights of each mineral.</i>

165
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,358
ORBIT would be good at this.

166
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:53,074
<i>Players will be given red, yellow,
green, blue, and purple minerals.</i>

167
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:57,620
<i>They will receive ten minerals,
with two of each color.</i>

168
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,916
<i>Each mineral weighs between
one gram and twenty grams.</i>

169
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,418
<i>Assuming the mineral's weight is N grams,</i>

170
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,962
<i>N will be a natural number.</i>

171
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,464
-So no decimals?
-That's right.

172
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,510
<i>Once the game begins,
information on one mineral will be given.</i>

173
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,637
They'll give us information.

174
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,057
<i>The wooden cubes given are only symbolic.</i>

175
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,977
<i>Their weight has no bearing
on the minerals' actual weight.</i>

176
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,730
<i>Minerals may not be
exchanged or transferred.</i>

177
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,651
<i>Players must place
the minerals on the scales</i>

178
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,946
<i>while making sure the scales are balanced,</i>

179
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,074
<i>and the weight of each mineral
must be deduced correctly.</i>

180
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:40,538
<i>There is a main scale
and a secondary scale.</i>

181
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,374
<i>On the main scale,
players must place the minerals</i>

182
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,168
<i>so that the scales are balanced.</i>

183
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,339
<i>The secondary scale may be used
to help with calculation</i>

184
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,384
<i>and does not have to be balanced.</i>

185
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:59,473
<i>Players will put on stickers
that will determine the order of play.</i>

186
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,058
<i>Based on the order,</i>

187
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,146
<i>players will place wooden cubes
on the prop scales in each room,</i>

188
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,065
<i>and the results will be
shown to all on the monitor.</i>

189
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,986
<i>On their turn, every player
must place at least two minerals</i>

190
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>on the scale within five minutes.</i>

191
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,284
<i>Players may use
both scales simultaneously.</i>

192
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,494
<i>Or they may use just one scale.</i>

193
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,123
<i>When placing minerals on the main scale,</i>

194
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,002
<i>both sides of the scale
may not have the same set of minerals.</i>

195
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:28,961
I see.

196
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,006
<i>Players may not remove minerals
placed on the scale.</i>

197
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,507
<i>The minerals will accumulate.</i>

198
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,178
<i>When the main scale is balanced,</i>

199
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,599
<i>players may pay one Piece
and guess the weight of each mineral.</i>

200
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,685
<i>Players who guess
all weights correctly succeed</i>

201
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,814
<i>and will receive two Pieces as a reward.</i>

202
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,525
<i>Players do not have to guess</i>

203
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,820
<i>even if the scale
is balanced during their turn.</i>

204
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,033
<i>If even one guess is incorrect,</i>

205
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,160
<i>the Piece they paid will not be returned.</i>

206
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,830
<i>Other players will only be informed
that it was incorrect,</i>

207
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,332
<i>and the game will continue.</i>

208
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,336
<i>Players with no minerals
or just one mineral</i>

209
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,214
<i>may not place
any more minerals on the scale.</i>

210
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,091
<i>They also lose their chance to guess.</i>

211
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,428
<i>When all players are unable
to place minerals on the scale,</i>

212
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,430
<i>the game will end immediately.</i>

213
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,518
<i>If the scale isn't balanced
by the end of the game,</i>

214
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,104
<i>or the weights of each mineral
aren't deduced correctly,</i>

215
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,772
<i>the prize match ends in failure.</i>

216
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,024
<i>In that case,
no prize money will be added.</i>

217
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,779
<i>If the main scale is balanced
and all weights are correctly deduced,</i>

218
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,614
<i>the prize match will end in success.</i>

219
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,200
<i>And 100 million won
will be added to the final prize.</i>

220
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,701
That's amazing.

221
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,372
<i>Players, please attach the number stickers
to determine the order.</i>

222
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,750
<i>The order will be revealed to all players.</i>

223
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,130
<i>The game will begin in ten minutes.</i>

224
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,341
Will the information
we get about the weight of one mineral

225
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,676
be different for each room?

226
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,219
It will be the same for all rooms.

227
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,887
-We're given the weight?
-The color and weight.

228
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,264
Okay.

229
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,141
We need to figure out four colors.

230
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,392
Four weights are unknown.

231
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,769
<i>I'm thinking of setting up an equation.</i>

232
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,105
Once we come up with several equations,

233
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,442
we can add them together
to calculate the weights.

234
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,153
<i>This game doesn't involve
complicated math.</i>

235
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,489
<i>It would be faster
to formulate an equation</i>

236
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,491
<i>since it involves simple calculations.</i>

237
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,618
Do you get the game?

238
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,622
<i>I didn't get the game at all.</i>

239
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,000
Once numbers are involved,

240
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,878
<i>I lose my footing and feel useless.</i>

241
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,629
Does only one person
have to get the answer?

242
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,840
Only one out of the seven
has to guess correctly.

243
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,049
Oh, really?

244
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,802
<i>We struck a good balance with our teams.</i>

245
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,513
It's a math game and each team
has someone who's good at math.

246
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,599
{\an8}-Once we figure it out...
-<i>Hanyang University, Engineering major.</i>

247
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,809
{\an8}So 2x plus y is...

248
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,603
{\an8}<i>MIT, Mathematics major.</i>

249
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,688
{\an8}When we place each mineral...

250
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,732
{\an8}<i>Yonsei University, Astronomy major.</i>

251
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,651
These three are more than capable at math.

252
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,652
<i>I felt reassured.</i>

253
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,779
-Sounds good.
-I think we'll manage somehow.

254
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,780
Me too.

255
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,241
Please determine your order.

256
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,784
I'll go first
since the latter is important.

257
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,744
-You're right.
-Yeah.

258
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,953
-I'll go first.
-Okay.

259
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,121
Should I go first?

260
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,332
I'll go fourth.

261
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,917
C plus D...

262
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,629
So it would be better for me to go first
with a plan in mind and sacrifice myself.

263
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,631
He'll be able to see what I did, won't he?

264
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,758
All results will be shown on the monitor.

265
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,969
<i>When players in each room
place minerals on the scale,</i>

266
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,348
<i>the results will be shown
to all players on the monitors.</i>

267
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,267
<i>However, players may not
move between rooms.</i>

268
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,854
<i>So they must guess
the other players' intentions</i>

269
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,814
<i>based on what they see on their monitors.</i>

270
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,651
They split us up
to force us to work in small teams.

271
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,694
The number of minerals is limited, right?

272
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,404
Each player gets two of each color,
for a total of ten.

273
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,364
What are these?

274
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,659
These will go on the scales
to mirror the other players' actions.

275
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,496
<i>Each player will receive
two minerals of each color,</i>

276
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,540
<i>for a total of ten minerals.</i>

277
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,210
<i>Minerals may not be
exchanged or transferred.</i>

278
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>Each player must place
at least two minerals during their turn.</i>

279
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,884
We can't remove minerals
placed by other players, right?

280
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,177
No, they accumulate.

281
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,971
We have to think this through then.

282
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,557
<i>The time has expired.</i>

283
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,725
<i>Scale Game begins now.</i>

284
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,728
<i>Players will receive their minerals now.</i>

285
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,314
For the unknown variable in the equation,

286
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,276
we should use these initials.

287
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,570
{\an8}-So what would we put down for red?
-Or do what you want.

288
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,530
{\an8}The variables would be R, Y, G, B, and P.

289
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,573
{\an8}I see.

290
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,201
<i>The information regarding
one mineral will be given now.</i>

291
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:34,248
<i>The yellow mineral
is the third heaviest mineral of the five.</i>

292
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,458
<i>And it weighs ten grams.</i>

293
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,003
{\an8}-Nice.
-This is good.

294
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,004
{\an8}This is great.

295
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,256
{\an8}Yellow is in the middle then, right?

296
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,427
{\an8}Two are heavier
and two are lighter than yellow.

297
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,761
<i>Yeon-woo.</i>

298
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,557
<i>Please place your minerals on the scale
within five minutes.</i>

299
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,517
{\an8}-Look, Yeon-woo is first.
-We're at the end.

300
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,269
{\an8}ORDER

301
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,937
{\an8}This is hilarious.

302
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,273
<i>-That's funny.
-It's in order of mathematical ability.</i>

303
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,691
<i>The math flunkers.</i>

304
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,401
<i>The three start us off.</i>

305
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,404
<i>Then Yu-min and then the mathematicians.</i>

306
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,364
We're all on the same page right now.

307
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,616
As of now, that is.

308
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,409
ORBIT, you got this.

309
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,535
-Dong-joo, you too.
-Seok-jin.

310
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,329
-Seok-jin, good luck.
-You got this.

311
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,496
Let's start with yellow.

312
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,916
Place yellow on one side.

313
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,043
Then place red on the other.

314
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,669
Yellow and red.

315
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,296
Then green and blue.

316
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,465
Let's see what the results are.

317
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,424
{\an8}On the main scale?

318
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,842
{\an8}They're also using the secondary scale.

319
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,302
They're pulling out all the stops.

320
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,846
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

321
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,598
{\an8}Yellow is heavier.

322
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,642
{\an8}That means red weighs less than ten grams.

323
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,143
{\an8}-Green is...
-Green is...

324
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,603
{\an8}heavier than blue.

325
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,771
{\an8}<i>Kyeong-rim.</i>

326
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,316
<i>Please place your minerals on the scale
within five minutes.</i>

327
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,359
{\an8}Let's see.

328
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,530
Should I place yellow here
and purple on the other side?

329
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,325
<i>With yellow on both sides,</i>

330
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,454
<i>we can figure out whether
purple is heavier or lighter than red.</i>

331
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,623
-Then we can guess purple's weight.
-Red and purple's weight.

332
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,500
-Right. I'll do that then.
-All right, do that.

333
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,627
-They put purple here.
-It's okay.

334
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,254
{\an8}This will help us compare red and purple.

335
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,714
{\an8}That makes sense.

336
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,092
{\an8}-There has to be a standard here too.
-Right.

337
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,053
{\an8}Assuming someone places a yellow here,

338
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,805
{\an8}I'll place a yellow on one side.

339
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,264
{\an8}You could...

340
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,142
{\an8}Or should I place a red then?

341
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,894
{\an8}-Two minutes left.
-I'll place a red...

342
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,730
{\an8}-Place a light one here.
-On one side?

343
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,065
{\an8}Or on both sides?

344
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,859
{\an8}What's going on?

345
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,528
{\an8}They're placing more, right?

346
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,321
{\an8}The player's turn has ended.

347
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,739
{\an8}-The same color?
-Why do this?

348
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,242
{\an8}I made a mistake.

349
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,995
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

350
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,204
{\an8}Why did they do this?

351
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,665
{\an8}Why did I place red on both sides?

352
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,709
{\an8}-I got confused too.
-That's pointless.

353
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,377
-We end up with the same thing.
-It's the same.

354
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,795
-It doesn't tell us anything new.
-Exactly.

355
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,171
-Why did they do that?
-It's fine.

356
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,424
{\an8}-Purple is heavier than red.
-Yeah.

357
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,343
<i>Joon-bin, please place
your minerals on the scale</i>

358
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,429
<i>within five minutes.</i>

359
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,097
{\an8}What if I place a red next to the blue?

360
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,348
{\an8}I thought the same thing.

361
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,725
{\an8}Place your red minerals

362
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,018
here and here.

363
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,186
Red is the lightest mineral so far.

364
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,730
<i>Then can we solve the weight for red?</i>

365
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,648
<i>With just those two minerals,</i>

366
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,191
<i>we can guess purple's weight.</i>

367
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,818
{\an8}-That's a good choice.
-Yeah.

368
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,236
{\an8}I would've done that too.

369
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,947
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

370
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,615
{\an8}It's the same?

371
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,826
{\an8}Two reds are lighter than one purple.

372
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,244
{\an8}Even with two reds,

373
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,537
{\an8}-purple is heavier.
-Right.

374
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,539
{\an8}-Red is a really small number.
-Yeah.

375
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,332
{\an8}-Green is...
-Green is heavier

376
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,585
{\an8}-than blue and red combined.
-Right.

377
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,919
{\an8}Red must be really light then.

378
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,755
{\an8}Should we place another red?

379
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,881
{\an8}What do you think?

380
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,507
Place a blue here.

381
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,426
How about another red here?

382
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,471
{\an8}-It's better to have fewer variables.
-I agree.

383
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,347
I think ORBIT's gonna do something here.

384
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,183
<i>They placed another red.</i>

385
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,186
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

386
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,228
{\an8}It went down.

387
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,146
{\an8}Okay, good.

388
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,898
{\an8}They're narrowing the range down.

389
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,442
{\an8}I think doing this makes the most sense.

390
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,860
Place a red there.

391
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,028
Like that.

392
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,034
<i>-It went down again.
-Big changes.</i>

393
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,702
That gives us the red's weight range.

394
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,163
<i>Purple is heavier than three reds</i>

395
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,957
<i>and it is lighter than four reds.</i>

396
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,294
<i>Based on this, purple's weight
is between seven and twenty.</i>

397
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,588
{\an8}<i>Depending on purple's weight,</i>

398
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,592
{\an8}<i>red's weight is between two and six.</i>

399
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,553
{\an8}Red is a really small number.

400
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,098
{\an8}-It's probably two or three.
-Right.

401
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,058
{\an8}Green could be the heaviest.

402
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,977
{\an8}The relationship between
P, G, and B is still unknown.

403
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,437
Do we have more of R or B?

404
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,064
-One of each.
-I see.

405
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,065
Place B.

406
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,109
Shall we see if yellow
makes this side heavier?

407
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,819
All right, let's do that.

408
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,238
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

409
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,907
<i>It's clearer now.</i>

410
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,159
{\an8}Green is much heavier.

411
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,412
{\an8}I think green is a lot heavier
and red is really light.

412
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,999
{\an8}We don't know G and P's relationship.

413
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,627
{\an8}We need to know how G and P compare.

414
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,131
<i>Kyeong-rim, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

415
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,841
{\an8}-Okay.
-What just happened?

416
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:58,095
{\an8}-One yellow and one blue were placed.
-Right, one blue and one yellow.

417
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,013
{\an8}-Yet the scales still look like that?
-The yellow...

418
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,306
This is what I'll do.

419
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,642
What about two blues here?

420
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,310
That way,

421
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,230
-G and P can be compared.
-Good idea.

422
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,358
<i>Even a person gifted in math would agree</i>

423
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,902
<i>that a simple equation with fewer
unknown variables is easier to manage</i>

424
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,571
<i>than a multi-order equation.</i>

425
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,951
<i>By placing minerals of the same color
on both sides to cancel each other out,</i>

426
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,663
<i>the equation will become simplified
and easier to solve.</i>

427
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,624
This is a bit risky.

428
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,169
-But it will get us closer...
-I will place the minerals.

429
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,508
What did they do?

430
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,426
What's this?

431
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,762
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

432
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,431
Why did they do this?

433
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,058
Wait, why did I do that?

434
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,896
There's something wrong.

435
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,607
I did that based on what you wrote.

436
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,775
{\an8}Isn't red heavier than purple?

437
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,985
{\an8}Red is...

438
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,405
{\an8}-Red is lighter than purple?
-Yeah, it is.

439
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,908
{\an8}I wrote down the wrong thing.

440
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,578
I made a mistake in my notes
and it snowballed from there.

441
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,331
It's all right.

442
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,834
-I'm such a fool.
-Don't say that. Just start fresh.

443
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,254
Because five minutes of each turn flew by,

444
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,466
I didn't have time
to correct my previous errors.

445
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,468
I had to keep up with the new equations.

446
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,261
Was this heavier?

447
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,679
<i>But I was so behind.</i>

448
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,060
-They put purple again.
-I will place a purple mineral.

449
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,646
Why?

450
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,314
I think we ruined it for everyone.

451
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,275
They're probably yelling at us.

452
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,706
<i>ORBIT, please place
your minerals on the scale</i>

453
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,750
<i>within five minutes.</i>

454
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,086
Let's say
I put these minerals on the scale.

455
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,546
-If I do...
-Okay.

456
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,549
-It would be R plus P,
-R plus P,

457
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,009
-compared to B.
-compared to B.

458
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,177
{\an8}Let's see how it goes.

459
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,389
{\an8}Let's see what R plus P shows us.

460
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,975
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

461
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,226
Okay.

462
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,897
The order is R, P, Y, B, then G.

463
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:19,111
<i>The order of weight
has been determined in this round.</i>

464
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,281
<i>As purple weighs less than ten grams,</i>

465
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,534
<i>the only number
for red's weight that satisfies</i>

466
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,370
<i>the previous inequation is two grams.</i>

467
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:33,208
<i>As a result, the purple's weight
is confirmed to be seven grams.</i>

468
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,087
Two, seven, and ten.

469
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,339
We need to figure out B and G.

470
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,677
<i>Seok-jin, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

471
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,472
Hopefully, ORBIT is figuring it out.

472
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,683
{\an8}<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

473
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,811
{\an8}<i>Yeon-woo, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

474
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,187
With three numbers,

475
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,857
I started to figure out ways

476
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,443
to balance the main scale.

477
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,986
To balance the scale...

478
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,823
I need to eliminate G and B.

479
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,994
<i>By eliminating the blue
and green minerals on each side,</i>

480
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,831
<i>players can find
the difference in total weight.</i>

481
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,709
{\an8}-Do you have a red mineral?
-No.

482
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,877
{\an8}-Do you have a red?
-No.

483
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,462
{\an8}-I do.
-In that case,

484
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,297
{\an8}place your red here later.

485
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,757
<i>When you do,</i>

486
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,927
<i>the equation becomes 2R plus 10 plus 3P.</i>

487
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:31,433
<i>The other side would be 4R plus 20 plus P.</i>

488
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,311
<i>That'll make both sides 35.</i>

489
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,314
We'll calculate this
without knowing blue and green.

490
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,358
-You should place a green on this side.
-Put a green mineral here.

491
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,947
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

492
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,700
<i>Yeon-woo is unable to place
any more minerals.</i>

493
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,160
<i>She is out of the game.</i>

494
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,580
{\an8}<i>Kyeong-rim, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

495
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,707
{\an8}Please don't place anything on this side

496
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,000
{\an8}until Yu-min's turn.

497
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,585
I don't have a choice.

498
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,503
Right.

499
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,841
Why does she keep doing this?

500
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,760
-What do we do?
-What did she place?

501
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,011
-A blue.
-A blue.

502
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,222
She can't place a blue right now.

503
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,808
Why is she placing a blue at this point?

504
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,101
The scale might collapse.

505
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,978
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

506
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,357
The secondary scale is balanced.

507
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,400
The secondary scale is balanced!

508
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,443
The secondary scale is balanced.

509
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,695
It's balanced.

510
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,781
We just need to calculate this.

511
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,158
Ten plus R plus P is G, right?

512
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,245
I got R, P, Y, B, and G's weights.

513
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,665
<i>Using the equations
he had formulated earlier,</i>

514
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,294
<i>ORBIT managed to figure out
the weight of the blue mineral as well.</i>

515
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,214
Two, seven, ten, sixteen, and nineteen.

516
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,633
<i>When the secondary scale was balanced,</i>

517
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,343
I found out
the weight of all five minerals.

518
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,053
G equals 19, right?

519
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,096
Yeah.

520
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,639
I think the total weight is 100.

521
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,890
The other side is 86.

522
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,600
We need to add 14.

523
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,770
<i>Joon-bin, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

524
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,608
<i>-Here is the status of the scales.
-It's the same.</i>

525
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,943
<i>He placed two greens.</i>

526
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,363
He put them on the other scale
so the main scale doesn't get messed up.

527
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,366
{\an8}<i>Joon-bin is unable to place
any more minerals.</i>

528
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,784
{\an8}<i>He is out of the game.</i>

529
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:18,039
Everyone's cautious because there are
only a few minerals left.

530
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,334
They're trying to make it work
with the few that are left.

531
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,296
{\an8}<i>Yu-min, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

532
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,882
{\an8}With the minerals you have left,

533
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,675
{\an8}we can't make 14.

534
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,219
{\an8}I have no idea what Dong-joo will place.

535
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,345
{\an8}Goodness.

536
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,308
How many are there in total?

537
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,810
Each person has two of each.

538
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,353
-Two times seven, so fourteen.
-Right.

539
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:45,192
Fourteen. There are thirteen
purple minerals on all scales.

540
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,902
There's only one purple left.

541
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,320
-It won't work.
-What do we do?

542
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,363
-It can't be done. What about red?
-Are we doomed?

543
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,034
<i>There are 12 red minerals on the scales.</i>

544
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,285
{\an8}And you have two.

545
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,329
{\an8}All right, there's a way to make 14.

546
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,122
One yellow and two reds.

547
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,124
Place these two on this side.

548
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,876
Then someone has to place
another red here.

549
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,169
Someone should have it.

550
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,712
-Seok-jin and Dong-joo do.
-Right?

551
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,550
Five seconds left.

552
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,885
{\an8}-There's no choice.
-Place them.

553
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,511
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

554
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,889
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

555
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,850
<i>Yu-min is unable to place

556
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,393
<i>She is out of the game.</i>

557
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,730
<i>Dong-joo, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

558
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:28,151
Please know that you need to place a red.

559
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,277
Can you hear me?

560
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,946
Come on, telepathy.

561
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,907
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

562
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,743
{\an8}REMAINING MINERALS

563
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,496
What?

564
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,248
She placed a blue and green.

565
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,582
She should've placed them here.

566
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,585
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

567
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,713
{\an8}<i>ORBIT, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

568
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,007
<i>People kept messing up the main scale.</i>

569
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,175
So it was frustrating.

570
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,095
I need to do some calculations again.

571
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,721
I just kept thinking

572
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,558
that I'm going to get this right
no matter what.

573
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,851
The difference is one.

574
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:06,481
{\an8}We need to balance the scale
with the remaining minerals.

575
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,691
{\an8}Green is 19.

576
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,526
{\an8}Yellow is ten.

577
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,069
{\an8}Purple is seven.

578
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,613
{\an8}The difference is two.

579
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,572
It doesn't work.

580
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,701
The difference is two
but Seok-jin probably has a red, right?

581
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,077
No one put a red, right?

582
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,328
-It was blue and green?
-Yeah.

583
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,497
Seok-jin has a red so I just need to
make a difference of two.

584
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,958
Here's what Seok-jin has.

585
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,545
{\an8}<i>He has a ten, a two, and a nineteen.</i>

586
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,339
-Twenty-six.
-One minute left.

587
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,465
Twenty-six.

588
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,009
Twenty-six.

589
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,510
Okay, it's possible.

590
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,846
Green and purple make twenty-six.

591
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,389
Here's what I'll do.

592
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,143
{\an8}If I add 26 to the side
that weighs 117 grams,

593
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,728
{\an8}it becomes 143 grams.

594
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,980
Then he can put a green and yellow here,

595
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,024
which will add 29 on that side.

596
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,776
-Then a red mineral has to go here.
-The red.

597
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,029
A green and yellow here, and a red here.

598
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,530
This is our last chance.

599
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,699
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

600
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,577
<i>ORBIT is unable to place
any more minerals.</i>

601
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,120
<i>He is out of the game.</i>

602
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,204
-Please.
-Seok-jin.

603
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,750
This game is harder for me
than today's main match.

604
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,170
{\an8}<i>Seok-jin, please place your minerals
on the scale.</i>

605
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,338
Will it work?

606
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,048
They want me to place them here.

607
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,800
It has to be green and yellow here,
and a red there.

608
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,218
I believe in you, Seok-jin.

609
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,929
My heart is pounding right now.

610
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,431
-I trust you.
-How thrilling.

611
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,308
They want me to put down
a bigger number on this side.

612
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,517
That's right.

613
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,602
Which would be these two.

614
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,314
Seok-jin, I know you know what to do.

615
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,815
I'll do this.

616
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,693
-He's done it!
-Green!

617
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,779
-Green and yellow.
-He did it.

618
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,655
Then a red has to go here.

619
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,908
-It worked?
-Seok-jin, put a red here.

620
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,701
Are you finished?

621
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,952
Yes.

622
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,497
<i>Here is the status of the scales.</i>

623
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,792
He didn't place the red on the other side?

624
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,921
You have placed one yellow
and one green on the main scale.

625
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,590
We couldn't figure out
the blue until the end.

626
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,133
G equals 19, right?

627
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,511
Yeah. It's two, seven,
thirteen, and nineteen.

628
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,930
B might not be 13. It might be greater.

629
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,598
Blue has to be 15.

630
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,601
We guessed blue was between 13 and 16.

631
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,728
That's how bad we were at the game.

632
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,398
I'm sorry.

633
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,608
<i>Due to failure in the prize match,</i>

634
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,985
<i>no prize amount is added.</i>

635
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,030
Being split into different rooms
really killed us.

636
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,824
The minerals on the scale look nice.

637
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,202
I feel miserable.

638
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,537
-It went to the wrong side.
-Kyeong-rim,

639
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,039
-I was so foolish.
-we made mistakes in the beginning.

640
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,583
I'm so angry at myself.

641
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,044
I made a mistake I shouldn't have made.

642
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,630
I accept that this is my fault.

643
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,715
<i>The prize match has ended.</i>

644
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,593
<i>Players, please return to the living area.</i>

645
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,512
I can't believe my notes were wrong.

646
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:46,099
I wrote down the wrong inequations.

647
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,018
I'm glad I didn't have to
wait for you to sleep.

648
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,271
Were you going to wait?

649
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,439
"Is he asleep yet?"

650
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,190
You're really something.

651
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,152
-You know why I slept so late last night?
-Why?

652
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,529
<i>I had to wait for everyone to go to bed.</i>

653
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,905
That's when I started.

654
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,199
<i>Seok-jin told me
I was like a mad scientist.</i>

655
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,452
<i>That's how we figured it out.</i>

656
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,995
What would the last Piece have told us?

657
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,164
How many digits can you get out of that?

658
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,124
It could be eight.

659
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,501
-That many?
-Yeah.

660
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,627
That's crazy.

661
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,633
I wish a Piece would fall from the sky.

662
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,927
I wonder if I can solve it without it.

663
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,012
It's unlikely, right?

664
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,850
What could the other Piece look like?

665
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,943
This is the best I can do for now.

666
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:43,448
If I hadn't lost a Piece,
I would have completed this by now.

667
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,826
What is that?

668
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,371
So that's the Piece you're missing?

669
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,832
-So the Pieces fit together like that?
-Yeah.

670
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,418
Don't tell anyone
that I've almost assembled this.

671
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,586
Okay.

672
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,837
That was disappointing.

673
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,923
We missed out on another 100 million won.

674
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,258
-I'm ashamed.
-Don't say that.

675
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,103
<i>Before the prize match,</i>

676
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,272
<i>I had found around six letters.</i>

677
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,233
E.

678
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,150
X.

679
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,778
N.

680
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,262
{\an8}Next...

681
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,307
{\an8}Y, E, A...

682
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,403
{\an8}Next year!

683
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,585
2024?

684
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,263
-I have two.
-Of what?

685
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,764
-Why only two?
-Pieces. Sorry?

686
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,059
I lost a Piece after the main match.

687
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,477
You didn't get a single combination?

688
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,687
None at all.

689
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,272
It's his fault then.

690
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,441
-Joon-bin, you're the problem.
-Why?

691
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,568
He was too busy supporting me.

692
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,486
So he couldn't get his combination.

693
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,780
-He lost one. He only has two.
-He lost a Piece.

694
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
-He thought I would win.
-If I needed a point,

695
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,910
-He thought I'd get four.
-I would've placed a monkey.

696
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:52,911
How many do you have?

697
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,870
-He has four.
-Four.

698
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,996
Give me one.

699
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,206
-Sorry?
-I have two Pieces.

700
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,374
Really? That's bad.

701
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,046
Joon-bin's bewildered right now.

702
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,297
I'll give you mine.

703
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,590
It's not that.

704
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,716
You don't have a lot.

705
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,051
-I have four.
-You do?

706
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,802
-Let's all survive.
-That's right.

707
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,471
-Survival is key.
-Take it.

708
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,475
I wanted him to have fun
without worrying about getting eliminated.

709
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,894
To be honest, I also want to see

710
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,314
someone like ORBIT win
in an environment like this.

711
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,943
-I think we're doing great here.
-Yeah.

712
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,277
-It's beautiful.
-It is.

713
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,905
I'm treating tomorrow
like it's my last day.

714
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,449
They say those who want to die, live.

715
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,076
And those who want to live, die.

716
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,911
Your grit is amazing.

717
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,497
-Let's take ORBIT down.
-We should.

718
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,082
-You've finally woken up.
-Yeah.

719
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,376
-It's like a coming-of-age story.
-It is.

720
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,669
Let's take him down.

721
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,096
Dong-jae, get some sleep.

722
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,806
-Dong-jae?
-Why did I say Dong-jae?

723
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,185
I probably seem like
a crazy person right now.

724
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,353
You frightened me.

725
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,397
-I will.
-I meant Seungkwan.

726
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,606
-Okay.
-Get some rest.

727
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,775
Tomorrow's a crucial day for you.

728
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,568
-It's time to start anew.
-Okay.

729
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,070
Lie down and get some rest.

730
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,086
You're so determined.

731
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,838
-Me?
-You're amazing.

732
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,339
You haven't taken a single break.

733
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,635
Drink some water.

734
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,761
Thank you.

735
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,183
<i>She spent hours on it
like some mad scientist.</i>

736
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,393
I was amazed.

737
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:50,737
<i>Honestly, I was desperate
for another Piece.</i>

738
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,365
<i>Because I might need it
for tomorrow's main match.</i>

739
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,117
<i>So I gave it my all.</i>

740
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,840
Seungkwan.

741
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,924
-Seungkwan.
-Yeah?

742
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,139
See-won.

743
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,224
See-won!

744
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,227
You're awesome.

745
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,314
I think my perseverance really paid off.

746
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,565
Time to sleep.

747
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,862
Starting tomorrow,
things will be different.

748
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,531
As I said before,

749
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,785
I'm not going to work with
ORBIT at all tomorrow.

750
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,163
We'll be playing to eliminate players,
and I can't do that to him.

751
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,831
If I win the game tomorrow,

752
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,167
it would probably happen by betraying him.

753
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,877
And I can't do that.

754
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,255
ORBIT filled in for so many aspects
that I lacked.

755
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,466
<i>And I can't betray someone like that.</i>

756
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,926
So I just won't work with him.

757
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,137
And I'll team up with you
while pretending to play for myself.

758
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,550
Thank you.

759
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,095
Thank you.

760
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,599
I'm finding life in prison quite pleasant.

761
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,768
-Is it pumpkin porridge?
-Yeah.

762
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,145
It looks so good.

763
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,026
How is it?

764
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,446
What's wrong?

765
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,614
You look puzzled.

766
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,243
I've never had pumpkin porridge
with rice in it.

767
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,928
Why are you up so early?

768
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,471
I know, right? I couldn't sleep.

769
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,516
This is my first breakfast here.

770
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,352
I want to eliminate everyone.

771
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,063
I wish they would all go home.

772
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,441
How are there nine people
in the quarterfinals?

773
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,026
-Joon-bin.
-Yeah?

774
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,944
-You're with me today, right?
-Of course.

775
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,280
Do you think you can go to prison again?

776
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,239
Me?

777
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,908
I'll go if we find the code.

778
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,035
Do you think no one knows the code?

779
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,789
Of the nine of us that are left,

780
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,209
one or two must know
but are keeping it secret.

781
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,961
Really?

782
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,090
How did they figure it out? I couldn't.

783
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,550
Observation.

784
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,720
Who here is that smart?

785
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,893
Seungkwan and See-won.

786
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,686
Please return to the game area.

787
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,980
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.

788
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,815
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

789
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,692
Please submit the cast puzzle.

790
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,361
-Here it is.
-Isn't she amazing?

791
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,071
You receive one Piece as a reward.

792
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,614
Thank you.

793
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,449
Please move forward.

794
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,618
-Good job.
-Oh, sorry.

795
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,538
What? Darn it.

796
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,666
-I need to go to Seok-jin.
-You do?

797
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,376
I didn't get the Piece I wanted.

798
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,257
Good luck.

799
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,009
<i>The main match will begin soon.</i>

800
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,887
<i>Please gather in the game area.</i>

801
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,931
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

802
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,100
How do my bangs look?

803
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,434
Your hair looks great.

804
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,352
Dong-joo styled it.

805
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,728
-Really?
-It's her work.

806
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,813
Let's go, everyone.

807
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,274
No way.

808
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,150
Is it Go?

809
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,110
What is that?

810
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,196
-This is for Yeon-woo.
-It looks like a Go board.

811
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,990
-What a welcome sight.
-This is cool.

812
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,033
It's Yeon-woo's time to shine.

813
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,702
-It looks fun.
-Are these items?

814
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,787
-What are these?
-Pieces.

815
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,956
-It's similar to Nine Men's Morris.
-They're out.

816
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,708
-Guys!
-Well done.

817
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,418
-Hi!
-Well done.

818
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,336
-You look better than I expected.
-It's bright here.

819
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,547
-Don't I look prettier?
-See-won!

820
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,382
-Way to hang in there.
-Tell me about it.

821
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm going to prison again.

822
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,012
<i>Greetings.</i>

823
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,515
<i>The fifth main match
of</i> The Devil's Plan <i>begins now.</i>

824
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,809
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

825
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:35,313
{\an8}<i>here is the current Piece count
for each player.</i>

826
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,442
{\an8}<i>Currently, Joon-bin has the most Pieces.</i>

827
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,364
<i>Now, here is the fifth main match.</i>

828
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,283
<i>Today's main match is</i>

829
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,493
<i>Laying Grass.</i>

830
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,661
Laying Grass?

831
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,787
Laying Grass.

832
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,916
<i>In Laying Grass, players must place
grass tiles on the territory table</i>

833
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,127
<i>to expand their territory.</i>

834
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,839
<i>The goal is to create
the largest square territory.</i>

835
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,007
It's basically Go.

836
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,383
It's similar.

837
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,551
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

838
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,513
<i>players will draw numbers
to determine the order of play.</i>

839
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:15,311
<i>Once the game begins,
all players will receive one face tile</i>

840
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,897
<i>with a sticker of their face on it.</i>

841
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,231
That makes me uncomfortable.

842
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,151
<i>A total of 96 grass tiles</i>

843
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,862
<i>are prepared in a predetermined order.</i>

844
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,199
<i>The order can be seen on the screen.</i>

845
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,076
-This is Tetris.
-It's Tetris.

846
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,703
<i>During their turn,</i>

847
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,790
<i>players will receive tiles in order.</i>

848
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,791
In order?

849
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:41,921
{\an8}<i>Additionally, all players will receive
one tile exchange coupon.</i>

850
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,548
<i>When a tile exchange coupon is used,</i>

851
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,134
<i>a player may choose one tile
from the next five</i>

852
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,347
<i>regardless of the predetermined order.</i>

853
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,477
<i>The tile next in order
of the tile chosen by the player</i>

854
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,021
<i>becomes the tile
that the next player will receive.</i>

855
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,191
<i>Tiles preceding the chosen tile</i>

856
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,861
<i>may be used
after all other tiles have been used.</i>

857
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,991
<i>Players may buy
a tile exchange coupon for one Piece.</i>

858
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:11,909
Wow!

859
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,577
Yes! I have three to spend.

860
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,122
<i>When a player receives their first tile,</i>

861
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:20,209
<i>they must place it so it touches
at least one side of their face tile.</i>

862
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,213
<i>The group of tiles in contact
with a player's face tile</i>

863
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,673
<i>will become their territory.</i>

864
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,178
<i>All tiles must be placed
within two minutes.</i>

865
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,724
<i>Once all players finish placing
their face tiles and first grass tiles,</i>

866
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,393
<i>round one ends.</i>

867
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,353
<i>Starting round two,</i>

868
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:45,776
<i>the grass tiles must touch
a player's territory on at least one side.</i>

869
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,071
<i>Once a tile is placed,
it may not be moved.</i>

870
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,906
There's no going back.

871
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,032
<i>When placing tiles,</i>

872
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,828
<i>they may not touch
other players' territory tiles.</i>

873
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,081
<i>Players may pay one Piece</i>

874
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,834
<i>to buy one grass tile.</i>

875
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,253
I shouldn't have given you my Piece.

876
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,047
<i>Players may only buy grass tiles</i>

877
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,592
<i>after all rounds are over.</i>

878
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,304
<i>And they may place the grass tiles
as they wish on the territory table.</i>

879
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:18,017
<i>There are squares on the table
that grant special benefits.</i>

880
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,312
<i>Players may receive special benefits</i>

881
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,773
<i>by placing tiles on the four spaces
surrounding said squares.</i>

882
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,904
<i>That square then becomes
part of the player's territory.</i>

883
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,448
<i>The tile exchange coupon square.</i>

884
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,618
<i>The player receives
one tile exchange coupon.</i>

885
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,746
<i>Tile exchange coupons may be transferred</i>

886
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,664
<i>and do not have to be used immediately.</i>

887
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,957
Transfer?

888
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,083
<i>The Piece square.</i>

889
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,211
<i>The player receives one Piece.</i>

890
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,797
-There are only two.
-That's a huge benefit.

891
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,798
<i>The stone square.</i>

892
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,969
<i>The player may place
one stone tile on any empty space.</i>

893
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,265
<i>Other tiles may not be placed
where the stone tiles are.</i>

894
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,727
<i>And stone tiles do not count
as any player's territory.</i>

895
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,895
You could block someone off.

896
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,356
-You use it to hinder others.
-<i>To remove stone tiles,</i>

897
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,900
<i>players must pay one Piece.</i>

898
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,487
Those stone tiles
will play an important role.

899
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,446
<i>The robbery square.</i>

900
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,575
<i>The player may choose
one tile from another player</i>

901
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,828
<i>and add it to their own territory.</i>

902
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:26,210
<i>Stone and robbery tiles
must be used immediately upon acquisition.</i>

903
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,963
<i>The game will last for nine rounds.</i>

904
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,924
<i>Once the game ends,
players will receive Pieces</i>

905
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,385
<i>based on the sizes
of the largest possible squares</i>

906
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,262
<i>in each player's territory.</i>

907
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,890
<i>A five-by-five square
will be the standard.</i>

908
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,518
<i>A six-by-six square
will be rewarded with one Piece.</i>

909
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,980
<i>A seven-by-seven square
will be rewarded with two Pieces.</i>

910
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,484
<i>And an eight-by-eight square
will be rewarded with three Pieces.</i>

911
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,402
Wow!

912
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,153
The bigger, the better.

913
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,655
You need to fill your territory.

914
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,700
<i>Players with four-by-four squares
or smaller</i>

915
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,827
<i>will be penalized.</i>

916
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,830
<i>Players with a four-by-four square
will have to return one Piece.</i>

917
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,125
<i>Players with a three-by-three square
will have to return two Pieces.</i>

918
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,713
<i>And players with a two-by-two square
will have to return three Pieces.</i>

919
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:16,176
<i>Players must create a territory square
that is at least five-by-five</i>

920
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,845
<i>to avoid being penalized.</i>

921
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:22,308
<i>In addition, the player with
the largest square</i>

922
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,602
<i>will receive three extra Pieces.</i>

923
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,771
<i>If multiple players end in a tie,</i>

924
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,481
<i>the extra Pieces are split evenly.</i>

925
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,152
<i>For example,
if two or three players end in a tie,</i>

926
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,113
<i>they will each receive one extra Piece.</i>

927
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,199
<i>If four or more players tie,
no extra Pieces will be given.</i>

928
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,411
Just like before.

929
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,413
<i>The results of today's main match</i>

930
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,499
<i>will determine the players
who will go to prison for the last time.</i>

931
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,542
The last time?

932
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,752
-The last time.
-<i>Starting tomorrow,</i>

933
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,587
<i>no players will go to prison.</i>

934
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,674
<i>Here are the 96 grass tiles</i>

935
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,344
<i>that will be used in Laying Grass.</i>

936
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,015
<i>The game will begin in 60 minutes.</i>

937
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,018
<i>Spend this time as you wish.</i>

938
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,186
This is Yeon-woo's game.

939
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,230
She's spent her whole life
taking over territory on a Go board.

940
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,191
The table looks like a Go board.

941
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:16,070
<i>Taking over special squares
worked just as it would in Go.</i>

942
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,696
This is the tile exchange square.

943
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,365
From the next five tiles...

944
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,908
You get to choose one.

945
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,242
You choose one.

946
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,119
-This is stealing.
-It's the robbery square.

947
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,829
You get to steal someone's tile.

948
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,581
This is a big one.

949
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,541
No one can place a tile around it.

950
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,918
This one gets you a Piece.

951
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,044
-You get a Piece.
-Yeah.

952
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,921
You're an expert in this.

953
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,674
-You made it here for a reason.
-It's like a Go board.

954
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,842
-Show us what you got.
-I'll try.

955
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,011
What if you turn into Genghis Khan?

956
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,388
It's similar to a Go board, right?

957
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,264
It's very similar.

958
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,557
-In Go,
-Right.

959
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,019
the corners offer the most efficient means
of expanding one's territory.

960
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,689
That's why the special squares here
aren't that special.

961
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,565
-They're not very good.
-They're good spots,

962
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,650
but the squares aren't special.

963
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,986
These are the most efficient spots
to build territory.

964
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,780
The worst spot is the center.

965
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,824
It's open,
so you're vulnerable to attacks.

966
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,534
-Right.
-So it's hard to build here.

967
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,954
-But the squares here are very special.
-There are a lot.

968
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,372
The order is crucial then.

969
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,541
Right. You need a lucky draw.

970
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,876
And you need a good strategy.

971
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,837
<i>The Piece square seems most appealing</i>

972
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,839
and most people will be drawn to it.

973
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,757
But it's located in the center.

974
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,176
I don't think

975
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,762
starting in the middle
will be an advantage.

976
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,888
I won't go home today.

977
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,266
-Why not?
-I won't go.

978
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,892
I'm determined.

979
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,977
Is someone inside?

980
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,564
I think the order is key.

981
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,815
You're right.

982
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,776
But that's out of our hands,
so put that aside for now.

983
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,321
Without any alliances, I don't think
anyone will be a target of attack.

984
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,992
Because in this game,
we need to push one player to victory.

985
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,245
I'll either try to make
a five-by-five square

986
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,247
-or a four-by-four.
-But...

987
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,587
Why did you guys stop talking?

988
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,672
We're just flustered.
We weren't talking about much.

989
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,091
-You like to play for yourself, right?
-Yeah.

990
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,260
Do you think
you can win with that strategy?

991
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,971
If two come together,
they can destroy one.

992
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,598
Three can destroy two.

993
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,183
So an alliance of three is best?

994
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,478
Instead of playing individually
in the main matches,

995
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:17,024
it's much more advantageous
to at least have secret alliances.

996
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,067
And something I've felt since yesterday

997
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,154
was that Seok-jin was much friendlier
towards me than I expected.

998
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,780
He even said he watches my videos.

999
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,282
The others must also be teaming up.

1000
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,451
Right, so if the others are doing that,

1001
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,537
we shouldn't play individually, should we?

1002
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,749
I'm not sure if teaming up
is the right move here.

1003
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,960
I think an alliance of unlikely people
would give us a competitive edge.

1004
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,587
Well, you're not unlikely.

1005
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,255
That's true.

1006
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,174
But they won't expect me
to team up with you two.

1007
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,551
-This is a really unlikely team.
-You and I as a team is unlikely.

1008
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,803
We make for a very unlikely team.

1009
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,140
Everyone thinks I have the most Pieces
and that I'm in a lot of alliances.

1010
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,392
So I'll take the biggest tiles possible

1011
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,103
and keep expanding my territory.

1012
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:59,233
Then everyone will attack me
and I'll attack them back.

1013
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,026
-He'll take all the damage for us.
-Exactly.

1014
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,236
And you two will expand.

1015
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,031
Then I'll help you
or Yu-min finish in first place.

1016
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:09,243
-And we'll share the extra Pieces.
-How will we place ourselves?

1017
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,911
-Let's discuss that.
-Okay.

1018
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,664
-We need to talk.
-Yeah, we do.

1019
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,083
-We haven't had time.
-We're due for a long talk.

1020
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,961
-Do you remember our first night?
-I do.

1021
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,755
It might not be a bad thing
to go to prison once.

1022
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,593
The sweetest honey is inside the hive.

1023
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,055
You had so many chances
to tell me but you didn't.

1024
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,139
About what?

1025
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,393
-The safe.
-Oh, right. But I had a reason for that.

1026
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,228
Seungkwan, Joon-bin, and I

1027
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,273
<i>had agreed to keep it a secret.</i>

1028
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,233
To be honest with you,

1029
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,235
I tried my best not to send you to prison

1030
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,279
<i>because you're my roommate.</i>

1031
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,197
<i>And I also helped you out.</i>

1032
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,032
Just as I helped you out with math,

1033
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,576
can you help me out?

1034
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:54,162
I'll do everything in my power to do that.

1035
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,122
Okay.

1036
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,207
<i>Yeon-woo said she'd help me this time.</i>

1037
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,042
So I'm accepting her offer.

1038
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,755
You need to get lucky
with the tiles for this game.

1039
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,632
Let's say there are tiles here.

1040
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,802
If you need tiles
in specific shapes to expand

1041
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,887
but you don't get them,
you can't fill that space.

1042
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,014
In this game,

1043
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,266
-You'd have to buy tiles.
-people with few Pieces will be done.

1044
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,851
Exactly, you need to buy tiles.

1045
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,854
We'll have to use Pieces
to fill our territories.

1046
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,982
Just focus on getting
a five-by-five square.

1047
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,318
The key here is we're open to attack.

1048
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,112
Just know I won't attack you.

1049
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,364
Same here.

1050
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:34,036
<i>ORBIT and I have a tight bond.</i>

1051
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,455
But at some point,
people need to get eliminated.

1052
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,457
So I need to steel my heart.

1053
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,334
<i>The time has expired.</i>

1054
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,002
<i>Please return to the main hall.</i>

1055
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,089
<i>First, the order
will be determined through a draw.</i>

1056
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,675
Joon-bin, please draw a ball.

1057
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,177
-Joon-bin, please.
-Please.

1058
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,803
Please draw nine!

1059
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,805
The balls all weigh differently.

1060
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,849
-Nine is the heaviest.
-Give me a one!

1061
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,392
Eight?

1062
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,229
-Joon-bin.
-Eight!

1063
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,648
-Joon-bin.
-Eight isn't bad.

1064
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,232
-Prepare to pay a Piece.
-It's fine.

1065
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,901
-Infinite Pieces.
-Dong-joo.

1066
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,194
-I got five.
-Five.

1067
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,695
-That's not bad.
-It's fine.

1068
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,738
Seven.

1069
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,281
Seven.

1070
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,491
Four. That's not bad.

1071
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,577
I'm not backing down anymore.

1072
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,539
-What is it?
-What is it?

1073
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,292
Nine?

1074
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:23,877
Seungkwan drew nine.

1075
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,337
I should've backed down.

1076
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,630
Two!

1077
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,091
-Yeon-woo, three.
-Three.

1078
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,259
-One!
-One!

1079
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:32,803
Six.

1080
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,103
<i>Round one begins now.</i>

1081
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,356
Here are your tile exchange coupons.

1082
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,691
Here is your coupon.

1083
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,695
See-won, please place a grass tile.

1084
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,448
Yeon-woo.

1085
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,950
Taking over the corners

1086
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,451
-will put us at an advantage.
-All right.

1087
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,869
-Is there a time limit?
-Two minutes.

1088
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,870
Really?

1089
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,708
{\an8}I'll start here
and expand in both directions.

1090
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,419
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

1091
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,713
Kyeong-rim, please place a grass tile.

1092
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,093
{\an8}I'm fourth, so I can take one corner.

1093
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,053
{\an8}You'll be off to a good start.

1094
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,266
{\an8}I will

1095
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,809
{\an8}use my tile exchange coupon.

1096
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,853
-Will you use your coupon?
-Yes.

1097
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,730
-Already?
-Which tile do you choose?

1098
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,106
The fourth one.

1099
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:31,027
-Tile exchange already?
-Kyeong-rim's bold.

1100
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,195
You're a risk taker.

1101
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,405
She took the fourth one?

1102
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,823
The ninth one wasn't too bad.

1103
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,949
It wasn't bad.

1104
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,909
The order doesn't really matter.

1105
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,620
-It might keep changing.
-Exactly.

1106
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,914
{\an8}-This isn't bad.
-It's all right.

1107
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,709
{\an8}-Are you finished?
-Yes.

1108
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,462
Yeon-woo, please place a grass tile.

1109
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,338
There are two corners left.

1110
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:54,509
The first four
are taking over the corners.

1111
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,513
-I guess I'll go for the middle.
-Yeon-woo.

1112
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,016
This is so unfair.

1113
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,521
-Look at her hand.
-Her posture is so elegant.

1114
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,107
-It's like a movie scene.
-It's a photoshoot.

1115
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,650
It's like watching
an actual Go game on TV.

1116
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,652
-I'll go with this.
-She's done.

1117
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,738
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

1118
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,531
-Seok-jin.
-I'll exchange tiles.

1119
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,074
-Will you exchange tiles?
-Yes.

1120
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,534
It's changing again.

1121
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,328
-Which tile will you choose?
-Seok-jin, come on.

1122
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,079
-This is fun.
-Which one did he take?

1123
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,873
-He took the ninth one?
-That's crazy.

1124
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,917
I'm taking the tenth one. That's not bad.

1125
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,376
Why waste coupons right away?

1126
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,131
Since I need access to many sides...

1127
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,341
I'll go with this.

1128
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,676
The corners are so much better.

1129
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,095
Dong-joo, please place a grass tile.

1130
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,181
Yeon-woo, should I place it here?

1131
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,350
Then everyone else can go this way.

1132
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,976
-This is better, isn't it?
-Yeah.

1133
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,061
I'll place it here.

1134
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,355
Yu-min, please place a grass tile.

1135
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,774
I choose from up to the sixteenth tile
if I use my coupon, right?

1136
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,026
-You may choose from what's here.
-Oh, okay.

1137
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,529
Why exchange
with such a good tile available?

1138
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,781
-Isn't that tile good?
-It's the best tile.

1139
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,282
Just do what you want.

1140
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,909
-It's your choice.
-No pressure.

1141
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,328
What's with everyone
trying to lecture her?

1142
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,663
Is this a classroom?

1143
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,081
There's a lot of lecturing.

1144
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,290
{\an8}Follow your dreams.

1145
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,793
Will you use your coupon?

1146
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,794
Please place your tile.

1147
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,922
Just avoid Yeon-woo on this side.

1148
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,800
That's a great tile.

1149
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,010
-Put it next to your tile.
-I'll go with this.

1150
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,888
-ORBIT, please place a grass tile.
-Okay.

1151
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,265
Who's going to attack me?

1152
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,474
You're going for the middle?

1153
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,560
-You are?
-Really?

1154
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,395
Are you serious?

1155
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,064
You want both of those squares.

1156
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,191
-That's an aggressive move.
-Go that way.

1157
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,235
-ORBIT.
-Go that way.

1158
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,362
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

1159
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,407
I admire your courage.

1160
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,366
Joon-bin.

1161
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,201
What do I do?

1162
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,953
If you come here, it's war.

1163
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,621
-If I go that way?
-Yeah.

1164
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:50,333
I'm going to expand toward Yu-min.

1165
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,211
If I go here, I'd have to
face Yeon-woo and that's more scary.

1166
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,338
Now that you mention it, it is.

1167
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,423
Don't come here.

1168
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,799
-Thirty seconds left.
-Don't come.

1169
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,342
You have thirty seconds left.

1170
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,635
Place it here, then go for that.

1171
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,803
-Go to the other side.
-You're right.

1172
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,391
-Are you finished?
-Good move, Joon-bin.

1173
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,144
Seungkwan, please place a grass tile.

1174
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,355
I'll use my tile exchange coupon.

1175
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,940
Which tile will you choose?

1176
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,694
{\an8}-I'll take tile 19.
-Please take it.

1177
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,197
How many tiles is that?

1178
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,617
Seungkwan.

1179
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,076
Your placement is invalid.

1180
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,829
-Right.
-It has to touch one side.

1181
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,247
{\an8}-Seungkwan.
-That's not bad.

1182
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,373
{\an8}Why?

1183
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,416
{\an8}-It's good.
-Move it back.

1184
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,501
{\an8}-They have to touch.
-Move it back.

1185
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,670
-Everyone's lecturing.
-So many kibitzers.

1186
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,298
-Move it back.
-Seungkwan, do what you want.

1187
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,383
-No, don't do that.
-If you do that, you're done.

1188
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,843
-Do that and you're dead.
-Don't do that.

1189
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:45,221
-I mean, if you're...
-Seungkwan, do what you want. Everyone!

1190
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,848
Seungkwan, do you want to go home?

1191
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,308
Go to your left.

1192
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,935
-No, go to your right.
-Go up.

1193
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,645
-Go the other way.
-Seungkwan.

1194
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,229
Go left. No, go right.

1195
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,773
-Stop!
-Left, right.

1196
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:55,899
-Go down.
-I'm going mad.

1197
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:56,942
That's a bad idea.

1198
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,902
-You have to fill in the other areas.
-Flip it the other way.

1199
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,654
-No...
-If you do that, you can't expand.

1200
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,072
Seungkwan, it's your choice.

1201
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,740
This is so funny.

1202
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,700
-I'm done.
-Are you finished?

1203
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,452
-I see you're going upwards.
-Good move.

1204
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,245
<i>Round two begins now.</i>

1205
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,414
See-won, please place a grass tile.

1206
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,916
That's amazing.

1207
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,793
-Here's what I think.
-What do you want to do?

1208
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,461
{\an8}I want to expand this way.

1209
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,130
{\an8}I need to take over
either of these squares to expand upwards.

1210
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,924
{\an8}I want to spread out this way.

1211
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,969
{\an8}I'm wondering if I should exchange my tile

1212
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,845
{\an8}or save it and just place that here.

1213
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,306
{\an8}If I were you,
I'd go for the robbery square.

1214
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,683
{\an8}-So...
-I'd do the same.

1215
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,934
{\an8}Either surround this

1216
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,477
{\an8}or surround this square.

1217
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,981
-This is a safe approach for you.
-What I'm thinking is

1218
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,316
if I exchange mine for tile 22,

1219
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,859
{\an8}I can expand my base up to here.

1220
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,361
{\an8}If you block this side,

1221
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,029
{\an8}they can come through here.

1222
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,281
{\an8}So you need to block this side.

1223
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,325
{\an8}-Is that a better move?
-Yeah.

1224
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,411
I think it'll be fine to exchange my tile.

1225
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,996
-You have one minute left.
-Okay.

1226
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,372
I'll use my coupon.

1227
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,790
Which tile will you choose?

1228
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,000
This one.

1229
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,751
It's hard to form plans

1230
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,670
because people keep changing things.

1231
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,630
I either do this or this.

1232
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,133
-She's going for the robbery square.
-She is.

1233
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,217
This is better.

1234
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,344
That's a great move.

1235
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,179
If you attack right away,

1236
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,849
you could have a hard time
in the later rounds.

1237
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,392
-Kyeong-rim.
-Yes?

1238
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,352
Thank you.

1239
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,813
Awesome.

1240
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,650
{\an8}-You have earned an exchange coupon.
-Okay.

1241
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,068
{\an8}-Here's your coupon.
-Thank you.

1242
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,740
I'm a pacifist, so I won't attack anyone.

1243
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,616
I'll attack if you attack me.

1244
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,411
Yeon-woo, please place a grass tile.

1245
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,662
I'll take this.

1246
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,375
It's better to go this way.

1247
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,418
Attack this side.

1248
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,296
You don't know much about Go, do you?

1249
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,215
-He doesn't want to be attacked.
-Take this square.

1250
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,301
Take that square.

1251
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,343
This would be better.

1252
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,762
That's a good move.

1253
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,846
-No, don't do that.
-That's good.

1254
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,598
She's not the type of person

1255
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,767
-who's easily swayed by others.
-She shouldn't.

1256
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,976
We were cellmates.

1257
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,479
She hasn't been to prison once
in her cushy life.

1258
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,813
Think about it.

1259
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,356
-Prison...
-No way.

1260
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,067
-Are you serious?
-This is crazy.

1261
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,860
She's a pro.

1262
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,404
I had no choice but to go here.
Come on, spare me.

1263
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,906
I'm here because I drew eight.

1264
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,783
Are you finished?

1265
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,034
-I'll do this.
-All right.

1266
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,452
I admire her courage.

1267
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,495
Seok-jin.

1268
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,122
I only exchanged mine for this tile
because it had one more square.

1269
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,707
Now I get a horrible tile.

1270
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,920
Seok-jin's tile placement is very good.

1271
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,129
I'm done.

1272
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,049
Seok-jin, you have earned
a tile exchange coupon.

1273
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,717
So that's how it works.

1274
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,677
{\an8}Here is your coupon.

1275
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:30,762
{\an8}Thank you.

1276
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,889
{\an8}Dong-joo, will you use your coupon?

1277
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,641
I want this tile.

1278
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,226
I'm going to play safe.

1279
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,394
I'll take over this square to start.

1280
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,897
Dong-joo, you have earned
a tile exchange coupon.

1281
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,065
{\an8}Thank you.

1282
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,942
I'm going to play safe.

1283
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,402
-Who's turn is it?
-Mine.

1284
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,280
I can place another straight tile here.

1285
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,366
-You're right. That would be good.
-Would it?

1286
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,409
-You'll be close to a five-by-five.
-You think so?

1287
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,954
-I'll exchange my tile.
-Will you use your coupon?

1288
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,497
Please take a tile.

1289
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,209
How should I place it?

1290
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,128
You could place it vertically.

1291
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,879
Take that Piece square.

1292
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,089
She can take that square.

1293
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,883
-Touch the square.
-It has to touch it.

1294
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,052
You're trying to take over three squares.

1295
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,303
I'd do the same thing.

1296
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,347
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

1297
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,515
Next, ORBIT.

1298
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,267
Please place a grass tile.

1299
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,434
This would be pointless.

1300
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,812
-Place it there.
-That's right.

1301
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,480
But the thing is...

1302
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,067
Shouldn't you surround this square
so you can get it?

1303
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,278
It's fine because Dong-joo
won't come this way.

1304
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,447
You trust Dong-joo that much?

1305
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,950
I'm not going to take that square
since ORBIT is.

1306
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,202
I'm not going to harm anyone.

1307
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,328
Yeon-woo.

1308
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,746
-Yeah?
-Come here.

1309
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,748
-Here's the thing.
-Okay.

1310
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,125
If he comes this way,

1311
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,586
wouldn't we be able to isolate him
if you and I surround him

1312
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,879
and strike with Seungkwan?

1313
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,591
-I'm saying we should attack first.
-Can we though?

1314
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,925
So we can have this area.

1315
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,969
We can block off this area.

1316
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,305
-That's a very offensive strategy.
-Right.

1317
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,640
If you pressure him from your side,

1318
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,933
we can isolate him.

1319
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,856
1 HOUR LATER

1320
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,316
You have earned a robbery square.

1321
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,317
I will take this.

1322
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,485
-Wow.
-Wow.

1323
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,071
See-won, you have earned a robbery square.

1324
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,242
I've always wanted to
face off against ORBIT.

1325
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,995
-Yeon-woo.
-Yeah?

1326
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,246
You ready to go home?

1327
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:04,559
