1
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,240
Hey Mario. Can't wait to get drunk?

2
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:54,003
Duck eggs for sale.

3
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:55,601
Hey there sexy.

4
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:59,175
Duck eggs.

5
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:00,385
Here comes Jun.

6
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:01,344
Duck eggs anyone?

7
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:03,179
Hey Jun give me some of that.

8
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,113
How many?

9
00:03:04,138 --> 00:03:07,559
Just one. Give me a soupy one.
Extra soupy.

10
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,186
Jun, please—

11
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:21,114
I want the 12th grader
fresh from the shower.

12
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:23,032
- Jun. Give me four eggs.
- Tomorrow at noon when

13
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:24,559
I get back from work.

14
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:27,053
Hi, my regular customer.
You said four?

15
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:28,246
Yeah.

16
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,256
Here you go.

17
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,985
The fourth egg's on me.

18
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,636
Thanks but I'll pay for it.

19
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:45,680
Please it will make me happy.

20
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:47,974
Thank you.

21
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:52,854
Jun, you sly old bastard!

22
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,815
You think you can charm
the pretty ones, huh?

23
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:59,143
Loan me three duck eggs
and I'll dance on your lap.

24
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,337
Tess, you're loose!

25
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:03,156
Screw you, asshole.

26
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:05,533
So it's true then?

27
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,830
Where's the money?

28
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:44,572
Well?

29
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,151
Wait.

30
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,295
Everyone paid up except
for Auntie Lolit.

31
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:00,932
She's asking if—

32
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,674
If what?

33
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:04,682
What?

34
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,338
What does she want?

35
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:14,221
No extensions,
she has to pay period.

36
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:18,627
Just do your job. Why do you
have to be nice to them?

37
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,073
Ben, my head hurts.

38
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:37,078
Ben, seriously!

39
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:40,414
You're so horny. You want
to do it every single night.

40
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,566
Got a problem? Huh?

41
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,879
You used to have your legs sprawled out,
by customers every night.

42
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,072
Huh?

43
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:50,565
Answer me.

44
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,361
What difference does it make? Well?

45
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,054
What's your problem?

46
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,769
Get in the mood.

47
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:23,326
Go ahead tell me how much I should
spend on my panties, too.

48
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:25,978
When did I ever give you shit about
how you spend your money?

49
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:28,714
Maybe it's better if we just split up.

50
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:33,069
That's your solution
to all our problems.

51
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:00,799
Hey, Emma.

52
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:02,916
I'll be right there ma'am.

53
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:07,295
Is my son there?

54
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,870
He rode out for work early.

55
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:15,729
Good man.

56
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,049
My son works hard.

57
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:29,284
Good day.

58
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:37,221
Who the hell are you?

59
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:40,932
I'm the new tenant.

60
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:46,285
Won't you come in?

61
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,948
No. I have other appointments.

62
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,851
- Try that on for size!
- This fits you.

63
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:54,919
I know right?

64
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:57,489
You'll wear it like this,
and then you'll leave this open…

65
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:14,580
I'll wash it.

66
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:16,565
You stink like shit!

67
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,221
Move away, you stink!

68
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,838
Father I've been wanting to leave Ben

69
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:45,080
but I don't want to
work at the bar again.

70
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:51,976
At least with Ben,
only one man is using my body.

71
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,330
Are you married?

72
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:56,272
No Father.

73
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:58,307
You are living in sin.

74
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:02,403
Father that's not—

75
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:04,010
How many years have
you been living together?

76
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:07,869
Still there?

77
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,502
Nevermind Father.

78
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:47,948
Let's go for another round.

79
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,867
I was stuck on that boat
for so long.

80
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:51,330
I'll pay you double.

81
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:52,828
Triple!

82
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,079
We'll see.

83
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:55,856
Which one tastes better?

84
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,417
This one?

85
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,336
Or this one?

86
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:06,133
This one is 2000 pesos.

87
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:09,470
- Shit.
- This one...

88
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:11,931
is 2500 pesos.

89
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,601
If you get both of them,

90
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,938
I'll give you a discount.
Take both for four thousand.

91
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:20,147
Including your pussy?

92
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:21,715
Five thousand.

93
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:32,618
Five thousand!

94
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,581
Did you wait long?

95
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,150
Not long.

96
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:40,042
Sorry I kept you waiting.
It's my client…

97
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:42,143
He wanted another round.

98
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:45,547
I thought he was going to
pay me in dollars.

99
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:50,229
Wish those sex-starved shitbags
paid more.

100
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,559
Here's five thousand.

101
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,104
I'll just add more tomorrow.

102
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:01,939
Sorry about this, Ems.

103
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:05,859
I made you dip into your savings.

104
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,768
That's okay.
No worries.

105
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:09,838
I can always just filch
from Ben's cashbox

106
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:12,620
since his loaning gig
is doing well.

107
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:16,385
Have you made up your mind
about leaving him?

108
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:19,010
He's going to kill you.

109
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,955
If he can find me.

110
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:28,100
You're wasted.

111
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,869
Leave me alone.

112
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:32,146
Ben.

113
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:38,642
I got fired.

114
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,899
His brother came back home
from Qatar.

115
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:45,983
He's taking over my taxi
from now on.

116
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:49,653
Doesn't he have two taxis
that he rents out?

117
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:53,548
He’s going to use the other one.
Screw all of them.

118
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:55,993
Son of a bitch.

119
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,657
Come here.

120
00:16:04,324 --> 00:16:05,784
Come here.

121
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,630
I said come here.

122
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:09,965
Cut it out!

123
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,368
- If you can just wait! The--
- Let go of that!

124
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:15,346
Damn it!

125
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:19,600
Ben, what the hell!
You smell disgusting!

126
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:21,894
- Stop it!
- You bitch?

127
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:25,731
Are you going to fight back?
You bitch!

128
00:16:25,773 --> 00:16:27,191
Are you going to fight back, too?

129
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:30,143
You're going to act like them?
Those assholes?

130
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:33,364
The things you're doing
to others...

131
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:34,948
Are you going to
do it to me too?

132
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,308
Get off of me!

133
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,410
Shut up!

134
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:46,335
Screw them and their taxis!
They can keep their taxi!

135
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:50,339
If they want to take my taxi!

136
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,107
No way!

137
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:54,259
Screw them!

138
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:19,960
Emma, this is all I can pay you.

139
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:23,947
It doesn't even cover the principal.
Please understand.

140
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:27,934
Miss Luis,  you know how strict
Ben is about these things.

141
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:30,816
Please I'm begging you.

142
00:22:30,841 --> 00:22:33,824
Also please could I borrow again?

143
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,059
I'm just in a tight fix right now.

144
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,340
I'll try.

145
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:41,499
Please just ask him for me.

146
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,327
That looks so good!

147
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,554
5-6!

148
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:38,705
- Pay up!
- Goddamn it, Emma!

149
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:40,373
I can barely scrape up enough
to buy real food.

150
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:41,500
What would I give you?

151
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:43,152
Pay up tomorrow.

152
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:44,720
I'll think about it.

153
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,880
This guy's drunk! He's drunk!

154
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:05,990
Ambo.

155
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,475
Pay up.

156
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,725
Your bills reek of fish!

157
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,920
Don't you wash your hands?

158
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:33,593
Are you trying to
run away from me?

159
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:35,870
You think you can run from me?

160
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:38,314
You never learn.

161
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:43,353
Were you going to leave me?
You think you can leave me?

162
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:44,646
What did I say?

163
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:47,045
I told you I'd kill you if you did.

164
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:53,670
So?

165
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:55,660
You wanna do this again?

166
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,044
That's the symbol of Sputnik.

167
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:42,904
You can't survive in that hole
if you don't have any friends.

168
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,255
How long were you in prison?

169
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:52,974
Three years.

170
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,621
Totoy Gulpi?

171
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,103
Who's this?

172
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:16,596
Sorry if I'm being too nosy.

173
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:18,521
No, no, it's alright.

174
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:26,748
They had that tattooed on me.

175
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:30,285
I had no choice. I was too weak
to fight back.

176
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,906
That time,

177
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,202
I was a new inmate.

178
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:41,794
So they gave me that nickname.

179
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:43,487
Totoy Gulpi.

180
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:46,956
Why?

181
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,527
Beating me up was their...

182
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:01,613
idea of fun.

183
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:07,638
Because I looked like a kid.

184
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:17,409
They raped me a couple of times too.

185
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,005
But I got back at those bastards.

186
00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:33,559
Now they can't call me a kid anymore.

187
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:35,450
Do you know why?

188
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:42,161
I brought in girls from outside.

189
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:44,007
For their…

190
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,673
recreational use.

191
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,123
The girls I brought in…

192
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,082
they were…

193
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:02,255
let's just say I knew them from
my days working at the bar.

194
00:33:02,738 --> 00:33:04,490
You were a pimp?

195
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,422
Something like that.

196
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:11,775
Eventually

197
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:15,490
I had a hard time
sneaking in more girls.

198
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,684
So what I did was

199
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:21,286
I would make the other
inmates put on dresses.

200
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:27,491
And shit, they went after them too.

201
00:33:32,474 --> 00:33:34,552
After that, I was untouchable.

202
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:39,814
I earned their confidence.

203
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,411
I earned their trust.

204
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:48,406
But more importantly

205
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:52,494
I got their respect.

206
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:28,113
I want to show you something.

207
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,303
But don't get mad,

208
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:36,822
Okay?

209
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,494
Get on.

210
00:36:35,198 --> 00:36:36,709
You're okay with it?

211
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:03,685
My name's Alfred, by the way.

212
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:07,521
I'm Emma.

213
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:11,568
Emma.

214
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,510
You're in the mood today.

215
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,502
I'll be okay with part time work.

216
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:42,945
- Back the hell up, man.
- Please, man.

217
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,513
Don't be too pushy.

218
00:40:44,538 --> 00:40:47,291
Here's what we'll do,
I'll text you if we got work for you.

219
00:40:47,316 --> 00:40:50,236
Now get going. I'm busy.

220
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,255
Thanks, Ems.

221
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:02,715
That's alright.

222
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,993
You seem happy.

223
00:41:06,154 --> 00:41:07,989
You have someone new.

224
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,394
Son of a bitch!

225
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,420
Tembong was executed.

226
00:46:57,445 --> 00:47:00,281
You guys run while you can!

227
00:48:03,403 --> 00:48:05,364
Wait, wait.

228
00:48:06,472 --> 00:48:08,390
What do you think?

229
00:48:12,728 --> 00:48:14,355
Turn around.

230
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:25,866
So sexy.

231
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,914
Ben doesn't let me
wear these kinds of clothes.

232
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:36,210
Oh yeah?

233
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:38,796
Alright.

234
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:41,590
I want you to wear that

235
00:48:41,674 --> 00:48:44,009
whenever you come to me.

236
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:32,683
Emma. Come here.

237
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,452
I saw Mrs. Ermie earlier.

238
00:49:53,037 --> 00:49:55,039
Told me she paid you yesterday.

239
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,375
Ah, I forgot to hand it over.

240
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,224
Are you stealing from me?

241
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,644
Come on, Ben.

242
00:50:16,685 --> 00:50:18,646
Stop that!

243
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:22,024
Stop picking a fight.

244
00:50:23,025 --> 00:50:25,569
Maybe you're seeing someone
behind my back?

245
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:31,200
Are you out of your mind?

246
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:34,328
One of your former customers?

247
00:50:37,347 --> 00:50:41,252
You bitch, leave me
and I'll kill you.

248
00:51:01,313 --> 00:51:03,983
Ben's getting suspicious.

249
00:51:06,277 --> 00:51:07,903
Ben?

250
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:10,965
So what now?

251
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,742
We should probably
meet up somewhere else.

252
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,044
I can look for a place.

253
00:51:16,745 --> 00:51:20,082
I've been wanting to leave Ben
for a long time, Alfred.

254
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,004
Take me away.

255
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:36,015
Are you sure?

256
00:51:46,066 --> 00:51:47,901
When do you want to leave?

257
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:49,987
Tomorrow.

258
00:51:50,029 --> 00:51:51,655
Tomorrow?

259
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:55,367
Please save me from that monster!

260
00:52:08,547 --> 00:52:10,132
Alright.

261
00:52:11,342 --> 00:52:14,011
I'll contact my uncle in Palawan.

262
00:52:14,094 --> 00:52:16,347
We can stay there in the meantime.

263
00:52:20,768 --> 00:52:22,686
Tomorrow night

264
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:28,233
I'll slip a sedative in that asshole's beer
to knock him out.

265
00:53:01,475 --> 00:53:03,000
Get me another one.

266
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:11,837
Do we still have sardines?
Open one for me.

267
00:54:11,879 --> 00:54:15,799
And where's the bottle?
Give me the bottle!

268
00:54:16,091 --> 00:54:17,509
Hurry up!

269
00:54:47,664 --> 00:54:49,374
The bottle.

270
00:55:30,516 --> 00:55:33,685
Heard about the demolition
in San Roque?

271
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:35,629
A riot ensued.

272
00:55:35,654 --> 00:55:36,880
Shit was thrown at them.

273
00:55:36,905 --> 00:55:39,102
Yeah! It rained shit.

274
00:55:59,361 --> 00:56:02,698
Ben, what the hell!
You're drunk again.

275
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,868
Didn't we talk about this?

276
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,621
- Cut it out!
- Just give in!

277
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:12,065
I told you to stop!

278
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:14,952
Stop it! You're always like this!

279
00:56:16,336 --> 00:56:19,172
You bitch.
You can't say no to me!

280
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:22,342
Come here. Come here!

281
00:56:22,384 --> 00:56:24,052
Cut it out!

282
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,014
Damn it.

283
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:32,060
Come here!

284
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:39,526
Ben?

285
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:04,926
Where do you think you're going
you piece of shit?

286
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:11,808
I've warned you.
Stubborn bitch.

287
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:13,577
What did I tell you, huh?

288
00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:16,855
What did I say?
What did I tell you?

289
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,566
Are you going to leave me?

290
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:21,485
You asshole!

291
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:23,654
Screw you!

292
00:57:23,945 --> 00:57:25,614
Screw you too!

293
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,078
You're a worthless husband!

294
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,580
You asshole!
You good-for-nothing piece of shit!

295
00:57:33,664 --> 00:57:35,499
You're a piece of shit!

296
00:57:47,415 --> 00:57:49,792
Screw you!

297
00:58:05,237 --> 00:58:08,573
You bitch!
You stabbed me, you bitch.

298
00:58:24,589 --> 00:58:26,438
Alfred!

299
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:29,528
I killed him. It was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

300
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:31,555
Calm down Emma! Emma!

301
00:58:31,596 --> 00:58:33,473
Emma listen to me!
Listen to me!

302
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:34,891
Emma listen to me!

303
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:36,893
Listen to me!

304
00:58:38,437 --> 00:58:41,064
Calm down! Listen to me!

305
00:58:41,106 --> 00:58:44,484
Emma listen to me!
Listen!

306
00:58:46,737 --> 00:58:48,447
Calm down.

307
00:58:50,323 --> 00:58:51,950
Calm down.

308
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:54,202
I'll take care of this.

309
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:56,288
Calm down.

310
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:03,754
Step back.

311
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:42,667
Thanks bro!

312
01:00:06,274 --> 01:00:09,402
Look at me. Listen to me.

313
01:00:09,694 --> 01:00:11,613
I will come back for you.

314
01:00:13,782 --> 01:00:15,659
Do you understand me?

315
01:00:22,499 --> 01:00:24,292
Stay calm.

316
01:02:04,142 --> 01:02:05,310
Emma.

317
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:07,812
- Just calm down.
- You scared me.

318
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:09,606
Emma it's just me.

319
01:02:20,784 --> 01:02:22,786
Let's get out of here.

320
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:25,205
Take me away.

321
01:02:27,207 --> 01:02:29,793
Emma, we can't leave yet.

322
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:33,088
It will look suspicious
if you just disappear.

323
01:02:33,113 --> 01:02:34,412
Do you understand me?

324
01:02:35,382 --> 01:02:37,550
So what are we going to do?

325
01:02:37,759 --> 01:02:40,053
I don't want to stay here anymore.

326
01:02:45,183 --> 01:02:48,520
We need to lay low for a while.

327
01:02:48,645 --> 01:02:51,940
And I can't stay here for long
someone might see us.

328
01:02:52,065 --> 01:02:53,608
Do you understand?

329
01:02:53,775 --> 01:02:55,527
What?

330
01:02:56,027 --> 01:02:58,694
Don't leave me. Please.

331
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,448
Emma.

332
01:03:03,368 --> 01:03:05,996
Just calm down okay?
You can do this.

333
01:03:09,082 --> 01:03:12,377
Don't leave me alone Alfred!

334
01:03:12,585 --> 01:03:14,713
I'm scared.

335
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:18,049
Stay calm.

336
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:22,929
Where is Ben's money?
Where does he keep it?

337
01:03:23,794 --> 01:03:25,443
I need it to pay for the car.

338
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:51,833
This should do.

339
01:03:56,796 --> 01:03:58,757
Emma listen to me.

340
01:04:00,008 --> 01:04:02,427
We can't see each other for now.

341
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:05,096
Do you understand?

342
01:04:05,805 --> 01:04:08,600
It's risky. Let's wait for things
to cool down.

343
01:04:12,437 --> 01:04:14,022
Come here.

344
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,025
You can do this.

345
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:20,695
- Don't worry.
- I'm scared.

346
01:04:22,363 --> 01:04:24,616
Don't be afraid.

347
01:04:24,824 --> 01:04:26,159
This will be over soon.

348
01:04:26,201 --> 01:04:28,828
I'll get you out of here.

349
01:04:37,462 --> 01:04:40,882
Alright. I have to leave.

350
01:04:53,186 --> 01:04:57,357
He hasn't come home since last night.
He's never done this before.

351
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:59,651
I know my son.

352
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:02,695
Something bad must've happened to him.

353
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:04,656
Do you know if he's made enemies?

354
01:05:04,697 --> 01:05:06,783
Could be one of

355
01:05:06,908 --> 01:05:10,286
the people who owes him money.

356
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:13,081
Give me their names.

357
01:05:13,123 --> 01:05:15,542
I'll confront them myself.

358
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:16,269
Damn it, Ben.

359
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,688
Don't scare me.

360
01:06:20,899 --> 01:06:23,318
Don't you dare haunt me,
you asshole.

361
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:38,416
Mother?

362
01:06:49,427 --> 01:06:52,555
I knew you had something
to do with this.

363
01:06:54,098 --> 01:06:56,184
Why did you say

364
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:58,728
that Ben would haunt you?

365
01:06:59,187 --> 01:07:01,981
Is my son dead? Huh?

366
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:05,610
Ah… no…

367
01:07:05,652 --> 01:07:11,616
I just thought that maybe
Ben's made a lot of enemies.

368
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:20,291
When Ben told me that
he would marry you...

369
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:22,293
I didn't allow it.

370
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:28,508
But he said

371
01:07:30,301 --> 01:07:32,220
if I get in the way

372
01:07:32,804 --> 01:07:34,805
he'd take you away
to live far from here.

373
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:43,836
So instead of losing my son,

374
01:07:48,444 --> 01:07:52,573
I settled for a whore for
a daughter-in-law.

375
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,832
"On one condition" I said

376
01:08:04,836 --> 01:08:08,715
that he must never marry you

377
01:08:11,509 --> 01:08:13,886
and that you must never
bear his children.

378
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:30,254
I know

379
01:08:32,822 --> 01:08:35,438
that you have something to do
with my son's disappearance.

380
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:39,782
Your shot, Lolit!

381
01:10:45,705 --> 01:10:47,915
Cheers to success!

382
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,419
Hey, man!
Come drink with us!

383
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:53,254
- Yeah, yeah, wait a sec.
- It's your shot!

384
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:54,714
It's Dave's birthday!

385
01:10:54,756 --> 01:10:57,989
Emma, come have a drink.

386
01:10:58,014 --> 01:10:59,887
You've been stuck
there for so long.

387
01:11:01,596 --> 01:11:05,099
Are you drunk?

388
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:10,121
Kaloy got caught in
a buy bust operation.

389
01:11:10,146 --> 01:11:11,439
That's his fault.

390
01:11:11,464 --> 01:11:13,925
Back to the cage for him.

391
01:11:52,764 --> 01:11:54,187
Alfred?

392
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,786
Alfred?

393
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,248
What?

394
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:14,252
I can't do this anymore.
I want to see you.

395
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,379
Damn it.

396
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:20,007
Emma, didn’t I tell you?
We can't be seen together.

397
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:21,842
Why can't you just wait?

398
01:12:27,807 --> 01:12:30,184
Look through the hole.

399
01:15:56,281 --> 01:15:58,659
Did she say where she was going?

400
01:15:58,802 --> 01:16:00,429
I know she has a gig
somewhere else.

401
01:16:00,454 --> 01:16:02,646
She said she needed extra cash.

402
01:16:04,248 --> 01:16:05,666
Okay thank you.

403
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,485
Sure take care!

404
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:10,696
Why is she looking for her?

405
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:12,723
She was asking about her friend.

406
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:22,541
Duck eggs, my favorite customer?

407
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:27,588
Okay. You're really sexy!

408
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:35,823
Alfred?

409
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:40,077
Emma what is it?

410
01:17:41,062 --> 01:17:41,912
Open up!

411
01:17:41,937 --> 01:17:43,968
Emma not now.
Come back another time.

412
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,041
Come on.

413
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,877
Damn it!

414
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:50,104
Emma, didn't I tell you
to wait?

415
01:17:50,129 --> 01:17:52,423
It's not a good time.
Someone might see you.

416
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:53,966
I can't take it anymore.

417
01:17:54,008 --> 01:17:55,134
Emma not now. Just go.

418
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:57,303
- Let me in.
- Emma next time. Next time.

419
01:17:57,344 --> 01:17:59,763
Emma I said not now.

420
01:18:01,783 --> 01:18:03,785
Son of a bitch!

421
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:06,186
What the... Son of a bitch!

422
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:08,397
What is this?

423
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:11,275
You were cheating on me?
Screw you!

424
01:18:11,317 --> 01:18:13,569
And with my friend?

425
01:18:13,611 --> 01:18:15,863
You useless pig!

426
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:17,031
Say something!

427
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,574
Calm down!

428
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:20,367
Let me explain.

429
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,244
Damn it.

430
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:25,539
There's another man.
He just left.

431
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,251
If you think I was the one who
slept with your friend you're wrong.

432
01:18:29,335 --> 01:18:32,463
- You pimped her?
- Yes! She told me she needed money!

433
01:18:32,687 --> 01:18:34,413
We need money too don't we?

434
01:18:35,341 --> 01:18:38,510
Sorry Emma.
I needed the money.

435
01:18:38,535 --> 01:18:42,062
And I gave Alfred his cut.

436
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:44,575
Thanks Alfred!

437
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,435
I'll go ahead.

438
01:18:56,195 --> 01:18:57,404
Bye!

439
01:19:00,509 --> 01:19:02,302
Come here.

440
01:19:03,077 --> 01:19:04,328
Sit down.

441
01:19:11,794 --> 01:19:13,796
We need the money don't we?

442
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:15,673
What do you want me to do?

443
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:18,554
This is my way of earning a buck.

444
01:19:20,987 --> 01:19:23,864
Why didn't you just tell me?
I have a little money saved.

445
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:27,643
Emma. That’s not enough
if we're moving to the province.

446
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:30,570
Your savings is nothing.

447
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:38,946
Collect more from Ben's debtors.

448
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,835
We'll need that money.

449
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,885
Are you just milking me for cash?

450
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:48,249
Why ask me that?
Am I trying to milk you for cash?

451
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:53,741
Did you seriously just ask me that?
I don't care about your money!

452
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:02,493
Tomorrow I'm leaving on my own.
I don't need you anymore.

453
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:04,388
Emma!

454
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:12,021
Say that again?

455
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:17,234
I'm leaving on my own.
I don't need you anymore!

456
01:20:17,393 --> 01:20:20,546
- You think you can survive?
- I can.

457
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:22,085
You'll go to jail.

458
01:20:23,966 --> 01:20:25,217
I will personally go to the police

459
01:20:25,242 --> 01:20:26,910
and tell them you killed
your husband!

460
01:20:26,935 --> 01:20:29,304
Don't mess with me, you bitch!

461
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:32,516
Then do it. You'll go to jail too
because you helped me.

462
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:34,293
If I go to jail then so be it.

463
01:20:34,318 --> 01:20:37,113
You think I'm scared of prison?

464
01:20:37,138 --> 01:20:39,849
What do you take me for?
A coward?

465
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,885
I'm used to being locked up Emma.

466
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:50,517
You're a monster! You asshole!
You monster!

467
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:53,979
Son of a bitch…
you monster!

468
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:56,356
You worthless son of a bitch!

469
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,610
You're such a goddamn asshole!

470
01:21:05,282 --> 01:21:07,076
Are you done?

471
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:19,505
You can come back.

472
01:21:20,798 --> 01:21:22,674
Just watch yourself.

473
01:21:24,009 --> 01:21:27,054
And don't even try to escape.

474
01:21:28,555 --> 01:21:32,226
Because we both know that
I can find you right?

475
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:41,276
Tomorrow morning collect the money,
and bring it straight to me.

476
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,863
No skimming off, okay?

477
01:21:45,572 --> 01:21:47,199
Are we clear?

478
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:53,247
Just be calm.

479
01:21:53,272 --> 01:21:56,025
You're too— oh?

480
01:21:56,815 --> 01:21:58,400
What's the matter?

481
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:04,800
You think I'm gonna hurt you?

482
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:10,305
I don't hit girls.

483
01:23:01,616 --> 01:23:03,327
Is this all you collected?

484
01:23:09,124 --> 01:23:11,835
Don't think you're off the hook.

485
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:16,530
I've hired a detective to look into
the disappearance of my son.

486
01:23:27,445 --> 01:23:29,072
Hey, my favorite customer!

487
01:23:29,444 --> 01:23:31,577
You haven't been buying
duck eggs from me.

488
01:23:33,102 --> 01:23:37,064
Damn you Jun.
You horny old man.

489
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:38,894
Give me my change.

490
01:23:38,936 --> 01:23:40,187
I already gave it to you.

491
01:23:40,212 --> 01:23:43,298
No you haven't.
Don't run off with my change Jun.

492
01:24:24,762 --> 01:24:26,973
Sorry for the delay.
Just wait a little longer.

493
01:24:28,877 --> 01:24:31,505
Perfect timing Ems.

494
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,718
Nice outfit.
Gotta talk to you.

495
01:24:34,017 --> 01:24:35,476
Boss.

496
01:24:38,721 --> 01:24:40,491
I need your help.

497
01:24:41,899 --> 01:24:44,235
Dina won't be able to make it

498
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:45,803
because she's sick.

499
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:48,297
Maybe you could fill in for her?

500
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:52,217
Ems, come on.
This guy's loaded.

501
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:54,445
We'll charge him extra.

502
01:24:54,794 --> 01:24:58,130
I saw his car parked downstairs.

503
01:24:58,815 --> 01:25:01,526
I've never seen a ride that badass.

504
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:04,282
We've hit the jackpot.

505
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:08,233
Come here.

506
01:25:10,394 --> 01:25:12,063
What's the problem?

507
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:16,218
Emma. You’re a whore
and you’re used to this right?

508
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:17,578
Yes or no?

509
01:25:17,672 --> 01:25:19,966
Yes or no? Answer me!

510
01:25:20,594 --> 01:25:22,763
- Yes.
- See?

511
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,615
Do you want to go to jail?

512
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,900
I bet you don't.

513
01:25:39,076 --> 01:25:41,390
- Are you still in school?
- Yeah.

514
01:25:42,374 --> 01:25:43,874
Why are you doing this?

515
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,808
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- I do.

516
01:25:48,304 --> 01:25:50,723
But I can't do these things to her.

517
01:25:53,539 --> 01:25:54,749
What the hell!

518
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:57,644
Not too fast.

519
01:27:32,387 --> 01:27:34,764
When did you last sin?

520
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:43,278
When did you last sin?

521
01:28:59,066 --> 01:29:00,693
Alfred?

522
01:29:06,603 --> 01:29:08,105
Mother?

523
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:44,044
You can hold me.

524
01:29:45,057 --> 01:29:46,725
I'm not a ghost.

525
01:29:49,268 --> 01:29:52,313
Ben. Forgive me Ben.

526
01:29:52,338 --> 01:29:54,298
Were you surprised?

527
01:29:56,584 --> 01:29:59,661
Want me to get you something to eat?

528
01:30:00,114 --> 01:30:02,783
You look tired from a long trip.

529
01:30:02,808 --> 01:30:04,142
Yes.

530
01:30:05,173 --> 01:30:06,966
Back from hell.

531
01:30:13,388 --> 01:30:15,139
I need a change of clothes.

532
01:30:17,566 --> 01:30:19,985
I'll get you fresh clothes.

533
01:30:40,576 --> 01:30:43,746
I'm surprised you haven't
thrown away my stuff.

534
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:02,232
You've gotten sexier.

535
01:31:08,097 --> 01:31:09,766
Makes sense.

536
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:14,391
It's not like you haven't replaced me.

537
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:17,795
Ben what happened?

538
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:20,522
How did you?

539
01:31:20,547 --> 01:31:23,967
What do you mean "What happened?".
You tell me.

540
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:25,543
Right?

541
01:31:27,842 --> 01:31:30,178
Forgive me.

542
01:31:41,365 --> 01:31:43,075
Don't worry.

543
01:31:44,877 --> 01:31:49,507
I'll forgive you. Do you hear me?
I'll forgive you.

544
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:55,599
I just want you to do something for me.

545
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:58,002
You understand?

546
01:32:05,194 --> 01:32:07,322
Call your lover.

547
01:32:09,487 --> 01:32:10,947
Call your lover.

548
01:32:10,972 --> 01:32:13,050
He's not going to come.

549
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:23,616
You'll find a way won't you?

550
01:32:23,827 --> 01:32:25,704
Find a way.

551
01:32:27,179 --> 01:32:29,014
Entice him.

552
01:32:30,954 --> 01:32:32,747
Do it with him.

553
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:37,891
And then while you're doing it,

554
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:39,726
kill him.

555
01:32:39,768 --> 01:32:41,895
I don't want to go to jail please.

556
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,215
I will be watching.
Do you understand?

557
01:32:45,802 --> 01:32:48,180
Of course you're going to jail.

558
01:32:48,372 --> 01:32:52,005
You really are going to jail
for what you did to me.

559
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:56,493
You and your lover
tried to murder me.

560
01:33:01,151 --> 01:33:02,902
I know but

561
01:33:04,073 --> 01:33:06,575
I'd rather go to jail for that
than for killing Alfred.

562
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,603
You won't go to jail.

563
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:12,261
Just do as I say.

564
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:15,392
What you will claim is

565
01:33:15,467 --> 01:33:17,177
he broke in

566
01:33:17,202 --> 01:33:19,496
and tried to rape you.

567
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,348
Understand?

568
01:33:23,412 --> 01:33:25,980
Nobody's going to believe that.
Nobody.

569
01:33:26,005 --> 01:33:29,842
It's your choice.

570
01:33:31,163 --> 01:33:33,165
Either you'll both go to jail,

571
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:35,365
or you'll do what I say.

572
01:33:45,492 --> 01:33:48,623
We can go back to the way
we used to be.

573
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:51,418
Just the two of us.

574
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,720
Before you ruined our lives.

575
01:34:54,168 --> 01:34:55,711
Call him.

576
01:34:57,167 --> 01:35:00,045
Make him come here,
tell him you need help.

577
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:07,588
Alfred!

578
01:35:10,126 --> 01:35:11,586
Alfred!

579
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:13,950
Help me!

580
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:16,206
Alfred!

581
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:17,903
Alfred!

582
01:35:17,928 --> 01:35:19,763
Help me!

583
01:35:26,184 --> 01:35:28,478
You ass.

584
01:35:30,705 --> 01:35:32,164
Alfred!

585
01:35:32,675 --> 01:35:34,635
Help me!

586
01:36:03,739 --> 01:36:06,283
What? What is it?

587
01:36:06,599 --> 01:36:07,600
What's going on?

588
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:10,962
Sorry Alfred.
I just missed you.

589
01:36:18,945 --> 01:36:22,323
Pretty horny for me,
are you?

590
01:36:23,116 --> 01:36:24,575
Huh?

591
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:48,308
Son of a bitch.

592
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:52,700
The hole?

593
01:37:04,853 --> 01:37:06,438
Is that it?

594
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:16,961
This bitch.

595
01:37:17,061 --> 01:37:18,562
You naughty girl.

596
01:37:57,835 --> 01:38:00,129
You slut.
You want it, huh?

597
01:38:00,171 --> 01:38:01,672
You really want it?

598
01:39:37,313 --> 01:39:38,814
Ben is here.

599
01:39:42,039 --> 01:39:44,859
- What?
- He's here watching.

600
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:48,571
That guy's dead.

601
01:39:55,578 --> 01:39:57,705
He'll kill you.

602
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:25,066
You bastards!

603
01:40:30,228 --> 01:40:32,114
You monsters!

604
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:35,201
You both deserve this!

605
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:38,913
This is for all of the filth
both of you dragged me through!

606
01:40:38,955 --> 01:40:41,040
You both deserve to die!

607
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:43,542
Go to hell!

608
01:40:43,584 --> 01:40:45,127
Shit!

609
01:40:50,633 --> 01:40:52,718
Kill each other!

610
01:41:14,407 --> 01:41:16,325
You son of a bitch!

611
01:41:28,671 --> 01:41:31,299
Screw you both!

612
01:44:43,073 --> 01:44:46,911
There's free food at the center.

613
01:44:48,051 --> 01:44:51,721
Jojo, go to the center.
Bring a large container.

614
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:56,962
Loan me a kilo of rice.
I'll pay later.

615
01:44:57,072 --> 01:45:01,175
Your debt is adding up. Okay.
Ask utoy to pick up the rice.
