1
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:33,495
(Everyone has a door to their hearts.)

2
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:39,025
(A friend who opened the door to my heart)

3
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:41,834
He always treats me genuinely,

4
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:43,965
so I get to open up about my worries.

5
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,564
She gives me strength without saying a word.

6
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,475
He is so thoughtful toward others.

7
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:50,475
I'm thankful to her in many ways.

8
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:53,275
I always wonder if he's doing okay.

9
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,215
She always has a smile on her face.

10
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:56,885
It's so fun to hang around with her.

11
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:58,815
He's someone I look forward to meeting again.

12
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,854
(Now, my friend tries...)

13
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,584
(to knock...)

14
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:06,685
(on another door.)

15
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:21,803
Hello?

16
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:22,941
Hello?

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,081
Don't you want to find love?

18
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:28,111
What? What is this all of a sudden?

19
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,751
I want to introduce you to some people.

20
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,451
How about a blind date?

21
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,420
- A blind date?
- What is this?

22
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,661
Who is she?

23
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:41,661
Literally, a genuinely good person.

24
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,161
Do you mean it?

25
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:45,201
Really? Can I get my hopes up?

26
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:48,470
I genuinely think it's a good idea.

27
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:49,500
You trust me, don't you?

28
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,141
I'm the guarantor right now.

29
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,401
I'll trust you.

30
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,511
Be real about it.

31
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,871
Really?

32
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:57,441
My goodness.

33
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,781
I'm suddenly so nervous.

34
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,680
(Will my friend be able...)

35
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,950
(to open the door to love?)

36
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:09,221
I'm so curious.

37
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:11,190
- The opening made me flutter.
- Right?

38
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:12,620
- Yes.
- I'm curious.

39
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:14,130
It's heart-fluttering.

40
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:15,261
Gosh. It's so...

41
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,430
It's so heart-fluttering. What now?

42
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,630
- I'm so excited.
- I'm so nervous.

43
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:21,770
I'm not nervous about filming,

44
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,901
- but about my friend.
- Yes. About watching my friend.

45
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:26,800
- I'm so curious.
- In fact, I couldn't sleep.

46
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:28,210
There hasn't been a show like this.

47
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:29,540
- Right. It's heart-fluttering.
- Yes.

48
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,380
By the way, nice to meet all of you.

49
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,740
(The lovebuds, love buddies, have gathered for the first time.)

50
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:34,110
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

51
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,510
Nice to meet you. Hello.

52
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:37,620
We're going to watch our friends...

53
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,551
- with the same intention.
- Yes.

54
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:41,121
I'm nervous.

55
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,561
That's true.

56
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,321
Hello.

57
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:48,260
My friend looks like Gong Yoo.

58
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:49,430
- Please send...
- Really?

59
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:51,230
- some love to my friend.
- Gosh. You surprised me.

60
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:53,031
- Does he really look like Gong Yoo?
- Really?

61
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,670
- This is a lovebud, Cho Sae Ho.
- Really?

62
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:56,971
Nice to meet you.

63
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,540
Do you have a friend who looks like Gong Yoo?

64
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,770
- I tell you slowly.
- Why didn't you set me up with him?

65
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:03,540
- I'll tell you slowly...
- Exactly.

66
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,180
- about him.
- Sounds good.

67
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:06,210
Okay.

68
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:07,380
Okay. Hello.

69
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:10,551
I'm here to help my friend get married.

70
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:12,180
- He means it.
- He's serious about it.

71
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:13,790
I'm Kim Nam Hee. Nice to meet you.

72
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,451
(Kim Nam Hee, his wish is for his friend to get married)

73
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:18,160
I believe the game of love requires strategies.

74
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm Lee Gwan Hee, a strategist.

75
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:21,391
(Lee Gwan Hee, a love strategist, former dating show cast)

76
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,401
I block the shots, but I never block love.

77
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,170
I'm Kim Young Kwang, a lovebud. Nice to meet you.

78
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,871
(Kim Young Kwang, always welcoming the shot of love)

79
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,141
Playing hard to get? Behave yourself.

80
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm going to introduce you to my model-like friend.

81
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,741
I'm a lovebud, Ji Ye Eun.

82
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:38,240
Everyone, I just know it all by looking at the eyes.

83
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,251
I'm Mi Joo, a lovebud and flirt radar.

84
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:44,650
Okay. Hello, everyone.

85
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,250
- I'm looking for a future family.
- What?

86
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:49,421
I'm Hur Young Ji, a lovebud.

87
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,221
- Is it your little sister?
- What?

88
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:55,530
My dream is to host my friend's wedding.

89
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,501
- I'm Kang So Ra, a lovebud.
- Yes.

90
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:00,600
- She's hot.
- Yes. She's awesome.

91
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,270
For the last three months,

92
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:04,370
I've been looking through my phone.

93
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,270
- Totally.
- Yes. I agree.

94
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,370
But I had only one person in my mind.

95
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,070
Of all my friends,

96
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:11,780
she was the only one who was a perfect fit.

97
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:12,781
- Really?
- Yes.

98
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,551
- Is that friend here?
- Yes.

99
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,110
You can look forward to seeing her.

100
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:18,350
I thought of this guy right away too.

101
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,721
- Really?
- He's my friend.

102
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:24,420
Can you give us a little hint about this friend of yours?

103
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:25,860
- I'm so curious.
- Me too.

104
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:27,490
- I live in Mapo-gu.
- Okay.

105
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:28,961
He's a friend from the neighborhood.

106
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,500
I call him an aristocratic gentleman from Mapo-gu.

107
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,630
- "A gentleman." - I see.

108
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,131
- An aristocratic gentleman?
- An aristocratic gentleman. Yes.

109
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,630
He must be classy.

110
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:39,800
By the way, are the friends of Young Kwang and Gwan Hee...

111
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,410
athletes?

112
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:42,870
- That's possible.
- Are they athletes?

113
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:44,710
I wondered who could be on the show...

114
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:47,610
and gain a lot of popularity, like I did.

115
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:49,010
- I looked for the right person.
- The wildcard

116
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:51,451
- He's buff like me. Yes.
- Gosh.

117
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:53,320
- "Like me." - Like me, he's a bit...

118
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:55,291
- "Like me." - He keeps saying, "like me."

119
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:57,260
- My friend resembles...
- "Like me."

120
00:04:57,261 --> 00:05:00,260
- Kim Woo Bin.
- Woo Bin is totally my type.

121
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:01,360
- Really?
- He's my dream guy.

122
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,660
When you watch this, you might fall in love with him.

123
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,160
I should be there.

124
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:07,130
Kim Woo Bin is my dream guy.

125
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,801
- I'm curious about So Ra's friend.
- Right.

126
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,571
- What will that person be like?
- My friend is so...

127
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,170
She looks like someone out of a Taiwanese movie.

128
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,241
"Taiwanese?"

129
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:16,840
- With a first-love vibe?
- You can tell, can't you?

130
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:18,710
- Someone with first love vibes?
- Goodness.

131
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:19,810
- Pure and innocent.
- Goodness.

132
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,710
Like the female lead of a teen romance movie.

133
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:22,781
- Very demure.
- Gosh.

134
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:24,550
- No.
- Amazing.

135
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,620
Ye Eun, what kind of person is your friend?

136
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:26,850
Whenever...

137
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:28,620
- my friend passes by, - Yes?

138
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,651
people think she's a model.

139
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:30,960
- Seriously.
- Is she not?

140
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:32,890
No. Wherever she goes,

141
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,590
she turns heads.

142
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,090
- People notice her.
- Really?

143
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:37,660
She looks like a model when she walks by.

144
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,230
- She must be well-proportioned.
- She has amazing proportions.

145
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:41,201
- She has amazing proportions.
- Really?

146
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:42,271
- Goodness. She's in trouble.
- I'm curious.

147
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,340
- My poor friend.
- Same.

148
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:45,440
My poor friend.

149
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:47,470
- So far, we've mentioned Gong Yoo.
- Yes.

150
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:49,570
- Kim Woo Bin, Song Joong Ki.
- Kim Woo Bin, yes.

151
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,780
Gong Yoo. We've mentioned a lot of people.

152
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:52,710
- It's going to get wild.
- I'm excited.

153
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:53,910
Starting today,

154
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,810
- will we be called "Lovebuds?" - That's right.

155
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,880
Lovebud means...

156
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:59,521
buddies who help their friends find love.

157
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:00,890
It’s “love” and “buddy” put together.

158
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:02,590
- This is exciting, right?
- I'm full of anticipation.

159
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:04,660
So the eight of us each vouched for...

160
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,660
our friends who are genuinely good people.

161
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,960
- Yes.
- And for 5 nights and 6 days,

162
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,101
they went looking for love on Geoje Island,

163
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:14,100
- "Geoji Island." - famous for its beautiful sea.

164
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:15,230
A lot can happen...

165
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,600
- in 5 nights and 6 days.
- Right.

166
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:18,440
- Seriously.
- Like what?

167
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:20,240
- Anything.
- Anything.

168
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,810
- I don't know.
- I hope that during that time...

169
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:23,910
- there was rain.
- Gosh.

170
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:25,040
- I don't know what you mean.
- There should have been rain.

171
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,080
- Yes, there should have.
- For moisture.

172
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,110
- I want to start watching now.
- Rain is necessary.

173
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:30,350
What kind of good people showed up?

174
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:31,920
Did any of them...

175
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:33,251
knock on my friend's heart?

176
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,920
Let's go meet everyone.

177
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,090
- I'm excited.
- Knock, knock.

178
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,291
- That's cute.
- Knock, knock.

179
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,660
(Now, the genuinely good people's first meeting begins.)

180
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:42,791
Is this Geoje Island?

181
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,740
(Episode 1. Meet My Friend)

182
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:53,941
Goodness.

183
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:55,311
- I'm nervous.
- This is amazing.

184
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,620
- Someone's here.
- Who is that?

185
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:08,621
Who's that?

186
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,960
- She's so demure.
- Who is that?

187
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,191
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

188
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:14,291
She's very demure.

189
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,561
- What?
- What?

190
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:21,431
(Gosh)

191
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:25,041
I should watch my step and keep an eye out for stones.

192
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:37,281
(Mi Joo's friend, Lee Da Hye)

193
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:41,020
Wait. Mi Joo. That's your friend, right?

194
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:42,050
- What? Is she right, Mi Joo?
- Right?

195
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,220
- She's speechless right now.
- Anyone can guess...

196
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,560
- That’s your friend.
- Everyone will agree she belongs…

197
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:47,120
- in a sports drink commercial.
- Right.

198
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:49,060
- She's pretty.
- She's so pretty.

199
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:50,160
She's so pretty, right?

200
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,830
- She's so pretty.
- Her smile is so pretty.

201
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,230
- She's so pretty.
- Oh, my gosh.

202
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,801
She's really pretty.

203
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:58,341
Hello. I'm Mi Joo's friend, Lee Da Hye.

204
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,740
Her strength is... Your strength is...

205
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,611
- You're not wearing mascara, right?
- No, I'm not.

206
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:04,440
You're not wearing mascara. You're not wearing eyeliner.

207
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:05,611
This is just her face.

208
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:06,911
That's her strength.

209
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:08,210
It's rare.

210
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,881
It's rare for people to be this naturally pretty.

211
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,881
- Da Hye recently got a haircut.
- I see.

212
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:13,421
I don't get why she did it.

213
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,590
- Did she get a bob?
- Yes. She's pretty with a bob.

214
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:17,021
But she's much prettier with long hair.

215
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:21,360
She's so pretty with a bob, though.

216
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:23,331
She is, but she's insanely pretty with long hair.

217
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:26,531
We met at an academy.

218
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:28,200
We didn't start it,

219
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:29,731
but somehow we became known as rivals.

220
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,441
- The two of you?
- Yes.

221
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,471
We were supportive of each other.

222
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:34,671
We were...

223
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:37,281
learning from each other.

224
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,041
This may sound a bit corny,

225
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,450
but I do feel a sense of respect.

226
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,950
I'm not sure I'd be capable of doing that.

227
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:45,280
- Da Hye said the same thing?
- She did.

228
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,381
Da Hye.

229
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,121
Don't use this footage.

230
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:51,020
I mean...

231
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:52,391
(Who was more popular?)

232
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,331
She's covering her mouth as she smiles.

233
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:58,061
What's really interesting is...

234
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:00,871
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this myself,

235
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,901
but Da Hye and I...

236
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:04,240
were the top two.

237
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:05,771
(We were the top two.)

238
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,811
(The self-proclaimed prettiest duo)

239
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:13,810
I can totally see that.

240
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:15,210
- Bold of you to say that yourself.
- Hey,

241
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,450
you're making me feel embarrassed on your behalf.

242
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:17,621
- You must be embarrassed.
- I can totally see that.

243
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:19,720
(Wink)

244
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:20,920
(What is a trait you'd want to steal from each other?)

245
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:23,420
- There are so many.
- Her femininity is so attractive.

246
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:24,661
She's so pretty.

247
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:27,791
(Laughing)

248
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:30,361
Girl, stop it.

249
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:31,900
(Da Hye is a genuinely good person...)

250
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,531
(with such enviable qualities.)

251
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:35,201
Is this it?

252
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:43,611
I'm the first one here.

253
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,061
I'm a bit nervous.

254
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,190
She's nervous. Da Hye!

255
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,631
It must be so nerve-racking to be there.

256
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,630
- Oh, my gosh.
- She's nervous and excited.

257
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,970
Why am I excited?

258
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:12,541
Da Hye, I'm sorry you're there by yourself.

259
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,240
- That's actually the time when...
- I should call her.

260
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,870
- Right.
- you feel the most awkward.

261
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:17,311
- It's a guy.
- Someone's coming.

262
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:19,111
Gosh, it's a guy.

263
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:20,381
Look at his hand tensing up.

264
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:22,450
(The second genuinely good person)

265
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:23,780
Goodness, it's a guy.

266
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:26,051
Look at his hand tensing up.

267
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:27,721
Goodness.

268
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:29,090
- Gosh.
- It's just for show.

269
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:30,250
- It's just for show.
- It's just for show?

270
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:31,561
That hand. Who is he?

271
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:36,830
Oh, my goodness!

272
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:38,161
(Nam Hee's friend, Oh Hyun Jin)

273
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,061
Oh, my goodness!

274
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:42,771
Why is he being so cheesy?

275
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:45,370
- That's amazing.
- Goodness.

276
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:47,440
The way his hand tensed up as he was walking.

277
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:49,671
Did you see that?

278
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:52,311
His eyes were looking upward too.

279
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,350
Gosh, like Song Joong Ki.

280
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,180
The aristocratic gentleman from Mapo-gu.

281
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:57,210
He gives off that aristocrat vibe.

282
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:58,281
Goodness.

283
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:01,120
Hello, my name is Oh Hyun Jin.

284
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:02,291
Nice to meet you.

285
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:05,421
We've been friends for 20 years.

286
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:07,961
We call each other once a day.

287
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:10,530
"What are you up to? Let's meet up."

288
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,431
And we just hang out.

289
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:14,200
(Nam Hee will follow his best friend anywhere,)

290
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:15,571
(wherever he goes, including...)

291
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:17,440
Do you want something to drink?

292
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:18,501
(Hyun Jin's pre-production meeting with the staff.)

293
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,140
Were you there as his manager?

294
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:22,570
- You're like his manager.
- Really?

295
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:24,341
I say he looks like Kwon Oh Joong to tease him.

296
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:25,781
And Javier Bardem.

297
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:28,011
He's such a good person.

298
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,180
He's always considerate,

299
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:30,380
kind, well-mannered.

300
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,720
You see how he smiles with his eyes?

301
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:33,480
(Hyun Jin was barely able to say anything.)

302
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:34,690
(The production staff suddenly had a question.)

303
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:36,250
Does your agency know you're here?

304
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:37,391
No, they don't.

305
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:42,061
He's very caring.

306
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:44,430
He's quick to help clean something off people. Even guys.

307
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,430
With his friends too.

308
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:48,070
- He wipes spots off too.
- Wait.

309
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:49,671
I've been wanting to get this off you.

310
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:51,500
Stop it.

311
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,900
(Sometimes, Hyun Jin's affection can be a little too much for Nam Hee.)

312
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,470
He's so nice, even to his guy friends.

313
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:55,611
He keeps his house neat and tidy too.

314
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,411
He's also interested in cooking.

315
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:58,540
He's good at grilling steak.

316
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,941
- Gosh.
- I see.

317
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:01,250
(He's ready for marriage.)

318
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:02,951
I think so.

319
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,920
Because...

320
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:06,151
he owns his own place.

321
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,991
He owns his own place.

322
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,220
He owns more than one place...

323
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:11,591
in Seoul.

324
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,021
Ten?

325
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,961
These days, it's hard to even own one home.

326
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:17,230
He has it all.

327
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,331
(He's a genuinely good person who has it all.)

328
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:22,671
They'll see each other soon.

329
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,240
They look good together.

330
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:25,471
- Oh, my gosh.
- They look good together.

331
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:32,141
- Hello.
- Hello.

332
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:33,941
Nice to meet you.

333
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:37,011
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

334
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:39,051
Gosh.

335
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:43,651
Gosh, that's hot.

336
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:46,221
What?

337
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:47,390
Gosh, that's hot.

338
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,130
- Why would you say that?
- That's hot.

339
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:50,191
Your bottom.

340
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:51,930
That's so hot.

341
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:53,930
- Are you okay?
- Sit here. It's not hot over here.

342
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:55,101
- You sure?
- Yes.

343
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,470
- We just met so...
- Well...

344
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,941
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.

345
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:03,840
Why didn't he sit next to her?

346
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:05,781
She offered.

347
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,011
- I'm glad you're here.
- Why?

348
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,920
- Were you...
- I was... Yes.

349
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:12,251
- You must have felt awkward.
- I felt awkward.

350
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,021
That's understandable.

351
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:15,891
Gosh, his smile is so charming.

352
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:17,621
He's so nice.

353
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,691
She's very shy.

354
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:24,200
When did you get here?

355
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:25,500
About...

356
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:26,530
- Here?
- Yes.

357
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,071
- Five minutes ago? Yes.
- Five minutes ago?

358
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:30,331
I feel like your skin will burn burn.

359
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,500
- The sun is blazing.
- Right.

360
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:33,901
It's scorching.

361
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:36,170
The sun is so intense...

362
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:37,510
- It's very strong.
- during the day.

363
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,111
- The sun is brutal.
- It's...

364
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,780
- still morning.
- Right.

365
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:42,811
I know.

366
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:46,520
(The third genuinely good person)

367
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:47,550
- Someone's coming.
- Someone's coming.

368
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:48,721
- Who is it?
- Someone's coming.

369
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:50,821
Who is it?

370
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:53,521
Who is it?

371
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,131
- I'm curious.
- Who is it?

372
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,030
Oh, my gosh.

373
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,100
- It's a guy.
- It's a guy.

374
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,361
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

375
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:04,171
- It's...
- Wait.

376
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:11,041
(Gwan Hee's friend, Ha Jeong Geun)

377
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,640
(Goodness.)

378
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:13,810
He's so cool.

379
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,050
- Here comes Kim Woo Bin.
- Kim Woo Bin.

380
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:17,350
- He's good-looking.
- Da Hye!

381
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,520
- She's lucky.
- Goodness.

382
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:19,880
She's lucky.

383
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,951
- He looks like a manly mine.
- Right?

384
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,320
He's really tall.

385
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,791
His face is small and well-proportioned.

386
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,390
You shot him from a nicer angle.

387
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:31,800
You didn't get drone footage for my friend.

388
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:32,960
But you got some for him.

389
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,601
We'll make sure he gets some next time.

390
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,271
Goodness.

391
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:39,070
Hello. I'm Lee Gwan Hee, and I'm vouching for...

392
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:41,071
someone who is a genuinely good person.

393
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,471
Doesn't his aura feel extraordinary?

394
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:47,111
I think he looks familiar to the actor, Kim Woo Bin.

395
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:48,681
His physique...

396
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:53,081
is as solid as a basketball player's.

397
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,421
Please turn around.

398
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:58,561
Hello.

399
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:00,121
My name is Ha Jeong Geun.

400
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,530
- There's a resemblance.
- There's a resemblance.

401
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:04,601
- There's a resemblance.
- Kim Woo Bin.

402
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,761
- Goodness.
- He really does look similar.

403
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:09,101
She's suddenly quiet.

404
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:11,171
Ye Eun, close your mouth.

405
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,941
- Goodness.
- Ye Eun, close your mouth.

406
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,771
- Ye Eun.
- Gosh.

407
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:16,670
He was raised well.

408
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:18,210
He's by the book.

409
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,240
He's physically strong and good-looking.

410
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,951
He's a really good guy whom I can vouch for.

411
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:25,651
- He has such a beautiful smile.
- Oh, my gosh.

412
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,920
I recommended him in the hope of turning him...

413
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:31,121
into the next Lee Gwan Hee.

414
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,521
I'd rather be the first Ha Jeong Geun...

415
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,660
than the next Lee Gwan Hee.

416
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,491
Say three charms about Ha Jeong Geun.

417
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,160
Ha Jeong Geun.

418
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:40,161
That's it.

419
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,030
He said his name.

420
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm going to watch you.

421
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,400
(Genuinely good people with charms to look forward to)

422
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,600
It's going great.

423
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:48,110
- Everyone is awesome.
- This is great.

424
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:50,041
- They're all...
- They're all good-looking.

425
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:51,610
He has a beautiful smile.

426
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,141
- He looks gorgeous.
- He's handsome.

427
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,251
Someone is coming.

428
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:04,051
Is someone here?

429
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:05,890
- It's a man.
- Really?

430
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:06,921
Yes.

431
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,631
- Hi.
- Hi.

432
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:17,130
- Please have a seat anywhere.
- Thanks.

433
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:18,470
- Da Hye!
- She seems happy.

434
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,041
I told you to cover your mouth when you smile.

435
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,481
He's good-looking and tall.

436
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:27,341
That's not good for me.

437
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:31,081
Have you eaten?

438
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:33,680
No, I haven't eaten much.

439
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:34,721
I see.

440
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:37,891
I shouldn't have either.

441
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:41,791
There's a bee.

442
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,561
- The bee is coming at me.
- The bee...

443
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,230
- Isn't it supposed to go to her?
- Isn't it a good sign?

444
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:50,171
- I'm not a flower.
- Oh, my.

445
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,740
- Jeong Geun.
- Hold on.

446
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:54,441
I haven't taught you that.

447
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:56,311
You just met today.

448
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,241
You just met today.

449
00:16:58,311 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm sorry.

450
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,680
That was too cheesy. It was too much when they first met.

451
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:03,810
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- They just met.

452
00:17:03,811 --> 00:17:05,180
- That was bad.
- I apologize to you on his behalf.

453
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:06,380
- I apologize.
- He's a bit cheesy...

454
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,381
for the first meeting.

455
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:09,391
- That's bad.
- Right.

456
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:10,791
Come on, Jeong Geun.

457
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,460
Isn't it supposed to go to her?

458
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:13,660
I'm not a flower.

459
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:14,731
Oh, my.

460
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:18,661
Are you flirting with her?

461
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:20,061
Are you flirting with me?

462
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:25,501
With bobbed hair and round eyes,

463
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:28,571
she looked cute to me.

464
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,840
(The fourth genuinely good person)

465
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:35,610
- The next person is a woman.
- Someone is coming.

466
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:36,611
Who is she?

467
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:41,080
- It's a woman.
- It's a woman.

468
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,790
- Whose friend is she?
- Oh, my gosh.

469
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,051
- Oh, my gosh.
- She's beautiful.

470
00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:48,860
- She looks like a model.
- She's nervous.

471
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,461
- She's very stylish.
- She really looks like a model.

472
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,401
She looks gorgeous.

473
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:04,041
Someone is coming.

474
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,781
- Hi.
- Hi.

475
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:10,381
(Ye Eun's friend, Kim Sin Young)

476
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:12,481
(Ye Eun's friend showed up like a model.)

477
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:14,820
My gosh! She looks so stylish.

478
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,821
- This is crazy. Oh, my gosh.
- She has a great style.

479
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:18,660
(Who is this genuinely good person with a new charm?)

480
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:22,130
The really good friend I recommend is someone...

481
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,730
I went to middle and high school with.

482
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:26,301
She's also a neighborhood friend.

483
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:29,501
Here she is. This is my friend.

484
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:35,611
Hi, I'm Ji Ye Eun's friend, Kim Sin Young.

485
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,810
I can see why you said she looked like a model.

486
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,310
- She really looks like a model.
- She's shy.

487
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:40,481
- She is very fashionable.
- Yes.

488
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:42,511
I'm pretty sure she's over 170cm tall.

489
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:44,081
She really looks like a model.

490
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,781
Actually, we met yesterday.

491
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,220
(They can see each other anytime they want.)

492
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,050
We live very close.

493
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:51,390
It's just across.

494
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,890
We're neighborhood friends.

495
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,220
(They got even closer, taking walks together.)

496
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:55,490
We said, "We were like that."

497
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:57,830
"We were really..." As we were talking about our past,

498
00:18:57,831 --> 00:19:00,131
it reminded us of our middle school days.

499
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:02,071
I think I'm going to cry.

500
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:03,831
We were so young.

501
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:05,471
What's wrong?

502
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,471
We were so young.

503
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,970
Are you really crying? What's wrong?

504
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:11,040
What's wrong with me?

505
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,611
- I guess I'm getting old.
- What's wrong?

506
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:13,941
We were in middle school,

507
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,511
but we've grown up now.

508
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:18,521
Somehow it really hit me.

509
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:20,321
You're making me cry.

510
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:22,291
This is annoying.

511
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:24,291
We are so weird.

512
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,160
(Why did you recommend her as your really good friend?)

513
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:28,590
She has a sense of humor.

514
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:31,231
She makes the mood fun.

515
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:32,861
Above all, she looks gorgeous.

516
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,401
She's in good shape.

517
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:38,301
She's like a model. She's got the model figure.

518
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,211
I'm sure she'll be a great girlfriend.

519
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,280
(Have you seen Sin Young with a man?)

520
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:46,511
I've never seen her with a man.

521
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:48,050
(Because they haven't dated a lot.)

522
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:51,051
What if I see you acting like a fox?

523
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,320
But I have that side of me that you don't know.

524
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:56,150
- I bet. You've dated as well.
- I can be foxy.

525
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,651
I'm actually a vixen.

526
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,291
- I'm a vixen.
- Don't say that.

527
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:01,361
Can't I say it?

528
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:03,260
Don't make me embarrassed.

529
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:06,231
- Would it damage your reputation?
- Yes.

530
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,030
- Would it ruin your reputation?
- Yes.

531
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:09,130
I understand.

532
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:11,171
(A genuinely good person, who is bright and makes you want to talk)

533
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:13,571
Hi.

534
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,311
She's really tall.

535
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,870
- He sits right away.
- He sat right away.

536
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:19,441
Oh, no.

537
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:21,710
She looks taller than Hyun Jin.

538
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:23,211
Poor Da Hye.

539
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:25,081
- How tall is she?
- How tall?

540
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:26,720
- She's 180cm tall.
- She's over 170cm, right?

541
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:28,291
- What? 180cm?
- Is she 180cm tall?

542
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,590
- She's 180cm tall.
- Is she really?

543
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,691
Really?

544
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:33,860
(She has a standout shape.)

545
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,760
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

546
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:37,230
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

547
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:39,960
- Please have a seat.
- Have a seat. I...

548
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,931
- Where do you want to sit?
- In the middle...

549
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:43,601
Please take a seat wherever you'd like.

550
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,641
- I'll sit here.
- You need to flip this over.

551
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,400
- It's too hot.
- Why does she sit next to him? No!

552
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:48,441
It's really hot.

553
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,340
- She's sitting on his left.
- No! Sit!

554
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:53,180
- Just sit! No!
- What's the matter?

555
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:56,380
- He's 10cm shorter than she is.
- It's just beginning.

556
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,820
- Please calm down.
- Calm down, please.

557
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,520
- Thank you.
- Please take one.

558
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:02,621
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

559
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:04,421
Sure.

560
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:07,161
- My mouth was actually really dry.
- I see.

561
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:10,991
I thought he was thoughtful.

562
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,231
- Da Hye keeps looking at him.
- Yes.

563
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:17,671
You're all wearing off-the-shoulder styles.

564
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:20,371
You might regret it soon.

565
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:23,541
I don't really care if I get tanned.

566
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:27,881
- I don't like to get tanned.
- I see.

567
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,551
- You're in the worst circumstance.
- I know.

568
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:31,150
- Why don't you...
- This jacket.

569
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:32,750
- cover yourself with this?
- Could I?

570
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,120
- You can use this.
- Thanks.

571
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,490
That's it.

572
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:37,690
- You're doing great.
- He did it well.

573
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:38,861
Da Hye.

574
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:39,960
- Protect your back.
- Since I have to return it,

575
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:41,191
- please keep it clean.
- Protect your back.

576
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:46,601
- He looks nervous.
- I think so.

577
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:48,671
He's already losing.

578
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:51,670
- Coming!
- Someone is coming.

579
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:52,741
Who is it?

580
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,510
- Oh, my gosh.
- I think it's a woman.

581
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:56,611
Oh, my gosh.

582
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,440
(The fifth genuinely good person)

583
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,140
- She's beautiful.
- We've never seen her.

584
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,710
- It's the first time I've seen her.
- Really?

585
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,381
Who is she?

586
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:15,861
I think someone is coming.

587
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,361
- You're right.
- Hi.

588
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:19,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

589
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,430
(The fifth genuinely good person with a big smile)

590
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:22,631
- Here she is.
- She's beautiful.

591
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:25,241
She's really beautiful. Oh, my gosh.

592
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:29,210
Hi, I'm Kim Young Kwang, a former national team goalkeeper...

593
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:32,710
and now a sports entertainer.

594
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:35,580
I have a friend I'd like to introduce today.

595
00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:37,351
This is my friend.

596
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:44,221
Hi, I'm Kang Su Jin. Nice to meet you.

597
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:46,961
- She's my friend.
- She's so beautiful.

598
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,490
She's really beautiful.

599
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:49,591
- Hi, Su Jin.
- My goodness.

600
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:51,630
- I can't remember the name.
- She looks like Seol Hyun.

601
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:54,430
- Yes, you're right.
- She looks like Seol Hyun.

602
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:56,200
She looks like a member of a girl group.

603
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:58,771
- She's really attractive.
- I can see.

604
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:01,640
Which camera should I look at?

605
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,011
This one? Or this? Or that?

606
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,240
- You'll be really attractive.
- The center one?

607
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:07,781
(Only 20 seconds in, she's already charming everyone?)

608
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,351
She's very talented. There's nothing she can't do.

609
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:16,751
She can sing. She's polite.

610
00:23:17,151 --> 00:23:18,791
She's tall.

611
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:21,931
She's just perfect.

612
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:23,991
She's beautiful.

613
00:23:24,261 --> 00:23:25,601
In many ways.

614
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:27,560
I forgot to say she can sing. She can sing.

615
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:28,930
- You said that earlier.
- Did I?

616
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:30,930
I wonder how well she can sing.

617
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,740
- He keeps saying it.
- She said I said that.

618
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,941
I thought I forgot to say it. She can sing.

619
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:37,141
She can really sing.

620
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:41,751
As you can hear, she has a husky voice.

621
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:45,250
I'm sure she'll give men butterflies.

622
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:46,921
Why don't you say something?

623
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:51,290
- To him?
- Yes. Imagine he's your boyfriend.

624
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,921
If he's doing something, such as cooking, I'll say,

625
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:55,590
"You look so hot."

626
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:57,130
(Alluring gestures instead of singing)

627
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:58,400
Not like that.

628
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:01,430
- Don't say, "You look hot." - Then, how can I say?

629
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,771
- I spoke softly.
- I'm worried she says that way.

630
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,640
Not like that.

631
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:08,100
- Speak calmly.
- You look hot.

632
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:09,711
That's it. Hold on.

633
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:11,070
Don't glare like that.

634
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:12,180
(Trying to do something with her eyes instead of her voice)

635
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:14,611
I can't help but make a facial expression.

636
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:19,051
(A genuinely good person with a husky voice)

637
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:21,851
- She's gorgeous.
- She's so adorable.

638
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,851
Hi.

639
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:27,661
- Where do you want to sit?
- It's hot.

640
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,560
- Yes. Here?
- I'll sit here.

641
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:31,090
- Let me move this here.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

642
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,330
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

643
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,600
Since it's hot, you need to flip it over.

644
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:36,171
Flipping it over? Thanks.

645
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:37,870
- Hi.
- Hi.

646
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:39,571
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

647
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:41,611
You all came early.

648
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,310
- Yes.
- I came...

649
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:44,511
- first.
- Really?

650
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:47,211
- Can I just keep my bag here?
- Let me get you water.

651
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:48,910
- Isn't it hot?
- It's okay.

652
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:50,881
- Is it okay? If you say so.
- Yes.

653
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:52,720
Why don't you do what you were going to do?

654
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:54,151
- Oh, water?
- Yes.

655
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:56,751
He's getting her some water.

656
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:58,560
- Thank you.
- I think he's charming.

657
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:00,591
He keeps trying to do something.

658
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,961
- He's pretty proactive.
- Thank you.

659
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:05,001
It could look cute.

660
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:12,640
Do you know how many people in total?

661
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,301
Guessing based on the remaining seats...

662
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:16,940
- One more person?
- I think one or two more will come.

663
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:18,780
- Are we five now?
- Yes.

664
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:19,781
Six?

665
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:21,541
Maybe three more people are coming.

666
00:25:23,011 --> 00:25:24,451
Three more people come.

667
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:26,580
A few days later, suddenly, one or two more...

668
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:27,750
- come.
- Exactly. I thought so, too.

669
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:28,851
The wildcard?

670
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:30,290
Aren't they the wildcards?

671
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:33,061
- I think there will be newcomers.
- Yes, definitely.

672
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:36,161
Is it a woman?

673
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:37,560
(The sixth genuinely good person)

674
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:39,100
- Is it a man?
- Is he my friend?

675
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:41,230
- It's a woman.
- Is it?

676
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:42,730
- Is it a man?
- I think he looks...

677
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:43,970
- like my friend.
- It's a man.

678
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:45,600
- It's a man.
- Yes.

679
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:47,071
I'm nervous. Why am I so nervous?

680
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:50,211
Isn't he your friend? I think he's your friend.

681
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:51,311
What?

682
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:52,780
Yes, it's him.

683
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:53,980
He's really fashionable.

684
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:55,510
- I thought it was a woman.
- Gong Yoo!

685
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:57,580
- Is he your friend?
- He's my friend.

686
00:25:57,581 --> 00:25:59,280
- He's my friend.
- He looks like Gong Yoo.

687
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:00,450
- Really?
- He's my friend.

688
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:02,290
I almost thought he was Jannabi.

689
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,421
Yes, he has his vibe.

690
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:09,061
(Sae Ho's friend, Kim Geon Wu)

691
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:10,791
He dressed up well.

692
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:12,560
(Screaming)

693
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,301
- Come on.
- He looks great.

694
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:20,071
I'm so nervous.

695
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:23,210
He's fun and kind.

696
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:24,440
He also has...

697
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:26,210
great taste in fashion.

698
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,311
I'll introduce my friend.

699
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:32,681
Hi.

700
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,881
I'm Kim Geon Wu,

701
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:36,590
and Sae Ho's cool friend.

702
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:37,791
Nice to meet you.

703
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:41,520
- He looks a bit like Gong Yoo.
- Just a little.

704
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:43,361
- I think I know what you meant.
- Right.

705
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:45,700
He has a dinosaur-like face.

706
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:47,860
Yes, but he's also adorable.

707
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:48,970
- Like a plant-eating dinosaur.
- Right.

708
00:26:48,971 --> 00:26:50,871
- Yes, you're right.
- Such as Brachiosaurus.

709
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,800
- He looks like he'd take...
- The men are...

710
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,901
- good pictures for his girlfriend.
- Yes.

711
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:57,610
Was it a restaurant where we first met?

712
00:26:57,611 --> 00:27:01,440
We first met at a Korean barbecue restaurant near Dosan Park.

713
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:03,410
- While we were having drinks, - Yes, while drinking.

714
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:04,580
I asked you where you got it...

715
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,450
and what brand it is. We talked about it.

716
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:10,351
We got closer while talking about fashion.

717
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:12,220
You can see on his social media...

718
00:27:12,221 --> 00:27:13,590
how stylish he is.

719
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,430
He has a good sense of style.

720
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:18,061
He kind of looks like a Japanese guy.

721
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,431
Your shirt today looks nice.

722
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:23,501
- It's the T brand.
- Yes.

723
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:27,441
I like it.

724
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:31,881
He's wearing all black, but I think...

725
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:35,451
the red on his shoes shows a good sense of style.

726
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,181
I'll show it while flirting with someone.

727
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:39,520
- Look at that.
- I see.

728
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:41,181
- He's really fashionable.
- Isn't that attractive?

729
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:44,121
- Red shoelaces on black shoes.
- Yes.

730
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:46,120
If you go out with Geon Wu,

731
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:48,791
It's like you're having the best personal stylist.

732
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:52,331
(A genuinely good person with a great sense of fashion)

733
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:56,001
- I can't tell from this one time.
- Look. Someone is coming.

734
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:58,641
- It scares me.
- Oh, my gosh.

735
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:00,501
- It scares me.
- Oh, my gosh.

736
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:01,671
Hi.

737
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:03,370
- Hi.
- Hi.

738
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:04,470
- Hi.
- Hi.

739
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:05,680
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

740
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:07,040
- Nice to meet you.
- This is great.

741
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,240
- It doesn't look bad at all.
- Where do you want to sit?

742
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:09,311
- I'll sit here.
- Here.

743
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:11,951
- Your bag...
- I'll put it here.

744
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:14,221
- Hi.
- Hi.

745
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,220
- Jeong Geu.
- He's glaring.

746
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,490
- He is checking him out.
- Yes.

747
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:19,790
- He saw him from head to toe.
- Yes.

748
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:20,861
That wasn't so great.

749
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:22,831
That's right.

750
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:26,630
- Hyun Jin.
- What was that?

751
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:28,701
She tucked her hair behind her ear.

752
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,370
Da Hye has a light skin tone,

753
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:34,671
which appeals to me more.

754
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:38,911
You look like a musician.

755
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:39,941
- Me?
- Yes.

756
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:41,241
- Are you a musician?
- I think he's in the arts.

757
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,081
- Yes, he looks a bit like that.
- In the arts.

758
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:46,380
We can't open up what we do, though.

759
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:48,321
- That's right.
- We can't say it. It's a guess.

760
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:50,151
I'm so curious about you all.

761
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,421
I think it'll be different from what I think.

762
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,031
It'll be fun.

763
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:07,501
- Will there be just six of us?
- This seat is really...

764
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:09,971
I guess it could be. No one has come for a while.

765
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:12,141
I thought about that.

766
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:15,210
- When we go out...
- Yes.

767
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,180
We just received a text message.

768
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:18,211
Did you get a text?

769
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,180
Go to the Lovebud House.

770
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:22,721
- Lovebud House.
- Are we going there?

771
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,220
- I think we're going there now.
- Really?

772
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,891
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

773
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,790
- I'm really looking forward to it.
- So am I.

774
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:30,991
(The friends' first meeting was full of nervousness and excitement.)

775
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:33,900
- Two people haven't come yet.
- You're right.

776
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:36,070
Six of them met first.

777
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:37,771
So, two are coming later.

778
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:39,571
- It seems like it.
- I'm so curious who they are.

779
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:43,911
When I saw Nam Hee overreact, I wondered...

780
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:47,280
- if he was always like that.
- I'm sorry.

781
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:49,081
But I also overreacted when I watched my friend.

782
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:50,280
- Right?
- I agree.

783
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:51,580
- This is...
- You do that naturally.

784
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,620
totally different...

785
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:53,780
- from other dating reality shows.
- You're right.

786
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:56,420
- I can only see my friend.
- Because they're our friends.

787
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,850
You were quiet at first,

788
00:29:57,851 --> 00:29:59,190
but then you spoke a lot more.

789
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:00,620
She became quiet, though.

790
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:01,790
You're right.

791
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,430
When I see my friend, I'm suddenly speechless.

792
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:04,690
Since she keeps sweeping her hair,

793
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:06,461
it could get greasy. Because of that,

794
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:08,570
I'm just so worried about her. She's so beautiful now.

795
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:10,300
When women sweep their hair,

796
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:11,301
- it signals flirting.
- She's flirting.

797
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:12,400
If she continues to do so, it signals flirting.

798
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:14,970
I think she's interested in someone there.

799
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:17,540
Also, I noticed she kept looking...

800
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,280
at Gwan Hee's friend.

801
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:21,440
- Jeong Geun.
- Yes, she looked at Jeong Geun.

802
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:23,410
- She might be interested in him.
- She might be.

803
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:24,810
I'm also curious about that.

804
00:30:24,811 --> 00:30:26,950
Did you and your friend...

805
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,591
talk about giving you a signal...

806
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,920
if they see someone they're interested in?

807
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:33,090
Did any of you talk about that?

808
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:34,620
- A signal.
- A signal of attraction.

809
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:35,830
We didn't talk about it.

810
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,861
- We talked about it.
- Did you?

811
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:40,160
My friend loves coffee.

812
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:42,031
He even hand-grinds coffee himself.

813
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:43,631
He'll take his grinder...

814
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,170
and make coffee...

815
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:47,740
- for someone he's interested in.
- Really?

816
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:50,710
The person he serves it to first is the one he's most interested in.

817
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:52,581
- That's what we decided.
- Really?

818
00:30:52,881 --> 00:30:54,180
I'll watch it carefully, then.

819
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:55,310
When he makes a morning coffee.

820
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,511
I'll watch him give it to whom.

821
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,080
I can't wait to find out...

822
00:30:58,081 --> 00:30:59,850
- who Hyun Jin, Nam Hee's friend, - Who's it going to be?

823
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:01,050
- will make coffee for.
- I can't wait.

824
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,490
Besides that,

825
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:04,420
- friends of So Ra and Young Ji...
- That's right.

826
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,120
- haven't come yet.
- They haven't come.

827
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:07,890
When will they come? Will they come the next day?

828
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:09,090
- Do you want to find out?
- Yes.

829
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:10,130
Shall we watch it now, then?

830
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:11,390
- Yes. Let's watch it.
- Yes.

831
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:12,431
- Knock knock.
- Knock knock.

832
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:15,631
This place is so cool.

833
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:17,231
It is. This is really nice.

834
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:19,370
- It's here.
- This one as well.

835
00:31:19,371 --> 00:31:20,740
- It's been decorated.
- Yes, this is it.

836
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:21,801
It's cute.

837
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:23,810
It's pretty.

838
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:25,541
- It's so nice.
- It looks great.

839
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:27,810
- The shared space is in the middle.
- It's divided like that.

840
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:28,881
That's interesting.

841
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:32,651
(The terrace in the women's residence)

842
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:38,590
It feels feminine.

843
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:40,691
My gosh. It's so pretty here.

844
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:44,030
(The 1st floor of the women's residence)

845
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:45,730
It'll be so much fun.

846
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:48,871
(The 1st floor of the women's residence)

847
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:51,031
There are even toothbrushes.

848
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,240
Everything is well-prepared.

849
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:54,241
Let's play this later.

850
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:55,970
- My gosh. Look at this.
- A game of pirates.

851
00:31:55,971 --> 00:31:57,270
- What is this?
- I think...

852
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:58,781
- this is the thing.
- This is the thing.

853
00:31:59,311 --> 00:32:04,281
(The mysterious room at the women's residence)

854
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:06,980
- Goodness.
- There is something inside.

855
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:09,321
- I think this is a voting room.
- We'll vote here.

856
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:11,251
This is insane.

857
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:22,900
I think we'll put something in here.

858
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,531
- We'll put it here.
- I know.

859
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:26,440
- Then, we'll give signals...
- Yes.

860
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,941
- about which color I chose.
- I think so.

861
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,110
I'm sure...

862
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:32,481
we'll have to do something in the evening.

863
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:34,180
Something is coming.

864
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:36,811
Seeing that, "Are we going to do a popularity vote,

865
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:39,021
or just pick someone we're interested in?"

866
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,721
I immediately wondered that.

867
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:43,821
- Voting?
- Are they going to vote?

868
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,690
They'll probably vote for something like...

869
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:46,921
The doors are so cute.

870
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,430
It's the same doors as the ones behind us.

871
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:51,530
- She's right.
- She's right.

872
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:53,400
- It's by the color.
- What is this?

873
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:55,331
I think that is it. It looks like that room.

874
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:57,900
I think they got nervous...

875
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,440
- since they found that room.
- I think so, too.

876
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:01,740
- They've been just excited.
- Yes.

877
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:04,440
- They're not there just for fun.
- You're right.

878
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,241
They have reasons to be there.

879
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:09,080
(The terrace in the men's residence)

880
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:10,980
There is exercise equipment to appeal to others.

881
00:33:10,981 --> 00:33:12,181
(The terrace in the men's residence)

882
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:20,321
(The 1st floor of the men's residence)

883
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:23,690
(The mysterious room in the men's residence)

884
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:25,931
I'm dying to know what the room is for.

885
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,260
- A lot of episodes will happen.
- This place will be the most...

886
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:29,171
- There'll be misunderstandings.
- Exactly.

887
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:31,501
This room is in both the women's and men's residences.

888
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:35,741
Barbecue.

889
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:37,240
This is so nice.

890
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:38,940
- There is that too.
- A barbecue grill.

891
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:40,710
- Barbeque grill. I saw it.
- I see.

892
00:33:40,711 --> 00:33:41,981
I love it.

893
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,450
I think many things will happen...

894
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:46,520
- in the shared space.
- I think so, too.

895
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,451
(The 1st floor of the shared space)

896
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:50,950
There is a pool here.

897
00:33:50,951 --> 00:33:52,161
- Is there a pool here, too?
- Yes.

898
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:54,060
It feels like...

899
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:56,431
- it's a place for a date.
- Oh, my gosh. A place for a date?

900
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:58,261
My gosh.

901
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,461
This is crazy.

902
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:03,800
(The upstairs of the shared space)

903
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,770
The pool is Jacuzzi-style.

904
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:07,570
They'll go into the pool together...

905
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:08,741
and have a chat.

906
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:11,870
- Hey. This is crazy.
- They're more excited.

907
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,280
They're more excited now.

908
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:14,810
I'll book it for you three later.

909
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:15,851
So, go and have fun.

910
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,810
- Thanks.
- I'll book the space...

911
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:19,320
- for you all...
- Thanks a lot.

912
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:21,521
- for one night.
- Thank you so much.

913
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:24,891
- Are these all women's suitcases?
- We'll bring them in.

914
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:27,321
So, this...

915
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:30,890
That's mine. It's heavy.

916
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:32,500
- I'll bring it in.
- The set of suitcases...

917
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:33,561
is mine, Jeong Geun.

918
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:36,531
- He's giving a good impression.
- It's fine.

919
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:38,070
The set of suitcases is mine, Jeong Geun.

920
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:39,471
It's not rolling at all.

921
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:41,101
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

922
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,641
It must be really heavy, Jeong Geun.

923
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:51,010
- You brought my two suitcases in.
- Yes.

924
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:52,151
Thanks.

925
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:55,151
Thanks.

926
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:58,791
- You carried the heaviest one.
- Goodness.

927
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,630
He's showing off.

928
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:05,390
I think he's trying to show his strength.

929
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:07,701
He could've rolled it as my friend did.

930
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:10,931
It has wheels.

931
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:12,771
Let me carry it.

932
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:14,701
Thanks.

933
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:16,771
Where is the handle?

934
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:19,210
- My gosh.
- Don't they have wheels on them?

935
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:20,281
Over here...

936
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:22,851
- There's no sofa.
- It's a dressing table.

937
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:24,751
- It's okay, you can put it down.
- I'll put it here.

938
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:26,421
Thank you.

939
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:31,921
- What is it?
- It's hard.

940
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,220
- Coffee?
- Already?

941
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:34,890
- Already?
- Already?

942
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:36,191
- That's so fast.
- Right away?

943
00:35:38,591 --> 00:35:40,431
He's a lot more impatient than I thought.

944
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,530
He is too hasty. Oh, dear.

945
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:44,131
He must've liked someone at first sight.

946
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:50,141
The ice...

947
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:52,880
It's not completely frozen.

948
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:55,241
(The ice hasn't frozen completely.)

949
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:00,821
I'm doomed.

950
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:05,521
I feel like things aren't going...

951
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:08,461
as I planned.

952
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:15,931
Only if I had a lot of ice...

953
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:19,171
That would have been perfect.

954
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,211
He wanted to make coffee for them but couldn't.

955
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:28,311
Is Hyun Jin making coffee?

956
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,080
No. The ice...

957
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:31,610
- It's not frozen?
- There's not enough.

958
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:32,950
- I don't think it'll work.
- You don't think?

959
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:34,751
- It's better to go out...
- And buy it.

960
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:36,751
- Are we really going out?
- Let's head out.

961
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:39,391
Or...

962
00:36:39,821 --> 00:36:42,190
is there a cafe in here?

963
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:43,630
There is one on the rooftop.

964
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:45,600
- Shall we go there?
- Shall we go there?

965
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:46,630
- Yes.
- That sounds nice.

966
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:48,860
- It's on the second floor.
- Yes. Let's go there.

967
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:50,131
- Let's go there.
- Okay.

968
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,300
- I want to drink coffee.
- Let's drink coffee.

969
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:54,800
Why don't we go to a cafe together?

970
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:56,041
(Hyun Jin comes back empty-handed.)

971
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:57,471
Coffee.

972
00:36:58,411 --> 00:36:59,481
The ice.

973
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,940
- As I mentioned, - The situation didn't help.

974
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:04,150
since he likes coffee, I think he wanted to share it.

975
00:37:04,151 --> 00:37:06,250
- Exactly. It was his goodwill.
- But there's no ice.

976
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:07,750
Didn't you feel it?

977
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:09,290
- My friend handled it cleverly.
- He...

978
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,350
My friend suggested...

979
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:11,490
- the rooftop cafe.
- Did you hear the way he spoke?

980
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,391
- He was keeping him in check.
- Keeping him in check.

981
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:15,060
- I could feel that.
- He naturally led them...

982
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:16,130
- to the rooftop.
- Exactly.

983
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:17,891
From what I can see,

984
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:19,800
my friend got the drop on him.

985
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,700
(As someone experienced in dating shows, he got the drop on.)

986
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:23,400
(He got the drop on the audience too.)

987
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:24,571
Amazing.

988
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:27,570
The score is already 1 to 0.

989
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:29,211
For who? Su Jin?

990
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:30,410
No.

991
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:32,580
No, it's for Sin Young.

992
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:34,741
- No, Da Hye.
- Da Hye.

993
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:37,050
Are you going this far over a cup of coffee?

994
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:39,350
One thing I'm sure about is that all three women...

995
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:40,621
were very focused on my friend.

996
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:42,151
"Focused."

997
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:43,620
We all see differently.

998
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,121
- Let's go to the second floor.
- Yes.

999
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,960
- Okay, let's go.
- That's a great tip.

1000
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:48,261
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1001
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:50,731
We can go up here.

1002
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:52,600
I got a text.

1003
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:54,201
- They got a text.
- What is it?

1004
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:56,401
- What is it?
- Where is this?

1005
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:57,931
What is it?

1006
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,801
Someone is waiting for us.

1007
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:03,640
I just got chills.

1008
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:04,740
(Someone is waiting for you.)

1009
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,981
(Choose a person to go to the address below.)

1010
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:18,621
(Someone is waiting.)

1011
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:22,091
Why is he so... I'm sorry.

1012
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:24,291
It must be Young Ji's friend.

1013
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:28,830
Buttoning up one more would've been nice.

1014
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:29,901
Really? Oh, no.

1015
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:31,831
Right?

1016
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:37,741
Who is going to pick him up?

1017
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:39,540
Who is it?

1018
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,741
- Who is it?
- The car...

1019
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:42,780
It's Su Jin!

1020
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:43,981
(Young Kwang's friend Su Jin is picking the new guy up.)

1021
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,620
Who will join us?

1022
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:51,251
I didn't even know if it was a man or a woman.

1023
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:53,291
I got to be the first one to see them.

1024
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,061
I was nervous and excited.

1025
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:00,161
(Humming)

1026
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:05,530
(The one you love)

1027
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:08,771
(Wish that was me)

1028
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:15,241
I'm here. I wonder who's there.

1029
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:24,991
I can see that she's nervous.

1030
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,991
- She should check her hair. Yes.
- If I meet them now...

1031
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:29,531
You need to check your look.

1032
00:39:29,631 --> 00:39:30,831
I'm nervous.

1033
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,331
Okay, turn off the engine.

1034
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:51,680
- He must be nervous.
- He's nervous.

1035
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,121
- He must be nervous.
- That's good.

1036
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,880
- You can't help but react this way.
- He's excited.

1037
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:56,851
- Oh, dear.
- My goodness.

1038
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:05,291
- They're going to meet.
- I can't watch this.

1039
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,071
Hello.

1040
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:21,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

1041
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,311
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

1042
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:25,251
- I...
- What is this?

1043
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:29,051
- He's cute.
- He's so fine.

1044
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:32,621
- He looks so soft and gentle.
- He's handsome.

1045
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:35,561
Hello. I'm Mi Joo, Young Ji's friend.

1046
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:37,660
A really fine guy...

1047
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,461
I, Hur Young Ji, can vouch for.

1048
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:42,901
He's the only one around me that's perfect...

1049
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,030
but single.

1050
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:46,441
(He is perfect in every way except his relationship status.)

1051
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:48,241
He is my real friend.

1052
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,671
Let me introduce him to you.

1053
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:54,211
- Hello. I'm Shin Dong Ha.
- Nice.

1054
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:55,981
Doesn't he look very reliable?

1055
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:59,680
One thing I cared about the most when selecting was the looks.

1056
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:00,781
Thank you.

1057
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:03,651
Why are you single?

1058
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:05,690
- I'm busy with work.
- That's right.

1059
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:07,021
But that's an excuse.

1060
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,790
- Right.
- I like traveling...

1061
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,190
and have a lot of hobbies.

1062
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:11,731
I have a lot of personal time.

1063
00:41:12,331 --> 00:41:13,860
If I may speak in his stead,

1064
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:15,131
it's because he has a lot of stuff.

1065
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:18,031
- He has a lot of stuff?
- He has a lot of stuff.

1066
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:19,671
He has a lot of hobbies.

1067
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:21,541
He has multiple hobbies.

1068
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:23,710
Traveling, ice hockey,

1069
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:24,740
- diving, - Ice hockey?

1070
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:26,541
- freediving, riding a motorcycle...
- He does everything.

1071
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:28,741
What if your girlfriend says,

1072
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:31,510
"Hey, I really want you to drop that hobby."

1073
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:32,780
What will you do?

1074
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,280
(Hobby or girlfriend?)

1075
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:36,951
Then I'll stop.

1076
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:39,151
That's the kind of mindset he has.

1077
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:42,191
Approach him. Come to him.

1078
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:45,161
I even had this thought once.

1079
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:48,301
You're on the screen, and I'm watching it.

1080
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,930
- My gosh.
- Are you sure you can...

1081
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:52,401
watch me flirt as is?

1082
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:55,171
Try it.

1083
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:58,141
(A genuinely good person who looks very cool and straightforward)

1084
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:00,280
He looks very likable.

1085
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:01,980
He looks very cool.

1086
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:04,610
He looks very soft.

1087
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:06,880
He's very relaxed.

1088
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:08,081
I'm proud of him.

1089
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,891
Hello.

1090
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:12,860
- Hello.
- Hello.

1091
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:15,161
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

1092
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,891
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

1093
00:42:18,061 --> 00:42:19,631
- I...
- What is this?

1094
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:21,700
- A letter. It told me to wait.
- Really?

1095
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:23,131
- Yes.
- Did you open it?

1096
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:25,501
- I think it's mine.
- Then do you mind...

1097
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:32,810
- Like this.
- This is how it's written.

1098
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:33,980
Yes, I'm here to pick you up.

1099
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:35,411
- Nice to meet you. Yes.
- Did you come to pick me up?

1100
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,310
My name is Kang Su Jin.

1101
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:39,150
- Kang Su Jin?
- Yes, Su Jin.

1102
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:40,381
I'm Shin Dong Ha.

1103
00:42:41,051 --> 00:42:42,850
- Shin Dong Ha.
- Dong Hwa?

1104
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,320
- Ha, as in "sky" in Korean.
- Dong Ha. Nice to meet you.

1105
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,560
- Nice to meet you.
- Whose friend are you?

1106
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:48,520
- I'm Hur Young Ji's friend.
- Young Ji?

1107
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:51,630
- I see.
- I'm Kim Young Kwang's friend.

1108
00:42:51,631 --> 00:42:52,860
- Kim Young Kwang the model?
- No.

1109
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,200
- The soccer player?
- Yes, that Kim Young Kwang.

1110
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:55,530
- Do you know him?
- Of course I do.

1111
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,671
- Shall we take your things and go?
- My things... Yes.

1112
00:42:57,731 --> 00:42:59,500
The car... I'll take that.

1113
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:01,540
- It's okay.
- Why would you take that?

1114
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:03,071
My friend, you take it yourself.

1115
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:05,670
Why would she want to help him with his stuff?

1116
00:43:05,671 --> 00:43:06,881
Let's go to the car.

1117
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:16,490
You came a bit later than the others.

1118
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:18,750
- We all met together.
- Really? When did you come?

1119
00:43:18,751 --> 00:43:20,590
- We...
- Today morning?

1120
00:43:20,591 --> 00:43:22,591
- Yes. We came in the morning.
- I see.

1121
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,090
Your accent tells me you're from Gyeongsang Province.

1122
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:26,431
- I am.
- Right?

1123
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:28,260
Where are you from?

1124
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:29,870
- I'm from Daegu.
- Daegu.

1125
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:30,901
Yes.

1126
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:35,001
Does he have an accent?

1127
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:36,940
- That's so cute.
- Good job.

1128
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:39,070
Su Jin is good at leading the conversation.

1129
00:43:39,071 --> 00:43:40,240
She's smooth at it.

1130
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:42,710
- Su Jin is doing everything.
- Yes.

1131
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:43,980
I'm frustrated by my friend.

1132
00:43:43,981 --> 00:43:45,280
She's so cool.

1133
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:46,721
I'm frustrated by my friend.

1134
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:48,820
- Sit in front.
- Should I drive?

1135
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:49,850
No, I'll drive.

1136
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:51,721
I'll drive you back.

1137
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:55,821
Excuse me.

1138
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:57,131
A car is coming.

1139
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:00,430
Come on!

1140
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:02,901
- That's cheating.
- What?

1141
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:05,301
Good job, Shin Dong Ha!

1142
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:10,411
Did you come from Daegu today? No, right?

1143
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:13,011
- I came over last night from Seoul.
- Last night from Daegu.

1144
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:14,740
- From Seoul?
- Yes.

1145
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:16,711
- You currently live in Seoul?
- Yes.

1146
00:44:16,951 --> 00:44:19,280
Just like the rest of us. I need to set the address...

1147
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,821
to our house.

1148
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:24,820
You came to pick me up.

1149
00:44:24,821 --> 00:44:26,820
- Yes, and...
- The rest went grocery shopping?

1150
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:28,320
Yes, just the two of them.

1151
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:30,431
And another person went to buy coffee.

1152
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:31,760
There's a cafe in front of the house,

1153
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:33,060
so we were planning to go there.

1154
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:35,101
- So we go straight to the house?
- That's right.

1155
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,500
- What?
- Is that another message?

1156
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:40,341
- My goodness.
- What is it?

1157
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:42,241
What is it?

1158
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:48,081
Hold on. I think we need to go and pick up one more person.

1159
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,580
- There's someone else?
- Yes.

1160
00:44:49,581 --> 00:44:51,110
My gosh. It must be a woman.

1161
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:52,951
(Another friend is waiting for you.)

1162
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:54,950
- She's picking up another person?
- Another pick up?

1163
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:56,121
So Ra's friend?

1164
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:59,761
They got three of them together on purpose from the start!

1165
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:01,620
They wanted the three to meet!

1166
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:02,930
- You guys are mean.
- In the car.

1167
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:04,561
This is crazy.

1168
00:45:05,261 --> 00:45:06,431
How many are there so far?

1169
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:08,230
- Is it a secret? Yes - Do you want to know?

1170
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:09,700
- Six, including me.
- Six?

1171
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:11,570
- Then am I the 7th?
- Yes, the 7th. This is the 8th.

1172
00:45:11,571 --> 00:45:13,840
- The eighth.
- Neungpo-ro, Geoje.

1173
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,470
(There's another new friend.)

1174
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:17,041
- Let me type in the address.
- Okay.

1175
00:45:19,911 --> 00:45:22,981
(He must have a lot to think about.)

1176
00:45:23,211 --> 00:45:24,211
Starting navigation...

1177
00:45:24,212 --> 00:45:25,580
It won't work if it's in flight mode, will it?

1178
00:45:25,581 --> 00:45:26,751
You're right.

1179
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:29,921
- You know it well.
- Just put it on DND mode.

1180
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:31,991
Focus mode.

1181
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:33,891
- Right.
- Right.

1182
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:36,460
Ten minutes?

1183
00:45:36,461 --> 00:45:37,960
(They head to pick up another friend.)

1184
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:39,260
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1185
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:40,331
(They head to pick up another friend.)

1186
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:43,870
You must like traveling.

1187
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:45,301
I love traveling.

1188
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:48,571
- I had a glance just now.
- Yes.

1189
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:52,511
- I was a bit surprised.
- Why?

1190
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:54,380
We have the same wallpaper.

1191
00:45:54,381 --> 00:45:55,681
Really?

1192
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:57,610
(They have the same wallpaper?)

1193
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:59,581
- Really?
- You've got to be kidding me.

1194
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:01,151
That's going too far.

1195
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:02,850
- Really?
- Really?

1196
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:03,851
- I...
- Really?

1197
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:04,990
Hey.

1198
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:06,920
- He's good at flirting.
- This is...

1199
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:08,191
fate.

1200
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:09,531
My goodness.

1201
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:12,760
We have the same wallpaper.

1202
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:14,100
Really?

1203
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:15,260
The Eiffel Tower?

1204
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:17,301
- Really? I got chills.
- Where is my phone?

1205
00:46:17,771 --> 00:46:18,801
This is mine.

1206
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:20,270
I took this picture.

1207
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:22,140
Look. Let me show you the side.

1208
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:23,510
- It's crazy.
- What is it?

1209
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:25,241
- Show us too!
- This is incredible.

1210
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:28,640
- Did you take it yourself?
- Yes.

1211
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:29,850
Amazing, right?

1212
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:30,981
It's amazing. I got chills.

1213
00:46:32,151 --> 00:46:33,980
- Did you go to the Eiffel Tower?
- Yes.

1214
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:36,250
- We talked about traveling.
- Yes.

1215
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,421
My favorite spot is the Eiffel Tower.

1216
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:40,220
I love Paris.

1217
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:42,090
The wallpaper on my laptop and tablet...

1218
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,761
are all the Eiffel Tower.

1219
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,660
This could make their conversation...

1220
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:48,260
- unfold smoothly.
- This is so...

1221
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:50,100
- Yes.
- They'd think it's fate.

1222
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:51,101
- Yes.
- They're meant to be.

1223
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:52,501
That's how they talk.

1224
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,441
- By myself...
- Yes.

1225
00:46:57,271 --> 00:46:58,541
I went on a trip to Europe alone.

1226
00:46:58,771 --> 00:46:59,840
- But...
- When?

1227
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:01,110
- Three years ago.
- Three years ago?

1228
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,311
In 2022. I think it was 2022.

1229
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:04,910
When did you go to Europe?

1230
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:06,851
I took this picture in 2022.

1231
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:08,920
- In 2022, in Paris?
- I can't believe it.

1232
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:10,390
- They...
- In front of the Eiffel Tower,

1233
00:47:10,391 --> 00:47:11,790
- they might've passed by one other.
- I'm getting chills.

1234
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:12,891
My goodness.

1235
00:47:13,061 --> 00:47:14,391
- Who did you go with?
- I was there by myself.

1236
00:47:15,891 --> 00:47:17,430
I like to travel alone.

1237
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:18,790
- Really?
- Yes.

1238
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:19,830
This is amazing.

1239
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:21,260
(They both went on the trip on their own.)

1240
00:47:21,261 --> 00:47:22,461
I got goosebumps.

1241
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:26,571
How can we have the same wallpaper?

1242
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:28,071
It's impossible.

1243
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:31,170
I've never seen something like this in my life before.

1244
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:32,840
He is calm,

1245
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:34,910
and I thought we had a lot in common.

1246
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,610
The first signal...

1247
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:39,281
(Our first signal)

1248
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:41,650
Our conversation went smoothly.

1249
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:42,850
She likes to travel,

1250
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:44,521
and she travels alone.

1251
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:46,891
It was completely by chance...

1252
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:49,191
that we had the same wallpaper.

1253
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:53,161
I felt comfortable talking with Su Jin.

1254
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:55,800
I liked it.

1255
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:57,871
I liked it. And...

1256
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:00,500
- I liked it.
- It's totally...

1257
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:01,940
- He basically confessed.
- My gosh!

1258
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:03,440
- He liked it!
- I told you.

1259
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:04,510
- Did you see his eyes?
- Yes.

1260
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:07,241
How many times did he say he liked it?

1261
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:08,980
He must've really liked it.

1262
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:11,110
- I got goosebumps.
- We got a couple.

1263
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:13,120
- We got a couple.
- They're drawn to each other.

1264
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:14,920
- We got a couple.
- We got one.

1265
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:15,981
We got one.

1266
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:18,520
- It's just like a movie.
- This is insane.

1267
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,520
- It's a typical rom-com situation.
- Right.

1268
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:21,660
Things are looking good.

1269
00:48:21,661 --> 00:48:23,890
Whoever will join them in the car later...

1270
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:25,061
might feel uncomfortable.

1271
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,600
They've already built such a strong bond.

1272
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:28,830
- My poor friend.
- This car date...

1273
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:31,530
- has a strong impact.
- And they're inside a car together.

1274
00:48:31,531 --> 00:48:33,841
- My friend has poor timing.
- It has a strong impact.

1275
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:43,911
(Who is the last friend who is a genuinely good person?)

1276
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:48,713
(Who is the last friend who is a genuinely good person?)

1277
00:48:48,714 --> 00:48:49,744
She has a foreign...

1278
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:51,013
- Is she...
- Seriously.

1279
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:53,084
- She looks cool.
- She's here!

1280
00:48:54,384 --> 00:48:55,714
Is she...

1281
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:57,523
- Is she a model?
- I told you.

1282
00:48:57,524 --> 00:48:58,953
- She's so pretty.
- A rom-com protagonist vibe.

1283
00:48:58,954 --> 00:49:00,193
She might beat the Eiffel Tower.

1284
00:49:00,194 --> 00:49:01,293
She has the first love vibe.

1285
00:49:01,294 --> 00:49:02,923
She might overcome the Eiffel Tower.

1286
00:49:02,924 --> 00:49:05,124
- Absolutely.
- I chose that outfit for her.

1287
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:13,910
Where is it?

1288
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,379
- I think we'll see them on the way.
- They're probably here, right?

1289
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,480
- There she is. It's a woman.
- Where is she?

1290
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,010
- I can't see...
- She's wearing a white skirt.

1291
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,980
- Wait. Su Jin became a bit nervous.
- She's pretty.

1292
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,420
- Her eyes...
- She looks very feminine.

1293
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

1294
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:40,269
- Hello.
- Hello.

1295
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,429
- Hello.
- Hello.

1296
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,870
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.

1297
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,800
- Hello.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

1298
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,139
(So Ra's friend, Choi Ji Eun)

1299
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,509
- Gosh, So Ra.
- Hello.

1300
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,710
(So Ra's friend, Choi Ji Eun)

1301
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,880
I'll introduce you to my friend.

1302
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,909
She is an NHB.

1303
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,419
A nerd who hides her beauty.

1304
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,749
Really?

1305
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,950
From her head to toe,

1306
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,290
she's pretty.

1307
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,920
- Here she is.
- She's embarrassed.

1308
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:07,789
She's pretty.

1309
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,289
She's so pretty.

1310
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,530
Hello.

1311
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,729
I'm Choi Ji Eun.

1312
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,269
Kang So Ra's friend, Choi Ji Eun.

1313
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:14,300
(So Ra's friend, Choi Ji Eun)

1314
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,130
(Glancing)

1315
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,940
Ji Eun has five attractive charms, apparently.

1316
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,509
The fortune teller says...

1317
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,739
she does nothing,

1318
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,879
but the men around her...

1319
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,139
go head over heels for her.

1320
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,680
You find out that the men around her have a crush on her already.

1321
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,550
Now, she should date.

1322
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,319
I should, shouldn't I?

1323
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,350
(I really want to date!)

1324
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,760
Ji Eun. Why do you think you're single?

1325
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,860
- I wasn't interested...
- There's more.

1326
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,360
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay.

1327
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,030
I want to hear your friend's voice.

1328
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
This is embarrassing.

1329
00:50:46,801 --> 00:50:48,099
- That's how you act as a friend.
- It's fine.

1330
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,369
- It's so embarrassing.
- Don't worry.

1331
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,499
- You end up talking for them...
- Yes.

1332
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,539
if they're not a smooth talker.

1333
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,739
- Can we hear Ji Eun's voice now?
- Yes.

1334
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,410
- Can we?
- Can we hear it?

1335
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,479
She might've been cutting off...

1336
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,880
the subtle signals that were sent toward her.

1337
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,449
I was busy.

1338
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,420
(In Ji Eun's opinion, she has been too busy.)

1339
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,149
Whenever I ask her what she's doing after my shoot is over,

1340
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,750
she says she's going home.

1341
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,460
All her clothes are very comfortable-looking.

1342
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,220
Those that don't tear easily.

1343
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,630
She wants to change my whole wardrobe.

1344
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,030
We're at a department store.

1345
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,170
Ji Eun is going to be my doll today.

1346
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,639
You look great.

1347
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,550
- This looks pretty on you, too.
- Seriously.

1348
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,109
- You look so pretty.
- You look so pretty.

1349
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,150
(I finally got to do what I wanted.)

1350
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,989
What is your ideal type, Ji Eun?

1351
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,150
My ideal type?

1352
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:43,989
I want someone...

1353
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,559
who looks exemplary.

1354
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,629
Someone with good morals, with a man-who-goes-to-church vibe.

1355
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,729
I don't want her to meet someone...

1356
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,230
who has too many hobbies.

1357
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,900
Someone who rides a motorcycle.

1358
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,600
That's what I want.

1359
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:56,839
You don't ask her if you're right.

1360
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,000
To the person behind me?

1361
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,370
She has no right to choose.

1362
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,439
She has no right.

1363
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,739
(A genuinely good person whose hidden charms we want to see)

1364
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,879
- Hello.
- Hello.

1365
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,410
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1366
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,350
- You're so pretty.
- Hello.

1367
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,149
- Did you get the letter?
- Is it that?

1368
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,819
Did it say someone was coming to pick you up?

1369
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,020
- That's right.
- Did you...

1370
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,060
- There's a flower too.
- Yes.

1371
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,719
- You got the same letter.
- Yes.

1372
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,290
- We came to pick you up.
- Yes.

1373
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,029
- Hello.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

1374
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,929
- What's your name?
- I'm Choi Ji Eun.

1375
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,630
- Ji Eun? Choi Ji Eun.
- Yes.

1376
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:27,869
I'm Choi Ji Eun.

1377
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,499
- Ji Eun? Choi Ji Eun.
- Yes.

1378
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,500
He can't take his eyes off her.

1379
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:32,039
- She surpasses the Eiffel Tower!
- My goodness.

1380
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,469
She surpasses the Eiffel Tower!

1381
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,909
Look at his eyes.

1382
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,239
- They're blazing.
- The Eiffel Tower has gone.

1383
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,309
But the Eiffel Tower.

1384
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,439
She can surpass the Eiffel Tower.

1385
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,649
- She can easily surpass it.
- You can do it!

1386
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,250
He might change the wallpaper right away.

1387
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,080
- I am Shin Dong Ha.
- Dong Ha.

1388
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,250
I am friends with Hur Young Ji of KARA.

1389
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,020
Hello.

1390
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,989
I am Kang Su Jin.

1391
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,229
I am soccer player Kim Young Kwang's friend.

1392
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,689
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1393
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,029
- Hello.
- What was your name again?

1394
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,800
- Choi Ji Eun.
- Right, Ji Eun.

1395
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,729
You're the last to join.

1396
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,369
- Really?
- Yes. Everyone else is here.

1397
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,069
- I've only met you two.
- Really?

1398
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,339
You guys only met two so far,

1399
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,809
- but I know the rest.
- Really?

1400
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,110
Yes. She said everyone was already here.

1401
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,709
I'm the last? I feel the pressure.

1402
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,580
- Aren't you curious?
- I am but...

1403
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,780
I'm feeling shy to be the last to join.

1404
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,880
Do you feel pressured?

1405
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,920
When I first saw Ji Eun...

1406
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,359
I thought Su Jin was really nice too,

1407
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,730
and when I saw Ji Eun, I thought,

1408
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,259
"There are two of them?"

1409
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,330
"This is good."

1410
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,370
(Laughing)

1411
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,639
They passed the test.

1412
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,800
Hold on.

1413
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,599
- What is he doing?
- You can't do that.

1414
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,269
- What is he doing?
- He sways so easily.

1415
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,339
What is he doing?

1416
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,139
- He should be steadfast.
- What is he doing?

1417
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,039
How can he like two women?

1418
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,079
It's...

1419
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,010
their first time meeting.

1420
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,419
It's okay. You don't have to...

1421
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,919
- You can feel at ease.
- I will.

1422
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,149
Su Jin is very conscious of her.

1423
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,989
- I think Su Jin is a bit upset.
- Yes. She's conscious.

1424
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,920
- I think Su Jin is a bit upset.
- She's glancing.

1425
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,860
Did you...

1426
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,859
get close to the others?

1427
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,360
More or less.

1428
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,700
- Really? In that short while?
- In those four hours.

1429
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,799
- Really?
- When she came to pick me up,

1430
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,770
she looked so relaxed.

1431
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:11,269
- I...
- I was very stiff.

1432
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,799
I know what's going on back there.

1433
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,410
But you two don't.

1434
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,940
- I know everything.
- Yes.

1435
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,110
- Oh, no.
- This is fun.

1436
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,779
Everyone else will be new to you.

1437
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,880
- Right.
- Except for the two of us.

1438
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,019
Well, we've just seen each other for ten minutes only as well.

1439
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,849
- I see. Only ten minutes.
- Yes.

1440
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,020
- I just got here too.
- Right.

1441
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,319
- You're Su Jin.
- I'm Su Jin.

1442
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,690
- I'm Dong Ha.
- You're Dong Ha.

1443
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,529
If you look closely, his belly button...

1444
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,430
- is facing toward So Ra's friend.
- His belly button?

1445
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,199
The remaining three people? Let me help you.

1446
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,500
Gosh, thank you.

1447
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,640
- Dong Ha will drive us there.
- Right.

1448
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,800
You all must be great drivers.

1449
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:49,010
(Our first encounter that felt a bit more special)

1450
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,909
- Do you not feel hot or cold?
- I'm okay.

1451
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,280
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1452
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,120
He keeps looking.

1453
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,330
Right. Windy Hill was the famous spot here.

1454
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,440
I heard Windy Hill is a famous tourist spot here.

1455
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,509
It's really... Did you say that you've been to Geoje before, Ji Eun?

1456
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,840
No. It's my first time here.

1457
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,710
- It's really windy at Windy Hill.
- Right.

1458
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,109
Is that why it got its name?

1459
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,180
- Yes.
- I see.

1460
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,780
How should I put it?

1461
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,420
You have to give up on your style.

1462
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,219
The wind will give you slaps.

1463
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,190
- Right. Is it like Jeju Island?
- Yes.

1464
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,030
I saw Dong Ha trying to be the icebreaker for us.

1465
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,399
As an introvert,

1466
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,399
I felt really grateful...

1467
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,870
for him to take that role.

1468
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,899
- They have opposing charms.
- They've been put together.

1469
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,969
Right.

1470
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,139
They were matched like that.

1471
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,139
- They were matched like that.
- Right.

1472
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,779
I think Ji Eun is quite an introvert.

1473
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,239
- She's a true introvert.
- Right.

1474
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,349
Let's say her heart is this much open.

1475
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,619
When a guy she is interested in keeps knocking on her,

1476
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,920
she opens up the doors all of a sudden.

1477
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,019
- Really?
- Dong Ha being like that...

1478
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,719
- really relieves me.
- Really?

1479
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,089
I think he will be able to make her feel comfortable.

1480
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:14,730
This was what I felt from this short clip.

1481
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:18,329
I think Dong Ha...

1482
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,229
will really shake things up.

1483
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,799
- I got that feeling.
- I see.

1484
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,739
He's someone who pokes around...

1485
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,009
- to test their hearts.
- They're in trouble.

1486
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,569
I got that feeling from him.

1487
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,209
I think he switched the Eiffel Tower wallpaper...

1488
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,040
- without anyone seeing him.
- Right.

1489
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,649
- They're grocery shopping.
- Is that a mart?

1490
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:37,649
We'll buy the things on the list first.

1491
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:38,819
- Okay.
- We can make changes.

1492
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,190
- We can take "water" out.
- Sure.

1493
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,489
- What's on the list?
- They look good together.

1494
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,320
- Meat and vegetables.
- Right.

1495
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,489
- And seasoned green onions.
- Seasoned green onions.

1496
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,560
We need these. Two packs would be enough, right?

1497
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:49,930
Only two packs?

1498
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,500
Just get four.

1499
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,330
I eat a lot of vegetables.

1500
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,900
There's the meat!

1501
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,069
- We can get...
- We can get this first.

1502
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,109
- Pork belly.
- Should we get...

1503
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,239
one pack of pork shoulder and one pack of pork belly?

1504
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,280
That sounds good.

1505
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,410
Great. I want some pork jowl too, all of a sudden.

1506
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,150
This is exciting.

1507
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,049
Grocery shopping will make anyone get closer to someone.

1508
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,519
- Right.
- Even if they are strangers.

1509
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,290
It's a moment to share each other's preferences.

1510
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,019
Shall we take a look at the olive oil and wine?

1511
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,830
Sure. We need onions too.

1512
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:23,059
We're having meat, so it should be red wine, right?

1513
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,130
Sounds good.

1514
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,029
Is there a type of wine that you like?

1515
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,429
I do like white wine.

1516
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,439
- White wine?
- Yes.

1517
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,670
Let's get some white wine too then.

1518
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,900
Then...

1519
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,710
- Jeong Geun is really considerate.
- Excuse me.

1520
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,240
Two bottles of these.

1521
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,609
Should we also get...

1522
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,680
- two bottles of red wine?
- Sure.

1523
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,679
What else did we need? What were we missing again?

1524
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,950
Gosh, that looks good.

1525
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,190
Can I get some?

1526
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,220
- You can choose some snacks.
- Snacks?

1527
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,990
We'll get a twisted donut.

1528
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,560
- Should we share these too?
- Sounds good.

1529
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:02,400
And a big one that we can share with everyone.

1530
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:04,340
I think this will be enough.

1531
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,470
Can I...

1532
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,740
have a donut?

1533
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,940
- "Can I have a donut?" - A donut?

1534
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:13,949
Just one.

1535
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:15,309
She started referring to herself.

1536
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:16,810
- Go ahead.
- "I..."

1537
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,189
I wanted to have donuts starting from this morning.

1538
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,459
You know how young kids snack while following their moms around...

1539
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,790
when they're grocery shopping?

1540
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,229
You remind me of them.

1541
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,899
(The two seem to have gotten closer than the start.)

1542
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,960
An immature child.

1543
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,669
- I'm going to... Yes.
- Is it good?

1544
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,830
I'm going to get puffy tomorrow.

1545
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,900
Aren't you having too much bread?

1546
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,100
Hold on.

1547
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,479
What is he dusting off?

1548
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,149
The donut wouldn't go near her back like this.

1549
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,249
- Isn't it her dandruff?
- She must've been startled.

1550
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,949
- She got the donut on purpose!
- "Gosh!"

1551
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,479
She got it on purpose?

1552
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,919
It naturally led to physical contact.

1553
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,050
(Feeling proud)

1554
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:56,990
You're getting it all over yourself.

1555
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,059
The sugar is all the way back there?

1556
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,060
Are you eating with your back or what?

1557
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,390
I feel embarrassed.

1558
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,330
Aren't you enjoying it a bit too much?

1559
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,760
It's really good though.

1560
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,969
If that brought up my interest in him,

1561
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,040
I believe it's true.

1562
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:16,410
He feels cold but warm at the same time.

1563
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,039
(They felt new charms during their time alone.)

1564
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,140
At that moment...

1565
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,750
It was...

1566
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,250
When she became happier eating the donut,

1567
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,920
she reminded me of a squirrel.

1568
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:33,660
I thought she was cute.

1569
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,159
- It's over if he found her cute.
- Already?

1570
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,929
- Squirrel means game over.
- It's over when that happens.

1571
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,299
It's over when a squirrel is mentioned, right?

1572
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,530
- It's over?
- Yes, it's over.

1573
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:42,769
(Getting up)

1574
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:43,899
- Hold on! What was that?
- They just met!

1575
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,499
- Why did he do that?
- Hold on!

1576
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,769
- Why do that?
- That's cheating.

1577
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,509
- They just met each other!
- Stop!

1578
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,009
- What?
- What is going on? Hold on!

1579
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,309
Are there cars passing by or people walking by?

1580
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:54,009
- Hold on.
- Why do that all of a sudden?

1581
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,909
- Were there shopping carts?
- That much is fine.

1582
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,550
- Excuse me.
- That much is fine.

1583
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,579
What could possibly be dangerous at that moment?

1584
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,649
- What was that?
- I can't believe it.

1585
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,449
Dusting the sugar on her back was fine, but this isn't.

1586
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,759
- I can't believe it.
- They just met.

1587
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,719
- Gosh!
- Da Hye was fine with it too.

1588
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,559
- He was just...
- Placing the hand...

1589
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,789
- on one's core?
- Did you teach him that, Gwan Hee?

1590
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:12,160
- I'm fine with the shoulders.
- That can't happen.

1591
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,030
- The shoulders are fine.
- It wasn't even this.

1592
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,899
- But the core?
- After seeing the position,

1593
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,839
- I think I should apologize.
- Right.

1594
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,439
- I'm sorry.
- That happened so naturally.

1595
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,139
- He apologized. Let's sit down.
- That almost upset me.

1596
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,070
Well, Da Hye didn't do anything about it.

1597
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,680
- Gosh. Nice one, Jeong Geun.
- That's minus five points for him.

1598
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,380
- Great job with the shopping.
- Great job!

1599
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,200
Your snacks mustn't get damaged.

1600
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,500
- My snacks.
- Right.

1601
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,099
- "Your snacks mustn't get damaged." - "My snacks?"

1602
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,469
- "My snacks?" - Are you serious?

1603
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,239
- He said that?
- That was a bit too much.

1604
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,270
Right.

1605
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,679
Are you really going to share the bread with the others?

1606
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,939
Of course.

1607
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,810
- You're not...
- It's a secret that I had two.

1608
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:03,409
It was supposed to be one for each person.

1609
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,849
You're not going to hide it in your room, are you?

1610
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:05,980
I won't do that.

1611
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:08,220
- Come and check.
- Was it one for each person?

1612
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,749
Yes. That was the plan,

1613
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:10,990
- but I ate two.
- I will get mine too, right?

1614
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,659
My friend is becoming cuter.

1615
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,129
- Is she not like that with you?
- She's speaking in a cuter way.

1616
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,859
She is cute, but...

1617
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,059
- But she never spoke like that?
- Yes.

1618
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,230
She doesn't talk to me like that.

1619
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:25,270
(The two start unpacking the things they bought.)

1620
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,370
There we go.

1621
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,070
(About to fall)

1622
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:35,980
Why is it so low?

1623
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:39,050
Careful.

1624
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,590
(The two are working well together.)

1625
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,690
I should put in the snacks too.

1626
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,569
- Is my friend missing?
- Where is he?

1627
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,770
- Where's Sin Young and Hyun Jin?
- Where's Sin Young?

1628
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,539
- There she is!
- There she is!

1629
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,540
- She's finally here.
- She's here.

1630
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,539
- She has coffee!
- Thank you.

1631
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,039
- We're here.
- They brought coffee.

1632
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,840
- They brought coffee.
- My friend is...

1633
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,079
Gosh, you bought bread too?

1634
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,479
- I bought us bread.
- I love it!

1635
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,780
- You bought bread?
- Yes. I bought us bread.

1636
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,480
- Thank you so much.
- There are a lot of snacks.

1637
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:17,119
What do you think of the snack selection?

1638
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,689
- Gosh, I love it.
- I love it.

1639
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,789
Da Hye thought of everyone...

1640
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,260
and asked us to buy some bread.

1641
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,330
But I heard that Hyun Jin doesn't like eating snacks.

1642
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,800
- I don't really eat snacks.
- Right.

1643
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,369
You can see that she's looking happy right now, right?

1644
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,969
She's thinking, "It's all mine."

1645
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:34,009
But I can't eat snacks before eating the meat.

1646
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,809
I really want to have some meat.

1647
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:40,040
(Jeong Geun quietly heads toward the kitchen.)

1648
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,280
(He cuts up the bread that Da Hye chose.)

1649
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:46,180
But this really looks amazing.

1650
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:47,519
There are red beans above the blueberries...

1651
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,550
and mugwort underneath.

1652
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,450
What a great choice.

1653
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,019
- What a great choice.
- Look at her big reactions.

1654
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,929
- I told her to do that.
- Are you going to have it or not?

1655
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,059
- Be quick to speak.
- Just one bite.

1656
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,729
Just one bite?

1657
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,529
We can have one bite each. It won't make a difference.

1658
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:01,800
- You should have some too, Geon Wu.
- I'll have just a little.

1659
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,170
Yes!

1660
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,669
- Who would say no?
- Who would say no?

1661
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:08,410
I feel proud after hearing that Geon Wu is going to have some.

1662
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,739
It feels like I shouldn't be the only one to miss out.

1663
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,110
It feels like I got his approval.

1664
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,710
Take a look at how it looks.

1665
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,680
(Excited to the max)

1666
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,920
- I don't think he'll have any.
- I'll have some.

1667
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,389
It feels like I can't miss out.

1668
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:22,619
- Well, - We'll all have a bite.

1669
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,920
- we should all get a piece.
- Right.

1670
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,460
I'll get this one.

1671
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,360
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1672
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,670
Come and eat.

1673
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,579
(The pick-up group finally returns.)

1674
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:48,080
This is the entrance. Keep going forward.

1675
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,249
- They're back.
- They're back.

1676
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,679
I'm curious about how things will pan out.

1677
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,380
Our wallpapers gave me goosebumps.

1678
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:53,990
We have the same wallpaper.

1679
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,419
It's crazy, isn't it?

1680
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,620
- Shouldn't we show them?
- The Eiffel Tower.

1681
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,189
- What?
- She mentioned it again.

1682
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,760
(Flirting with the Eiffel Tower?)

1683
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,959
Why did she have to mention that at that moment?

1684
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,670
- I guess Su Jin...
- Let's try to...

1685
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:10,700
- felt something from that.
- The Eiffel Tower signal?

1686
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,040
Let me do it for you. It's heavy.

1687
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,740
Thank you. I'm really sorry.

1688
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,750
I'm really sorry!

1689
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,150
This is our home.

1690
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,919
- I see all of their shoes.
- It's obvious...

1691
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,089
- They are all inside.
- All eight pairs are there.

1692
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:30,550
- They're entering!
- Gosh.

1693
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:32,660
The new friends are coming in.

1694
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,230
I'm curious about how everyone will react.

1695
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,530
We're here.

1696
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,399
- I got so surprised.
- You're here.

1697
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,769
You're already eating?

1698
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:44,199
- Gosh. Hello.
- Gosh.

1699
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,239
- Hello.
- I got so surprised.

1700
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,439
- What's going on?
- What?

1701
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,669
(The friends get surprised as there are two new friends.)

1702
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,410
It wasn't just one new friend?

1703
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,509
- Hello.
- There are two new friends?

1704
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:52,579
- What?
- Hello.

1705
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:53,609
- That's why...
- Oh, my gosh.

1706
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,149
- I'll help you with that.
- It's okay.

1707
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,980
- You went through so much.
- My goodness.

1708
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,919
- Hello.
- Hello.

1709
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,949
- Give...
- Hello.

1710
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,319
Give us your suitcases.

1711
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,949
Should we just greet each other...

1712
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,020
- after putting away our things?
- Sure.

1713
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:05,260
What's going on?

1714
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,629
When I first saw her, in terms of her looks...

1715
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:14,299
she felt kind of like me, sort of like a foreigner.

1716
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,000
She felt really charming to me.

1717
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:21,170
I thought that she was someone who men would find interest in easily...

1718
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,810
with her personality and looks.

1719
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:27,810
- Hello.
- Your suitcase.

1720
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:31,050
When I first saw Choi Ji Eun,

1721
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,919
she felt like an idol trainee,

1722
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,719
and she had a strong image...

1723
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,620
of someone with a lot of talent.

1724
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,330
I thought she was an idol star.

1725
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,229
- The slippers...
- Right. I'll carry it.

1726
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,529
There aren't any slippers that can be used outside, right?

1727
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,129
- Where were they again?
- Watch out.

1728
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:48,569
There weren't any slippers that could be used outside.

1729
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,669
Right? There were only six pairs, right?

1730
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,940
- Use these.
- For now, use these.

1731
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:53,499
Where should I go?

1732
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,970
It's to the right.

1733
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,110
With Dong Ha's first impression,

1734
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,580
he felt like someone who would suit me the most.

1735
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,179
And I also thought...

1736
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,149
that he would be someone who would work well with me.

1737
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,349
How should I put it?

1738
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,049
As soon as I saw him,

1739
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:08,249
he felt like a musician.

1740
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,490
That was what I felt.

1741
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,989
He felt like someone...

1742
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,290
that was clean.

1743
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,060
I could just...

1744
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,999
tell right away.

1745
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,130
He felt like someone who was clean.

1746
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:23,900
Women like men with clean vibes.

1747
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,240
- Someone neat.
- Right. Women like neat men.

1748
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,240
- Would you like one?
- It's great to meet you.

1749
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,710
They're all gathered now.

1750
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,610
Oh, my gosh.

1751
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,209
We should first...

1752
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,180
I know everyone. I'm the only one who knows everyone.

1753
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,219
Should we introduce ourselves first...

1754
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,219
- and hear from the new friends?
- Sounds good.

1755
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:41,719
My lovebud...

1756
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,789
- is Mi Joo, - I see.

1757
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,590
and my name is Lee Da Hye.

1758
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:47,090
Thank you.

1759
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:48,630
It's great to see you.

1760
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:49,989
My lovebud...

1761
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:52,129
is Ji Ye Eun,

1762
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,900
and I am Kim Sin Young.

1763
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:58,640
Hello. I am Cho Sae Ho's friend, Kim Geon Wu.

1764
01:06:58,770 --> 01:06:59,870
It's great to see you.

1765
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:03,139
I'm Actor Kim Nam Hee's friend,

1766
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:05,240
and my name is Oh Hyun Jin. It's nice to meet you.

1767
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:09,010
Hello. I am a friend of the soccer player, Kim Young Kwang.

1768
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,250
I am Kang Su Jin. It's great to see you.

1769
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,079
Hello. I am...

1770
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,620
a friend of the leader of Inferno,

1771
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:17,989
Lee Gwan Hee.

1772
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,460
- "Leader of Inferno?" - My name is Ha Jeong Geun.

1773
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,860
- Ha Jeong...
- Geun.

1774
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,700
Hello. I am...

1775
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:26,929
a friend of KARA's Hur Young Ji.

1776
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:28,300
My name is Shin Dong Ha.

1777
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:29,600
I see.

1778
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,300
It's great to see you.

1779
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,399
Gosh, she used a lot of blush.

1780
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,669
Hello. I am...

1781
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,710
Actress Kang So Ra's friend, Choi Ji Eun.

1782
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,040
It's great to see you.

1783
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,709
- We have finally all gathered.
- Right.

1784
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,780
- We have finally all gathered.
- It's great to see you all.

1785
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,979
I pretended to listen to everyone talk...

1786
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,049
and secretly kept memorizing everyone's names.

1787
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:47,050
Same here.

1788
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:48,249
- Let's go around one more time.
- Right.

1789
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,689
- It's hard to memorize names.
- Right.

1790
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,690
- Da Hye?
- Yes.

1791
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:51,819
- Sin Young?
- Gosh.

1792
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,820
- Geon Wu?
- Yes.

1793
01:07:52,821 --> 01:07:54,260
Hyun Jin and Su Jin?

1794
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,560
- Jeong Geun?
- You got it.

1795
01:07:55,561 --> 01:07:56,589
- You memorized it all.
- Gosh.

1796
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:57,759
- You're Dong Ha?
- Right.

1797
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,799
What?

1798
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,060
- You're Dong Ha?
- Right.

1799
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,030
He's meticulous. My friend is a meticulous one.

1800
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,469
Please tell me your names one more time.

1801
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:07,639
I am Dong Ha. Ha, as in "sky" in Korean.

1802
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,169
- What's your full name?
- Shin Dong Ha.

1803
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,170
Shin Dong Ha.

1804
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:11,980
But you got all of their names right.

1805
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,079
But earlier...

1806
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,450
He's really quick to memorize names.

1807
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:18,879
I kept telling him our names when I was with him.

1808
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,379
- Right. She told me...
- Right?

1809
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,850
how everyone looked.

1810
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:24,719
I told him that there were three men...

1811
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:25,960
and a total of six people.

1812
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,420
Did you make the connections from her descriptions?

1813
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:31,229
This makes things harder to predict. Jeong Geun said that Ji Eun...

1814
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:33,300
looked like an idol star and showed interest.

1815
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,869
- Isn't that a huge compliment?
- Right.

1816
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,129
A huge compliment.

1817
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,739
In your eyes, So Ra,

1818
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,839
who do you think your friend suits better with...

1819
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,909
out of Dong Ha and Jeong Geun?

1820
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,480
I've been told about Ji Eun's ideal type.

1821
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,249
I suddenly can't remember his name.

1822
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:51,219
He's often the judge for idol audition shows.

1823
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,549
- Lee Seok Hoon?
- Right!

1824
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:54,389
- I see.
- Lee Seok Hoon?

1825
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,319
- That's exactly Dong Ha.
- That's exactly Dong Ha.

1826
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,890
- Right. I think she would be...
- That's exactly Dong Ha.

1827
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,820
interested in Dong Ha based on his looks.

1828
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,260
That is my opinion.

1829
01:09:02,261 --> 01:09:03,789
But in my opinion,

1830
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:05,259
I think the main star is Jeong Geun...

1831
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,430
based on what we watched.

1832
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,900
Don't you think so?

1833
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,130
No. I don't think so.

1834
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,769
Jeong Geun feels like the bad guy,

1835
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:13,599
- and Dong Ha is the good guy.
- Right.

1836
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,969
In my opinion,

1837
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,709
I think Dong Ha is closer to being the bad guy.

1838
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,579
- Jeong Geun is super innocent.
- But...

1839
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,439
- You're completely wrong.
- But Dong Ha...

1840
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,509
Jeong Geun!

1841
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:23,349
Guys are good at reading other guys.

1842
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:24,419
Hold on!

1843
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,750
Jeong Geun did this.

1844
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,249
- How could you say...
- Hey, stop it!

1845
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,920
- What did Dong Ha do?
- Stop it!

1846
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,649
What did Dong Ha do?

1847
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,019
Before you get upset, Young Ji,

1848
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:33,690
please talk about Geon Wu too.

1849
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,859
(Laughing)

1850
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:35,930
My Geon Wu.

1851
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,759
He worked hard to dress up,

1852
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,859
but no one is paying attention.

1853
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,299
It's the same with Hyun Jin.

1854
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,370
(Disappointed)

1855
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:42,829
After watching the clip,

1856
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:44,230
I believe there are genuinely good people gathered...

1857
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,899
that perfectly match our show's intention.

1858
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,969
They are genuinely good people.

1859
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,209
I am excited to see...

1860
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:52,440
how things will pan out with these eight people.

1861
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,779
(The first day on Geoje Island passes by.)

1862
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:56,209
The sunset is beautiful.

1863
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:58,850
The day is passing by.

1864
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,119
- Right.
- Then...

1865
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,720
- He's getting worked up.
- Right.

1866
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,289
- Right.
- I just...

1867
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:05,789
But I agree though.

1868
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:07,060
I think that's true.

1869
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,060
- What?
- What is it?

1870
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,429
- Right.
- Did she get a message?

1871
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:12,129
It's a definite choice.

1872
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,229
It's a definite choice and he went with that.

1873
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:15,699
This embarrassment...

1874
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,129
and that being able to...

1875
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,699
- show the lowest part of you...
- What?

1876
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,869
What? Where is she going?

1877
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:22,670
(Da Hye heads somewhere with a serious face.)

1878
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,610
- Where is she going?
- What's going on?

1879
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,180
(She opens the door to the Mysterious Room?)

1880
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:31,450
- It's the Mysterious Room.
- Are they having a vote?

1881
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,750
Gosh, look at this.

1882
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:35,749
- What is this?
- I think this place...

1883
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,050
has something special.

1884
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,519
(The secret area that everyone was curious about)

1885
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,889
It looks special.

1886
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:42,630
(The secret area that everyone was curious about)

1887
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,370
(What is this place that even the cat is curious about?)

1888
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,140
"Who is the person that knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1889
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:59,310
- The first impression.
- I'm getting goosebumps.

1890
01:10:59,311 --> 01:11:00,539
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- Me too.

1891
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,110
It must be a vote for the first impression.

1892
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:03,879
Is it a vote based on their first impressions?

1893
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,249
That must be it.

1894
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,749
"Who is the person..."

1895
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,489
"Who is the person..."

1896
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,049
"Who is the person..."

1897
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:12,319
"Who is the person..."

1898
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,289
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1899
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:17,429
(Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?)

1900
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:20,060
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1901
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,629
It's the Heart Room.

1902
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:24,769
(The Heart Room where one's heart is whispered out at the end of the day)

1903
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:25,800
That's amazing.

1904
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:30,809
(Who is the one who knocked at the door of Da Hye's heart?)

1905
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:34,010
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1906
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,049
"Open the door of that person."

1907
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,750
(Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?)

1908
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,320
Geon Wu?

1909
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,720
Geon Wu went through a lot today.

1910
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,290
Hyun Jin.

1911
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:50,490
Jeong Geun.

1912
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,930
It must be Jeong Geun.

1913
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:59,770
It's hard to choose! What do I do?

1914
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,120
- What?
- Just go for it, Da Hye!

1915
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,079
Just go for it, Da Hye. It's okay.

1916
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,690
Who is it? I'm so curious.

1917
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,589
(Ha Jeong Geun)

1918
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,020
- It's Jeong Geun.
- It's Jeong Geun.

1919
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,360
Jeong Geun did well.

1920
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:25,260
Well...

1921
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:29,070
I think it may be because we haven't talked that much.

1922
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,400
This emotion.

1923
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,170
It's hard to grasp.

1924
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,110
Hold on.

1925
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:40,839
Jeong Geun was the only one whom I wanted to talk to more.

1926
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,409
I wanted to spend some time with him.

1927
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:45,820
(Da Hye wants to learn more about Jeong Geun.)

1928
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,090
It was supposed to be one for each person.

1929
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,090
I want to know more about him.

1930
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,420
As I wanted to know more about him,

1931
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:56,390
I chose Jeong Geun.

1932
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,500
If I open the door...

1933
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,270
What is this?

1934
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,429
Do I read it?

1935
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,900
(There's a letter inside?)

1936
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,439
(What is the letter?)

1937
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,509
(The Lovebud Guarantee written by the lovebuds!)

1938
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:11,680
- Right.
- Right.

1939
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,009
- The ones that we wrote?
- Right.

1940
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,340
- We wrote them earlier.
- I see.

1941
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:16,780
So that's the Lovebud Guarantee.

1942
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,920
I can tell that it was written by Gwan Hee.

1943
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,799
Let's have a great time, everyone.

1944
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,270
(Da Hye's exciting first selection is complete!)

1945
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:37,270
- They went grocery shopping.
- Right.

1946
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,369
They spent a lot of time together.

1947
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,370
- Right.
- Right.

1948
01:13:40,371 --> 01:13:41,509
- They were together.
- They talked a lot too.

1949
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:43,669
Da Hye felt comfortable with him.

1950
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,309
Da Hye spoke cutely in front of Jeong Geun.

1951
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:47,280
- Right.
- "Snack."

1952
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,710
Who is next?

1953
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,250
- Jeong Geun.
- It's Jeong Geun.

1954
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,520
This is big.

1955
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:56,189
Will it be Ji Eun?

1956
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:57,919
- Ji Eun or Da Hye?
- Right, Da Hye.

1957
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,920
- Will it be Ji Eun or Da Hye?
- Was Da Hye...

1958
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:03,230
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1959
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,729
"After removing the name tag of the person of interest,"

1960
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:09,629
"state the reason in front of the camera."

1961
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:10,870
(Who will Jeong Geun choose after getting chosen by Da Hye?)

1962
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,239
I'm really curious.

1963
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,770
I'm curious who Jeong Geun will choose.

1964
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,469
I think they will choose each other.

1965
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:19,210
- I think so.
- Will they?

1966
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:23,210
Will they? Or will he choose Ji Eun?

1967
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:25,480
Gosh. This is tough.

1968
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,350
- Da Hye?
- Is it Sin Young?

1969
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,590
Yes, Jeong Geun. The first impression matters.

1970
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:37,960
(Who will be Jeong Geun's first choice?)

1971
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:44,389
(Who will be Jeong Geun's first choice?)

1972
01:14:54,099 --> 01:14:55,898
(Choi Ji Eun)

1973
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:58,569
The one who has knocked on my door...

1974
01:14:59,292 --> 01:15:01,502
is Choi Ji Eun.

1975
01:15:01,632 --> 01:15:03,162
- What?
- It's Ji Eun.

1976
01:15:03,602 --> 01:15:04,971
- I thought it'd be Ji Eun.
- You were right.

1977
01:15:04,972 --> 01:15:07,332
- Gosh. He's something.
- Was that the end?

1978
01:15:07,872 --> 01:15:09,241
- Did it end like this?
- I'm sorry.

1979
01:15:09,242 --> 01:15:11,041
But she'll get angry if you don't show the rest.

1980
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:14,342
- Show what happens next.
- Jeong Geun is...

1981
01:15:14,442 --> 01:15:15,711
- really amazing.
- It's okay.

1982
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,711
- This is fun.
- Gosh. It's fun.

1983
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:19,712
- You're okay, right?
- After all that.

1984
01:15:20,882 --> 01:15:23,022
After all that, he goes in the back and chooses...

1985
01:15:23,182 --> 01:15:24,251
This was about the first impression.

1986
01:15:24,252 --> 01:15:26,122
- He doesn't know what that is.
- I'll apologize.

1987
01:15:26,292 --> 01:15:27,822
- I'll accept your apology.
- I'm sorry.

1988
01:15:27,892 --> 01:15:29,661
- Unlike what we expected, - Exactly.

1989
01:15:29,662 --> 01:15:30,922
- It was unexpected.
- he chose Ji Eun.

1990
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:32,992
- Exactly.
- He chose her.

1991
01:15:33,432 --> 01:15:35,631
As for Jeong Geun,

1992
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:38,771
- Ji Eun is totally his type.
- Is she totally his type?

1993
01:15:38,772 --> 01:15:41,072
Da Hye is totally my type.

1994
01:15:41,132 --> 01:15:43,742
- You don't have to say that here.
- We didn't ask you.

1995
01:15:43,902 --> 01:15:46,571
You're making it even worse.

1996
01:15:46,572 --> 01:15:49,411
Jeong Geun and I have totally different tastes in women.

1997
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:50,682
His true friend expected this.

1998
01:15:51,242 --> 01:15:53,251
It's not that I was chosen,

1999
01:15:53,252 --> 01:15:55,622
- but I feel very proud.
- That's right.

2000
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,481
- I somehow feel...
- Your friend was chosen.

2001
01:15:57,482 --> 01:15:58,551
- Exactly.
- Yes.

2002
01:15:58,552 --> 01:16:00,192
It boosts my confidence.

2003
01:16:00,452 --> 01:16:01,991
- Thank you, Ji Eun.
- It's all right.

2004
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:04,121
- But...
- But Da Hye chose Jeong Geun.

2005
01:16:04,122 --> 01:16:05,491
Right. Da Hye chose Jeong Geun.

2006
01:16:05,492 --> 01:16:08,602
It's Da Hye's choice, so I respect it.

2007
01:16:08,662 --> 01:16:10,831
- This is only the first night.
- Yes.

2008
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:13,301
- Their choice might change anytime.
- You're right.

2009
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,671
It's only the first impression.

2010
01:16:14,672 --> 01:16:15,702
- Right.
- It's fine.

2011
01:16:15,902 --> 01:16:17,902
- I'm fine.
- Why are you boiling, though?

2012
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:19,441
- Why are you boiling with anger?
- I don't know.

2013
01:16:19,442 --> 01:16:22,242
It feels like he is cheating after everything they did.

2014
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:24,851
- That's true.
- I'm a bit hurt.

2015
01:16:24,852 --> 01:16:26,511
- That's what it feels like.
- My heart feels heavy.

2016
01:16:26,512 --> 01:16:29,481
What did you write on the Lovebud Guarantee...

2017
01:16:29,482 --> 01:16:31,851
that Da Hye said it sounded like you, Gwan Hee?

2018
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:35,161
It's just... I was asked to introduce Jeong Geun.

2019
01:16:35,162 --> 01:16:38,061
- I wrote that he's like a turtle.
- A turtle.

2020
01:16:38,062 --> 01:16:40,761
Because the way he speaks and his personality...

2021
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,261
- In what aspect is he a turtle?
- But for a turtle...

2022
01:16:42,262 --> 01:16:43,762
- Why is he a turtle?
- A turtle?

2023
01:16:43,862 --> 01:16:45,471
- Why is he like a turtle?
- He's not a turtle.

2024
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:46,572
(Gwan Hee sparks up a turtle controversy.)

2025
01:16:47,032 --> 01:16:49,841
He's a turtle, but he's so touchy-feely.

2026
01:16:49,842 --> 01:16:51,971
I thought he was a sea turtle.

2027
01:16:51,972 --> 01:16:53,941
I didn't know he was a Ninja Turtle.

2028
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:56,281
- That's why.
- What is confusing...

2029
01:16:56,282 --> 01:16:57,981
is that Jeong Geun did a good job.

2030
01:16:57,982 --> 01:16:59,311
- You're right.
- He didn't do something wrong.

2031
01:16:59,312 --> 01:17:01,251
- He impressed others well.
- He impressed them very well.

2032
01:17:01,252 --> 01:17:02,951
Yes. I can't wait for next week.

2033
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,392
- Will your friend make coffee?
- Is it over?

2034
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,621
Do we get to see your friend...

2035
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:09,061
- make coffee next week?
- Yes.

2036
01:17:09,062 --> 01:17:10,361
- Okay.
- Next week,

2037
01:17:10,362 --> 01:17:12,992
you'll see Hyun Jin making coffee.

2038
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:14,962
Please look forward to it.

2039
01:17:15,002 --> 01:17:17,062
I hope the coffee is for Su Jin.

2040
01:17:18,032 --> 01:17:20,231
I can't wait to see what will happen...

2041
01:17:20,232 --> 01:17:21,601
- next week.
- That's right.

2042
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:23,072
- I really hope...
- Yes.

2043
01:17:23,272 --> 01:17:24,842
my friend's name tag...

2044
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:26,872
will be picked.

2045
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:29,411
- Please.
- Me too.

2046
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:30,481
- Please.
- Please.

2047
01:17:30,482 --> 01:17:33,382
- Yes. I really hope so.
- Yes.

2048
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:35,981
That will be all for today.

2049
01:17:35,982 --> 01:17:38,552
Who will be the person who will knock on the door of your heart?

2050
01:17:38,592 --> 01:17:39,592
See you next week.

2051
01:17:39,593 --> 01:17:41,222
- Knock, knock.
- Knock, knock.

2052
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:43,492
(Date My Friend)

2053
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,832
(The voting on the first impressions continues.)

2054
01:17:46,432 --> 01:17:48,402
(I had to think it over...)

2055
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:51,532
(about whom to choose.)

2056
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:53,972
(I'm still confused.)

2057
01:17:54,472 --> 01:17:57,002
(Nice. I liked it.)

2058
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:58,641
As soon as I saw her, I was like...

2059
01:17:58,642 --> 01:17:59,942
(I want to know about her.)

2060
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:03,782
(Who knocked on the door to my heart?)

2061
01:18:04,582 --> 01:18:05,782
I'm nervous.

2062
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:10,122
(Who will be their first choices?)

2063
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:11,891
- What?
- What?

2064
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:12,892
My goodness!

2065
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:14,422
- Who is it?
- Who?

2066
01:18:19,692 --> 01:18:21,602
Gosh. This is...

2067
01:18:25,502 --> 01:18:26,902
It was totally unexpected.

2068
01:18:28,302 --> 01:18:31,672
(The one who knocked on my heart was...)

2069
01:18:31,842 --> 01:18:33,512
- Really?
- Gosh.

2070
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,182
I don't know about her either.

2071
01:18:35,242 --> 01:18:37,482
(The unpredictable voting on their first impressions)

2072
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,751
(This is what your hearts are saying.)

2073
01:18:39,752 --> 01:18:41,051
- What is this?
- Gosh.

2074
01:18:41,052 --> 01:18:42,151
(The first impression voting results...)

2075
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:43,752
(are posted on the board.)

2076
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,092
I can't believe it.

2077
01:18:45,352 --> 01:18:46,951
Gosh. Isn't this giving it away too much?

2078
01:18:46,952 --> 01:18:49,492
Even if we like the same person,

2079
01:18:49,622 --> 01:18:51,192
I'm confident.

2080
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:52,892
Gosh. What is this?

2081
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,862
Something big is about to happen.

2082
01:18:55,062 --> 01:18:57,532
When you see that the feelings aren't mutual, it feels...

2083
01:18:57,662 --> 01:18:59,001
This is a jungle.

2084
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:00,502
I can't watch this.
