1
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,130
(You know what?)

2
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:16,790
(I actually know someone really great.)

3
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,631
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

4
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,661
(Just open your heart a little.)

5
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,670
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

6
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,870
(Date My Friend)

7
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:25,901
(This program contains
indirect advertisements.)

8
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:29,110
She didn't have the bracelet on.

9
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:31,380
When she left the house,
she put it back on.

10
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:32,811
But when she came back, it was gone.

11
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:36,651
(The bracelet was gone again
after the date with Dong Ha.)

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,981
Did you sleep until now?

13
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:42,691
(Ji Eun and Dong Ha seem much
closer since their date.)

14
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:49,261
(That made me feel so annoyed.)

15
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,100
(I feel trapped.)

16
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:52,701
(I just want to get away.)

17
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:58,801
Gosh, this is driving me insane.

18
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,241
You took the bracelet off.

19
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:02,741
You're not going to wear it anymore.
I'll take it.

20
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:05,341
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

21
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:10,111
(The misunderstanding between them
seems impossible to clear up.)

22
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:12,680
(Meanwhile, Dong Ha...)

23
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,791
- Let's go have a drink.
- Okay.

24
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,120
So I don't think Ji Eun and I...

25
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,761
- need any more dates.
- Really?

26
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:23,591
(I only need my remaining
dates to be with you.)

27
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:28,071
(Dong Ha is going straight for Su Jin.)

28
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:31,841
(Hyun Jin is going straight for Da Hye.)

29
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,710
(To express my feelings,)

30
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,510
(I brought her coffee.)

31
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,981
I confidently said...

32
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:40,951
that I was interested in two people.

33
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:42,911
Am I 1 of those 2?

34
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:44,481
I am, right?

35
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:47,021
(Hyun Jin's long-awaited
first date with Da Hye)

36
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,251
(I find that side of you cute.)

37
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,220
(My heart fluttered.)

38
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:55,491
(Da Hye and Hyun Jin had a romantic date.)

39
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,830
(That night,
the person who chose Hyun Jin was...)

40
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,861
(Sin Young.)

41
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,301
(I followed my heart.)

42
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:07,910
(I've seen Hyun Jin's consideration
for others many times.)

43
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,570
(That's what drew me to him.)

44
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,811
(Da Hye returned from
her date with Hyun Jin.)

45
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,410
I understand what Su Jin said...

46
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:14,750
- about him.
- Right?

47
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,810
(Da Hye experienced Hyun
Jin's thoughtfulness...)

48
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:17,950
(that Su Jin had spoken of.)

49
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,380
I felt very at ease.

50
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,490
I really enjoyed our genuine conversation.

51
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,420
Of the three, he was the one I had
the most sincere conversation with.

52
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,621
- Right.
- He's someone you can do that with.

53
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,831
(To be honest,
I also like people like that.)

54
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,701
(I think it's impressive.)

55
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,130
(I think he's someone...)

56
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:38,241
(I'm curious about and interested in.)

57
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:42,611
(Pandora's Box)

58
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,211
Da Hye, it's best not
to eat the inner part.

59
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:51,351
- The seeds?
- Yes.

60
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:53,350
But that's the tasty part.

61
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:54,491
I know it's tasty,

62
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,390
but you'll have a hard time digesting it.

63
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:57,421
Right. Got it.

64
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,390
That's why they're usually
served without the seeds.

65
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:02,331
(Da Hye listens to Hyun Jin
and scrapes off the seeds.)

66
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,531
What?

67
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:12,940
(Da Hye and Hyun Jin got a
lot closer after their date.)

68
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:17,011
(Da Hye and Hyun Jin got a
lot closer after their date.)

69
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:20,711
Can you get this for me?

70
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,611
All right.

71
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,521
(Glancing over)

72
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,831
(All of a sudden, Sin Young seems anxious.)

73
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:37,600
Which one is the chair that broke earlier?

74
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,461
- What? Right.
- Which chair broke earlier?

75
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:41,831
I think it was this one.

76
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,731
- No, it's not. It was...
- Is it that one?

77
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,571
I wanted to talk with Hyun Jin.

78
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,381
I was trying to read the room.

79
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,481
I was unsure whether to say something.

80
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,811
I was trying to find the right moment,

81
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,121
so I kept standing up
and sitting back down.

82
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,621
It probably showed.

83
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,020
(Sin Young is trying to find the
right moment to talk to Hyun Jin.)

84
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,521
- Be careful. Don't lean back.
- Right.

85
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,891
Sin Young has been interested in him.

86
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:15,430
I want to go grab a beer with Hyun Jin,

87
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,341
but there’s nowhere to go,
so I don’t know what to do.

88
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,270
- She's asking Da Hye to leave.
- She's asking her for space.

89
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:24,241
(With me?)

90
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,711
I was surprised...

91
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,411
that she wanted to talk with me.

92
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:31,181
Could she be viewing me in a romantic way?

93
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:34,891
Sin Young.

94
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,961
(On Day 3, Hyun Jin had asked
Sin Young out on a date.)

95
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,261
(Sin Young and Hyun Jin's date on Day 3)

96
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:43,731
- Come over here.
- Where?

97
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,760
- Like this? Yes.
- You got it?

98
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,001
- You sure you won't fall?
- Yes.

99
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:52,640
(Sin Young was attracted to Hyun
Jin because of his thoughtfulness.)

100
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:53,701
I think...

101
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:58,411
we click well both in
conversation and when hanging out.

102
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:00,910
Our vibes match really well,

103
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,281
and our conversations flow easily.

104
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:07,891
Not just in a friendly, comfortable way.

105
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,320
When I'm in a relationship,

106
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,061
- Yes, teasing.
- I like teasing my girlfriend.

107
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:14,431
That's what I like. Just having fun.

108
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:15,791
And...

109
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:19,061
when I'm talking to you,

110
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,100
that side of me comes out more...

111
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,001
because I feel at ease.

112
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:28,471
You know how a situation
can make your heart flutter?

113
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:30,741
That felt so good,

114
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:33,411
so that's why I wanted to talk to him.

115
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,620
- Let's sit here and drink.
- Yes, let's drink.

116
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:47,621
(Sin Young mustered up the
courage to talk to Hyun Jin.)

117
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,101
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

118
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,171
- Good job today.
- Good job today.

119
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,711
Gosh, that's refreshing.

120
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,411
How was your day?

121
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,951
Me?

122
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:14,491
How was my day?

123
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,050
- Well, - Not like...

124
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:20,521
I had a fun date.

125
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:23,130
(Hyun Jin went on a
date with Da Hye today.)

126
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:25,330
I felt like our conversation...

127
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,501
flowed really well.

128
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,801
I felt at ease.

129
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,181
As for me,

130
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:46,381
I talked a lot with Jeong Geun.

131
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:49,651
During our conversation,

132
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,791
I really...

133
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:56,761
sorted out my thoughts.

134
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,800
(What did Sin Young talk about
during her date with Jeong Geun?)

135
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,671
What I'm worried about is...

136
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:05,101
It's not like I wasn't curious about him.

137
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,671
About Hyun Jin.
I did want to get to know him.

138
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,370
That's why...

139
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:12,210
I want to go on another date with him,

140
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,081
- to tell you the truth.
- You want to go on another date.

141
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,851
She asked him for advice.

142
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:18,521
They asked each other for advice.

143
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,880
- It's complicated.
- I get what you're saying.

144
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:23,751
But, to be honest,

145
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,060
I think the person who feels that way...

146
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:29,090
should be the one making the first move.

147
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:31,401
Instead of expressing your
feelings, you're just waiting.

148
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,761
You can't just stay still.

149
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:35,670
Time will fly by,

150
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,231
and you'll regret it when this is over.

151
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:40,100
You're right.

152
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,941
You can go talk to him first, you know.

153
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,450
(Sin Young decided to take
Jeong Geun's advice...)

154
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:49,681
(and go up to Hyun Jin.)

155
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:51,881
Well...

156
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,050
I told you yesterday at
the end of our date...

157
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,191
that our time together
felt meaningful to me.

158
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:58,791
And...

159
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:00,860
I meant it.

160
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,991
Yes, of course. Me too.

161
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:04,701
That is why...

162
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:08,270
I wanted to talk to you...

163
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,001
one more time.

164
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:13,701
That's why...

165
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:18,511
I asked to talk to you tonight.

166
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:28,591
I...

167
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,991
really...

168
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:35,491
I think of myself as someone
with high self-esteem...

169
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,331
and a very confident person.

170
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:39,931
No matter what.

171
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,031
But the one thing...

172
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:48,141
I am a bit fragile about my height.

173
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,281
Even when I try not to be,
I continue to feel fragile.

174
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,321
(Their first encounter)

175
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:02,321
(She's really tall.)

176
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:08,990
(From the very beginning,
he was conscious of her height.)

177
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:12,701
People say I shouldn't consider that,

178
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:14,731
but for me,

179
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:17,001
since I'm a man,

180
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:19,840
I want to protect my woman...

181
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:21,840
like a man should,

182
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,711
and be able to hold her, so...

183
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:30,450
I believe he said it with a lot of courage.

184
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:31,921
He was honest.

185
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:40,160
For you, height...

186
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:41,830
- It's very big.
- must be...

187
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,161
- a big thing.
- For me.

188
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,561
It's a bit...

189
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:50,430
Describing it as low
self-esteem might sound funny,

190
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:53,440
but I do feel like it’s a weak spot for me.

191
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:55,741
That's why I think I kept...

192
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,551
trying to joke about it.

193
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,721
Sure. That's...

194
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,391
I think it’s completely understandable.

195
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:14,321
And besides,

196
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:16,791
I am...

197
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,301
quite tall,

198
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,661
to be honest.

199
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:23,630
So you're saying that you do understand me.

200
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:25,201
I really do understand it.

201
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,171
In reality,

202
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,541
when I showed interest,

203
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,951
there were actually times...

204
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:36,681
when the guy...

205
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,620
felt overwhelmed...

206
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:42,021
by my size.

207
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,960
So, I realized that I could be too big...

208
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,761
in the eyes of some guys.

209
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:52,631
So I did experience that...

210
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:55,470
a lot in my life,

211
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,100
so I completely understand what it's like.

212
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:58,171
But...

213
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:02,011
I still wanted...

214
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,810
to ask you one more time.

215
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:05,840
I understand what you mean.

216
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:06,911
She still wanted to.

217
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,111
But it seems like...

218
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:11,651
what you're saying is that...

219
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:14,150
No, it's okay.

220
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,251
This is...

221
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,650
No, I...

222
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:17,891
(Sin Young even takes care
of Hyun Jin's feelings.)

223
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,060
You're wonderful simply for who you are.

224
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:25,531
(You're wonderful simply for who you are.)

225
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,871
We talked, and obviously,

226
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,441
Sin Young and I...

227
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,911
connected better than I had expected.

228
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:39,981
I told her even the things that...

229
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:42,211
I wouldn't want to tell others,

230
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:44,481
and she completely...

231
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:46,521
understood...

232
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,621
those parts.

233
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:51,321
(Will Hyun Jin's heart open up?)

234
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,860
Before, it was about...

235
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:57,030
the age gap with Su Jin, and now...

236
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,701
- The height difference.
- it's the height difference.

237
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,771
I think this would drive
Hyun Jin crazy, too.

238
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:03,901
But who needs height when it comes to love?

239
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:08,440
But I do understand where
both of them are coming from.

240
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,511
I was always on the tall side,

241
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:13,781
so I tended to hunch over when I was young.

242
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:16,250
And I think Sin Young would have...

243
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:18,280
- been conscious in the same way, - Yes.

244
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:21,320
but since Hyun Jin has that insecurity,

245
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:22,450
I don't think it will be easy.

246
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,521
He seems to have...

247
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:25,361
difficulty coping with it.

248
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:27,221
- That's possible.
- Since there are many...

249
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:28,491
tall people.

250
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,730
The thoughts may come from...

251
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,000
the way they’ve lived all their lives.

252
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

253
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:36,330
- It's something you can’t help.
- Yes.

254
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:37,571
Gosh.

255
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:41,740
- I’m craving a drink.
- Yes.

256
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:44,141
It's the 1st time the 4 of
us are drinking together.

257
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,441
Right?

258
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,951
Hyun Jin, how was your talk with Sin Young?

259
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:54,221
For me, to be honest,

260
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,051
I showed her my lowest self.

261
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,221
My trauma...

262
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:01,790
Not exactly trauma, but...

263
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,931
I even talked about...

264
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:06,561
the part where I’m most vulnerable,

265
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:08,530
and I spoke honestly.

266
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:09,901
And I did so even more,

267
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:11,401
since it was Sin Young.

268
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:13,871
She made me feel that comfortable.

269
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,311
Hyun Jin, Sin Young is...

270
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:21,480
the kind of person...

271
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,551
that makes you...

272
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:28,081
open up completely as
you're talking with her.

273
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,920
I didn't have...

274
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:32,360
a real date with Sin Young.

275
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,561
We were just like...

276
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:37,591
helpers to each other.

277
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,301
Our conversation...

278
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,970
She talked about her troubles,

279
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,001
and I did too.

280
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,170
I gave her the solutions...

281
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,111
that I believed were right,

282
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:53,311
and seeing her...

283
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,110
act on it...

284
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,620
and seeing how it's working out,

285
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,621
I feel really proud.

286
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:08,891
(He carefully passes on the
message of Sin Young's courage.)

287
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,001
For me,

288
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:14,631
during this time,

289
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,671
at this place,

290
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,571
I was really immersed.

291
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,041
I could say I was over-immersed,

292
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:27,981
and that I was truly sincere.

293
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,591
I think you are the one
with the most courage.

294
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,101
Yes, he did his best.

295
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:58,541
(Geon Wu returned to his room.)

296
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:09,450
(He prepares something.)

297
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,591
What is that?

298
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,721
Is that a letter?

299
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:18,800
With the pictures I took,

300
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:22,231
I wanted to share the good
memories with everyone.

301
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:23,971
I thought they would all like it.

302
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:28,770
(The pictures that Geon
Wu took during the trip.)

303
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,111
Goodness.

304
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,491
(Where is he heading with
the pictures he prepared?)

305
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:43,921
Don't you think so?

306
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:46,090
Our feelings can change...

307
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:47,490
- between us, - You're right.

308
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:48,761
- I'm...
- but for the Final Pick...

309
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,090
- I'm here.
- Why are you so busy?

310
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,290
What is that?

311
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,600
- Here, Sin Young.
- What is this?

312
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,230
- What is that?
- That's so touching.

313
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,600
- Su Jin.
- Who did this?

314
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:56,601
Where did this come from?

315
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,100
- Did you write this? Is it for us?
- This is...

316
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:59,540
truly touching, Geon Wu.

317
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,700
Did you write this, Geon Wu?

318
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:01,840
- I know.
- These are...

319
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:04,071
postcards that I made with
pictures I took in Paris.

320
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,780
- So...
- Why are you giving them now?

321
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:06,880
- I know.
- What?

322
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,550
Are you proposing?

323
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,850
- I know.
- I knew it.

324
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:11,450
- Are you trying to flirt?
- Are you proposing?

325
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:14,080
You should have done this
before going to the Heart Room.

326
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:16,190
You should have given this beforehand.

327
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,420
I didn't know who would come,

328
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:19,160
so I just brought it as a gift...

329
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,990
- to the other participants.
- Exactly.

330
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,391
Amazing.

331
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,930
- Did you take these, Geon Wu?
- Yes.

332
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:26,861
Gosh, that's amazing.

333
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,800
They are the pictures that I took.

334
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:30,970
- These ones?
- Yes.

335
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:33,000
The first picture is...

336
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,300
It means,

337
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:36,371
"Good news."

338
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:38,340
After receiving this,

339
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:41,140
I can really tell that
you are a good person.

340
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:42,311
That's amazing.

341
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:44,311
So cool.

342
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,350
(A precious gift that
shows Geon Wu's sincerity)

343
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:47,550
Did you do this?

344
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,751
(A precious gift that
shows Geon Wu's sincerity)

345
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:51,151
Look at this.

346
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:55,891
It's touching.

347
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,600
(Is there any part of
Da Hye's postcards...)

348
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:09,210
(that you paid special attention to?)

349
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:11,240
Of course, it did cross my mind.

350
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,481
For example,

351
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,650
with the seal attached to the postcard,

352
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,421
I had one different kind of seal.

353
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:21,521
I did think about...

354
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,950
giving the person I liked...

355
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:26,461
the different seal,

356
00:17:28,091 --> 00:17:30,191
but I just kept it all the same.

357
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:31,960
(A surprise gift from Geon Wu that
is thoughtful yet lighthearted)

358
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,160
- Geon Wu is very thoughtful.
- He is.

359
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,071
(A surprise gift from Geon Wu that
is thoughtful yet lighthearted)

360
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:37,870
- Ji Eun.
- Yes?

361
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:39,400
- What are you doing?
- I'm just here.

362
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,201
- I came to give this to you.
- What is that?

363
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,471
Goodness.

364
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:46,211
I'm curious about Ji Eun's feelings.

365
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:49,581
Yes.

366
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:52,351
- What I felt today was...
- Yes?

367
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:53,751
In the morning,

368
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:57,251
- he might not have seen it.
- I'm sure he didn't.

369
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,990
In the morning,
we wore the bracelets together.

370
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,061
- Oh, right.
- We both wore the bracelets.

371
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:06,061
We jokingly said that we
shouldn't take them off.

372
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,531
Actually,

373
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:10,470
I wasn't sure I could keep my word.

374
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:12,200
If it suits my outfit, I'll wear it.

375
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:13,640
If not, I'll take it off.

376
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:15,671
We had fun when we bought it.

377
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:20,281
He was seated right next to me.

378
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:23,110
He asked...

379
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:24,681
- Why you weren't wearing it.
- why I wasn't wearing mine.

380
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,591
(Today morning)

381
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:34,390
(Ji Eun wasn't wearing her
bracelet, and Jeong Geun saw it.)

382
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:36,531
No, don't get me wrong.

383
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,831
Don't get me wrong.

384
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,830
I took it off for the interview.

385
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:42,931
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:46,500
Even when I told him,
"I have it in my pocket."

387
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,571
"I took it off for the interview."

388
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,171
But the way he looked at me...

389
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,581
wasn't, "Is that so?"

390
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:56,010
He didn't believe me.

391
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,711
He thought I was making an excuse.

392
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,781
- Did I...
- I think he had been holding it in.

393
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,521
commit a crime?

394
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,720
At that moment, Ji Eun might've thought...

395
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:07,791
- he wasn't considerate of her.
- Right.

396
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:09,531
She could get flustered.

397
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:13,661
To be honest,

398
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,000
I get that he could've been upset
that I removed the bracelet.

399
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,801
But he did that again in
front of everyone else.

400
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:21,640
I actually told him the day before...

401
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:23,541
that when he expressed his feelings...

402
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,040
so openly in front of everyone,

403
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,140
I felt uncomfortable...

404
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:29,111
- because I was shy.
- You feel uncomfortable.

405
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:34,221
He seems to put behind the thought...

406
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:38,020
that I'd feel uncomfortable and...

407
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:40,391
- His feelings came first.
- focus on his own feelings first.

408
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:43,991
It made me think, "Did I commit a crime?"

409
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,501
I mean, it's just a bracelet.

410
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:51,671
Fine. Let's say I was
overly sensitive about that.

411
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:53,401
We could choose our dates today.

412
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,911
He told me many times that
he's bothered by Dong Ha.

413
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:01,381
Regardless,

414
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,681
I'm free to do what I want.

415
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,181
I choose Dong Ha.

416
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:10,920
As I chose him,

417
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:15,160
- It wasn't your final pick.
- I looked at him and said his name.

418
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:16,731
Even in that moment,

419
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,131
I was walking on eggshells
around Jeong Geun.

420
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,901
I had that thought.

421
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:25,271
That was just how I felt,
so I could've just let it pass.

422
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,601
But in front of everyone again...

423
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:29,711
Let's talk at night...

424
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,981
before we go to bed.

425
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,981
Since we can't spend today together.

426
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,091
Who knew these bracelets...

427
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:54,301
- would get you from the back.
- They're just bracelets.

428
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:57,531
It's just a bracelet to me.

429
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,141
- But it wasn't to him.
- Exactly.

430
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:08,951
He asked to have a serious conversation.

431
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:10,981
I really hate that.

432
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,581
I hate it so much.

433
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,420
- Right.
- That atmosphere was too heavy...

434
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:20,561
- and unbearable for me.
- It was suffocating.

435
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,391
- I can't handle that atmosphere.
- Just now, you two...

436
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:25,160
I'd think so too.

437
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:27,731
You didn't do anything wrong.

438
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:33,341
But to do that, it's the fastest to
just let go of this relationship.

439
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,571
So you want him to leave you alone.

440
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,411
I guess so.

441
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:39,811
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

442
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:43,811
My feelings for him have disappeared.

443
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:45,621
Exactly.

444
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:51,391
(Ji Eun has too many thoughts
jumbled up in her head.)

445
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:03,100
(Gwan Hee's face gets serious too.)

446
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:05,070
That happens.

447
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:08,001
I used to do to my wife
what I wanted to do.

448
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:09,571
Because I liked it.

449
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:12,341
Until some point, she accepted it happily.

450
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:15,281
But later, she told me seriously.

451
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,911
"Rather than doing what you want to me,"

452
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:20,550
- "can't you ask what I want?" - Yes.

453
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:23,190
- Yes.
- That hit me hard.

454
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,921
You did it...

455
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,491
- out of pure joy.
- Right.

456
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:28,860
But the receiving party...

457
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:30,360
Yes, they can feel pressured.

458
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:32,131
- That's why she said that.
- I agree.

459
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,101
If she says she feels pressured
and her feelings have disappeared,

460
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:38,971
they can't go back anymore.

461
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,110
I understand that Ji Eun feels pressured.

462
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,440
I completely understand
why she feels pressured.

463
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,611
(Ji Eun would've felt pressured,
walking on eggshells.)

464
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,750
(D-1 to the Final Pick, the sun rises.)

465
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:51,511
Why does the morning look so sad?

466
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:55,550
It's Jeong Geun.

467
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:58,420
(Jeong Geun goes to exercise
early in the morning.)

468
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,321
Let's overcome it by exercising.

469
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:19,111
(He must have a lot on
his mind to keep running.)

470
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:27,281
(Jeong Geun, who feels uneasy,
ran for a very long time.)

471
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:32,791
(At the same time, in Lovebud House)

472
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:43,271
(Ji Eun gets ready just
like any other day.)

473
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:47,201
I don't want the others
to feel uncomfortable...

474
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:50,471
because of Jeong Geun and me.

475
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,711
I'll try to act as naturally as possible.

476
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:58,381
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen)

477
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:04,520
(Dong Ha is busy from the morning.)

478
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:08,761
(Dong Ha is busy from the morning.)

479
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:11,031
Where is the seaweed?

480
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:18,301
(Why is Dong Ha busy so
early in the morning?)

481
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:22,371
I'm going to cook breakfast
with Su Jin today.

482
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:26,081
Everyone seemed to crave Korean cuisine.

483
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:27,910
Since seaweed soup is easy to make,

484
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:29,881
I was preparing the seaweed.

485
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:32,880
Seaweed soup.

486
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:36,821
(Dong Ha and Su Jin will cook together.)

487
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:43,491
You're cooking breakfast?

488
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:46,231
I'm getting it ready first.
I need to soak the seaweed.

489
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:49,000
What else will you cook?

490
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:51,030
Tell me, and I'll help with the rest.

491
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,240
Just seaweed soup.

492
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,471
- We bought side dishes too.
- Okay.

493
00:24:56,411 --> 00:25:01,881
(He ends up making seaweed
soup with Hyun Jin.)

494
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:04,781
(Cooking with ease)

495
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:12,091
(He stir-fries beef in sesame oil first.)

496
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:18,461
What is it?

497
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:20,261
What is it?

498
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:22,201
- Good morning.
- Hi.

499
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:25,601
Good morning.

500
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,601
- Did you have a good sleep?
- Sorry?

501
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:29,910
- You already started?
- It's okay.

502
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,911
- We thought it'd take some time.
- We thought it'd take some time.

503
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:35,240
Doesn't it already smell delicious?

504
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:36,980
I could smell it from outside.

505
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:38,311
- Really? From outside?
- Yes.

506
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,621
(Su Jin helps as soon as she joins.)

507
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:45,291
I should take out dried laver too.

508
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:49,691
Shall I fry some eggs, then?

509
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:52,901
Should I make a rolled
omelet or fried eggs?

510
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:55,101
- Rolled omelet sounds nice.
- Can you make rolled omelet?

511
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:56,901
I got it.

512
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,371
How many eggs should I use?

513
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,141
(Tapping)

514
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:09,051
We finally eat Korean cuisine.

515
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,381
(Again)

516
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:13,180
She's good.

517
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:17,151
(The way she hits the eggs
suggests that she's cooked often.)

518
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,161
(Glancing)

519
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:24,631
She seemed like a good cook.

520
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,061
Yes.

521
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:28,461
As expected.

522
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:31,631
That was adorable too.

523
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:38,541
Hi.

524
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:39,811
Something smells good.

525
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:40,980
(Jeong Geun enters the
common area after his run.)

526
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:41,981
Did you sleep well?

527
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,651
- I woke up at 5am.
- Good morning.

528
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:46,921
- Here.
- Do you have a hangover?

529
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:48,451
It's killing me.

530
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:50,691
Yesterday, I...

531
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,761
We've got to try it later tonight.

532
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,400
Hello.

533
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:03,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

534
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:05,130
- Do you need something?
- It's okay.

535
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:06,441
(At that time,
Ji Eun passes by the common area.)

536
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:10,841
(She quickly goes upstairs
after a short greeting.)

537
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:38,001
I could feel the tension in the air.

538
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,271
It was a bit awkward.

539
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:43,641
It made me read the room.

540
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:48,141
I could personally feel that
he was feeling uncomfortable.

541
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:01,720
It would've been fine if
Jeong Geun acted lively,

542
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,930
but if he keeps showing
that he's feeling down,

543
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:04,931
it will gnaw at their nerves.

544
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,300
- His face clearly shows it.
- Well,

545
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:07,330
what can Jeong Geun do?

546
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:08,700
He can't pretend like nothing happened...

547
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:10,201
- and act all cheerful.
- Yes.

548
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,470
Jeong Geun, what are you doing?

549
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,001
(Childish Gwan is very
concerned about his friend.)

550
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:29,291
Are you good at rolling it?

551
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:31,351
Of course.

552
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:32,491
I'm decent at it.

553
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:36,830
He must find Su Jin very adorable.

554
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,431
It looks like it.

555
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,960
Can you roll it squarely...

556
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,401
in a round pan?

557
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:45,001
Do you want that?

558
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:48,741
- I don't know how to do it.
- Just like this.

559
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:52,611
Make it tasty.

560
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:55,611
I can make it neat.

561
00:28:57,711 --> 00:29:00,951
(He quickly holds it for her.)

562
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:03,391
- Did you add more?
- I did.

563
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:04,991
She rolled it nicely.

564
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:08,691
It's like a blanket.

565
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,400
We didn't have enough ingredients
to make a rolled omelet,

566
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:15,660
so she just used eggs.

567
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:19,070
And she made it thick and nice...

568
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:20,800
like a blanket.

569
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:24,571
I found that side of her charming.

570
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,240
- Chop it on a cutting board.
- Yes.

571
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,111
- And we can put it on two plates.
- That sounds good.

572
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:35,151
(Jeong Geun is spending time on his own.)

573
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:37,891
(Glancing)

574
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,991
Decorate it with ketchup.

575
00:29:41,121 --> 00:29:42,690
You're in charge, Jeong Geun.

576
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:44,091
- Yes.
- Decorate it with ketchup.

577
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,000
Are you good at drawing?

578
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,631
Draw a character.

579
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:54,300
(Kind Su Jin includes Jeong
Geun, who was on his own.)

580
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:55,701
Okay. There you go.

581
00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:57,670
(Su Jin's big rolled omelet)

582
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,481
This is like those big rolled omelets...

583
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,940
they sell in snack bars.

584
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,481
(Su Jin's big rolled omelet)

585
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:03,881
This...

586
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:06,521
Take it there.

587
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:18,691
(The table is getting filled one by one.)

588
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:20,430
This.

589
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:21,801
It's very wide.

590
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,731
Spoons.

591
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:24,971
You must do it all.

592
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,840
We just need seven for now, right?

593
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:34,781
(Jeong Geun and Ji Eun avoid each other.)

594
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:42,121
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

595
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:44,491
Enjoy.

596
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:45,650
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

597
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:46,921
Enjoy your food.

598
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:48,720
Enjoy.

599
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,630
(The breakfast looks delicious.)

600
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:52,230
- It looks delicious.
- There's only brown rice.

601
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:54,060
- I like brown rice.
- I'm hungry.

602
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,131
(The breakfast looks delicious.)

603
00:30:55,261 --> 00:30:56,600
- It's delicious.
- Thank you.

604
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:57,900
I'm glad you like it.

605
00:30:57,901 --> 00:30:59,570
(The first Korean cuisine
they have together)

606
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:00,601
It's delicious.

607
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:02,040
(Sin Young tries Hyun
Jin's seaweed soup first.)

608
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,140
Garlic.

609
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:04,441
(Sin Young tries Hyun
Jin's seaweed soup first.)

610
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:05,910
- The seaweed soup tastes great.
- Does it?

611
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,441
Yes. Who made this?

612
00:31:07,611 --> 00:31:08,641
Hyun Jin.

613
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:11,451
Good job.

614
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:13,481
- It's nice.
- Yes.

615
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:16,121
It feels like I'm eating homemade food.

616
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:18,690
The rice tastes fine too.

617
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:19,761
Is it good?

618
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:20,990
It's nice.

619
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:24,461
(Brown rice with savory
taste and soft texture)

620
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:31,830
(She puts some seasoned dried squid...)

621
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:35,271
(on top of the warm brown
rice and eats them together.)

622
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:43,311
(Dong Ha takes a bite of
Su Jin's rolled omelet.)

623
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:44,410
Nice.

624
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:45,751
- Is it?
- It's good.

625
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:47,551
(Feeling proud)

626
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:52,791
(Dong Ha is about to pick up dried laver.)

627
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,361
Dried laver flirting,
just like perilla leaf flirting.

628
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:57,991
Pick it up first.

629
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,261
I'll take this.

630
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:04,501
(They act lovey-dovey even when they eat.)

631
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:11,210
- Is it good?
- I like this kind of texture.

632
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:12,781
- Yes.
- It's a bit firm.

633
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,041
But soft at the same time.

634
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,580
It's so good.

635
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,181
It's multigrain rice,

636
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:20,950
but it's not tough. It's soft.

637
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:22,450
- It's so nice.
- This is great...

638
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:23,590
- when you're on a diet.
- Yes.

639
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:25,120
I ate 2 or 3 packs of this rice yesterday.

640
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,220
Yes.

641
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:27,661
- I think I ate two.
- It's nice.

642
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,361
That was a nice breakfast.

643
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:33,331
- I'm full.
- Thanks for the meal.

644
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:40,001
(They finished their breakfast.)

645
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:44,470
Have you ever dated your
boyfriend for four days straight?

646
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:45,641
- You haven't.
- I haven't.

647
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:47,410
- Right?
- Not at all.

648
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:48,740
(The three of them are
talking after breakfast.)

649
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,950
- It's tiring.
- Never.

650
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:51,410
- Right? You date one day, - Just...

651
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:53,320
and you should rest before
working the next day.

652
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:56,521
(The three of them are
talking after breakfast.)

653
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,691
Isn't that why we all ate?

654
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:03,991
Everything is like the first time.

655
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:07,801
She's looking at him.

656
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:13,241
- You're eating now.
- Sorry? Yes.

657
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:18,510
- I had a dream.
- Did you get some sleep?

658
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:21,110
(Jeong Geun sits next to Ji Eun.)

659
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:23,280
- Dong Ha is still sleeping.
- Is he?

660
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:24,550
I want to sleep too.

661
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:25,981
Dong Ha hasn't even washed yet.

662
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:27,480
- He hasn't?
- No.

663
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:28,520
- Really?
- Yes.

664
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:31,651
I guess he came down right away.

665
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:34,391
He came here straight to make breakfast.

666
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:48,671
(They don't look at each other.)

667
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:52,271
(Is he trying not to burden her anymore?)

668
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:07,691
The last musical I watched was...

669
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:09,590
- Jekyll.
- "Jekyll and Hyde?"

670
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:10,731
Who was in the cast?

671
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:12,801
Well...

672
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,701
I can't remember the name.

673
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:18,171
Let's go in.

674
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:29,111
(Ji Eun gets up from her seat.)

675
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:38,951
My shoes.

676
00:34:40,421 --> 00:34:42,121
The rain comes and goes.

677
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:43,191
Yes.

678
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:49,331
Did you take your medicine?

679
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,631
I did after I ate breakfast.

680
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:00,481
Gosh. The way they part from each other.

681
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:07,981
(The two walk away
without talking anymore.)

682
00:35:54,561 --> 00:36:02,301
(What is Ji Eun thinking about right now?)

683
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,720
I went to Ulsan to become a
professional soccer player.

684
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:18,521
- I didn't hesitate.
- At what age?

685
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:21,191
- Was this what I had earlier?
- Yes.

686
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:23,491
- Sorry. I drank too much of it.
- It's fine.

687
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:28,300
(The board has changed.)

688
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:29,361
What is it now?

689
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,571
I wonder what it could be on the last day.

690
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:39,711
Gosh.

691
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:49,351
Gosh.

692
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,521
There was a reason why the
name tags were missing today.

693
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:55,191
We have the chance to pick.

694
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:58,331
It's talking about the
doors of our rooms, right?

695
00:36:58,461 --> 00:36:59,901
I think so.

696
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:01,461
What is that?

697
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:04,601
Is it a difficult choice to make?

698
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:06,400
(Do you wish to know that person's heart?)

699
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:08,470
(Open the door to find out
who they chose last night.)

700
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:11,241
- What?
- They can check one person's heart.

701
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:14,241
Please don't check Ji Eun's
heart, Jeong Geun.

702
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:22,781
Are you going to check?

703
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:43,811
(The place that Jeong Geun went
to after being lost in thought)

704
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:48,081
(In front of the Heart Room)

705
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:52,411
(Hesitating)

706
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:59,661
(He enters the Heart Room
after much deliberation.)

707
00:38:01,491 --> 00:38:04,130
To be honest, that door...

708
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:07,301
was like Pandora's box to me.

709
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,971
I think I would look inside.
I would do that.

710
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:11,771
Don't look!

711
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:22,941
(He opens Pandora's box in the end.)

712
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:25,680
For me to let Ji Eun go without any regret,

713
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:28,081
I thought that I had to look inside.

714
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:32,420
(A name can be slightly
seen from inside the door)

715
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:34,361
Which name is on it?

716
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:37,791
What if Ji Eun chose Dong Ha?

717
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:39,830
No, I don't think she would've chosen him.

718
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:41,700
I don't think she would've chosen Dong Ha.

719
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:43,170
- Ji Eun wouldn't have chosen him?
- No.

720
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:44,200
Then who would she have chosen?

721
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:45,631
I think she would've chosen Jeong Geun.

722
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:49,141
(Please)

723
00:38:57,781 --> 00:39:05,221
(The person who Ji Eun chose last night)

724
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:12,061
(Choi Ji Eun chose Shin
Dong Ha last night.)

725
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:21,500
(After seeing Ji Eun's choice,)

726
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:24,171
(Jeong Geun closes the door.)

727
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:27,640
It was a moment...

728
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:31,081
that helped me realize that
I could give up on Ji Eun.

729
00:39:32,481 --> 00:39:38,321
I no longer had to think about
whether I should talk to her or not.

730
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:40,361
That was how certain I was.

731
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:48,060
(Will the door of Jeong Geun's
heart close up like this?)

732
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:51,331
(Will the door of Jeong Geun's
heart close up like this?)

733
00:39:58,571 --> 00:39:59,611
Oh, no!

734
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,341
- Oh, no!
- That was cruel.

735
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,810
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

736
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:05,681
Did you have to see
that with your own eyes?

737
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:07,820
My gosh. Things have gone so bad for him.

738
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:09,221
How did it end up like this?

739
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,090
But couldn't this be a way...

740
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:13,590
to get his heart sorted?

741
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:15,721
(Will Ji Eun and Jeong Geun's
connection end right here?)

742
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:20,930
(Geon Wu suddenly gets up.)

743
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:22,131
Where is Geon Wu going?

744
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:27,641
(Is he curious about Da
Hye's choice last night?)

745
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:32,071
(Lee Da Hye)

746
00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:34,280
- I hope it was him that he chose.
- Da Hye!

747
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:36,141
Please go for Geon Wu, Da Hye!

748
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,981
What about Hyun Jin?

749
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:39,681
She had a good date with Hyun Jin too.

750
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:42,551
Oh, I'm sorry.

751
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:46,491
I didn't realize you
were sitting next to me.

752
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:48,760
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were sitting next to me.

753
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:50,261
(Checking his reaction)

754
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:53,560
I'm not quite sure, to be honest.

755
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:58,001
I wasn't able to feel how she felt,

756
00:40:58,371 --> 00:40:59,671
so I don't know what to expect.

757
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:01,041
I really don't know what to expect.

758
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:09,810
(Who did Da Hye choose?)

759
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:14,721
(Who did Da Hye choose?)

760
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:16,151
I think she would've chosen Geon Wu.

761
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:17,621
Who is it?

762
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:22,160
(Lee Da Hye chose Shin Dong Ha last night.)

763
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:24,631
- What?
- Dong Ha?

764
00:41:24,961 --> 00:41:26,530
(Da Hye chose Dong Ha?)

765
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,531
- Hold on!
- Why is he so popular?

766
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,500
- Hold on.
- What?

767
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:32,700
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Hold on.

768
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,940
It's a misunderstanding, Geon Wu.

769
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,740
(Flustered)

770
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:36,971
It's a misunderstanding, Geon Wu.

771
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:39,010
It's a misunderstanding, Geon Wu.
It's a misunderstanding, Sae Ho.

772
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:40,411
(Why is it a misunderstanding?)

773
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:42,211
- What is going on?
- What is going on?

774
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:44,681
- What is going on?
- Da Hye tore off the wrong name.

775
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,681
- What is going on?
- It was Geon Wu.

776
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:47,881
It was Geon Wu.

777
00:41:47,981 --> 00:41:50,421
Why are you saying that?
It surely wasn't him.

778
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:52,890
He's a man full of charm.

779
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:54,760
- He really is a man full of charm.
- Why?

780
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:55,761
(Feeling embarrassed)

781
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:57,630
But why did she choose Dong Ha?

782
00:41:57,631 --> 00:41:58,891
(Really confused)

783
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:01,430
It was true that she was
shaken up by Dong Ha.

784
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:03,301
I think that influenced her choice.

785
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,800
Da Hye seems to fall for
the person she likes.

786
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:10,611
I wish for her to be the
one who is liked more.

787
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,880
I think she still has a fixed
idea about her ideal type.

788
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,680
- I see.
- Yes.

789
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:19,350
It's the last day for Da Hye.

790
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,380
Who do you wish for her to spend time with?

791
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:22,381
Geon Wu.

792
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:25,390
- Right.
- It's hard to find...

793
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:27,491
someone who is that attentive like Geon Wu.

794
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:55,680
I thought she could've chosen someone else,

795
00:42:55,681 --> 00:42:57,451
but after seeing that she had
actually chosen someone else,

796
00:42:57,751 --> 00:43:00,921
I had a strange feeling.

797
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:04,961
Geon Wu.

798
00:43:09,971 --> 00:43:14,700
(Why did Da Hye's heart
head toward Dong Ha?)

799
00:43:14,701 --> 00:43:18,711
(Why did Da Hye's heart
head toward Dong Ha?)

800
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:22,210
(Shin Dong Ha)

801
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:26,181
The date with Dong Ha left the
strongest impression on me.

802
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:30,921
This is why I will choose Dong Ha.

803
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:35,221
Right.

804
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:36,661
I'll be there.

805
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:38,161
There's no need to look.

806
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,761
You can choose what to do.

807
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:06,821
Dong Ha is here.

808
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,621
Dong Ha is here.

809
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:10,660
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

810
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:11,890
(Dong Ha joins in as the last one.)

811
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:13,430
- The main guy is here.
- Dong Ha.

812
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:14,561
The man full of charm.

813
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:17,430
Dong Ha.

814
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:20,001
(Take a look at that.)

815
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,710
"Do you wish to know that person's heart?"

816
00:44:25,711 --> 00:44:28,841
"Open the door to find out
who they chose last night."

817
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:30,450
It's in the Heart Room.

818
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:32,211
Are there people who won't check?

819
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:33,720
- We all think differently.
- Really?

820
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:36,521
- Yes. The name tags.
- I mean...

821
00:44:38,451 --> 00:44:42,590
(Whose heart is Dong Ha curious about?)

822
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:46,661
(Whose heart is Dong Ha curious about?)

823
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:56,911
Gosh. Dong Ha.

824
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,341
Whose door will he open?

825
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:00,081
I'm so curious about Dong Ha's decision.

826
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:03,211
If Dong Ha is curious
about Ji Eun's heart...

827
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:18,960
I was quite certain that
he would've chosen me.

828
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:20,461
Even so,

829
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:23,830
I was curious about that person's heart.

830
00:45:23,831 --> 00:45:25,971
That was why I decided to
check that person's heart.

831
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:28,940
My gosh!

832
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:32,671
(Who did Dong Ha choose last night?)

833
00:45:35,241 --> 00:45:36,740
"Shin Dong Ha..."

834
00:45:36,741 --> 00:45:38,681
"chose Kang Su Jin last night."

835
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,920
(Shin Dong Ha chose
Kang Su Jin last night.)

836
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:44,891
I was worried that there
would be a surprise.

837
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:47,561
I felt grateful...

838
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:48,991
that he chose me.

839
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,660
I felt really grateful.

840
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:52,161
(I felt really grateful.)

841
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:58,630
(Dong Ha decided to check...)

842
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:02,101
(Su Jin's heart.)

843
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:03,570
"Kang Su Jin..."

844
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:05,771
"chose Shin Dong Ha last night."

845
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:08,480
(Kang Su Jin chose Shin
Dong Ha last night.)

846
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:10,580
I wasn't curious about anyone else.

847
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:14,321
That was why I decided
to check Su Jin's heart.

848
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:22,620
(The two chose each other.)

849
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:25,691
These two have become a couple now.

850
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:29,230
They have become an official couple now.

851
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:30,571
It was Day One for them yesterday.

852
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:32,031
Gosh.

853
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:33,200
- Let us wish them the best.
- Right.

854
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:34,500
Congratulations.

855
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,341
How many handshakes are we doing?

856
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:39,611
We had a few handshakes at the start.

857
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,040
Right. Gosh.

858
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:44,210
I will make sure to watch
over from a distance.

859
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:45,350
(Watching over like a satellite)

860
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:46,551
I will watch over from a distance.

861
00:46:46,581 --> 00:46:47,680
Right.

862
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:48,721
(Upset)

863
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:51,850
- It's raining a lot.
- It's raining?

864
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,990
(After checking each other's hearts)

865
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:55,921
Do you think we will be going out today?

866
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:57,861
I'm not sure.

867
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm pretty sure there will be a final date.

868
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:02,100
Right.

869
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:03,701
(Su Jin and Dong Ha spend time together.)

870
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:05,700
It's my first time in here.

871
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:06,771
It is, right?

872
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:15,211
You checked, right?

873
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,950
The door of the person you like.
The thing on the board earlier.

874
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:19,611
- Yes, I checked.
- Right.

875
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:21,521
We shared the same heart.

876
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:24,651
"We shared the same heart."

877
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:31,290
Did you personally talk with each person?

878
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,890
- Who?
- Well, the guys.

879
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,100
Hyun Jin, Jeong Geun, and Geon Wu.

880
00:47:35,101 --> 00:47:37,070
No. Other than when we went on a date,

881
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:39,900
I've never talked with anyone individually.

882
00:47:39,901 --> 00:47:41,371
- No one? Not even once?
- No.

883
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:42,971
- Except for you.
- Really?

884
00:47:43,971 --> 00:47:44,971
It fascinates me.

885
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:47,111
It felt great to hear that.

886
00:47:48,381 --> 00:47:49,811
She looked cute too.

887
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:52,151
That was it.

888
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:57,851
(Su Jin and Dong Ha's
conversation feels lovey-dovey.)

889
00:47:58,121 --> 00:48:00,090
That person can make a choice.

890
00:48:00,091 --> 00:48:02,861
I can feel fine without checking.

891
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:05,260
"Find out who they chose last night."

892
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:06,961
I can feel fine without checking.

893
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,160
I wondered if I should check or not.

894
00:48:10,161 --> 00:48:11,571
I was quite torn.

895
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:13,370
I was curious...

896
00:48:13,371 --> 00:48:14,870
and wanted to check.

897
00:48:14,871 --> 00:48:16,441
That was why I decided to check.

898
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:23,980
I don't think you have to check.

899
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:26,550
(The person Sin Young is curious about...)

900
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:28,621
(is Hyun Jin.)

901
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:34,460
(Oh Hyun Jin chose Lee Da Hye last night.)

902
00:48:34,461 --> 00:48:35,721
You shouldn't have checked.

903
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,301
I expected that person to be picked.

904
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:45,701
I did think that he would've chosen Da Hye.

905
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:47,941
It actually turned out to be Da Hye.

906
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,540
"I was right."

907
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,371
I just thought that to myself.

908
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:57,751
(Hyun Jin enters the Heart Room next.)

909
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:00,921
We went on a 1-on-1 date together.

910
00:49:02,181 --> 00:49:03,991
I was curious about...

911
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:05,620
her heart for me.

912
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:07,261
That was why I opened Da Hye's door.

913
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:14,101
(Da Hye chose Dong Ha last night.)

914
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:16,501
I thought that it was something
that could've happened.

915
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:20,231
It didn't change my heart.

916
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:21,940
That was how it was.

917
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:23,271
Right.

918
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:25,640
(The moment they realize...)

919
00:49:25,641 --> 00:49:29,411
(their hearts aren't
heading toward each other)

920
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:32,951
How?

921
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:37,520
Gosh, Da Hye.
There are so many people who like you.

922
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:38,991
What are you doing?

923
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,960
I think they all decided to check...

924
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:42,860
- to get their hearts sorted.
- Right.

925
00:49:42,861 --> 00:49:43,990
- It's for that reason.
- Right.

926
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:45,791
- There's not much time left.
- Right.

927
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:49,531
So has Jeong Geun closed
his heart toward Ji Eun?

928
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:51,130
I'm pretty sure...

929
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:53,740
Jeong Geun will sit crouched
in the corner of his room.

930
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,140
There's only one way for this
relationship to be restored.

931
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:58,241
(Only one way?)

932
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:00,611
Ji Eun has to come up to him first,

933
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:03,080
- and has to approach him.
- After the show is finished.

934
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:05,980
and go, "Will you open up
the door to your heart?"

935
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:07,420
- Or else, this relationship is...
- Right.

936
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,151
There's nothing that Jeong
Geun can do from here.

937
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:14,361
(Except for Ji Eun and Da
Hye, they have all checked.)

938
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:16,661
- Already?
- Yes.

939
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:21,401
(The seat next to Jeong Geun is empty.)

940
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:26,401
(Ji Eun won't take it.)

941
00:50:35,581 --> 00:50:36,681
Okay.

942
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:38,551
So you all have read it.

943
00:50:38,611 --> 00:50:40,011
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

944
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,721
I'll open it then.

945
00:50:46,121 --> 00:50:52,561
(What will be written
inside the last envelope?)

946
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,961
"On the last night,"

947
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:59,571
"have a 30-minute conversation
to share your feelings."

948
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:04,370
(Have a 30-minute conversation
to share your feelings.)

949
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:05,741
Really?

950
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:08,941
Right before the Final Pick
that will happen the next day,

951
00:51:09,241 --> 00:51:11,951
an important opportunity
has been given to everyone.

952
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:15,381
Have the final conversation
with the person on your mind.

953
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:18,090
They will have to talk in the end.

954
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:19,650
- Through this chance, - That's important.

955
00:51:19,651 --> 00:51:21,521
Ji Eun's misunderstanding can be solved.

956
00:51:24,091 --> 00:51:31,001
(The last opportunity to
reveal their true hearts)

957
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:38,011
- All 4 each?
- All 4 each.

958
00:51:42,281 --> 00:51:47,221
I decided not to approach Ji Eun anymore.

959
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:53,190
"Right. We just weren't meant to be."

960
00:51:53,191 --> 00:51:55,361
This was the thought that I had.

961
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:06,071
(Will Jeong Geun be able to have
one last conversation with Ji Eun?)

962
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:16,940
Then I'll talk with Jeong Geun here first.

963
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:17,981
- Okay.
- Okay.

964
00:52:18,211 --> 00:52:19,611
- Let's go, Jeong Geun.
- Let's go.

965
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:21,181
- What?
- What?

966
00:52:21,821 --> 00:52:23,321
I think she wants to make him feel better.

967
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:24,920
She wants to make him feel better.

968
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:26,551
(Sin Young calls Jeong Geun,
who has a lot on his mind.)

969
00:52:29,621 --> 00:52:32,130
You're filled with too
many thoughts right now.

970
00:52:32,131 --> 00:52:34,330
It couldn't be helped.

971
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:35,461
Exactly.

972
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:40,201
May I ask you about this?

973
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:43,670
You gave her the medicine.

974
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:44,711
But...

975
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,581
I got a bit surprised at that moment.

976
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:51,681
It felt like you sort of
slammed it on the table.

977
00:52:57,751 --> 00:53:00,251
With what I saw, it felt like...

978
00:53:00,961 --> 00:53:05,361
you were expressing your complaint.

979
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,701
That was how I viewed it.

980
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:14,000
That wasn't my intention.

981
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:16,201
I just quickly wanted to
give it to her and leave.

982
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:18,170
I'm only human too.

983
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:21,811
I felt really embarrassed at that moment.

984
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:27,281
I didn't have the confidence to
give it to her and sit there.

985
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:35,921
I don't have...

986
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:42,661
the confidence to talk
to her first anymore.

987
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:47,171
I don't see that chance with her.

988
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:56,181
Yesterday, you told me...

989
00:53:57,241 --> 00:53:59,950
to do everything I wanted to before I left.

990
00:53:59,951 --> 00:54:02,281
- You said that to me.
- Right.

991
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:07,391
Today, I want to tell you the same thing.

992
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:10,661
Now is the time to talk.

993
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:15,131
This time we have is a chance.

994
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:19,201
I think all you can do now...

995
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:22,201
is to do what you want.

996
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:26,741
- She's seriously the best.
- Yes.

997
00:54:26,971 --> 00:54:28,380
Sin Young is seriously so nice.

998
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:29,740
(Sin Young gives him sincere advice.)

999
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:33,211
First, I want you...

1000
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:38,791
to hear out...

1001
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:43,061
everything she has to say.

1002
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:50,831
Hear what she has to say.

1003
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:52,231
- Okay.
- Yes.

1004
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:02,310
Sin Young pointed out things...

1005
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:06,050
that I didn't even realize myself.

1006
00:55:06,051 --> 00:55:07,581
When I realized that,

1007
00:55:08,781 --> 00:55:10,481
I was regretful and sad,

1008
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:15,261
and I took some time to reflect...

1009
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:20,191
on whether I had...

1010
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:23,901
made any mistakes with Ji Eun.

1011
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:31,371
(Jeong Geun got a chance
to rethink things.)

1012
00:55:31,671 --> 00:55:32,671
That's right.

1013
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:35,610
- Sin Young gives great advice.
- Yes, it was so appropriate.

1014
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:37,240
Her advice was amazing.

1015
00:55:37,241 --> 00:55:38,980
- I really hope he hears her out.
- Right.

1016
00:55:38,981 --> 00:55:40,851
Instead of going to talk
about how he's feeling,

1017
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:43,851
I think it'd be good for him to
say, "I want to hear how you feel."

1018
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:46,991
(Good job, my friend!)

1019
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:54,731
(She approaches from afar,)

1020
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:58,231
(and one man is waiting.)

1021
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:07,240
We have similar tastes.

1022
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:08,780
We both like photography.

1023
00:56:08,781 --> 00:56:10,481
We have these things in common.

1024
00:56:10,781 --> 00:56:14,221
So did he want to talk to
me more about those things?

1025
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:15,821
I was curious.

1026
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:24,391
(Who will Da Hye talk to last?)

1027
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:32,501
(Geon Wu)

1028
00:56:40,341 --> 00:56:41,541
I was so happy to see her.

1029
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:44,680
I thought it would be so nice...

1030
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:48,150
to talk to her about various things
now that we're more comfortable,

1031
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:49,251
so I was very happy to see her.

1032
00:56:53,091 --> 00:56:54,521
- Do you want champagne?
- Sounds good.

1033
00:56:55,461 --> 00:56:57,691
This is from my Lovebud.

1034
00:56:57,991 --> 00:56:59,661
- Really?
- Yes.

1035
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:02,060
- He gave it to me as a gift.
- Thank you.

1036
00:57:02,061 --> 00:57:03,461
- Then we should drink it.
- Yes.

1037
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:14,341
First of all,

1038
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:18,451
I consistently chose you,

1039
00:57:19,051 --> 00:57:22,881
but I don't regret that at all.

1040
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:25,751
You're such a good person.

1041
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,321
So, I...

1042
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,821
Right, it's so...

1043
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:31,931
I mean...

1044
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:36,360
I thought I was really good
at expressing my feelings,

1045
00:57:36,361 --> 00:57:38,230
but it was so much harder than I thought.

1046
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:39,401
- It's hard.
- It is.

1047
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:42,140
Also, even if I do express my feelings,

1048
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:43,440
it doesn't mean the other
person will always notice.

1049
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:45,140
And some people notice...

1050
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:47,411
even when I don't express my feelings.

1051
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:52,181
I think you noticed even
when I wasn't expressive.

1052
00:58:00,121 --> 00:58:02,291
"Lovebud Lee Mi Joo introduces her friend."

1053
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:04,491
"She always tries her best
at whatever she does."

1054
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:07,061
"She's so nice. I've never seen her angry."

1055
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:12,831
(When she was crying from feeling down,)

1056
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:17,471
(he got up before anyone
else to console Da Hye.)

1057
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:28,321
I should take some on my plate.

1058
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:31,421
- Do you want me to get you some?
- Yes, please. It's far.

1059
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,120
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

1060
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:35,321
- Here.
- Yes.

1061
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,691
That's good. Thank you.

1062
00:58:39,991 --> 00:58:42,061
That's more like breakfast.

1063
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:46,100
(Geon Wu always took care of her,)

1064
00:58:46,101 --> 00:58:48,741
(even though she didn't
express her feelings to him.)

1065
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:53,411
I really appreciate how
considerate you were.

1066
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:58,150
From our dates and conversations,

1067
00:58:58,151 --> 00:59:00,050
what I felt...

1068
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:03,381
was that you were very sincere.

1069
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:08,821
I had so much fun, and I was so happy.

1070
00:59:09,661 --> 00:59:12,190
I think I was so happy.

1071
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:13,261
- Really?
- Yes.

1072
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:17,670
I like things like this. Leather.

1073
00:59:17,671 --> 00:59:22,101
(He found things he had in
common with the person he liked.)

1074
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:28,011
You said red looked good on you.

1075
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:30,211
- I remember that.
- You're right.

1076
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:37,621
(He remembered every
little thing Da Hye said.)

1077
00:59:39,221 --> 00:59:40,750
Can I check out your camera?

1078
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:42,091
I'd love that.

1079
00:59:43,421 --> 00:59:45,261
What a good memory.

1080
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:51,170
The reason I got into photography...

1081
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,301
is because my father runs
a photography studio.

1082
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:55,941
You must've been around cameras a lot.

1083
00:59:56,841 --> 00:59:59,070
Actually, when I was young,

1084
00:59:59,071 --> 01:00:01,580
- Did you not like it?
- I didn't really like...

1085
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:03,741
taking pictures...

1086
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:06,881
or being in pictures.

1087
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,580
Since I was young,

1088
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:11,991
I was very insecure about my appearance.

1089
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:14,790
- Why?
- I was very insecure.

1090
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:16,521
So, when I was young,

1091
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,760
I really didn't like...

1092
01:00:18,761 --> 01:00:21,461
- Your appearance?
- how foreign I looked.

1093
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:28,071
(After their date,
they spent time alone together.)

1094
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:35,211
(Thanks to Geon Wu,
Da Hye felt much more at ease.)

1095
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:37,511
- Earlier, I...
- Oh, my.

1096
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:42,851
I think on my dates with you,

1097
01:00:43,451 --> 01:00:46,590
I was most myself.

1098
01:00:46,591 --> 01:00:47,621
I see.

1099
01:00:52,091 --> 01:00:54,560
Well, I'm sure today...

1100
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:57,160
and tomorrow too, we'll have to pick again.

1101
01:00:57,161 --> 01:00:58,901
We'll have to pick again.

1102
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:05,310
I don't know what will happen,

1103
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:10,581
I'll probably pick you.

1104
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:13,010
(Geon Wu confesses his
feelings once again.)

1105
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:15,380
- I think I will.
- Right.

1106
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:18,251
(Geon Wu confesses his
feelings once again.)

1107
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:22,690
"I will pick you again,"

1108
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:24,930
"and I don't regret that."

1109
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:28,230
"I respect your pace."

1110
01:01:28,231 --> 01:01:31,000
I could tell he was caring about me.

1111
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:32,531
I was grateful.

1112
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:36,441
Da Hye is a good judge of character.

1113
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:38,340
Geon Wu is a good person.

1114
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:39,840
He's very considerate.

1115
01:01:39,841 --> 01:01:41,580
Their date was so nice.

1116
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:44,280
(Did Da Hye's feelings change?)

1117
01:01:44,281 --> 01:01:45,351
It was.

1118
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:51,350
(Darkness has come to their last night.)

1119
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:52,551
It's the last night.

1120
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:13,111
Oh, you surprised me.

1121
01:02:13,841 --> 01:02:15,480
- You're here.
- Yes.

1122
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,111
Give me your umbrella. I got it.

1123
01:02:17,381 --> 01:02:18,381
Thanks.

1124
01:02:19,551 --> 01:02:20,611
Oh, gosh.

1125
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:23,981
Oh, my goodness.

1126
01:02:25,821 --> 01:02:27,321
This is such a nice vibe.

1127
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:29,820
- Really?
- Yes, in the car...

1128
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:31,091
on a rainy day...

1129
01:02:34,461 --> 01:02:35,800
(What does she want to tell
Hyun Jin on their last night?)

1130
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:37,661
The mood is so nice.

1131
01:02:46,571 --> 01:02:48,740
- The sound of the rain.
- Exactly.

1132
01:02:48,741 --> 01:02:51,110
I really like listening to the rain...

1133
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:53,081
from inside the car.

1134
01:03:02,121 --> 01:03:03,121
A feeling of stability.

1135
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:04,790
A feeling that you're protected?

1136
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:05,891
Kind of like that.

1137
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:13,200
Honestly, on the first day,

1138
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:16,870
we hadn't gotten close yet.

1139
01:03:16,871 --> 01:03:19,470
We were meeting for the first time,

1140
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:20,770
so that first day...

1141
01:03:20,771 --> 01:03:23,011
felt very long to me.

1142
01:03:24,081 --> 01:03:25,180
That's how I felt,

1143
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:28,780
but exactly from the second
day, we went on dates...

1144
01:03:28,781 --> 01:03:31,551
and started spending time together.

1145
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,151
And each time, I thought,
"Why is today so short?'

1146
01:03:35,621 --> 01:03:38,190
Honestly, I can't even remember...

1147
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:39,530
everything that happened.

1148
01:03:39,531 --> 01:03:40,760
Everything felt...

1149
01:03:40,761 --> 01:03:42,760
like it rushed by so fast.

1150
01:03:42,761 --> 01:03:44,931
But during all of that...

1151
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:54,240
There were some good times.

1152
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:56,010
It was so meaningful.

1153
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:57,440
(Her time here felt meaningful
because she was with Hyun Jin.)

1154
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:59,151
It was a meaningful experience for me.

1155
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:00,651
Same for me.

1156
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:10,261
In my own way...

1157
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:12,291
I mean, it must be the same for everyone...

1158
01:04:12,591 --> 01:04:15,560
I think I did everything I could do.

1159
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:16,561
Right.

1160
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:18,670
Everyone has different dispositions.

1161
01:04:18,671 --> 01:04:19,731
Right.

1162
01:04:19,931 --> 01:04:22,641
So, with you...

1163
01:04:23,301 --> 01:04:24,500
I don't know.

1164
01:04:24,501 --> 01:04:26,870
When I think...

1165
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:28,611
about my dates with you,

1166
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:31,210
I really liked...

1167
01:04:31,211 --> 01:04:33,480
the sides of you...

1168
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:36,981
that you showed me.

1169
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:38,591
So...

1170
01:04:39,891 --> 01:04:42,120
I thought,

1171
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:43,990
"Hyun Jin..."

1172
01:04:43,991 --> 01:04:45,691
"is a really good person."

1173
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:54,701
How do you say such sweet words?

1174
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,300
Sin Young speaks so sweetly.

1175
01:04:57,301 --> 01:04:59,371
- She really does.
- She does.

1176
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,811
I think I can kind of drink coffee now.

1177
01:05:02,141 --> 01:05:03,340
(She couldn't drink coffee before.)

1178
01:05:03,341 --> 01:05:04,710
This is different from drip coffee.

1179
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:06,051
Thanks to Hyun Jin,

1180
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:07,881
I can drink coffee now.

1181
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,020
Something like this?
Should we do something like this?

1182
01:05:11,021 --> 01:05:12,521
Let's do it. Let's go.

1183
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:15,090
I think it's so hard for someone I like...

1184
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:16,990
- to also like me.
- It's such a hard thing.

1185
01:05:16,991 --> 01:05:18,430
Someone I like...

1186
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:19,461
I got you.

1187
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:21,901
Are you okay? It's okay. Hold my hand.

1188
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:23,601
Be careful.

1189
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:27,971
(Hyun Jin was always a
good person to Sin Young.)

1190
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:38,380
You've totally done that.

1191
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:39,981
I could feel that.

1192
01:05:41,211 --> 01:05:42,381
This is what I said.

1193
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:48,221
"Sin Young..."

1194
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,660
"keeps making me share
things about my dark side..."

1195
01:05:50,661 --> 01:05:52,231
"that I don't want to share."

1196
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:55,501
By that, I meant that you make
me that comfortable when we talk.

1197
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:59,501
You draw stories out of me.

1198
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,470
That made me tear up.

1199
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:05,770
He was saying he could show her
even the worst parts of him.

1200
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:09,581
(Hyun Jin could talk about
anything in front of Sin Young.)

1201
01:06:13,881 --> 01:06:19,851
(They shared their sincere
feelings on the last night.)

1202
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:23,361
This is so tough.

1203
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,260
Oh, gosh. It's so hard.

1204
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,331
That conversation was so precious.

1205
01:06:27,531 --> 01:06:28,630
She...

1206
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:30,760
- She really is a good person.
- She really is.

1207
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:31,900
- Seriously.
- We know.

1208
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:32,931
She really is.

1209
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:35,871
My heart hurts so much.

1210
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:37,741
(Don't cry, Ye Eun.)

1211
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,141
I think she's a good person. Gosh.

1212
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:46,350
- Why are you crying?
- Young Ji is crying.

1213
01:06:46,351 --> 01:06:49,020
Because I...

1214
01:06:49,021 --> 01:06:50,350
I really felt that.

1215
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:52,150
I think Hyun Jin really felt so.

1216
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:53,720
He described...

1217
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:55,590
Sin Young's beautiful soul...

1218
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:57,391
with those words.

1219
01:06:57,661 --> 01:07:00,531
I'm curious what Hyun
Jin will choose to do.

1220
01:07:03,101 --> 01:07:07,931
(And...)

1221
01:07:08,301 --> 01:07:13,271
(this person is waiting for someone.)

1222
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:15,480
(Jeong Geun wants one
last talk with Ji Eun.)

1223
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:16,741
I'm guessing Jeong Geun...

1224
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:19,451
asked Ji Eun to meet.

1225
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:24,791
While I was waiting for Ji Eun to show up,

1226
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:28,491
I was nervous. I was very anxious.

1227
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:30,960
After today,

1228
01:07:30,961 --> 01:07:33,491
I don't think Ji Eun and I...

1229
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:37,501
would have the chance to talk.

1230
01:07:44,201 --> 01:07:45,371
She's here.

1231
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:47,511
- It's Ji Eun.
- It's Ji Eun.

1232
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:01,251
Hello.

1233
01:08:02,461 --> 01:08:03,521
Who is that?

1234
01:08:03,861 --> 01:08:04,891
Oh, what?

1235
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:06,361
- Dong Ha?
- What?

1236
01:08:06,631 --> 01:08:07,890
- What?
- Hold on.

1237
01:08:07,891 --> 01:08:09,861
(Dong Ha was waiting for Ji Eun.)

1238
01:08:10,131 --> 01:08:11,301
Hello.

1239
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:13,431
Who is that?

1240
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:14,701
Oh, what?

1241
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:16,241
- Dong Ha?
- What?

1242
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:17,841
- What?
- Hold on.

1243
01:08:27,211 --> 01:08:28,520
It's going like this?

1244
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,581
What? Is this the end?

1245
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,820
I don't think Dong Ha
would've asked her to meet.

1246
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:33,821
- Of course.
- I think Ji Eun went to him.

1247
01:08:35,121 --> 01:08:37,821
Dong Ha shows up again at the end.

1248
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:39,761
Oh, next week.

1249
01:08:40,431 --> 01:08:41,531
I'm going crazy.

1250
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:46,901
(Who will their really good
friends' Final Pick be?)

1251
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:52,511
(Between the two of them...)

1252
01:08:53,141 --> 01:08:56,081
(flows a current of new emotions.)

1253
01:08:56,941 --> 01:08:59,810
(Unknowing how Ji Eun feels...)

1254
01:08:59,811 --> 01:09:01,781
(and having to wait endlessly,)

1255
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:07,251
(Jeong Geun is becoming anxious.)

1256
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:12,761
(In the end, Jeong Geun's
sincerity couldn't reach her.)

1257
01:09:13,931 --> 01:09:16,301
(Emotions come crashing down.)

1258
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:20,701
(A relationship is about to start...)

1259
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:23,671
(But I...)

1260
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:26,871
(She became confused about how she feels.)

1261
01:09:27,341 --> 01:09:29,210
(Afterward,)

1262
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:32,751
(their last heartfelt messages)

1263
01:09:34,351 --> 01:09:36,851
- Why?
- She must have a lot on her mind.

1264
01:09:37,351 --> 01:09:40,321
(Their last night is full of turmoil.)

1265
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:44,320
(Final Pick D-Day)

1266
01:09:44,321 --> 01:09:47,831
(With their final choices coming up,)

1267
01:09:49,361 --> 01:09:50,801
(the atmosphere has changed.)

1268
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:53,971
(I was so nervous.)

1269
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:56,541
(The time has come.)

1270
01:09:57,271 --> 01:09:59,470
(I became more careful.)

1271
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:01,541
(I think I kept waiting for assurance.)

1272
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:04,711
(It finally begins.)

1273
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:13,050
(Their final choices aimed at each other)

1274
01:10:13,051 --> 01:10:19,631
(Their final choices aimed at each other)

1275
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:23,530
(Unpredictable results)

1276
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:27,001
(Hearts that waver until the very end)

1277
01:10:27,601 --> 01:10:29,601
Even though he expressed
his feelings so much...

1278
01:10:31,141 --> 01:10:35,740
(Will they be able to meet...)

1279
01:10:35,741 --> 01:10:39,051
(a really good person?)

1280
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:43,850
(How will things end for them?)

1281
01:10:43,851 --> 01:10:47,990
(How will things end for them?)

1282
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:49,090
(So look.)

1283
01:10:49,091 --> 01:10:50,790
(I know a really good person.)

1284
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,760
(I'll introduce you to them.)

1285
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:54,731
(Knock on the door to their heart.)

1286
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:57,701
(I guarantee my friend is a good person.)

1287
01:10:57,961 --> 01:11:00,000
(Date My Friend)

1288
01:11:00,001 --> 01:11:01,100
(You know what?)

1289
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:02,800
(I actually know someone really great.)

1290
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:04,770
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

1291
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:06,741
(Just open your heart a little.)

1292
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,780
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

1293
01:11:09,781 --> 01:11:11,981
(Date My Friend)
