1
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,190
(You know what?)

2
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,731
(I actually know someone really great.)

3
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,631
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

4
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,631
(Just open your heart a little.)

5
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,601
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

6
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:24,870
(Date My Friend)

7
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:28,870
(Their first time eating dinner together.)

8
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:31,641
(His gaze keeps lingering on someone.)

9
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:36,511
(I think she's someone I want to get to know better.)

10
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:40,151
(I chose Ji Eun...)

11
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:42,520
(because she's the prettiest.)

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:45,460
(I choose Da Hye.)

13
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:47,561
(Kim Geon Wu)

14
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,030
(I realised I was...)

15
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,330
(being drawn toward Geon Wu.)

16
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,761
(Her heart lingers toward him, more and more.)

17
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,171
(On their second morning, they found...)

18
00:00:58,371 --> 00:00:59,371
What?

19
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:02,440
(Go on a date with the person recommended by the Lovebuds.)

20
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,770
(Kim Geon Wu and Kim Sin Young, Shin Dong Ha and Lee Da Hye)

21
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,181
(Ha Jeong Geun and Choi Ji Eun, Oh Hyun Jin and Kang Su Jin)

22
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:07,911
(Hyun Jin and Su Jin took the bus to go on their first date.)

23
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:10,310
(He was very considerate...)

24
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,950
(and I felt butterflies.)

25
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,720
(After today's date, )

26
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:16,250
(I feel like I’ve opened my heart halfway.)

27
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,021
(She let her guard down throughout the date.)

28
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,521
(Da Hye and Dong Ha had their date, as well.)

29
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:23,530
(An activity-based date)

30
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:27,060
(They carefully held hands...)

31
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:29,800
(and looked into each other's eyes and began to spend...)

32
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,770
(their time alone together.)

33
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:34,211
(It's relaxing. I'm having a great time.)

34
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,640
(I tend to be a handful.)

35
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:37,910
(I'm so high-maintenance.)

36
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:40,581
(If you need attention, I can give you the attention.)

37
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:41,980
(Their dates are over.)

38
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:45,680
(It's now time to make their second choice.)

39
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,621
(Where is Dong Ha's heart headed after his date with Da Hye?)

40
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,151
(Choi Ji Eun)

41
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,920
- Gosh.
- I knew it.

42
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,360
(It's hard to predict...)

43
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:55,961
(how their friends feel.)

44
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,100
A lot happened last week.

45
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,960
- That's right.
- We were completely hooked.

46
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:01,200
Through Lovebud Matching,

47
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,930
- they went on their first dates.
- Yes.

48
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,370
So Ra, I remember Dong Ha saying something impressive.

49
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,400
He did.

50
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,810
He said, "If you need attention,"

51
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,511
- "I can give you the attention." - "The attention."

52
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,941
- Right. I'm curious, though. Look.
- What is it?

53
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,280
- They went on a date, right?
- Yes.

54
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:16,180
They gave each other butterflies,

55
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,550
- and they flirted.
- Yes.

56
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,521
So why would he choose someone else?

57
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,590
- He said he'd give her attention.
- Right, he flirted.

58
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:22,690
Right, he flirted with her.

59
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:25,161
And he talked as if he were imagining their future together.

60
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,690
Isn't that the decent, well-mannered thing to do?

61
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,590
- Look. He is well-mannered, but...
- It's not like he can...

62
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,830
- put up walls the entire time.
- He is well-mannered.

63
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,060
It's nice that he's well-mannered,

64
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:35,000
but he could have toned down the flirting.

65
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,970
She said, "I'm so high-maintenance."

66
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:38,940
- What was he supposed to say?
- Right.

67
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,470
"Really? That must be hard."

68
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,571
"High-maintenance? That's too much work." Like this?

69
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:45,040
"What a hassle." It's not like he could have said that.

70
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,540
He could have just said, "That must be hard."

71
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,780
What was he supposed to do?

72
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:48,950
He should just say, "I see."

73
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,050
He usually doesn't get this upset.

74
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,180
"I don't like high-maintenance women."

75
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,920
- Nice.
- Say that and get off the boat?

76
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,590
No, that's not a decent thing to do.

77
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,920
Should he not have let her take the row, either?

78
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,160
- Why are you saying all that?
- Time-out.

79
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,460
- What should he have said instead?
- He should have just...

80
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:01,930
Here's what I think. Normally,

81
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,290
these things wouldn't be a problem.

82
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,460
But since we're all rooting for our friends...

83
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:07,100
- Right. That's why.
- We're all so invested in this.

84
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:09,200
We're so immersed and since this is happening to our friends,

85
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,200
it feels a lot more personal.

86
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,400
- Right.
- So we can't help but be bothered.

87
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,740
- But don't worry too much.
- Us talking won't change anything.

88
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:16,240
- The dates aren't over yet.
- Yes.

89
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,980
There are still a lot more choices to be made.

90
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,340
- You're right.
- Geon Wu and Sin Young...

91
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,410
- haven't gone on their date yet.
- I'm so excited.

92
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,680
I feel like she'll exude charm.

93
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,980
Let's continue watching the Lovebud Matching Dates.

94
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:27,250
- Knock knock.
- Knock knock.

95
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,291
- Knock knock.
- Who is it?

96
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,851
(Lee Mi Joo and her friend, Lee Da Hye)

97
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:32,761
(Lee Gwan Hee and his friend, Ha Jeong Geun)

98
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:35,131
(Ji Ye Eun and her friend, Kim Sin Young)

99
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,661
(Cho Sae Ho and his friend, Kim Geon Wu)

100
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,401
(Kim Young Kwang and his friend, Kang Su Jin)

101
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:43,131
(Kim Nam Hee and his friend, Oh Hyun Jin)

102
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:45,671
(Kang So Ra and her friend, Choi Ji Eun)

103
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:48,271
(Hur Young Ji and her friend, Shin Dong Ha)

104
00:03:56,311 --> 00:04:00,051
(Episode 3. Secrets)

105
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:02,990
(Which couple will be going on their first Lovebud Matching Date?)

106
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,420
- I wish I could be there.
- Yes.

107
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,491
(Which couple will be going on their first Lovebud Matching Date?)

108
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:07,931
Let's go.

109
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:10,791
Do you know how to drive?

110
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,731
No, I don't.

111
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:16,230
You look like you're about to start driving.

112
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:18,171
(Jeong Geun and Ji Eun, matched by Gwan Hee and So Ra)

113
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,141
Do you know how to drive?

114
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,441
- I do have a license.
- But not much driving experience?

115
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,411
- Very little experience.
- I see.

116
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:26,981
Do you trust me?

117
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,181
More than I trust myself, at least.

118
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,591
"Gwan Hee's Recommendation?"

119
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,791
(Gwan Hee received an envelope...)

120
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:43,490
What is this?

121
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,230
(with Lovebud Guarantees of the genuinely good people.)

122
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:46,231
Gosh.

123
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:49,971
Jeong Geun's first choice...

124
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:52,641
would be her, I think.

125
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,201
Choi Ji Eun.

126
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,070
- Gosh.
- I knew it.

127
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,510
(Lovebud Guarantee, Choi Ji Eun)

128
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,140
She seems like the quiet type.

129
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,581
So if they go somewhere that he frequently goes to,

130
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:03,851
like jazz bars or LP bars,

131
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:06,951
and he confidently takes charge of the date,

132
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,921
they'll get along nicely.

133
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:11,521
Wait. What?

134
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:17,391
(Who did So Ra choose as her friend's first choice?)

135
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,231
Jeong Geun.

136
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,170
You've got a great eye.

137
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,601
(In sync)

138
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:26,640
He's dressed in a simple dress shirt,

139
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:28,341
and he's at a gallery.

140
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,280
It might be the lightning, but from this angle,

141
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,141
it looks like conditioner...

142
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,311
is part of his haircare routine.

143
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,881
So it seems like he's someone who takes good care of himself.

144
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:40,851
I have a good feeling about this.

145
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,121
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

146
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:49,531
(The Lovebuds' choices aligned from the very beginning.)

147
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,331
I hope their date goes well.

148
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:57,801
(Will the two feel the same way as their Lovebuds?)

149
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,241
Did you get some good sleep last night?

150
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,171
Our sleeping arrangements changed.

151
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:07,141
- Not as well as I thought I would.
- Right.

152
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:08,751
- Did you go to sleep late?
- But...

153
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:10,651
Yes, around 2am.

154
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,150
He speaks so kindly.

155
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:14,490
- Right. He's so kind.
- He's so kind.

156
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:15,591
"Did you go to sleep late?"

157
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:20,191
What's your usual ideal type?

158
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:22,530
- "My ideal type?" - Yes, personality-wise.

159
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:24,191
- Conversion?
- I see.

160
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:25,960
I see. Someone you can talk to.

161
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:27,060
Someone I can...

162
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,531
- Talk easily to?
- hold a conversation with.

163
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,631
You don’t have a preference when it comes to looks?

164
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,741
Not really. If the conversation flows easily,

165
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:38,980
- looks don't really matter to me.
- I'm asking because I think...

166
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,940
your Lovebud would have made her choice based on your type.

167
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:42,481
- Gosh.
- You don't think so?

168
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:46,481
I don't know. I did tell him about my type.

169
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,650
So I felt like, if my Lovebud did choose,

170
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:52,991
he made his decision based on that.

171
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:57,831
I see. What's your type?

172
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,031
- My type?
- Yes.

173
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:05,201
(Curious)

174
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,571
I told him I liked tall women.

175
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,311
Everyone here is tall, so I was surprised.

176
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:13,710
(Tell me more.)

177
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:15,551
She's asking for details.

178
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,520
(In that case)

179
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:23,450
I told him I preferred someone who was taller than 165cm or 166cm.

180
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,791
(Nodding)

181
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:27,991
And I told him I preferred someone with long hair.

182
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,561
(Someone with long hair?)

183
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,001
That's me.

184
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:41,870
- "That's me?" - I thought Ji Eun...

185
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,671
was supposed to be an introvert. She just said, "That's me."

186
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:44,881
She's a foix.

187
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,981
- She said, "She's a fox." - Unbelievable.

188
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,481
All my worries were for nothing.

189
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,481
- What could it be?
- I think it is an LP bar.

190
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,791
- Maybe an LP cafe?
- What could it be? Is this it?

191
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,490
- What is this?
- Gosh.

192
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:02,230
- This place looks nice.
- Look at all the vinyl records.

193
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,791
It has such a nice ambiance.

194
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,530
- It's so charming.
- Yes.

195
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,971
(An LP cafe)

196
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,431
- A vinyl record...
- I like this.

197
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,140
What? The figures?

198
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:14,571
- Oh, cameras. You like them, right?
- Yes.

199
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,940
Cameras and old phones.

200
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:19,510
(The vintage cameras all over the cafe...)

201
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:22,411
(completely nailed Ji Eun's taste.)

202
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,651
That's us.

203
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:27,421
- You can take pictures of that.
- I see.

204
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:35,130
(They take their first picture together.)

205
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,991
One, two, three.

206
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,570
Well, then.

207
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,631
Is there a singer you want to listen to?

208
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:45,571
- A song I want to listen to?
- Yes.

209
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:48,040
- I wonder what song he'll choose.
- Let's see if they have it.

210
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,810
He's familiar with all kinds of genres.

211
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,710
- He probably knows all of them.
- Does he like everything?

212
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,081
Yes, he enjoys all genres.

213
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,210
Do you have anything by Eric Benet?

214
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,351
- Pardon?
- Eric Benet?

215
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:58,881
- We don't have Eric Benet.
- I see.

216
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,151
Out.

217
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,591
Let's see.

218
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:06,360
(It was supposed to be Jeong Geun's time...)

219
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,990
(to show off his charm...)

220
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,531
These vinyl records are from way back.

221
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:13,731
Then...

222
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:16,330
- They are too old.
- Gosh.

223
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:17,730
- What now?
- His mind froze.

224
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:18,971
Just take out anything, Jeong Geun.

225
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:26,641
(She pretends to be uninterested.)

226
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,051
This one is...

227
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,650
(The owner comes forward to help.)

228
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:35,151
We only have albums from the '60s and '70s.

229
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:37,050
(It unexpectedly takes longer for him to choose a song.)

230
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,790
Jeong Geun must be having a mental breakdown.

231
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,291
(It unexpectedly takes longer for him to choose a song.)

232
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,431
I really searched hard, but...

233
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,900
I was searching for "golden hour" by JVKE,

234
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,931
or "drunk text,"

235
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,540
which is a song...

236
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:57,611
that expresses love while under the influence of alcohol.

237
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,980
I actually wanted to listen...

238
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:02,751
to those kinds of songs with Ji Eun.

239
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,780
It was hard to find any of the albums...

240
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:11,050
that I wanted to share with her,

241
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:13,361
so I was very flustered.

242
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:14,621
His distinct...

243
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,361
calmness.

244
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,961
And the cheeky side within his calmness was...

245
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,201
quite charming.

246
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,070
- What?
- Really?

247
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,340
- She liked it.
- Because she's attracted.

248
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,441
- She likes him.
- On the contrary.

249
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:28,370
He looks tough on the outside,

250
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:30,311
- but if he stammers a bit...
- I see.

251
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:32,910
If I were the lady, I think that would seem cute.

252
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,050
Because he's trying hard to find anything.

253
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,851
He should know beforehand if he was planning to go there.

254
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:40,750
He doesn't know everything.

255
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:41,790
(Calming down)

256
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,491
- He doesn't know everything.
- That's her style.

257
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:44,551
You're right.

258
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:45,590
(She ends it with a quick apology.)

259
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:46,661
It’s possible not to know.

260
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:48,360
- Could we...
- Yes.

261
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,390
Try this?

262
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:50,461
(It ends as a collaboration with the owner.)

263
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:56,801
So...

264
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,171
Like the place in Paju.

265
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,210
- That place.
- I think I know.

266
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:04,270
- Do you know it?
- Yes.

267
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:05,341
Have you ever been there?

268
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,141
I...

269
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,281
It's so hot, isn't it?

270
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:12,451
You go ahead.

271
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,951
You seem really hot.

272
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:18,991
(This guy is sweating because of the vinyl records.)

273
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,161
(Ji Eun picks up a camera.)

274
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,461
(Glancing)

275
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,001
- Does it work?
- Yes.

276
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,841
It's one of the models that I've been wanting.

277
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,011
- This one?
- Yes.

278
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:47,381
(The camera heads towards Ji Eun.)

279
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,321
Does it work?

280
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:58,531
Look here. Do a peace sign.

281
00:11:58,861 --> 00:11:59,961
I'll take a good one for you.

282
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,000
One, two, three.

283
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:07,600
(Jeong Geun slowly approaches Ji Eun with her interest.)

284
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,511
How do I see it? Is it this one?

285
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,010
These two really seem like...

286
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,280
- they are on a date.
- Yes.

287
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,540
- It does seem like a date.
- The lovey-dovey vibe is good.

288
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,781
(They grow closer to each other.)

289
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,380
(Both turning)

290
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:20,381
(Touch)

291
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:22,121
That makes your heart skip a beat. You know, right?

292
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,190
- What?
- What is it?

293
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,650
- Is he at it again?
- He touched her.

294
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:26,060
- He's at it again.
- He touched her.

295
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,760
- Again.
- That's understandable.

296
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,831
- He's at it again.
- Come on.

297
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:31,601
- He touched her.
- He touched her?

298
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,000
- He's good at touching.
- He does.

299
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,231
It's only hard the first time.

300
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:37,130
(They become more comfortable with each other as time passes.)

301
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,170
Sorry.

302
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,900
(They become more comfortable with each other as time passes.)

303
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,471
But it's cute.

304
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:44,341
No?

305
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,411
Let's listen to AKMU.

306
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:49,351
- Will he play it?
- He will.

307
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,280
- Sir.
- Yes.

308
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:52,451
That's it.

309
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:54,421
Could you play it for us?

310
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,021
Thank you.

311
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:57,791
The one I like happened to be here.

312
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:00,161
Your skirt is too short.

313
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:02,331
Would you like to put this over?

314
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:05,631
Thank you.

315
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:08,631
- You're wearing a tank top?
- I'll go with the tank top.

316
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:14,640
- Goodness.
- What?

317
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:16,370
(Jeong Geun is endlessly delicate towards Ji Eun.)

318
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:17,540
My goodness.

319
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,611
Gosh.

320
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:25,850
(This time, Jeong Geun picks up...)

321
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:29,391
(the disposable camera.)

322
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:34,960
How do you use these types of cameras?

323
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,191
Do I just take it?

324
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,131
There's a way.

325
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:39,601
Can you tell me?

326
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,300
This one...

327
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,430
How do you take a picture?

328
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:44,771
(He tries to enjoy what Ji Eun likes.)

329
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,101
You really like cameras, don't you?

330
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:48,441
Don't.

331
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:51,241
One, two, three.

332
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:53,540
If you do that, then the picture is taken.

333
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,580
- Really?
- Yes.

334
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:57,280
- If you turn it all the way, - Yes.

335
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,450
It will stop.

336
00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:59,581
Then you press it.

337
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,591
Then you'll hear the clicking sound.

338
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,651
I liked it.

339
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:08,731
It was just the two of us listening to the vinyl records,

340
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,760
and I was very pleased to see...

341
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,901
Ji Eun showing interest in them.

342
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:18,941
One-on-one dates really do give...

343
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:21,541
the intimacy.

344
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:24,771
How is Jeong Geun compared to his usual self?

345
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:25,980
He's so different.

346
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:30,480
But I can see that he is working hard...

347
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:32,520
- to relate with Ji Eun.
- That's nice.

348
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:33,980
I get it with Jeong Geun.

349
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,890
You said Ji Eun is an introvert.

350
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,850
I think she saw how hard Jeong Geun was trying.

351
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:40,260
- Yes.
- She saw how the introvert...

352
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:41,630
- Yes.
- was trying hard for her.

353
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,831
I know.

354
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:45,430
And another tip I gave him was that...

355
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,930
- Yes?
- he will be the most fit...

356
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,471
among all the other guys.

357
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:53,300
So if he gets the chance to show it off,

358
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,670
he should be bold and take his clothes off.

359
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:56,541
- So that tank top was a tactic?
- Sure.

360
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:57,870
I see.

361
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:00,381
But between pushing up the sleeves of a dress shirt...

362
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,080
- and a tank top...
- Hey,

363
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,580
- aren't you on my side?
- I'm just asking...

364
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:04,910
- the ladies.
- Okay.

365
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,651
- Since I don't know, either.
- Okay.

366
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,220
- I prefer...
- A tank top is different.

367
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:09,390
- a dress shirt.
- It's not like he was shirtless.

368
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:11,890
- Yes, the sleeves.
- The dress shirt.

369
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:12,920
- When the sleeves are pushed back, - Just a bit.

370
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:14,420
- and the veins are popping.
- Yes.

371
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:15,630
- But everyone can be different.
- For me,

372
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:17,760
a tank top, but are the armpits well-groomed?

373
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:18,960
If so, then I prefer the tank top.

374
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,660
- Mine are well-groomed, - Yes.

375
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:21,731
So would you like to...

376
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:25,000
No? The tank top...

377
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:26,841
Could you hold it up?

378
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:28,371
Well...

379
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:29,740
They are well-groomed.

380
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,140
That's a wife beater.

381
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:33,880
- His are well-groomed.
- Excuse me.

382
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:35,450
Why is he holding my arm up?

383
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:36,950
- Your armpits are so clean.
- His are well-groomed.

384
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:38,550
- I keep them clean.
- Yes.

385
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:39,551
I will take that back.

386
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:40,620
- I will take that back.
- His body is great.

387
00:15:40,621 --> 00:15:42,291
- I do exercise as well.
- Okay.

388
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll choose the dress shirt. I'm sorry.

389
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,661
- I'll change.
- I mean...

390
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,160
It's a good thing the weather is great.

391
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,530
It's great.

392
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:55,101
(Sae Ho and Ye Eun's match, Sin Young and Geon Wu)

393
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,600
Goodness.

394
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,770
- The model couple.
- My side was open.

395
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:58,840
(Which date spot did the Lovebuds recommend?)

396
00:15:58,841 --> 00:15:59,870
- This is nice.
- He's handsome.

397
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:00,871
They are a good match.

398
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,471
They look good together because they have similar vibes.

399
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:05,441
"The ocean?"

400
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,281
(Lovebud Ye Eun's Recommendation, Geon Wu and Sin Young)

401
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,980
(Who do you think will be the best match for your friend?)

402
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:11,150
(Lovebud Guarantee, Kim Geon Wu)

403
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:12,521
(Lovebud Guarantee, Oh Hyun Jin)

404
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,081
Kim Geon Wu.

405
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:18,521
He has great style.

406
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:21,361
I think this kind of guy will be good for Sin Young.

407
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:23,261
One that just clicked...

408
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:24,731
was Sin Young.

409
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:26,360
She is an ENFP,

410
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,730
so my first thoughts are that...

411
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,101
she could lead Geon Wu well.

412
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:32,240
That's so interesting.

413
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,801
We really never agreed on this.

414
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,310
(Did you like the date your Lovebud matched you with?)

415
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:37,610
My Lovebud.

416
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,911
(Did you like the date your Lovebud matched you with?)

417
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,141
I loved it, which shocked me.

418
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,850
I actually spent more time with Geon Wu...

419
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,321
than I thought.

420
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,781
He's making it like art.

421
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:48,391
- That's nice.
- Goodness.

422
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,721
Yes.

423
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:55,261
(She sat next to Geon Wu at the cafe on the first day.)

424
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:59,260
(She was next to Geon Wu during their morning run.)

425
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:00,300
But our conversations...

426
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:03,731
were mostly things that all three of us could talk about,

427
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:05,970
so I was a little disappointed...

428
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:11,010
that I couldn't have a private conversation with him.

429
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:13,110
So I did want to have...

430
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:16,911
a conversation with him.

431
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:20,250
(Will Sin Young be able to talk with Geon Wu more?)

432
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:21,281
This is nice.

433
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:24,051
- Gosh. What was that?
- Oh my gosh.

434
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:26,390
What was that?

435
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,291
(Startled)

436
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:29,431
He's so close to her.

437
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:31,461
Should I wear my sunglasses, too?

438
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:32,601
You should.

439
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:33,760
It's a must today.

440
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,801
- Right?
- Yes.

441
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,030
- They look so good together.
- Yes.

442
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:40,301
- They are so stylish.
- Geon Wu has a great side profile.

443
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:44,111
(They head to the sea, full of excitement.)

444
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,541
I still really love the sea.

445
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:48,450
Do you like the sea?

446
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,011
I do like the sea, but...

447
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:51,550
- I love playing in the water, - Yes.

448
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:53,420
But the distinct...

449
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:54,950
- Ickiness?
- Yes, the ickiness.

450
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,350
- It's sticky.
- Yes.

451
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:57,850
- With the salt water.
- Yes.

452
00:17:57,851 --> 00:17:59,420
It makes me a bit...

453
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:01,521
Right. It does feel a bit unpleasant.

454
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:04,860
Sin Young said she liked the sea.

455
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:06,760
But when he said it's icky, and she went with it right away.

456
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,201
Yes, she's the type to go along with it.

457
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:15,741
It's the sea. Finally.

458
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,071
It's so pretty.

459
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,680
Gosh.

460
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,841
It's so pretty.

461
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:23,680
Gosh, it's pretty.

462
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:24,980
- They are like models.
- Yes, they are so tall.

463
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:26,820
(They are like models on the runway.)

464
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,980
They look great together.

465
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,891
- Their image fits nicely.
- This couple looks so hip.

466
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,861
Are we getting on it?

467
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,730
- Is it a yacht?
- Is it a yacht?

468
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:39,061
- It's a yacht.
- It's really a yacht.

469
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,571
- That's the best.
- That's nice.

470
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,501
- I love it.
- The yacht.

471
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,670
- That will work great.
- That's nice.

472
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,171
(The Lovebud's recommendation for the couple is a yacht date.)

473
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:52,311
A yacht sounds nice. A yacht?

474
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,611
I think they will look amazing, since they are like models.

475
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:58,250
It will look like a movie.

476
00:18:58,251 --> 00:18:59,851
They will be a model couple.

477
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:02,051
Geon Wu is great at taking pictures,

478
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,350
so I think it would be nice for them...

479
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,561
to go to a place with a great background for taking pictures.

480
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:10,960
You need to fall in love if you're on a yacht.

481
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,930
- That's so nice.
- The sea looks amazing.

482
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,630
- Gosh, that's nice.
- I want to ride that.

483
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,671
That's great.

484
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:19,071
Have you ever been on a yacht like this?

485
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,470
No, it's my first time on a yacht.

486
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:21,541
- Really?
- Yes.

487
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:23,541
Amazing.

488
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:25,781
Gosh.

489
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:28,651
This is so nice.

490
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,411
Should we sit on the bean bag?

491
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:31,681
Have a seat.

492
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:34,721
Goodness.

493
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:37,591
Gosh.

494
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,461
This is...

495
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:43,131
- Is yours okay? Mine gets flat.
- Yes.

496
00:19:43,331 --> 00:19:44,831
No, let's exchange it.

497
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:46,131
- Thank you.
- Yes.

498
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,430
(Geon Wu changes seats right away for Sin Young.)

499
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:50,600
- Are you okay?
- It's quite flat.

500
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:51,731
- It gets flat, doesn't it?
- Yes.

501
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:54,241
Thank you. Gosh, this is so nice.

502
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:56,511
It's so nice.

503
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:57,970
It's really cool out here.

504
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,040
It's much cooler...

505
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,741
- than inside.
- It's much cooler.

506
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:03,480
(Tapping her feet)

507
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,381
Sin Young loves it.

508
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:10,190
I have something I want to ask you.

509
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:11,491
- What?
- You said that...

510
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,760
- age doesn't matter to you.
- Right.

511
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:17,730
How many years older would you be okay with?

512
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:19,001
Up to ten years older.

513
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,500
- Ten years?
- Ten years older?

514
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:22,831
It's my first time hearing that.

515
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,300
Is Geon Wu young?

516
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:27,701
I guess he likes it when the lady leads.

517
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:31,111
My head is starting to spin a bit.

518
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,781
Is it? Oh, no.

519
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,641
- Are you getting seasick?
- Yes.

520
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:43,520
- Are you okay?
- I think it's here.

521
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:44,950
It got tough as soon as we got here.

522
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,491
Is it tough here? Oh, no.

523
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,190
He's getting seasick.

524
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:51,361
(The rough waves disturb their date.)

525
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,501
Wouldn't he feel better if he just threw up?

526
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:57,031
And they can get closer as she pats his back.

527
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,470
- But it's their first date.
- Not on their first date?

528
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:00,601
(Vomiting as flirting is a bit much.)

529
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,910
It's really shaking, all of a sudden.

530
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,040
I think I'm slowly starting to get seasick.

531
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,041
- Really?
- Yes.

532
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:10,611
(The mood is brought down due to Geon Wu's seasickness.)

533
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:14,151
(Geon Wu keeps having a hard time.)

534
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,891
(Worried)

535
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:22,361
Geon Wu was getting seasick and had a hard time,

536
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:23,931
so I was worried about him.

537
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,231
I got seasick,

538
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:30,901
so I felt really bad about that.

539
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:32,600
- He would be so...
- It's not like he wanted...

540
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,001
- to get seasick.
- I know.

541
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,011
It's okay.

542
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:41,781
(Looking around)

543
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,210
- Can you stay put here?
- Here?

544
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:46,780
Despite it all, he's going to take pictures.

545
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:48,690
(Geon Wu tries not to show that he is getting sick.)

546
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:49,790
- How sweet.
- He's taking her picture.

547
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,691
He's getting seasick, but he's still taking her picture.

548
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:54,720
Is this the right pose?

549
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:56,430
- Am I looking this way?
- Yes.

550
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:57,631
- Okay.
- One moment.

551
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:10,371
- It looks too dangerous for you.
- No, it's okay.

552
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:13,741
Will you pose for me?

553
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:19,680
She's posing since he wants to take her picture,

554
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:21,250
but she knows that he's not feeling well.

555
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:27,161
(They both try their best, aware of each other's efforts.)

556
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:33,961
- Did it turn out well?
- Yes. Be careful.

557
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:35,331
It's like this.

558
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:40,601
Geon Wu wasn't feeling so well,

559
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:44,011
but he took my pictures...

560
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:45,270
and helped choose the best ones.

561
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:47,011
"This one is nice."

562
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,511
I loved it.

563
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:49,811
Goodness.

564
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:53,881
- Are they turning out nicely?
- Let's see them. Hold on.

565
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,951
Gosh, this is so...

566
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,891
The boat is really rocky. Be careful.

567
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:02,390
(Stumbling)

568
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:03,560
- She's falling.
- Hold her.

569
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:05,391
- He held out his hand.
- Hold her.

570
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:08,560
She didn't see. I wish she could've seen his hand.

571
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,270
I think he was going to, but missed the timing.

572
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:11,301
- Yes.
- He went like this.

573
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,600
(Geon Wu held his hand out on the yacht.)

574
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,711
When?

575
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:21,411
He held his hand out like this?

576
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,951
I didn't see that at all.

577
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:25,451
- She didn't see it.
- Oh, no. Sin Young.

578
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,151
I didn't see that at all.

579
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:30,551
Why did you tell her now?

580
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,420
If only he didn't get seasick...

581
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:35,360
I sent them on a yacht date,

582
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:37,591
only thinking of how beautiful it would be.

583
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,400
He turned out to be...

584
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:42,170
- prone to seasickness.
- But those situations...

585
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,070
could make their bond stronger.

586
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:46,200
On the contrary? When you get sick,

587
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:48,140
- you tend to bond.
- You take care of the person.

588
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,470
Emotions can grow by taking care of each other.

589
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,840
When they were talking in the car,

590
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:54,680
they both seemed to be bolder,

591
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,450
compared to when they were with the whole group.

592
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,950
And it seemed like they were both interested.

593
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:01,350
But on the yacht, because of his seasickness,

594
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:04,850
we couldn't tell how they were feeling.

595
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:06,190
- Yes, let's keep watching them.
- Yes.

596
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:08,560
It was great in the car. We should keep an eye on them.

597
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:09,891
Yes. What a pity.

598
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,290
My heart is breaking.

599
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,361
(Will they be able to safely finish the seasickness date?)

600
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:16,730
(On the other hand, how is Su Jin and Hyun Jin's date going?)

601
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,501
- That gave me the creeps.
- Yes.

602
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:20,071
This is it.

603
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,071
Gosh.

604
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:23,941
Over there.

605
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,941
- They have snacks.
- I just saw that, too.

606
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm hungry.

607
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:29,881
- Should we go there?
- They have snacks.

608
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:31,580
Tteokbokki.

609
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:33,481
- That looks so good.
- I want tteokbokki.

610
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,051
That looks so good.

611
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,291
I want to go on a date.

612
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:42,190
Here's the cheese tteokbokki.

613
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:43,291
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

614
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,191
- Gosh.
- That looks good.

615
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:48,400
This is the food for our first date.

616
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:50,031
I know. It's snacks.

617
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:52,401
I like it. It feels familiar.

618
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:54,671
The market feels familiar, to begin with.

619
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,910
I love it.

620
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,571
(Su Jin and Hyun Jin love the date at the market.)

621
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,541
- Thank you.
- Let me help.

622
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:04,550
Just a bit of noodles for me.

623
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:05,581
- Just a bit?
- Yes.

624
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:08,891
(Very little)

625
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:11,991
That's too little, though.

626
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:14,820
Sorry. I was playing with you.

627
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:16,430
- You did that on purpose, right?
- Sure.

628
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,961
- This is enough, right?
- Yes, that's nice.

629
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,930
Su Jin must be loving it. Look at her smile.

630
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:22,371
How cute.

631
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:27,541
- I'll try it.
- Okay.

632
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:31,511
(Glancing)

633
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:36,981
- Gosh, thank you.
- I was being...

634
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,951
- so thoughtless. Sorry.
- Thank you.

635
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,950
- Don't you need one?
- I'm good.

636
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,290
(He brought an apron for Su Jin.)

637
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,061
- I'm...
- I was looking for one.

638
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:53,001
It's good.

639
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,471
- For you, - Yes.

640
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:03,470
What is the first thing that draws you...

641
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:06,081
- when it comes to men?
- For me?

642
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,680
- I'm tall, - Yes.

643
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,781
So I do see the height first.

644
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:11,551
And I also look at their inner qualities.

645
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:15,251
Their actions, way of speaking,

646
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:19,160
their attitude towards others.

647
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,790
Sure, that's important.

648
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:23,491
I think actions represent the person.

649
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:26,700
I take those most into consideration.

650
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,761
- I think it's important too.
- Yes, really.

651
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,470
And you were...

652
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:32,941
the model example of it.

653
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:36,541
I felt it a lot today.

654
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,870
Such as...

655
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:39,841
walking on the street and opening the door for me.

656
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,681
You were so well-mannered.

657
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:50,121
(From the moment they left the house, )

658
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:53,020
(Hyun Jin was considerate of Su Jin throughout.)

659
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:54,760
- That's so sweet.
- He let her stand...

660
00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:55,930
away from the road.

661
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:57,630
(Hyun Jin was considerate of Su Jin throughout.)

662
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:58,931
He's so nice.

663
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:01,960
When we walked by the roadside,

664
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:04,000
he kept checking if a car was coming.

665
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:06,000
He kept an eye on me all the time,

666
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,501
and I could feel it.

667
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:11,940
Because of those aspects, I got to like him more.

668
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,081
That is today's takeaway.

669
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:17,280
He's cool.

670
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:19,251
- He's cool.
- He's cool.

671
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:22,081
- It makes your heart flutter.
- It does.

672
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:26,561
(My friend, keep it up.)

673
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,490
- What do you look for?
- For what?

674
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:29,690
What do you see in women?

675
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,861
It's my turn to ask you a question.

676
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:32,601
For me...

677
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:35,531
I wish she would be considerate.

678
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:37,631
It doesn't have to be about me.

679
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:39,170
- Considerate to everyone?
- To others.

680
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,001
- Right.
- Being considerate of others.

681
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,840
The basic things.

682
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:45,170
- I find those important.
- Yes.

683
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:48,141
Yes, I know what you mean. Those minor aspects. Me too.

684
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:51,810
I think so too. So...

685
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:56,251
(The more they talk, the more similarities they find.)

686
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:05,331
Since today is our first date...

687
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:06,930
You've only met two so far.

688
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:09,001
But you said you weren't curious about the rest.

689
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,871
- He must've said that.
- Did he?

690
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,401
No?

691
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:15,771
I do want to go on a date with all four guys.

692
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,910
Aren't you curious about other girls too?

693
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:19,110
- No.
- No?

694
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,281
- Really?
- Yes.

695
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:21,381
Why?

696
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,981
Going on a date with all of them...

697
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:25,250
- won't really...
- That's what you think?

698
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:27,081
(Hyun Jin said he wasn't curious about the others.)

699
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:29,521
I just...

700
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,861
I'm not sure if I should say this,

701
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:37,160
but I only had you and Da Hye in mind.

702
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:38,461
- Really?
- He was way too frank.

703
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:39,561
That's what I'm thinking.

704
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,771
He's already told her frankly.

705
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:46,741
What I felt about Su Jin was...

706
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,711
that she was very caring and considerate of others.

707
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:53,310
Because of those aspects,

708
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,681
I think my feelings for her...

709
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:58,210
grew a bit.

710
00:28:58,211 --> 00:28:59,551
(I think my feelings for her grew.)

711
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:02,950
Hyun Jin told me openly...

712
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,691
that he only had me and Da Hye in mind.

713
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:08,091
That made my heart flutter.

714
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,931
Thank you for being honest with me.

715
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,461
It must've been hard. I get where you're coming from.

716
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:14,900
That's why,

717
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,330
- I feel bad.
- to you, I... No.

718
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:18,001
- I said I was curious about others.
- That's why I told you this. No.

719
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:22,641
It doesn't matter. That's just how you feel.

720
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:26,080
(Su Jin and Hyun Jin's market date...)

721
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:28,640
(was full of heart-fluttering moments.)

722
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,080
I think she was touched by his honesty.

723
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:34,420
Yes. Su Jin was touched by how honest he was.

724
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:35,580
She's very innocent,

725
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:37,651
- so she was touched by it.
- Exactly.

726
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:41,921
(Meanwhile, what are Ji Eun and Jeong Geun doing?)

727
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:52,701
Yesterday...

728
00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:56,971
I didn't mean to look,

729
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:59,710
but when we were in the common area...

730
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,651
playing games at night,

731
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,781
I saw that you were on your phone.

732
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:07,781
(The night before)

733
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:09,451
(Glancing)

734
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:11,221
- She was keeping an eye on him.
- Exactly.

735
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,691
She was interested in him.

736
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:14,420
- She keeps glancing at him.
- She was watching him.

737
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:15,421
My gosh.

738
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:19,501
I wondered if you were working.

739
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:23,071
I need to go overseas soon.

740
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:27,300
(They were watching each other.)

741
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:28,440
It was...

742
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:30,040
(They were watching each other.)

743
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,911
- Here's your salmon salad.
- Thank you.

744
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,481
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

745
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:37,080
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

746
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:39,051
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

747
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:40,881
Let me get you some pasta.

748
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:44,121
- Here. Sure.
- Thank you.

749
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:47,460
Ji Eun is cute and affectionate.

750
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:48,520
- Yes.
- She is.

751
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:49,690
It's the way she speaks.

752
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:51,161
She's very affectionate.

753
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,771
- Is it good?
- Yes.

754
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:05,541
I have a feeling that you'll feel awkward...

755
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,611
when you meet people.

756
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:11,011
Let's say, for a blind date.

757
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:15,080
I don't like it when they approach me so much...

758
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,391
to the verge of feeling uncomfortable,

759
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:21,490
but I want them to at least make their feelings known...

760
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:23,791
- so that I can notice it.
- I see.

761
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,401
I'm a bit slow when it comes to people's feelings.

762
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:29,770
Those who want to approach you...

763
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:31,471
must really risk their chance.

764
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:35,100
They don't know what works and what doesn't.

765
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,211
So I feel a bit bad.

766
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,881
I feel bad for the other person.

767
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:41,681
Why?

768
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:43,651
Ji Eun is great at playing hard to get.

769
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:45,611
- She...
- She's so good at it.

770
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,820
She's saying,

771
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:50,451
"Even if I make things tough for you, you should come closer."

772
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,050
She's not playing hard to get.

773
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:53,891
- That's just her personality.
- She's no joke.

774
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:56,461
Jeong Geun is in for a hard time.

775
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:57,860
That's not going to happen.

776
00:31:57,861 --> 00:31:59,701
Jeong Geun is flustered.

777
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:02,871
I feel the same.

778
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:04,870
When I go out,

779
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm not really the one to start a conversation.

780
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,001
Yes.

781
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:12,171
I'm usually the listener.

782
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:16,751
You must be trying hard now.

783
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,950
I don't even try...

784
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:21,251
if I don't feel the need to.

785
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:28,660
He's saying he'll try to...

786
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:30,860
- keep up with Ji Eun's pace.
- Yes.

787
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,701
He's being considerate of her.

788
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:38,170
- I wouldn't know. I think...
- Yes.

789
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,601
Maybe, in your twenties?

790
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:42,370
Didn't you take only 1 or 2 pictures yesterday?

791
00:32:42,371 --> 00:32:43,511
- Yes.
- Before you ate.

792
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:47,141
(Staring)

793
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:50,911
What are you staring at?

794
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:53,251
Hello.

795
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:56,521
Here.

796
00:32:57,221 --> 00:32:58,251
Hi.

797
00:33:00,821 --> 00:33:02,661
You look like a cat.

798
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:04,031
That's a first.

799
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,990
What do people say you look like?

800
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:07,101
Like a puppy.

801
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:15,140
Based on this, I can't tell at all...

802
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:16,870
that Dong Ha was her first choice.

803
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,570
Exactly. They both look like...

804
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:19,980
they're fond of each other.

805
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:21,880
(Did Ji Eun have a change of heart?)

806
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:22,911
Tomorrow...

807
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:25,850
Can you really wake up for a morning walk tomorrow?

808
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:27,081
I can.

809
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:29,690
Tell me in advance if you're too tired.

810
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:30,751
Okay.

811
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:33,860
Don't stand me up.

812
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:34,991
I can go on a walk.

813
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:39,401
They even promised to go on a walk together.

814
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,731
I wonder what Sin Young is eating.

815
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,140
Geon Wu was seasick.

816
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:48,640
What can she eat when he is seasick?

817
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,170
- Seasickness medicine.
- Porridge.

818
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:51,210
- Porridge.
- You'll get to see soon.

819
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:52,880
- Plain porridge.
- Did she really have porridge?

820
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,110
(My friend, are you all right now?)

821
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:55,381
- Plain porridge.
- Oh, dear.

822
00:33:55,811 --> 00:33:58,750
(Sin Young and Geon Wu have recovered from the seasickness.)

823
00:33:58,751 --> 00:33:59,881
It's so good.

824
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,091
It's so nice.

825
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:07,291
I'm a bit hungry.

826
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:11,591
It's a bit hard to eat this here.

827
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:13,161
Should I...

828
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:14,431
cut an apple for you?

829
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,401
- Are you serious?
- This one's big.

830
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:29,381
- Hold on.
- Geon Wu, you should do it.

831
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,310
What are you going to do?

832
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:32,411
(Her unstable knife work makes Geon Wu raise his hand.)

833
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,251
Should I turn it?

834
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:38,690
Be careful.

835
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:40,191
- Don't worry, Geon Wu.
- Okay.

836
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,621
Don't be anxious.

837
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:47,730
Pass it to me, dear.

838
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:48,760
- "Dear?" - "Dear?"

839
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:49,830
- Gosh.
- "Dear?"

840
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,171
- "Dear?" - "Dear?"

841
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:52,530
- "Dear?" - Does he...

842
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:53,840
- sometimes call you...
- Exactly.

843
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,470
- "dear?" - Does he use it often?

844
00:34:55,471 --> 00:34:57,311
He doesn't call me "dear."

845
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,070
Why did he say it, then?

846
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:00,940
I understand if he called another guy that.

847
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,640
Yes, but you don't normally say that to someone of the opposite sex.

848
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:03,850
- You're right.
- "Dear."

849
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,750
- Maybe he was too focused.
- "Pass it to me, dear..."

850
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,981
is quite surprising to hear.

851
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:11,390
I can't defend him for that.

852
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:12,450
You can't?

853
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:13,761
(Even Gwan Hee can't defend him.)

854
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:15,661
Pass it to me, dear.

855
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:20,631
Why can't she hear... What is she even doing?

856
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,300
What is she doing?

857
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:26,301
She is determined to feed him.

858
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,910
(Unaware of what her friend is thinking, )

859
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:34,741
(Sin Young is wrestling with the apple.)

860
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:36,480
I'll do it.

861
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:39,521
I think I've done it once when I was young.

862
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:44,321
(Geon Wu takes over smoothly.)

863
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:54,461
- You make it look so easy.
- Sin Young.

864
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,430
You made it look nice and sharp.

865
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,971
- This shape?
- Yes, that angle.

866
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:02,000
- The V-shape.
- It's nice.

867
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,210
He's so sweet.

868
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:04,211
(They are all smiling now.)

869
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:05,611
- Shall we toast?
- Enjoy the fruit.

870
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,240
Enjoy.

871
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:08,681
(They are all smiling now.)

872
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:12,781
It's sweet.

873
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,581
Apparently, peanut butter tastes good with apple.

874
00:36:16,181 --> 00:36:17,221
Should I go buy one?

875
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:19,191
- Can you go now?
- Should I?

876
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:20,890
Will you swim to a market?

877
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:22,861
It takes me about 30 minutes to swim there.

878
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,730
Go and get some peanut butter from Udo.

879
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:26,500
- He's opened up to her.
- He looks fine now.

880
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:27,701
He's making jokes now.

881
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:29,401
He's feeling comfortable.

882
00:36:31,601 --> 00:36:34,001
I'm normally very shy.

883
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,571
So I was quite worried.

884
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:41,741
Since there were just two of us, I could talk more comfortably.

885
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,810
We got to know each other more...

886
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:45,851
and got closer.

887
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:50,590
(Sin Young and Geon Wu got closer on the yacht date.)

888
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:52,190
- Thank you.
- Bye.

889
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:54,891
(Sin Young and Geon Wu got closer on the yacht date.)

890
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:56,691
- That was fun.
- I had a great time.

891
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:59,761
You took such nice pictures of me.

892
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:02,530
I'm sorry that only I got to have nice pictures taken.

893
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:03,531
Don't worry about it.

894
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:07,301
(Did they have a change of heart?)

895
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:10,770
I think they got closer.

896
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,181
- I can see that.
- They're comfortable now.

897
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:14,510
- That's rather touching.
- Yes.

898
00:37:14,511 --> 00:37:15,511
They've become comfortable with each other.

899
00:37:15,512 --> 00:37:17,750
- The atmosphere has changed.
- Who do you think they'll choose?

900
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:18,980
They need to make a choice...

901
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:20,481
after the first date.

902
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:24,151
I think Sin Young will definitely choose Geon Wu.

903
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:26,151
But I have a feeling...

904
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:29,160
that Geon Wu won't choose Sin Young.

905
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:30,360
What do you know?

906
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:31,791
(Who are you to say that, Gwan Hee?)

907
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:33,000
What do you know?

908
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,031
I think he'll choose her today.

909
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:37,930
(Everyone has come back to the Lovebud House.)

910
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,470
- They're all back.
- They're back.

911
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:40,641
- They've gathered.
- This is crazy.

912
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:42,271
- What did you do?
- We got here 30 minutes ago.

913
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,040
We had the fanciest date ever.

914
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,281
(Our date was the fanciest date ever.)

915
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:49,511
- Really?
- Hey.

916
00:37:49,911 --> 00:37:51,610
- The sea...
- You're right.

917
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:53,450
- Did you go on a cruise?
- "Your own space?"

918
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:54,681
We went on a yacht.

919
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,951
Really? You went on a yacht?

920
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,820
See? Ours was...

921
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,161
- the fanciest.
- I took the best photos for her.

922
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,330
I really should pay him for the photos he took.

923
00:38:07,331 --> 00:38:08,430
That good?

924
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:10,601
But while taking photos for her, I got seasick.

925
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,241
He got seasick.

926
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:14,570
It's a pity he got seasick.

927
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:15,801
(That darn seasickness)

928
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:17,441
It was like...

929
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,940
- It shook like this.
- If I don't hold the rail,

930
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:23,550
- I...
- I was this close to falling.

931
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,750
My legs can't stand straight.

932
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:27,180
It's so funny.

933
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,250
- We did go on a boat too.
- We got on a boat.

934
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,351
- We...
- Was it a fishing boat?

935
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:34,061
- One of those small boats?
- I had to pedal to make it move.

936
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:36,090
- A pedalo?
- A kayak.

937
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:37,631
- A kayak.
- I see.

938
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,331
The kayak was nice too.

939
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:42,361
- It was a nice date.
- It was nice.

940
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:49,301
If that's the case, Dong Ha had it so hard.

941
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:52,640
We had so much fun too.

942
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:54,580
Would you look at the angle of the photo Da Hye took?

943
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,110
They're showing off their dates.

944
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:57,111
They're showing off.

945
00:38:57,112 --> 00:38:58,151
You guys look...

946
00:38:58,681 --> 00:38:59,980
We got on a boat like this.

947
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:01,050
It's so nice.

948
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:02,380
- It was nice.
- What a great view.

949
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,721
- The kayak...
- This was fun too.

950
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,490
This was pretty cool too.

951
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:08,661
(They show off their dates like real couples.)

952
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:10,390
(He looks like he's concerned about Dong Ha and Da Hye playing around.)

953
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,661
- Geon Wu. Look at his eyes.
- My gosh.

954
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,831
And Sin Young is looking at him.

955
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,001
It was so funny. It was nice.

956
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,110
It bothered me somewhat,

957
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,771
but I knew I would have the opportunity soon.

958
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:31,811
Okay. Let's talk later.

959
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,320
- It could bother him.
- He was bothered by them.

960
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:36,791
- It could.
- Yes.

961
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:39,890
Right. Geon Wu chose Da Hye last night.

962
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:41,720
Yes. You must understand.

963
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:43,591
I mean,

964
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:44,990
- they went on a date, - That's right.

965
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,060
But someone you were fond of...

966
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:47,930
went on a date, and that would bother you.

967
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,460
- Especially if she had so much fun.
- Yes.

968
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:50,500
I agree.

969
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,830
Geon Wu's eyes became feral.

970
00:39:52,831 --> 00:39:53,940
He had the eyes of a rabbit before.

971
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,201
I've never seen that side of him.

972
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:01,540
- Hi.
- You're back.

973
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,310
Yes. How did it go?

974
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:04,780
It was good. Where did you go?

975
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,721
We went to a market.

976
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:07,781
A market?

977
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:10,451
- What about you?
- We got on a boat too.

978
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:13,091
Did you have a nice conversation with Da Hye?

979
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:14,191
Yes.

980
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,730
We kept guessing...

981
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:20,301
- Really?
- each other's job.

982
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:23,771
What about you with Su Jin?

983
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,171
I had a good talk with Su Jin.

984
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:30,071
I tried my best to talk with her a lot.

985
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:33,341
We also talked about how we felt about each other.

986
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,141
How I thought about her...

987
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:39,250
and how she thought about me.

988
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:42,280
You guys had a deep and serious talk.

989
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:43,451
We tried to.

990
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:46,151
I should talk more about that with her.

991
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,831
I'm sure you'll get the chance.

992
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:52,861
It was just the first date.

993
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:56,061
And...

994
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:58,830
Dong Ha is more curious about their date.

995
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,700
At first, he was quite interested in...

996
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:01,970
- Su Jin in the car.
- Yes.

997
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:03,471
- The Eiffel Tower.
- The Eiffel Tower.

998
00:41:03,871 --> 00:41:05,910
- I think...
- Yes.

999
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:08,610
The bond they formed from the Eiffel Tower...

1000
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:10,310
- is still there.
- Yes, the Eiffel Tower.

1001
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:11,550
- The Eiffel Tower.
- The Eiffel Tower.

1002
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:13,651
- He might believe in fate.
- I think so.

1003
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,690
(Meanwhile, at the women's dorm)

1004
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:19,221
(Ji Eun, Sin Young, and Su Jin are taking a break.)

1005
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:21,891
Shall I tell you something amazing?

1006
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:25,591
What is it?

1007
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:28,761
We even sang to each other in a game room.

1008
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:34,641
Su Jin must've really liked it.

1009
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:38,871
(They sang a duet and had a fun date.)

1010
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:43,140
You genuinely had a date.

1011
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:46,210
- We did everything. The game...
- You dated like a real couple.

1012
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,081
- We played a shooting game.
- That sounds fun.

1013
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:51,221
You guys feel like you're already...

1014
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:53,491
Did you guys feel something on your date?

1015
00:41:53,621 --> 00:41:55,521
- I did.
- Really?

1016
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,431
She did.

1017
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:01,361
He is very considerate.

1018
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:04,771
He kept acting like a bodyguard when we walked by the roadside.

1019
00:42:04,931 --> 00:42:06,941
- That much?
- He is attentive.

1020
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,771
He opened the door for me.

1021
00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:12,711
I want to know him more. I really do.

1022
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:15,711
I'm the type that needs more time spent together to make up my mind.

1023
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:17,651
You're approaching him very seriously.

1024
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:19,781
I am very serious when I approach someone.

1025
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:23,751
He grew on me more than yesterday.

1026
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:27,121
We both said so.

1027
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:29,990
- Thank you so much, Su Jin.
- Gosh.

1028
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:31,390
(It's an honour!)

1029
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:33,661
Didn't she basically choose him already?

1030
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:36,000
- Congratulations.
- They can go home now.

1031
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:37,500
Please take good care of him.

1032
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,270
- It's so nice.
- Please.

1033
00:42:39,271 --> 00:42:40,800
- He had a good first impression.
- I really hope they work out.

1034
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:42,371
- I'm rooting for them.
- Me too.

1035
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,770
It was fun,

1036
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:45,340
but I'm worried he didn't appeal as a man.

1037
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:47,240
- He did.
- She sees him as a man.

1038
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,910
She even expressed her feelings to Hyun Jin.

1039
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:50,780
Does that level of interest really mean she's interested in him?

1040
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:52,110
- Yes.
- She is.

1041
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,350
Like how she brought up that he was like a bodyguard.

1042
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:54,480
- She's subtly bragging about him.
- Yes.

1043
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:56,320
Totally.

1044
00:42:56,321 --> 00:42:57,390
That's right.

1045
00:42:57,391 --> 00:42:59,791
(I'm so happy.)

1046
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:04,891
Let's cook dinner ourselves.

1047
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:06,661
Let's see.

1048
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,631
Pasta. Meat.

1049
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:11,430
- Yes.
- Pork cutlet.

1050
00:43:11,431 --> 00:43:12,531
(The men are in charge of dinner today.)

1051
00:43:13,031 --> 00:43:14,501
I'll boil the pasta first.

1052
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:17,140
Pasta is a safe option.

1053
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:18,211
Are you good at making pasta?

1054
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:20,241
I've made it a few times.

1055
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,711
But I can't guarantee the taste.

1056
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:31,021
I can cook a handful of dishes.

1057
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:33,421
It'll be nice to do the best I can...

1058
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:36,961
for the person I'm fond of.

1059
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:40,160
Doing that, I'm hoping Ji Eun...

1060
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:44,731
will be reminded of me when she sees this dish.

1061
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:46,801
- Jeong Geun!
- Look at him!

1062
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,170
It's nice that the sun has set.

1063
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,441
(The women have come to join the common area.)

1064
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:55,040
It has the taste of Chinese cuisine.

1065
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,910
- Like dim sum?
- Right.

1066
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:58,381
- You're back.
- Yes.

1067
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:00,580
But...

1068
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:01,680
Gosh.

1069
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,491
I shared my deduction as a detective.

1070
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:05,950
- Did they hear about it?
- Yes. I told them about it.

1071
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:06,960
- The rest of them...
- I see.

1072
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:08,960
She almost guessed my job.

1073
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:10,260
- Right. We talked about it.
- Did I get it right?

1074
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:11,530
You just said I guessed it.

1075
00:44:11,531 --> 00:44:12,590
- She almost got it.
- She must be right.

1076
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:13,931
(Da Hye approaches Dong Ha a lot more after the date.)

1077
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:15,901
She played Detective Conan.

1078
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:20,501
(Looking intently)

1079
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:22,100
- He's bothered.
- He is.

1080
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:23,300
Look at the way he's looking at her.

1081
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:25,941
(Geon Wu feels bothered by how Da Hye is acting.)

1082
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:31,850
- What are you up to?
- I'm making the pork cutlet.

1083
00:44:31,851 --> 00:44:33,111
That's nice. Okay.

1084
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:39,621
(Geon Wu is working on the frozen pork cutlet.)

1085
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:43,431
It looks delicious.

1086
00:44:43,491 --> 00:44:44,761
It's making my mouth water.

1087
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,131
Let's go.

1088
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:49,000
We'll be back.

1089
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:50,001
(After a bit of food flirting, the women head back.)

1090
00:44:52,371 --> 00:44:56,271
(He turns on the ventilator after bringing up Da Hye's expectations.)

1091
00:44:56,671 --> 00:45:01,241
(He turns up the heat...)

1092
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:05,711
(and adds a lot of Da Hye's favourite pork cutlet.)

1093
00:45:09,821 --> 00:45:14,761
(He's only focused on the pork cutlet.)

1094
00:45:23,531 --> 00:45:24,631
What is that?

1095
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:31,971
(He takes a bite out of anxiety.)

1096
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:38,081
I hope it tastes good. It has to.

1097
00:45:38,351 --> 00:45:40,851
It already looks good with your skilful hands.

1098
00:45:40,881 --> 00:45:43,021
(Impressed)

1099
00:45:44,891 --> 00:45:46,090
There was magic being performed here.

1100
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:47,191
I know, right?

1101
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,761
This isn't burnt.

1102
00:45:51,591 --> 00:45:54,860
It was too frozen to be cooked in oil,

1103
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:56,831
so the surface burned right away.

1104
00:45:57,801 --> 00:45:58,831
Do you want to try one?

1105
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:00,900
If I eat it now,

1106
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:02,701
I think the roof of my mouth won't survive.

1107
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,071
It was better than I thought when I just tried one.

1108
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:08,841
Pass it to me. I'll try to work on it.

1109
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:10,381
Keep stirring it.

1110
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,850
It really burns up right away.

1111
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:14,880
Really?

1112
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:16,281
(Feeling embarrassed)

1113
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,421
(The pork cutlet gets grilled once again slowly.)

1114
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:23,991
(Scraping)

1115
00:46:30,431 --> 00:46:32,271
Gosh, I smell something savoury.

1116
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:36,501
What happened?

1117
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:38,340
The temperature of the oil was too high.

1118
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:39,511
- Really?
- Come when we're done.

1119
00:46:39,641 --> 00:46:40,810
Come when we're done with everything.

1120
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:42,341
Is that so?

1121
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,950
The dumplings. Should we quickly try one each?

1122
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:46,110
The dumplings look really good.

1123
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:47,981
- They look delicious.
- They look delicious.

1124
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:49,651
It's hot!

1125
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:50,821
Can you take a bite?

1126
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:51,991
It's hot!

1127
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:54,320
(Going wild)

1128
00:46:54,321 --> 00:46:56,221
You still want me to try one after seeing that?

1129
00:46:57,131 --> 00:46:58,790
- I said it was hot.
- No. It's fine.

1130
00:46:58,791 --> 00:46:59,891
- Really?
- Yes.

1131
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:01,001
I'll give it a try.

1132
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,560
It's hot. Blow on it.

1133
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:04,100
Blow on it at least five times.

1134
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:06,071
It's fine. You can eat it. It's not like you'll die from it.

1135
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:09,801
Would you like another one? Will you be okay?

1136
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:11,341
Yes.

1137
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:14,481
Where is Hyun Jin?

1138
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:15,611
He's setting the table.

1139
00:47:16,841 --> 00:47:19,311
I should serve it to him as everyone had one.

1140
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:20,751
Oh, you're here. Nice timing.

1141
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:22,221
- It's hot.
- Isn't it hot?

1142
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:24,950
- My gosh!
- Gosh!

1143
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:29,061
(She hurries out without any shoes to take care of Hyun Jin.)

1144
00:47:30,691 --> 00:47:32,331
- That might not work.
- Okay.

1145
00:47:32,991 --> 00:47:34,301
I'll grill it in the frying pan.

1146
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:42,441
(Meanwhile, Jeong Geun's pasta is finished in no time.)

1147
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,111
Should we have dinner outside today?

1148
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:46,770
- Outside? Where?
- Yes.

1149
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:47,840
- Right out here.
- Right out here?

1150
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:48,841
The table out there?

1151
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:50,380
- That sounds good.
- That sounds very good.

1152
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:51,981
Gosh, the food must taste delicious outside.

1153
00:47:52,881 --> 00:47:53,981
The giant pasta is here.

1154
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:56,350
Allow me to put what I made where the main dish belongs.

1155
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:58,551
- Sure.
- Of course. This is the main dish.

1156
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:00,491
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1157
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,620
Gosh, it looks so pretty with the dumplings.

1158
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:04,560
- I know, right?
- I'm actually proud of this.

1159
00:48:04,561 --> 00:48:07,401
(They are ready for dinner.)

1160
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:13,201
Can we sit now? Is everything set up?

1161
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:15,071
Where's Ji Eun?

1162
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,241
- She disappeared.
- She disappeared.

1163
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:18,211
Let's all take a seat.

1164
00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:19,811
- What about Ji Eun?
- We should eat together.

1165
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:24,150
(Jeong Geun and Dong Ha wait for Ji Eun without taking a seat.)

1166
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,480
This is bad.

1167
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:27,351
(Jeong Geun and Dong Ha wait for Ji Eun without taking a seat.)

1168
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,791
I wasn't able to talk with Ji Eun,

1169
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:32,351
so I was bothered about it.

1170
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:41,731
Ji Eun.

1171
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:45,071
Ji Eun?

1172
00:48:45,471 --> 00:48:46,971
That happens when you like someone.

1173
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,171
He's fallen for her.

1174
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:51,370
We don't know when Ji Eun will be back.

1175
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:53,271
- What should we do?
- Right. What should we do?

1176
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:55,941
- I'll serve you the pasta first.
- Thanks for cooking for us.

1177
00:48:55,981 --> 00:48:57,450
- I think the pasta will get soggy.
- Right.

1178
00:48:57,451 --> 00:48:59,110
- We should eat.
- We can use this.

1179
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:00,180
- Go ahead.
- Well...

1180
00:49:00,181 --> 00:49:02,281
We would wait if she told us she would be back in five minutes.

1181
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:04,890
This is nice as we don't know each other's ages.

1182
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:06,691
It's first-come, first-served. Right?

1183
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:09,221
- Right.
- Right.

1184
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:11,460
- You can have wine or beer.
- Cheers?

1185
00:49:11,461 --> 00:49:12,991
- I think a can for me will be good.
- Thank you.

1186
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:15,330
- Thank you for the food.
- Let's eat.

1187
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:16,430
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for cooking for us.

1188
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:18,231
Thank you for cooking for us.

1189
00:49:19,471 --> 00:49:20,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you for cooking for us.

1190
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:21,870
(Slurping)

1191
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:22,871
Thank you for the food.

1192
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,111
I was curious about the wine...

1193
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:26,470
as I was told that it suited well with the cream pasta.

1194
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:27,480
I think they will work great together.

1195
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:28,640
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

1196
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:29,740
- Geon Wu. Eat lots...
- It's so good.

1197
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:30,851
- since you had a small lunch.
- It's so good.

1198
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:32,211
It's really good.

1199
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,121
- It's good.
- So good.

1200
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:36,481
It's good.

1201
00:49:36,621 --> 00:49:37,820
First of all,

1202
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:40,391
I'm happy that I am acknowledged by Taste Da Hye.

1203
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,560
Taste Da Hye.

1204
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:43,661
Taste Da Hye likes it.

1205
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,231
- "Taste Da Hye?" - "Taste Da Hye."

1206
00:49:46,591 --> 00:49:47,861
"Taste Da Hye likes it."

1207
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:52,000
(Ji Eun comes down at that moment.)

1208
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:53,501
She's here. Hurry up and come on over.

1209
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:54,941
Hurry over, Ji Eun.

1210
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:57,441
Ji Eun!

1211
00:49:57,511 --> 00:49:58,540
You're hungry, aren't you?

1212
00:49:58,541 --> 00:49:59,671
You went through a lot.

1213
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:00,810
Wait right there.

1214
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:03,511
(Jeong Geun gets up right away as soon as Ji Eun comes.)

1215
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:08,180
(Jeong Geon gets slippers for Ji Eun in a flash.)

1216
00:50:08,181 --> 00:50:09,451
Thank you.

1217
00:50:10,021 --> 00:50:12,551
You need to try the pasta I made. Come on.

1218
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:14,490
- How good could it be?
- That's nice.

1219
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:15,660
It's a bit...

1220
00:50:15,661 --> 00:50:16,920
Don't worry. It's still pretty good.

1221
00:50:16,921 --> 00:50:19,391
He wants you to rate it.

1222
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:21,600
Compare the pasta we had earlier today...

1223
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,761
and what I made.

1224
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:25,800
- But...
- It's been out for a while.

1225
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:27,000
You came too late.

1226
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:30,641
(Jeong Geun looks a lot more excited.)

1227
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:34,241
Which tastes better?

1228
00:50:40,481 --> 00:50:41,551
I can't see it.

1229
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:42,651
You can't see it?

1230
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:43,951
Have you seen me pour it...

1231
00:50:43,952 --> 00:50:46,021
Is it better than what we had earlier?

1232
00:50:46,051 --> 00:50:47,461
It's a different taste, but it's good.

1233
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:49,991
- Then I'm satisfied.
- Right. It's good.

1234
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:53,661
The ready-made sauce was barely used.

1235
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:55,930
- It was made with fresh cream.
- Fresh cream? I see.

1236
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:57,870
He made the sauce himself with fresh cream.

1237
00:50:57,871 --> 00:50:58,871
That's amazing.

1238
00:50:58,872 --> 00:50:59,931
It's really good.

1239
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:01,371
The seasoning too.

1240
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:02,700
It was perfectly seasoned.

1241
00:51:02,701 --> 00:51:03,871
The bacon is good.

1242
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,610
I'll go and spend some time thinking in my room.

1243
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:08,711
Just kidding.

1244
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:11,351
Gosh, my back hurts.

1245
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,180
Su...

1246
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:15,420
- Su Jin, - You must've kicked really hard.

1247
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:16,751
I must've kicked the ball too hard.

1248
00:51:18,721 --> 00:51:20,461
Why do my spinal erectors hurt so much?

1249
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:22,091
Gosh.

1250
00:51:22,391 --> 00:51:24,161
- My Lovebud will be satisfied...
- Gosh.

1251
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:25,991
After seeing you kick the ball.

1252
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:27,500
Why?

1253
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,001
(Sighing)

1254
00:51:29,161 --> 00:51:30,800
Hurry up and show me the picture you took of me.

1255
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:33,940
It was my first time seeing a photo taken from that angle.

1256
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:35,601
It was taken from my foot.

1257
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:37,311
Isn't that the Gen MZ shot?

1258
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:38,841
I took this one.

1259
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:41,440
- I took it like this.
- That's amazing.

1260
00:51:41,441 --> 00:51:42,980
- So that's how it works.
- Right.

1261
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:44,050
That's amazing.

1262
00:51:44,051 --> 00:51:45,911
(Kayak date, Dong Ha and Da Hye)

1263
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:51,351
He looks like the CEO of a kayak business.

1264
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:52,921
"Come and enjoy the kayaks."

1265
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:54,360
You're almost lying down to paddle it.

1266
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,391
- Yes.
- I see.

1267
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:58,561
Ji Eun is loving it.

1268
00:51:58,691 --> 00:51:59,790
Show Ji Eun one more time.

1269
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,100
- She loves it so much.
- That foot.

1270
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:02,761
That foot is the highlight.

1271
00:52:03,331 --> 00:52:05,270
- Right.
- That foot is the highlight.

1272
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:07,440
- It was taken well.
- Right. It was taken well.

1273
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:08,641
The view is great.

1274
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:12,311
This is the one that Dong Ha took.

1275
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:14,380
- It's beautiful.
- Right.

1276
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,880
And Da Hye's red dress was a great choice today.

1277
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:18,881
Gosh.

1278
00:52:18,882 --> 00:52:20,980
- The weather is amazing, isn't it?
- It really is.

1279
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:22,851
- It was refreshing.
- It was nice.

1280
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:24,151
- It looks refreshing.
- It was so funny.

1281
00:52:26,591 --> 00:52:28,790
We didn't take any photos with our phones.

1282
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,631
Right. We used a digital camera that was in the bar.

1283
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:32,591
Gosh, that's nice.

1284
00:52:33,131 --> 00:52:35,060
The owner gave us the film.

1285
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:36,230
We used that to take pictures.

1286
00:52:36,231 --> 00:52:37,401
- They gave you the camera?
- Yes.

1287
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,301
I think our date was different compared to the others.

1288
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:43,671
I do think that ours might've been too quiet.

1289
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:45,971
Right. But we still had fun in the midst of that.

1290
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:47,681
We did talk a lot with each other.

1291
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,611
I thought that I should stay calm.

1292
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:55,951
Nothing was for sure yet.

1293
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:57,651
We still don't know who will end up together.

1294
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:05,761
Jeong Geun really made it obvious about his feelings.

1295
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:09,000
It felt like he was making it obvious on purpose.

1296
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:10,131
It did bother me...

1297
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:11,901
that he was being like that right in front of me.

1298
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:20,710
(Tension fills the Lovebud House.)

1299
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:21,780
Cheers!

1300
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,380
- Cheers!
- Let's eat.

1301
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:25,311
- Great work.
- Great work.

1302
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:28,551
(The time for selections has come.)

1303
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:32,491
It's the night. Many things happen at night.

1304
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:34,121
- Gosh.
- It's the Heart Room.

1305
00:53:36,821 --> 00:53:40,190
(The first visitor of the Heart Room)

1306
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:41,701
(Jeong Geun)

1307
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:49,801
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1308
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,141
Stop acting like you need to think about it, Jeong Geun.

1309
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,381
Let's do it.

1310
00:53:56,511 --> 00:53:59,211
(He chooses without hesitation.)

1311
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,851
I...

1312
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:06,151
choose the same as yesterday.

1313
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:09,961
I choose Choi Ji Eun.

1314
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:13,631
As I spent more time with her,

1315
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:15,531
I thought that...

1316
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,730
she was someone that suited me well...

1317
00:54:18,731 --> 00:54:22,541
with her personality and thoughts.

1318
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:27,610
As I had a great time with her,

1319
00:54:27,611 --> 00:54:29,440
I chose Ji Eun.

1320
00:54:29,441 --> 00:54:31,051
(He chose Ji Eun for two days, and his feelings have grown.)

1321
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:39,990
I'm curious about him.

1322
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:41,361
(Dong Ha was 1st place in the first impression voting results.)

1323
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:44,830
This is after his date with Da Hye.

1324
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:47,261
(Who is the one who has knocked on Dong Ha's heart?)

1325
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:53,831
(It's Ji Eun instead of Da Hye, with whom he went on a date.)

1326
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:54,901
Choi Ji Eun.

1327
00:54:56,841 --> 00:55:00,711
My first date was with Da Hye.

1328
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:05,650
(He hesitates to speak.)

1329
00:55:05,651 --> 00:55:06,711
It was...

1330
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:15,660
really nice, but I felt more comfortable than excited.

1331
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:18,291
It was from feeling the spark.

1332
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,901
That was the date.

1333
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:24,901
She felt more like a friend...

1334
00:55:25,331 --> 00:55:28,041
that I could relate to.

1335
00:55:29,601 --> 00:55:31,271
As for now,

1336
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,011
I think I still want to...

1337
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:39,310
get to know Ji Eun more.

1338
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:41,451
Gosh, this isn't easy. We're in trouble now.

1339
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:44,420
- It's okay.
- In Dong Ha's situation,

1340
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:45,820
he never had the chance to have a long conversation...

1341
00:55:45,821 --> 00:55:47,250
- with Ji Eun, whom he picked.
- Right.

1342
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:49,190
- He can be curious about her.
- He never went on a date with her.

1343
00:55:49,191 --> 00:55:50,191
(Gosh)

1344
00:55:50,192 --> 00:55:51,331
Since he hasn't gotten to know her yet.

1345
00:55:52,931 --> 00:55:55,501
(Ji Eun's door is open.)

1346
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:59,301
- What?
- What's wrong?

1347
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:01,171
- What is that?
- What is that?

1348
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:05,071
(An unknown note is found.)

1349
00:56:05,211 --> 00:56:06,411
Gosh.

1350
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,981
It made me think a lot.

1351
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:10,950
What's going on?

1352
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,081
I've never seen him look so flustered.

1353
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,881
(Jeong Geun, who first chose Ji Eun in the Heart Room)

1354
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:18,051
What are they looking at?

1355
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:23,021
(Jeong Geun was surprised as well.)

1356
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:26,960
(Choi Ji Eun is 28. She is a producer.)

1357
00:56:26,961 --> 00:56:28,400
(You can check the age and occupation of the person you chose.)

1358
00:56:28,401 --> 00:56:29,401
Really?

1359
00:56:29,661 --> 00:56:31,670
- She's a producer?
- Yes.

1360
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:33,430
Was that why she was interested in cameras?

1361
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:34,440
That's amazing.

1362
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:35,970
- That was totally unexpected.
- Right.

1363
00:56:35,971 --> 00:56:37,300
Right. It never even crossed my mind.

1364
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:40,541
She's a producer in the planning division of my agency.

1365
00:56:40,641 --> 00:56:42,580
- Really? She's in charge...
- Yes.

1366
00:56:42,581 --> 00:56:45,880
Of filming things like promotion videos...

1367
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:47,881
- of the actors in our agency.
- Gosh. I see.

1368
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:49,281
- I see.
- Right.

1369
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:53,291
I got to find out some information...

1370
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:56,061
on Ji Eun.

1371
00:56:57,531 --> 00:57:00,391
I want to learn about her...

1372
00:57:01,861 --> 00:57:03,401
without any filters.

1373
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:06,931
I want to learn about her personality or emotions...

1374
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:08,801
in more detail.

1375
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:15,411
I didn't expect her to be a producer.

1376
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:17,040
I didn't expect that.

1377
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:19,351
I thought she was a model...

1378
00:57:19,611 --> 00:57:21,351
or an actress.

1379
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:24,221
So her being a producer...

1380
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:29,261
was very fascinating.

1381
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:31,891
There is...

1382
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:34,530
an age gap between her and me.

1383
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:36,900
- Why? Is Dong Ha much older?
- There must be an age gap.

1384
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:38,201
Gosh.

1385
00:57:40,071 --> 00:57:41,471
Things got complicated for me.

1386
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:45,411
- There must be quite an age gap.
- There must be quite an age gap.

1387
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,071
- Is he 12 years older?
- He doesn't look so.

1388
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,181
I'm sorry, but how can you say that?

1389
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:53,211
- Well...
- Maybe around ten years apart?

1390
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:58,751
(Dong Ha's date, Da Hye)

1391
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:02,221
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1392
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,291
(Will she choose Dong Ha, who was her first date?)

1393
00:58:05,292 --> 00:58:07,491
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1394
00:58:10,401 --> 00:58:12,901
Unexpectedly, when I went into the Heart Room,

1395
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:16,371
I didn't have a clear answer.

1396
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:18,611
Because...

1397
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:20,840
there was someone I was definitely curious about,

1398
00:58:20,841 --> 00:58:23,081
so I thought that I would pick that person.

1399
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,110
But once I entered the room,

1400
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:27,410
I was reminded of the moments...

1401
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:31,051
I felt the most comfortable.

1402
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:32,891
It was hard...

1403
00:58:33,691 --> 00:58:35,061
to make a decision.

1404
00:58:35,521 --> 00:58:38,831
Right. She's interested in Jeong Geun as well.

1405
00:58:39,831 --> 00:58:41,900
Dong Ha thought of her as a friend.

1406
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:43,431
Don't pick him, Da Hye.

1407
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:46,500
- I have to take a photo of this.
- This?

1408
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:48,001
- Take it for me.
- Your backside looks...

1409
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,101
so funny.

1410
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,580
It's Dong Ha based on how things went.

1411
00:58:56,581 --> 00:58:58,611
Gosh, this is hard.

1412
00:58:59,151 --> 00:59:02,521
(A strong first impression)

1413
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:05,391
Aren't you having too much bread?

1414
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:09,721
(They even shared special moments of their own.)

1415
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:12,360
Who could it be?

1416
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:14,160
I think it'll be Jeong Geun.

1417
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:15,560
- I think so too.
- Right?

1418
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:16,830
- Yes.
- It's Dong Ha.

1419
00:59:16,831 --> 00:59:19,200
(Who will Da Hye choose?)

1420
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:21,441
(Shin Dong Ha, Ha Jeong Geun)

1421
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:24,271
The one who presented a happy moment...

1422
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:26,911
to me was...

1423
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,650
(Da Hye chooses Dong Ha.)

1424
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:34,681
Dong Ha.

1425
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:36,980
- That line breaks my heart.
- It's Dong Ha.

1426
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:38,891
"The one who presented a happy moment to me."

1427
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:41,121
He said you were like a friend!

1428
00:59:42,521 --> 00:59:46,391
The way he made me feel really comfortable...

1429
00:59:46,661 --> 00:59:48,901
was what made my heart flutter.

1430
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:54,100
- I... Don't do it.
- What?

1431
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:58,741
(The date with Dong Ha was comfortable.)

1432
00:59:59,011 --> 01:00:00,470
- The genre is changing.
- I always wanted to try this.

1433
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,211
I've never played around like this.

1434
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:05,050
After enjoying a comfortable date,

1435
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:09,081
I felt like this was what I'd been looking for.

1436
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:12,991
- I will choose now.
- Dong Ha's job will be revealed.

1437
01:00:13,221 --> 01:00:14,291
And his age.

1438
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,301
I was so wrong.

1439
01:00:33,311 --> 01:00:34,311
Okay.

1440
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,641
(Dong Ha's job that Da Hye had predicted)

1441
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:40,910
I think you're an engineer or a producer.

1442
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:42,151
I've narrowed it down.

1443
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:45,051
But I'm certain you work in the music industry.

1444
01:00:45,191 --> 01:00:47,621
(She predicted that he would have a job related to music.)

1445
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:50,921
(And...)

1446
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:53,190
I think I almost got Dong Ha's job.

1447
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,331
Be quiet.

1448
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:57,130
I think he might be Young Ji's manager...

1449
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:59,200
or someone who works with Young Ji.

1450
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:00,670
- Like her manager?
- Right?

1451
01:01:00,671 --> 01:01:03,371
(Detective Da Hye was certain about Dong Ha's job.)

1452
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:04,671
And...

1453
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:07,611
I was so wrong.

1454
01:01:10,141 --> 01:01:12,051
What now? I feel so embarrassed.

1455
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:18,820
(She can't pull herself together.)

1456
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:19,851
Is this true?

1457
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:24,321
Sorry, Young Ji.

1458
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:26,731
Gosh. What now? This is so embarrassing.

1459
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:29,130
- Why? Is he a chef?
- What? Why is she sorry?

1460
01:01:29,131 --> 01:01:30,231
Why?

1461
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:34,741
(Shin Dong Ha is 37. He is a doctor.)

1462
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,881
I'm a doctor with 18 years of experience.

1463
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:49,080
I started as a general practitioner,

1464
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:50,851
and I am currently a dermatologist.

1465
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:54,321
As a director of the hospital,

1466
01:01:54,421 --> 01:01:56,591
I oversee everything, including consulting clients...

1467
01:01:57,831 --> 01:01:59,831
and performing procedures.

1468
01:02:02,731 --> 01:02:06,971
(Shin Dong Ha, 37, a doctor with 13 years of experience)

1469
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:08,700
- I see.
- He's a doctor.

1470
01:02:08,701 --> 01:02:10,570
- Why? He looks like a doctor.
- Being a doctor suits him.

1471
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:12,211
- It fits him.
- His looks fit his occupation.

1472
01:02:12,371 --> 01:02:14,170
Actually, Dong Ha...

1473
01:02:14,171 --> 01:02:15,480
is a director of a dermatology clinic.

1474
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,380
- Really?
- I love it.

1475
01:02:17,381 --> 01:02:19,681
- That's why he has fair skin.
- That's lovely.

1476
01:02:19,851 --> 01:02:22,680
We have a group chat with me, him, and my sister.

1477
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:24,990
It's been around 5 or 6 years since we got close.

1478
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,490
- You trust him that much...
- They're like family.

1479
01:02:28,491 --> 01:02:29,590
- Of course.
- to introduce him to others.

1480
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:30,661
He's like family to me.

1481
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:34,091
(Who is the next person to enter the Heart Room?)

1482
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:37,361
I...

1483
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:41,301
(Ji Eun enters with a sigh.)

1484
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:44,201
Actually, today...

1485
01:02:46,311 --> 01:02:48,741
In fact, for today...

1486
01:02:50,511 --> 01:02:51,851
Jeong Geun...

1487
01:02:53,111 --> 01:02:54,281
Jeong Geun?

1488
01:02:55,821 --> 01:02:58,951
(Relieved)

1489
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:00,951
I think her feelings may have grown.

1490
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:15,101
What?

1491
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:24,340
"Ha Jeong Geun...

1492
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:25,511
is 32."

1493
01:03:26,681 --> 01:03:29,181
"He's an M and A investment strategist."

1494
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,890
I currently work as a member of an investment strategy team...

1495
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:36,620
at a global IT company.

1496
01:03:36,621 --> 01:03:38,891
I'm a M and A strategist with five years of experience.

1497
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:45,130
I discover companies with potential to grow...

1498
01:03:45,131 --> 01:03:47,601
and make strategic investments or mergers and acquisitions...

1499
01:03:48,101 --> 01:03:50,000
to create synergy...

1500
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:52,071
and financial outcomes for the company.

1501
01:03:52,571 --> 01:03:55,780
Also, to enhance personal abilities,

1502
01:03:55,781 --> 01:03:59,681
I am pursuing a Finance MBA at Korea University Graduate School.

1503
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:05,421
(Ha Jeong Geun, 32, M and A investment strategist)

1504
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:08,421
It's a job I'm not familiar with.

1505
01:04:10,921 --> 01:04:14,191
In his everyday life, Jeong Geun speaks...

1506
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:17,301
and behaves very calmly.

1507
01:04:17,971 --> 01:04:21,341
Maybe it's the nature of his work...

1508
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:23,870
that he speaks so smoothly.

1509
01:04:23,871 --> 01:04:25,470
While thinking so,

1510
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:29,611
I still want to see his more relaxed self.

1511
01:04:30,211 --> 01:04:32,581
Do you want to see him in a relaxed mode?

1512
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:34,480
That means she likes him.

1513
01:04:34,481 --> 01:04:35,921
(That means she likes him.)

1514
01:04:37,781 --> 01:04:39,821
(Hyun Jin had a fun date with Su Jin today.)

1515
01:04:40,591 --> 01:04:42,821
(In which direction will his heart move toward?)

1516
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:48,801
(He chooses Su Jin as the one who knocked on his heart.)

1517
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:50,400
- Gosh. I love it.
- Yes.

1518
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:52,000
Gosh. I like this so much.

1519
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:54,071
- He's straightforward.
- He took it off right away.

1520
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:55,440
- He didn't even hesitate.
- No.

1521
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:56,940
- He's straightforward.
- This is what I'm talking about.

1522
01:04:56,941 --> 01:04:58,211
That was cool.

1523
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:01,510
The one who held the biggest place...

1524
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:05,251
in my head and heart was...

1525
01:05:05,351 --> 01:05:09,151
Su Jin, so I chose her.

1526
01:05:10,151 --> 01:05:12,220
I enjoyed our time together.

1527
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:13,351
It was fun.

1528
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:16,990
There were some points she might not be interested,

1529
01:05:16,991 --> 01:05:18,691
but she responded well to them.

1530
01:05:27,801 --> 01:05:28,900
- Gosh.
- Why?

1531
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:30,401
- Please read it for us.
- What is it?

1532
01:05:31,101 --> 01:05:32,310
- What is that look on his face?
- Why?

1533
01:05:32,311 --> 01:05:34,341
- Is it a good thing?
- Does he like it or what?

1534
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:44,250
(What is the information about Su Jin...)

1535
01:05:44,251 --> 01:05:45,691
(that made Hyun Jin smile?)

1536
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:49,321
- She's 28.
- She's 28.

1537
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:50,461
"A soccer coach?"

1538
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:51,591
Really?

1539
01:05:52,461 --> 01:05:54,261
- That's cool.
- That's awesome.

1540
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:56,160
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- That's why...

1541
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,660
she is a friend of Young Kwang.

1542
01:05:57,661 --> 01:05:59,500
- I see.
- They played soccer before.

1543
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:01,030
They played soccer in the arcade.

1544
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:02,270
(The two played a ball-kicking game in the arcade.)

1545
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:03,801
(Was that a hint?)

1546
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:17,321
I'm a soccer coach with 3 years of experience.

1547
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:22,890
I started playing soccer when I was in elementary school.

1548
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:24,290
I was a member of the U-13...

1549
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:26,731
and the U-16 national women's youth soccer teams.

1550
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:28,560
Then I played as a center back...

1551
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:30,331
for the women's soccer team at Korea University.

1552
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:35,601
After graduation, I joined the Sejong Sportstoto WFC...

1553
01:06:35,841 --> 01:06:38,071
as a player until I retired.

1554
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:42,141
Now, I teach soccer to youth and adults.

1555
01:06:48,951 --> 01:06:52,391
(Kang Su Jin, 28, a soccer coach)

1556
01:06:53,421 --> 01:06:54,861
The time has come.

1557
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:59,560
(It's Su Jin's turn, who went on a date with Hyun Jin.)

1558
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,661
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1559
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:04,101
Please.

1560
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:05,401
Okay.

1561
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:10,100
I don't need to hesitate today.

1562
01:07:10,101 --> 01:07:12,071
(It's a no-brainer.)

1563
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,611
Hyun Jin.

1564
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:19,081
We went on our first date.

1565
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:22,450
He expressed his feelings for me...

1566
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:25,921
both indirectly and directly.

1567
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:28,521
I think my heart...

1568
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:32,161
is open halfway.

1569
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:38,131
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1570
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:39,630
Thank you.

1571
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:40,830
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

1572
01:07:40,831 --> 01:07:42,471
(It's as if he won the best acting award.)

1573
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:44,170
What I love is that they both...

1574
01:07:44,171 --> 01:07:46,171
picked each other without hesitation.

1575
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:47,771
Gosh. It feels unbelievably good.

1576
01:07:47,841 --> 01:07:49,210
If it works out well with Hyun Jin,

1577
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:52,251
it's going to be her first love and first boyfriend...

1578
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:54,610
- for Su Jin.
- Su Jin and Hyun Jin.

1579
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:55,720
It's the Jin-Jin couple.

1580
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:57,521
- That's right. The Jin-Jin couple.
- Right.

1581
01:07:57,581 --> 01:07:58,791
Su Jin and Hyun Jin.

1582
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:00,190
The love that overcame the Eiffel Tower.

1583
01:08:00,191 --> 01:08:01,890
- The Jin-Jin couple.
- You can't be so sure yet.

1584
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:02,991
The Eiffel Tower doesn't...

1585
01:08:03,091 --> 01:08:04,161
I envy you.

1586
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,631
Right. Hyun Jin's occupation.

1587
01:08:14,701 --> 01:08:15,801
This is crazy.

1588
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:19,110
Why? What is it?

1589
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:21,781
(Su Jin is quiet after seeing Hyun Jin's information.)

1590
01:08:26,551 --> 01:08:28,221
She looks serious now.

1591
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:29,581
What is it?

1592
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:30,851
Right.

1593
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:41,360
(What's on Su Jin's mind?)

1594
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:43,130
Tell us about it.

1595
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:44,161
What? Where is she going?

1596
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:47,970
Tell us about it.

1597
01:08:47,971 --> 01:08:49,001
What? Where is she going?

1598
01:08:54,711 --> 01:08:57,681
(Su Jin paces around for a long time.)

1599
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:13,390
For their first selection,

1600
01:09:13,391 --> 01:09:15,130
they read the Lovebud Guarantee.

1601
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:16,200
Yes.

1602
01:09:16,201 --> 01:09:18,131
For their second selection,

1603
01:09:18,671 --> 01:09:21,330
they found out about their occupation and age.

1604
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:22,700
Yes. It was such an important decision.

1605
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,910
You start off by knowing about the partner...

1606
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,610
more than anyone.

1607
01:09:26,611 --> 01:09:28,210
- That could be so useful.
- Yes.

1608
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:29,211
(They found out about each other earlier than others.)

1609
01:09:29,212 --> 01:09:31,210
- We can't ignore those aspects.
- You're right.

1610
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:32,751
- If we were to be honest.
- Yes.

1611
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:34,711
Was Su Jin surprised...

1612
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:37,121
because of the age?

1613
01:09:37,481 --> 01:09:39,490
- It could be his occupation.
- We don't know that yet.

1614
01:09:39,491 --> 01:09:41,351
- It could be his job.
- Why don't they show us?

1615
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:43,261
I can't wait to find out.

1616
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,501
But... Well...

1617
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:49,661
You saw...

1618
01:09:49,801 --> 01:09:51,401
- his occupation and age.
- Yes.

1619
01:09:51,461 --> 01:09:52,531
How do you feel?

1620
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:54,630
- I don't know who I picked.
- Right.

1621
01:09:54,631 --> 01:09:57,371
But do you feel different after seeing it?

1622
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:00,511
I...

1623
01:10:01,171 --> 01:10:04,911
I expected him to be like what I had read.

1624
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,481
I'm shocked.

1625
01:10:06,511 --> 01:10:07,651
- Why?
- Gosh.

1626
01:10:07,851 --> 01:10:11,050
Are you that shocked? What shocked you?

1627
01:10:11,051 --> 01:10:13,520
- I can't tell you.
- When you choose,

1628
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:14,991
what is on your mind?

1629
01:10:15,661 --> 01:10:17,861
When I choose? I just follow what my heart says.

1630
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:21,530
- Do you choose the person you like?
- Yes.

1631
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:23,230
I sincerely answered...

1632
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,661
- the question there.
- As is? I see.

1633
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:27,470
But I'm a little shocked after opening it.

1634
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:28,701
Really?

1635
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:30,171
Yes.

1636
01:10:31,771 --> 01:10:32,771
That's it.

1637
01:10:33,171 --> 01:10:34,911
- Are you shocked?
- Yes.

1638
01:10:36,781 --> 01:10:38,111
Gosh. I don't know.

1639
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:40,251
It's shocking. Anyway...

1640
01:10:40,651 --> 01:10:42,781
- That's why I'm more confused.
- I see.

1641
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:47,820
Honestly, I really want to know what you're thinking.

1642
01:10:47,821 --> 01:10:49,221
(Meanwhile, at the men's dorm)

1643
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:54,031
I was determined to follow my heart.

1644
01:10:54,761 --> 01:10:56,201
- The boys are lost too.
- I mean...

1645
01:10:58,131 --> 01:10:59,831
If I don't follow my heart,

1646
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:04,000
- in this short period of time, - Right.

1647
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:07,011
I don't think I can achieve anything.

1648
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:10,440
That's why...

1649
01:11:10,441 --> 01:11:13,751
- I thought I should get close...
- Right.

1650
01:11:13,781 --> 01:11:16,751
And make efforts for the one I'm interested in.

1651
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:19,990
Jeong Geun. If you were set on a date...

1652
01:11:19,991 --> 01:11:22,361
with someone other than Ji Eun,

1653
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,660
would it be...

1654
01:11:24,661 --> 01:11:25,831
- Then...
- Yes.

1655
01:11:26,561 --> 01:11:30,061
I would have gone to the date,

1656
01:11:31,631 --> 01:11:34,901
but I wouldn't be as excited as I was today.

1657
01:11:35,141 --> 01:11:36,201
- Exactly.
- Really?

1658
01:11:36,741 --> 01:11:38,140
That's the situation I'm in right now.

1659
01:11:38,141 --> 01:11:40,111
I see.

1660
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:42,681
- What an honest man.
- Yes.

1661
01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:46,281
I'm here to meet someone who's right for me.

1662
01:11:46,881 --> 01:11:49,380
I'm not here to be the final couple.

1663
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:50,421
- You're right.
- Yes.

1664
01:11:50,651 --> 01:11:52,650
When I think about it, when I first met...

1665
01:11:52,651 --> 01:11:54,650
- Su Jin and Ji Eun, - That's right.

1666
01:11:54,651 --> 01:11:56,820
I had a nice conversation with them.

1667
01:11:56,821 --> 01:11:58,360
We went to a cafe and all.

1668
01:11:58,361 --> 01:12:00,460
But because it was the first time, I was so nervous.

1669
01:12:00,461 --> 01:12:04,001
I couldn't figure out if I had a good feeling or not.

1670
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:05,831
It went that fast.

1671
01:12:06,801 --> 01:12:09,970
But looking back,

1672
01:12:09,971 --> 01:12:13,340
Su Jin and Ji Eun are the ones I'm interested in.

1673
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:15,111
But today, I didn't get to talk to them.

1674
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:18,981
In a way, the whole day today...

1675
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:21,350
wasn't really...

1676
01:12:21,351 --> 01:12:24,521
- a productive day for me.
- Right.

1677
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:26,751
- I assume you enjoyed the date.
- I can't believe it.

1678
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:30,791
At any rate,

1679
01:12:31,621 --> 01:12:33,030
I got to spend time...

1680
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:35,801
with someone I was curious about...

1681
01:12:36,501 --> 01:12:39,231
- and who I was interested in.
- Yes.

1682
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:41,631
In that aspect,

1683
01:12:42,301 --> 01:12:44,071
even when I came back from the date,

1684
01:12:44,171 --> 01:12:46,440
I was still curious about her.

1685
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:48,610
"What does she do? How old is she?"

1686
01:12:48,611 --> 01:12:50,411
She made me more curious.

1687
01:12:51,441 --> 01:12:54,351
I was certain she made me more curious.

1688
01:12:56,651 --> 01:12:58,080
- They're so frank.
- He's indeed honest.

1689
01:12:58,081 --> 01:12:59,991
I think the tension will start to grow now.

1690
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:03,961
- This is driving me nuts.
- What is?

1691
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:07,391
Su Jin said she was shocked.

1692
01:13:08,261 --> 01:13:10,000
- What could it be?
- But it's...

1693
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:12,070
While talking to him, I realised...

1694
01:13:12,071 --> 01:13:15,200
one's heart and thoughtfulness matter to me a lot.

1695
01:13:15,201 --> 01:13:17,071
We were on the same page with that.

1696
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:20,971
He was so thoughtful when treating me...

1697
01:13:21,171 --> 01:13:23,540
in every aspect, including opening the door for me.

1698
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:26,050
- Really?
- He was a natural gentleman...

1699
01:13:26,051 --> 01:13:27,211
when we were alone.

1700
01:13:27,381 --> 01:13:29,751
I appreciated it.

1701
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:31,450
- He...
- You had an issue...

1702
01:13:31,451 --> 01:13:33,350
- while talking to him.
- Yes.

1703
01:13:33,351 --> 01:13:35,360
We had a deep conversation today.

1704
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:36,990
I told him...

1705
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:38,991
that I was curious about others too.

1706
01:13:40,391 --> 01:13:44,901
But from his perspective,

1707
01:13:45,971 --> 01:13:48,570
he was clear about something...

1708
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:50,801
that stood out to me.

1709
01:13:52,371 --> 01:13:53,410
I'd be okay...

1710
01:13:53,411 --> 01:13:54,910
if it could be compensated with other things.

1711
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:56,681
I don't know if it's the right thing to do.

1712
01:13:57,981 --> 01:13:59,680
The Heart Room wasn't the problem here.

1713
01:13:59,681 --> 01:14:01,410
- But with that information, - Was this a problem too?

1714
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:03,220
My head is about to explode.

1715
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:04,851
I got shocked after reading it.

1716
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:08,251
- I see.
- What is it?

1717
01:14:08,621 --> 01:14:09,791
What could it be?

1718
01:14:10,491 --> 01:14:13,691
A lot happened to Su Jin today.

1719
01:14:14,091 --> 01:14:16,131
- Yes.
- What is it, Su Jin?

1720
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,031
Why does this happen to me?

1721
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:19,731
Why aren't you sleeping?

1722
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,731
- Su Jin can't sleep now.
- Why not?

1723
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:23,640
- For Su Jin, - Did she have a problem?

1724
01:14:23,641 --> 01:14:25,841
It'll be a sleepless night.

1725
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:27,041
She can't sleep now.

1726
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,640
She has a bomb in her head.

1727
01:14:28,641 --> 01:14:29,940
- Really?
- It's ticking.

1728
01:14:29,941 --> 01:14:30,941
(What is worrying Su Jin so badly?)

1729
01:14:42,421 --> 01:14:44,791
(What information did Su Jin find out about Hyun Jin?)

1730
01:15:01,011 --> 01:15:03,780
"Oh Hyun Jin is 39."

1731
01:15:03,781 --> 01:15:05,811
"He is a stage and musical actor."

1732
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:10,521
A musical actor and a stage actor...

1733
01:15:12,521 --> 01:15:14,091
A musical actor.

1734
01:15:14,791 --> 01:15:15,891
And 39 years old.

1735
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:22,500
Through the date today,

1736
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:24,760
I got to know Hyun Jin better.

1737
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:26,130
He is very thoughtful.

1738
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:28,200
Because I discovered some aspects of Hyun Jin...

1739
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:31,441
that I couldn't see yesterday, I got more drawn to him.

1740
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:35,641
For me,

1741
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,781
the maximum age difference is six years older or younger.

1742
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:42,281
Gosh. An 11-year difference is not easy.

1743
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:46,091
- Eleven years.
- It was the age.

1744
01:15:47,421 --> 01:15:48,990
- He's 11 years older.
- Eleven years.

1745
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:51,190
- Su Jin can feel that way.
- It might feel too old.

1746
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:52,931
- That's possible.
- You're right.

1747
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,831
- Yes.
- And it's her first relationship.

1748
01:15:56,701 --> 01:16:00,000
The 11-year age difference is a big deal.

1749
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:02,441
- Some might be okay with it, but...
- You're right.

1750
01:16:02,801 --> 01:16:04,370
- Age difference doesn't matter.
- Right.

1751
01:16:04,371 --> 01:16:06,111
- It's just a number.
- Yes.

1752
01:16:06,571 --> 01:16:08,070
Now that...

1753
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:10,181
- she knows about Hyun Jin, - Yes.

1754
01:16:10,311 --> 01:16:11,380
How she treats him from now on...

1755
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:12,480
- will be critical.
- Yes.

1756
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:13,811
- If she likes him...
- Yes.

1757
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,680
Will it bring the two closer...

1758
01:16:16,681 --> 01:16:18,120
or apart?

1759
01:16:18,121 --> 01:16:19,420
- We have to see to find out.
- Yes.

1760
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:20,690
- What will happen?
- Exactly.

1761
01:16:20,691 --> 01:16:23,690
They didn't show us Sin Young and Geon Wu's decisions yet.

1762
01:16:23,691 --> 01:16:24,991
- You're right.
- That's true.

1763
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:26,231
- Right.
- That's true.

1764
01:16:26,361 --> 01:16:27,361
- You're not feeling at ease.
- Ye Eun.

1765
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:29,000
- Are you eager to find out?
- Yes, I am.

1766
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,460
- You can't wait, can you?
- I can't.

1767
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,971
Unfortunately, we'll say goodbye now.

1768
01:16:33,531 --> 01:16:34,801
It's unfortunate.

1769
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,741
It's according to our schedule. What a shame.

1770
01:16:38,201 --> 01:16:40,010
- I always feel something's missing.
- Now...

1771
01:16:40,011 --> 01:16:43,011
It always feels incomplete for Ye Eun and me.

1772
01:16:43,441 --> 01:16:46,150
- But we have next week.
- Yes. We have next week.

1773
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:47,680
We'll say goodbye now.

1774
01:16:47,681 --> 01:16:49,920
- Okay.
- Genuinely good people...

1775
01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:51,920
who will knock on the door of your heart.

1776
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:53,150
We'll see you next week.

1777
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:54,651
- Knock, knock.
- Knock, knock.

1778
01:16:56,461 --> 01:16:57,960
(This place...)

1779
01:16:57,961 --> 01:16:59,731
(is about to turn into a jungle.)

1780
01:17:00,331 --> 01:17:01,961
(Hotter)

1781
01:17:02,231 --> 01:17:03,530
It's not bad, isn't it?

1782
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:06,501
(A pool is open to expose their feelings.)

1783
01:17:06,531 --> 01:17:08,471
- Gosh. He's so fit.
- It's my first time seeing it too.

1784
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:11,041
Su Jin was fierce.

1785
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:12,571
She was cool.

1786
01:17:12,941 --> 01:17:14,011
Show it to me again.

1787
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:17,910
- Is that your Catholic name?
- Yes.

1788
01:17:17,911 --> 01:17:19,250
How did you know? Are you Catholic?

1789
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:20,251
Yes.

1790
01:17:20,851 --> 01:17:22,551
We have many things in common.

1791
01:17:22,781 --> 01:17:24,421
(Is he sending me a signal?)

1792
01:17:24,721 --> 01:17:25,751
Su Jin.

1793
01:17:26,191 --> 01:17:27,951
I think she wanted to be by Dong Ha's side.

1794
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,421
(It bothered me so much.)

1795
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,630
- What are you doing?
- What?

1796
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:34,731
(The friendship starts to fall apart.)

1797
01:17:35,161 --> 01:17:36,561
You look upset.

1798
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:38,460
(A fierce battle of nerves unfolds...)

1799
01:17:38,461 --> 01:17:40,501
(amid explosive tension.)

1800
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:45,201
(And a mission is announced on the board.)

1801
01:17:45,271 --> 01:17:47,711
Geon Wu, Dong Ha, Hyun Jin, and Jeong Geun,

1802
01:17:47,911 --> 01:17:49,211
do this.

1803
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:51,241
- What?
- Come on!

1804
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:53,581
(The unexpected mission shifts the mood.)

1805
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:57,021
Is there someone you'd like to talk to besides me?

1806
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,351
I won't worry about it.

1807
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:03,791
It made me so comfortable.

1808
01:18:04,621 --> 01:18:06,891
(The relationships suddenly shift.)

1809
01:18:07,091 --> 01:18:08,391
Dating is about luck too.

1810
01:18:08,461 --> 01:18:12,131
I wanted to apologise and say...

1811
01:18:12,331 --> 01:18:13,801
that it really was a mistake.

1812
01:18:13,871 --> 01:18:16,301
- Da Hye. What's wrong?
- Something must have happened.

1813
01:18:16,701 --> 01:18:19,311
So I had a mental breakdown.

1814
01:18:20,141 --> 01:18:22,741
(What happened to them?)

1815
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:24,040
(You know what?)

1816
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:25,651
(I actually know someone really great.)

1817
01:18:25,751 --> 01:18:27,580
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

1818
01:18:27,581 --> 01:18:29,621
(Just open your heart a little.)

1819
01:18:29,921 --> 01:18:32,621
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

1820
01:18:32,821 --> 01:18:34,891
(Date My Friend)
