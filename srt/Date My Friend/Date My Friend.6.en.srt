1
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,190
(You know what?)

2
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,790
(I actually know someone really great.)

3
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,661
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

4
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,631
(Just open your heart a little.)

5
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,571
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

6
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,740
(Date My Friend)

7
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:25,871
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,241
(Their relationships grow deeper with time.)

9
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,410
(Today was perfect for me.)

10
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:33,281
(Me too.)

11
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:36,581
Da Hye.

12
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:40,821
I could tell he cared, so I was thankful.

13
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:45,691
(Hearts open up with time.)

14
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,291
Should we get matching bracelets?

15
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:48,961
- Bracelets?
- Yes.

16
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:53,261
(No matter what happens, we won't take them off.)

17
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:58,001
(Ji Eun's bracelet is nowhere to be seen.)

18
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,300
No.

19
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,471
No, don't take it the wrong way.

20
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,411
(It's only a bracelet.)

21
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,781
(Do I really have to go through all this because of it?)

22
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,421
(Misunderstandings sparked by their bracelets)

23
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,591
(And the women were given the choice of their dates.)

24
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:23,531
(Ji Eun chose Dong Ha.)

25
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,731
My relationship with her...

26
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,801
will reach a crossroads that day.

27
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:31,901
I will go on a date with Hyun Jin.

28
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,501
My chance is finally here.

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,411
(Their true feelings are yet to be revealed.)

30
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,910
But Jeong Geun kind of went,

31
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:43,551
"I want Choi Ji Eun!" and refused to let you go.

32
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,180
- Are you a couple?
- My personality...

33
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,251
Are you a couple?

34
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,691
I feel so bad that I can't take off this bracelet.

35
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,421
I don't know how you feel about Jeong Geun.

36
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,991
You have to follow your heart.

37
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,761
My feelings are kind of emptying out.

38
00:01:58,431 --> 00:01:59,761
I don't want to hold onto him.

39
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,471
She might have wanted to...

40
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,640
leave space for someone else.

41
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:06,241
She's free to do whatever she wants.

42
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,940
(You took your bracelet off.)

43
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,881
(Yes, I did.)

44
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:15,251
(The emotional distance between us)

45
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,221
Be careful.

46
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,090
- Your heels could get stuck here.
- Right.

47
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:24,291
- Right. That would be bad.
- Here. Come to this side.

48
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:27,160
- This way.
- Are they on a double date?

49
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:28,760
I think so. This is a first, right?

50
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:29,831
- Yes.
- What?

51
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:33,100
- It's good.
- We're here. Let's go inside.

52
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,200
We're here.

53
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,100
- I'm starving.
- The food's going to be good.

54
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,441
- Hello.
- Hello.

55
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,670
- This looks so good.
- This looks so good.

56
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:41,671
(You can't go wrong with pork belly, minari, and bean sprouts.)

57
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:44,141
- Look at the minari.
- This is great. There's minari.

58
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:47,111
It's too bad that we can't drink alcohol with this.

59
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:48,910
We're eating pork belly,

60
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:50,311
and it's raining outside.

61
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,351
What did you eat yesterday, Jeong Geun?

62
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,691
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

63
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,161
- I felt full without even eating.
- Gosh.

64
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,791
What?

65
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,031
That's insane.

66
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:07,731
You never know what can happen.

67
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,000
You know what you just said, right?

68
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,570
She could prefer Dong Ha...

69
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:12,740
after her date with him.

70
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:15,210
I see. Ji Eun?

71
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:16,211
Yes.

72
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,341
Thank you for the food.

73
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,251
This looks so good.

74
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,650
The green onion kimchi is great.

75
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:28,751
(This is good.)

76
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:33,791
(Let me try.)

77
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,491
The kimchi is amazing.

78
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:40,531
We're now halfway through filming.

79
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:44,300
What are your thoughts?

80
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:45,870
Did you have moments...

81
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:48,340
where you thought one date was better than the other?

82
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,911
To talk about each person,

83
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,311
we now know each other's age.

84
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,580
- And I went on a date with...
- The age gap.

85
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,611
People who I have the biggest age gaps with.

86
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:59,381
- Right?
- Yes.

87
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:01,121
But yesterday,

88
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,621
I didn't feel that age gap.

89
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:07,930
They're only a year apart.

90
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,631
But to be honest, I did feel that generation gap with him.

91
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:12,260
- I did feel it.
- With Hyun Jin?

92
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,301
- I see.
- Yes.

93
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,430
- Really?
- She felt the generation gap.

94
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,941
Really? "A generation gap?"

95
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,100
The age difference isn't that big, though.

96
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:22,640
Also, Dong Ha and Hyun Jin are close in age.

97
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,271
(Dong Ha and Hyun Jin are from the same generation!)

98
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,940
Age doesn't matter.

99
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:27,750
From this experience, Su Jin realized that...

100
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,510
- age doesn't matter.
- Age doesn't matter.

101
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:30,950
- The number isn't what's important.
- She learned that.

102
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:32,620
Dong Ha made her feel comfortable.

103
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,780
- Right.
- And he guided her well...

104
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,451
- Yes.
- without doing too much.

105
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:38,861
But the fact that they're just one year apart in age surprised me.

106
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:42,431
Anyway, both of them are much older than me. Right?

107
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,431
For me, at least.

108
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,430
What’s the maximum age difference you’re comfortable with?

109
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:50,630
Hypothetically.

110
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,271
Gosh, that's...

111
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:00,680
I'm not sure. I think I'll have to see it through to know for sure.

112
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:01,881
See it through?

113
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,880
You have to know that before.

114
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:05,020
- That's how..
- You're right.

115
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,151
And I have it somewhat in mind.

116
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,191
I do have it somewhat in mind,

117
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,121
but I'm just saying it's hard. I'm confused.

118
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,320
I think everyone here would be feeling confused.

119
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,730
- Of course.
- Right.

120
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,791
It's the same for everyone.

121
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,900
Actually, you...

122
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,131
went on a date with just one person.

123
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:23,301
- Yes.
- Right.

124
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,971
(Curious)

125
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,211
I think Ji Eun was someone...

126
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:34,241
I was able to enjoy...

127
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:38,020
spending time with and talking to...

128
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,281
after coming here.

129
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,051
That's why...

130
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:44,791
Well...

131
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:46,721
Well...

132
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,900
But I’m not really sure either.

133
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:52,961
I also...

134
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:58,001
am definitely giving certain things a lot of thought.

135
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,741
And I know this could be a misunderstanding,

136
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,471
but I do want an answer.

137
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,241
That's my situation, even though I can't get into much detail.

138
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:12,980
There was too little time for us to clear up the misunderstanding.

139
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,181
And then...

140
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,091
she went on a date with someone else.

141
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:20,390
The situation unfolded,

142
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,160
unstoppable and irreversible.

143
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,631
(The lack of communication is worsening his misunderstanding.)

144
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:36,410
I was so caught up in my own situation...

145
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,880
that it was hard for me to get a grasp on...

146
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,710
the choices others were making.

147
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:41,751
Right.

148
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,151
But I think I have an idea now that I've talked to you today.

149
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:49,251
So in terms of that,

150
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,620
I hope that, if anyone has made up their mind,

151
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,431
they should express it well.

152
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:58,331
- Right. That's what we're here for.
- That's right.

153
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:01,700
(Through the double date, )

154
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:06,401
(the four people were able to have a heartfelt conversation.)

155
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:12,711
Do you think that gave Jeong Geun a change of heart?

156
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:17,151
- No.
- Gosh. I'm not sure.

157
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:19,881
I feel like his perspective might change a little.

158
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,121
- I think so, too.
- Right now, his head is full of...

159
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:24,661
He's probably thinking about it a lot.

160
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:27,491
I wonder what Ji Eun is up to.

161
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:33,531
(Only Jeong Geun and Geon Wu are left.)

162
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,001
I wonder what Ji Eun is up to.

163
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,401
That's what I thought.

164
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:41,070
It’s really bothering me.

165
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,440
I didn't think it would.

166
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,140
Wait, you're not wearing it.

167
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:45,381
- Which one?
- The bracelet.

168
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:48,311
Of course, I didn't wear it. She took hers off earlier.

169
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,720
I have to talk to her later when she gets back.

170
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,051
Gosh, this is insane.

171
00:07:57,421 --> 00:07:59,621
Goodness. Ji Eun is on a date with Dong Ha right now.

172
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,890
(Meanwhile, during Ji Eun and Dong Ha's date)

173
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:03,031
Have you sobered up a bit?

174
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,761
I’m mostly sober now.

175
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,201
We had just the right amount of drink, right?

176
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:11,400
- I did. I feel good right now.
- Really?

177
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:13,571
I didn't overdo it.

178
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:16,041
- I drank just enough.
- I was feeling a little drunk.

179
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:17,980
- A little?
- Yes.

180
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,240
- I was feeling kind of drunk.
- I was slightly tipsy too.

181
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,841
Yes, I was quite tipsy.

182
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,650
- You took the bracelet off.
- What?

183
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:31,821
You took the bracelet off.

184
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:33,721
Oh, I...

185
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,691
Gosh. That's too much.

186
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,900
Yes, I did.

187
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,971
(Yes, I did.)

188
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:45,200
It felt right to do so.

189
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,501
(It felt right to do so.)

190
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,710
Do you think so?

191
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:54,750
(Do you think so?)

192
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:55,850
- Yes.
- Okay.

193
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:58,181
You're right.

194
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,251
It's inconsiderate.

195
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:03,551
That's why I took it off.

196
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,131
Can I ask you honestly?

197
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,331
Yes.

198
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,731
Why did you choose me on the second day?

199
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:20,171
- The second day?
- Yes, for the second vote.

200
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,151
The date on the second day...

201
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:32,051
felt like being with a friend,

202
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:35,521
and it was a fun day, but...

203
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:39,421
It's the same way. I thought it wasn't right...

204
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,090
to choose someone...

205
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,361
- just because we went on a date.
- Just because you went on a date?

206
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,431
Of course, she could get hurt,

207
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,061
but...

208
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:47,801
Still,

209
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:51,201
there's no reason for me to vote without sincerity.

210
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,571
I had already made up my mind by then.

211
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:01,410
I think that kind of determination is necessary.

212
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:02,581
(I think that kind of determination is necessary.)

213
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:06,980
"Determination."

214
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:11,621
(Determination)

215
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:20,201
(What kind of determination will Dong Ha and Ji Eun make?)

216
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:21,800
To be honest...

217
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:22,871
(You took off your bracelet?)

218
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,531
I think I had no choice.

219
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,571
Honestly...

220
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:33,781
Anyway, it's on me if that person gets his feelings hurt.

221
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:36,650
Jeong Geun.

222
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:37,951
She's thinking about that.

223
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,221
That his feelings could get hurt.

224
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:40,980
That she will accept the consequences...

225
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:41,990
- of hurting him.
- And so...

226
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,591
- she drew the line.
- Yes, she did.

227
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,360
She called him "that person,"

228
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:47,960
and not "Jeong Geun."

229
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,490
Maybe that's why you shouldn't get matching items.

230
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,800
Why do you think she took off the bracelet?

231
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,360
What was the ultimate reason?

232
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,901
For me, I think it meant,

233
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,241
"Give me some time."

234
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,140
I think that's what it meant.

235
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:03,040
- "I want to think about it." - Yes, because...

236
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,340
feelings can progress at their own pace.

237
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:06,680
Jeong Geun did rush a bit.

238
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,110
He may have rushed,

239
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:10,211
but from Jeong Geun's point of view,

240
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:12,420
- Ji Eun was the one...
- He was fast.

241
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,680
Who suggested the bracelets first.

242
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:15,620
- She started the fire first.
- The meaning of it...

243
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:18,120
- They had different perspectives.
- Gosh, it's hard.

244
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:19,261
(The bracelet had a different significance for them.)

245
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,861
(After the date, Sin Young and Jeong Geun came to a cafe.)

246
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:37,670
But for you,

247
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,910
you want to clear up the misunderstanding more, right?

248
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,111
I do feel like that's what I have to do.

249
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,981
I usually think and make decisions on my own.

250
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,421
But that way, mistakes can happen.

251
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:52,190
Since it's just my own thoughts.

252
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,491
- That's true.
- Yes.

253
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,391
So...

254
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,961
Actually, yesterday,

255
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,671
Ji Eun and I got...

256
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,631
matching bracelets.

257
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,541
- Yes.
- Okay.

258
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:09,371
It was too cute,

259
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,510
but I said I will put it on if she did it with me.

260
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:13,581
So...

261
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,110
I told her,

262
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,880
whatever it may be,

263
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:20,780
even if we go on a date with someone else,

264
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,351
- let's not take this off.
- Okay.

265
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:25,361
But this morning, I came back from the interview,

266
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:27,021
and she didn't have the bracelet on.

267
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,600
I actually froze after seeing it.

268
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:33,931
- After seeing her wrist.
- Okay.

269
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,370
I thought, "Fine,"

270
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,941
and I also took it off.

271
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:43,170
That's why I had a lot on my mind,

272
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:45,641
and in the midst of the buildup of misunderstandings,

273
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:49,350
I went on a date with you,

274
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,950
and I don't know what happened after that.

275
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:55,191
If she put it back on before going with Dong Ha...

276
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,891
That's why I feel like...

277
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:02,961
I ended up pouring all of this out to you today.

278
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:06,461
But you know,

279
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:08,831
I actually saw it.

280
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,371
Saw what?

281
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,341
She had the bracelet on.

282
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:18,071
Even in the morning,

283
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:21,981
I actually didn't see her without the bracelet on.

284
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,680
- Hello.
- Did you sleep well?

285
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:25,881
(This morning)

286
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:29,421
(Ji Eun had the bracelet on her wrist.)

287
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:32,891
(She didn't take it off.)

288
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,930
But I only saw her without the bracelet on,

289
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:36,090
- in my perspective.
- Yes.

290
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:37,391
- So...
- I know.

291
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,131
You need to clear it up.

292
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:40,501
I think...

293
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,971
you should clear things out with her.

294
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:45,771
- Okay.
- Yes.

295
00:13:46,671 --> 00:13:47,741
I will do that.

296
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:50,371
When we get back,

297
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:53,540
I don't know what the vibe was like for them,

298
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,410
- but I will do what I want to do.
- Yes.

299
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:57,551
That's a separate matter.

300
00:13:57,851 --> 00:13:59,150
(Through Sin Young, he cleared up the misunderstanding with Ji Eun.)

301
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:01,651
I hope you can clear up the misunderstanding.

302
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,150
It can happen if you like another person.

303
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,321
It can happen if you like another person,

304
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:09,430
but it was really cute that he had those strong feelings...

305
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,060
within this short time,

306
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:13,461
so I wanted to applaud and support him.

307
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:16,031
So it was a date...

308
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,341
where we gave each other advice.

309
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,740
I did feel much better...

310
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,681
after talking with Sin Young.

311
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:30,780
So...

312
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:32,581
I felt that I needed to tell Ji Eun...

313
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,851
about all the misunderstandings...

314
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:40,361
that had formed.

315
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,990
If you need anything as well,

316
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:46,030
- Okay.
- make sure to tell me, okay?

317
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:47,101
Okay.

318
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:49,430
I will try to solve them for you.

319
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,500
(By sharing their troubles, )

320
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,641
(the two grew much closer as friends.)

321
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,210
Now, everything is cleared up...

322
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,310
- for Jeong Geun.
- Yes.

323
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:57,640
- When he returns, - That's right.

324
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:58,780
- Yes.
- it will be a new start.

325
00:14:58,781 --> 00:14:59,841
You're right.

326
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,081
This is serious.

327
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,510
- What do we do?
- Things are cleared up,

328
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:05,920
but the bracelet isn't on...

329
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,981
- Ji Eun's wrist.
- There won't be.

330
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,990
- This is just one day.
- Yes.

331
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,720
That's what he went through...

332
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,760
- in one day.
- The 24 hours felt like 240 hours.

333
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:14,790
- Of course.
- They have to move on.

334
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,501
- But when you like someone, - Goodness.

335
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,231
Isn't that usually how it is?

336
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:21,700
- That's true.
- Yes.

337
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,671
He's having a hard time.

338
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:27,540
(Which couple arrived at the scenic hanok?)

339
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,041
- It's really windy.
- I know.

340
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,340
- This way.
- Okay.

341
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,341
Over here.

342
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,051
What a vibe.

343
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:37,651
- It's nice, right?
- Yes, I like it.

344
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:39,550
It's my first time coming to...

345
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,481
a nice place while we're here.

346
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:43,791
It's like a scene from an animated film.

347
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,161
What a vibe.

348
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:47,590
- Let's go in.
- I'm looking forward to it.

349
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:49,290
(Hyun Jin and Da Hye are at a hanok cafe.)

350
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,161
If the wind is bothering you...

351
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:52,601
Okay, I will tell you.

352
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,231
I like it.

353
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,570
Okay. One moment.

354
00:15:57,571 --> 00:15:58,741
(Wait.)

355
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,141
(Why did Hyun Jin suddenly get up?)

356
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:13,281
- A blanket?
- Gosh. He's a gentleman.

357
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:15,120
- Don’t they look good together?
- They do.

358
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:16,621
They look good together.

359
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:21,321
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

360
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:24,960
- It's comfortable here.
- I know.

361
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:28,901
(They finally spend time together.)

362
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:32,871
This might sound funny, but...

363
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:42,981
I was curious...

364
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:45,151
about you.

365
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,221
- What you're thinking right now...
- Yes.

366
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,551
And so on.

367
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:58,131
(He is too nervous to say anything.)

368
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:02,071
Whether you're curious about...

369
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:04,001
any of...

370
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,341
the male participants as a date.

371
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:12,241
It's unlikely you like someone 100 percent out of the 4 of us here.

372
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,751
But I think they each weigh slightly differently in you.

373
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,781
Whether it's just 1 or 2 percent difference.

374
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,590
I'm curious about that from where I stand.

375
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,120
Because I'm interested in you.

376
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:26,661
(Because I'm interested in you.)

377
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:29,961
I wanted to check out her feelings...

378
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:33,531
and figure out my actions based on that.

379
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:35,501
So I wanted to know what she was thinking.

380
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,671
(Their first meeting)

381
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,341
(Actually, Hyun Jin...)

382
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,871
Thank you.

383
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:47,581
(He willingly handed over his jacket to Da Hye on the first day.)

384
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:49,251
- I'll...
- Yes.

385
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,121
Oh, no. Are you hurt?

386
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:57,191
(When Hyun Jin got hurt while cooking...)

387
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:58,461
Hold on.

388
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:01,620
It's okay. I have a bandage too.

389
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:07,701
(To Da Hye who were shocked and worried for him...)

390
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:10,301
- Gosh. Are you a nurse?
- Here.

391
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,171
I only have one.

392
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,400
Just a bandage is enough.

393
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:15,101
No, apply the ointment too.

394
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:17,740
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

395
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:20,680
(He's always had feelings for her.)

396
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:24,251
She is very attentive and considerate.

397
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,821
She takes good care of others.

398
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:29,721
I was grateful.

399
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,520
That moment...

400
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:32,960
(Hyun Jin's feelings for Da Hye grew when she showed him kindness.)

401
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,361
was our biggest interaction.

402
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,131
Da Hye, would you like some coffee?

403
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:40,761
I'd love that.

404
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:42,530
- You have coffee?
- Yes.

405
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:43,930
- I made you one.
- Thank you so much.

406
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:45,970
I said I would yesterday but didn't.

407
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:47,070
Thanks a lot.

408
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,271
(His coffee signal that he promised with his lovebud headed to Da Hye.)

409
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,641
- You...
- I confidently said...

410
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:56,110
that I was interested in two people.

411
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:57,810
I told her that when Su Jin asked me.

412
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:59,451
Am I one of those two?

413
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,721
You're asking me that straight up like that?

414
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:05,291
Was I that easy to read?

415
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,921
(Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?)

416
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:09,891
(Day 1)

417
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:14,001
(Day 3)

418
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:15,701
Actually, I was hoping...

419
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,541
that Da Hye would ask me out on a date.

420
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,371
And she did.

421
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:25,181
"Great. Let's have a nice talk with her on the date."

422
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:26,841
That's what I thought.

423
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:30,781
One thing I can tell you is,

424
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,921
there's someone near zero percent.

425
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,580
That person might have zero interest in me too.

426
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,251
- I don't care.
- I'm getting very curious.

427
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,450
That zero percent isn't me, is it?

428
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:40,120
- Not you.
- If it were me,

429
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:42,991
- we wouldn't be talking here.
- Exactly.

430
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,731
The rest is 33.33 percent each.

431
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:49,170
He looks so happy.

432
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,271
- Now, he's smiling.
- Yes, he is.

433
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:53,501
Now, he's smiling. He's so happy.

434
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:56,241
Let's have a great day today.

435
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:58,640
Can you?

436
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,840
Yes. The beginning is important.

437
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,851
- Yes.
- So...

438
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:08,650
I prefer the weather cool than hot.

439
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:10,020
Yes. I think it'll taste good.

440
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:13,661
I've wanted to try baby potato salad.

441
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:17,460
And we're going to have perilla oil pasta.

442
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:19,361
(It must be delicious.)

443
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:22,801
- We must try them.
- Whatever it is...

444
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:25,541
I've never seen you turn down food.

445
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,371
Exactly.

446
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:29,741
It's fine.

447
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:32,411
I like people who eat well.

448
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:37,950
I also like people who eat well.

449
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,950
- When they don't eat...
- Am I eating too little?

450
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:42,451
Based on my standard, you don't eat a lot.

451
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:43,721
To be honest.

452
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:46,260
It's not because we're filming.

453
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,791
You just don't eat much, right?

454
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,261
- No, I eat a lot.
- Not that you eat very little.

455
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,700
But since I'm a bit nervous,

456
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,771
I'm worried about getting indigestion...

457
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,671
- Yes.
- and so on.

458
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,071
My gosh.

459
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:07,211
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

460
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:09,781
- Enjoy the food. Let's eat.
- Enjoy the food.

461
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:18,661
(Da Hye tries the baby potato salad that she's been wanting to try.)

462
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:22,531
- Yes, eat up.
- It's tasty.

463
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:24,291
It's so delicious.

464
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,741
It's tasty. I like the combination.

465
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:41,241
This is good too.

466
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:54,391
(Da Hye must've been hungry. She eats so well.)

467
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,291
The way...

468
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,631
you become happy...

469
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,900
- I love food so much.
- when you eat.

470
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:05,231
When you become happy,

471
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,811
I find that side of you...

472
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,041
- cute and bright.
- I...

473
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:16,081
- He likes everything about her.
- My goodness.

474
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,980
- He likes it.
- He is in love.

475
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,750
- I see.
- He must like it.

476
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:25,520
(He builds a cushion wall thinking of Geon Wu.)

477
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:26,691
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:29,890
I'm sorry, but let me keep this wall up for a while.

479
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,330
They should date once at least.

480
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:32,331
Should they?

481
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:33,730
- I see.
- Of all the times I've seen him,

482
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:35,030
- He looks the happiest, doesn't he?
- he looks like...

483
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:36,370
- he has the most interest.
- Yes.

484
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:37,800
I guess you can't hide it.

485
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,371
You can never hide it.

486
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:41,170
His eyes are shooting hearts.

487
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,071
I agree. His eyes are dripping honey.

488
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,981
You'll get hungry fast because it's salad.

489
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:49,551
- Right.
- So eat lots.

490
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,831
(The wind chooses to blow strongly at that moment.)

491
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,561
Are you okay?

492
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,501
- Thankfully, I'm almost done.
- Really?

493
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:16,541
- Aren't I eating well?
- You're eating so well.

494
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:20,841
The wind kept ruffling my hair,

495
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,181
so I was focused on it.

496
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,551
My hair.

497
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,690
- I think we should go back.
- Shall we?

498
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:33,521
- Let's go, then.
- The wind is too strong.

499
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,860
- This is the problem.
- My gosh.

500
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:39,131
Why does Hyun Jin always have poor timing?

501
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:42,101
What's wrong with the timing?

502
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:44,070
The weather was so nice.

503
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:46,601
Yes. The weather was fine on the others' dates.

504
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:51,370
I said during the interview...

505
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:53,281
- that the Final Pick was important.
- Yes.

506
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:55,951
Wouldn't everyone agree?

507
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:00,881
She's drowsy...

508
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:02,890
- after eating.
- How cute.

509
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:04,120
She's so cute.

510
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,561
- What should I do with her?
- She's drowsy after eating.

511
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:17,130
What is it?

512
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:18,971
- Are you okay? You're tired.
- How did you know?

513
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:21,540
I can see that your soul has left you.

514
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,010
What should I say?

515
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:24,570
I had a great meal.

516
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:25,711
And...

517
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,181
What?

518
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:29,751
You talking to me woke me up.

519
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:34,051
(Battling blood sugar spike)

520
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:42,631
(He finds her adorable.)

521
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:45,901
We should've brought some water.

522
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:50,830
It's things like this...

523
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,940
- that I find you quirky.
- Drinking water...

524
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,740
- might help me wake up.
- You're right.

525
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:55,941
You're right, but...

526
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,271
Should I say you're unique?

527
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,640
I should drink water.

528
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:02,411
I should've brought some.

529
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,081
Exactly.

530
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:07,520
(Drowsy eyes)

531
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:09,451
Do I look sleepy?

532
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:10,821
A bit?

533
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:13,890
Close your eyes.

534
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:15,361
- I'll close them for one minute.
- Five minutes.

535
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:18,430
- No, one minute is fine.
- Five minutes.

536
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:20,160
I'll feel bad.

537
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,330
- You're in the car now...
- I'm wide awake now.

538
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:22,631
It's fine.

539
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,070
You can't help that you feel sleepy.

540
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:26,271
It's okay to feel sleepy.

541
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:27,940
Still.

542
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:29,240
As soon as we arrive...

543
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,310
Be quiet.

544
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:31,311
(Be quiet!)

545
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:36,981
He paid attention to how sleepy I felt.

546
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:40,520
He is very considerate.

547
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:43,490
I was really grateful, and it's such a good trait.

548
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:45,021
That's what I thought.

549
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:47,991
Maybe...

550
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:51,391
we could develop our relationship into something better.

551
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:55,501
My heart fluttered at that thought.

552
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:58,230
Who do you think...

553
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:00,541
suits Da Hye more, Geon Wu or Hyun Jin?

554
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,511
They're even to me.

555
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,641
- That's what I think.
- Really?

556
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:08,340
Since Da Hye likes to be looked after,

557
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:10,880
If I were her, I think I would be more satisfied...

558
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:12,480
- with this date.
- Right.

559
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:13,950
- With Hyun Jin, - Right?

560
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:15,991
- Da Hye looks more at ease.
- She looks the most comfortable.

561
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:17,621
I'm sorry, Sae Ho.

562
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:19,120
- It's okay.
- Will you unfold your arms?

563
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,290
- I feel cold.
- Excuse me.

564
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,820
- Please.
- Excuse me,

565
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,490
- you're blocking the camera.
- Just a moment.

566
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:25,560
- Let's see you in the near future.
- Please don't block the camera.

567
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:27,060
- I'd like to treat you to a meal.
- Let's have a meal together.

568
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:28,761
Your behind is so close to me.

569
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,071
- It's so nice.
- I'm sorry.

570
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,831
I'm sorry, Nam Hee. I guess...

571
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,401
- you won't know until it's over.
- Of course.

572
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:36,270
(Geon Wu's lovebud, Sae Ho, has a lot on his mind.)

573
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:37,541
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

574
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:40,510
(The night at Lovebud House after the dates)

575
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:41,541
Hey.

576
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:43,911
You're back early, Dong Ha.

577
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:46,580
When did you come back?

578
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:48,380
About 30 minutes ago?

579
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:49,551
I see.

580
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:55,730
Are you the only one back, Dong Ha?

581
00:26:55,731 --> 00:26:57,591
- You and Ji Eun?
- I think so.

582
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:00,130
Ji Eun should be sleeping.

583
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:01,361
- Is that so?
- Yes.

584
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,631
She must've had so much fun to be sleeping already.

585
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:08,301
That's funny.

586
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:14,981
Jeong Geun must have a lot going on in his head right now.

587
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,311
If she's gone to sleep as soon as she came back because she's tired...

588
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:28,821
(Ji Eun decides to take a short rest.)

589
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,931
- Someone is there.
- Who?

590
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:39,640
- Who?
- I think it's Dong Ha.

591
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:40,801
Why are you alone?

592
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:42,770
You guys arrived last.

593
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:43,771
- Exactly.
- Did we?

594
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:45,071
I figured it out from looking at the garage.

595
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:46,841
Did you have fun?

596
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:49,681
You look tired. What did you do?

597
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:51,751
- A lot of things.
- A lot of things?

598
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,450
Su Jin is a bit wary of his date.

599
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:55,651
She asked if he had fun.

600
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:58,050
What did you do?

601
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,220
- Us?
- Yes.

602
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,021
What did you do that you came back so late?

603
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:03,360
I thought I did a lot of things.

604
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:04,661
We even had a drink.

605
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:06,730
We drank and called a driver to come back.

606
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:08,101
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

607
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:09,270
Where?

608
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,430
A grilled clam restaurant.

609
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:11,731
I see. You went to eat grilled clam.

610
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:13,441
- I'm sorry I can't eat seafood.
- We finished two bottles of soju.

611
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,011
- You're kidding. Seriously?
- Yes.

612
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:23,851
(How do they feel after dating other people today?)

613
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:26,751
- What did you have for dinner?
- Hey.

614
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:28,251
What did you have for dinner?

615
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:29,451
We had meat.

616
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,760
We had pork belly, pork shoulder, and pork jowl.

617
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:34,461
It was too far for us.

618
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,160
Dong Ha. Did you have drinks too?

619
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:38,491
I had a lot.

620
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:40,331
That's why Ji Eun passed out.

621
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,001
Is Ji Eun asleep?

622
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:44,971
How was your date?

623
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:46,771
- We went to a cafe too.
- Right.

624
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:55,141
Dong Ha. Where did you go?

625
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:56,850
To a grilled clam restaurant first,

626
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,610
and there was a cafe within walking distance,

627
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,851
so we stopped by...

628
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:01,720
to catch a breather.

629
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:03,751
We were supposed to come back after that.

630
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:06,461
But she wanted to walk.

631
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:08,790
You know the midpoint of our running course?

632
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:10,791
- That's where the cafe was.
- I see. You guys went there.

633
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:24,740
Jeong Geun is extremely focused.

634
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:26,981
(Another person who has lost his smile.)

635
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,311
- I'll have this fruit.
- Let's get some sugar.

636
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,480
It's sugar time.

637
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:32,580
(Da Hye, Su Jin, and Sin Young gather to recharge with sugar.)

638
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:33,621
Nice.

639
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:37,651
- We had fun today.
- Yes.

640
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:40,061
- This would be good if it's on top.
- What is it?

641
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:43,130
- The granola.
- Yes. It looks tasty.

642
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,361
- If you sprinkle it...
- I got us some.

643
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:45,830
- Here.
- My gosh.

644
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:47,831
- You sure are a food expert.
- "A food expert?" Here you go.

645
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:49,330
You sure know it well.

646
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:51,201
- In case you don't eat it.
- I don't.

647
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:53,640
Who wants ice cream?

648
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:54,870
Who wants watermelon?

649
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:56,111
- Watermelon?
- I like watermelon.

650
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:57,671
- I'll cut it for you.
- Watermelon.

651
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,581
- Are you making watermelon punch?
- Yes.

652
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:01,580
- This...
- Can I have this slice?

653
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:02,581
Sure.

654
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:05,111
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

655
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:10,320
(Meanwhile, Ji Eun, who was resting, joins them in the common area.)

656
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:12,021
- Ji Eun, are you okay?
- This here...

657
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,260
Have you recharged?

658
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:15,360
Would you like some watermelon?

659
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:16,491
Get some sugar.

660
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:20,000
- Get some sugar.
- Bring chopsticks.

661
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,101
Okay.

662
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,670
Is that it?

663
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:26,041
I didn't draw anything.

664
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,770
- You don't eat conch too?
- Here.

665
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,071
Have some watermelon.

666
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:30,471
- Did you cut a watermelon?
- Yes.

667
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,751
I can't eat that either.

668
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:38,950
- Over there should have...
- Yes?

669
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:40,681
Forks and knives.

670
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,480
- The bracelet.
- Oh, no. The bracelet.

671
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:43,721
- The bracelet.
- Oh, no.

672
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,221
(Staring)

673
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:52,531
(Ji Eun's wrist is empty.)

674
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:56,731
The bracelet was gone.

675
00:30:58,131 --> 00:30:59,171
Yes.

676
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:02,000
When she came back, she wasn't wearing her bracelet.

677
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:04,611
Before the date, she said...

678
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,640
that she had some kind of reason...

679
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:10,011
and put the bracelet back on.

680
00:31:12,511 --> 00:31:13,951
But it was gone when she came back.

681
00:31:23,961 --> 00:31:25,331
- The intestines?
- I eat it without them.

682
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:26,801
So...

683
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:33,801
- Shall we bring some more?
- Yes.

684
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:37,271
Thanks.

685
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:39,511
Hyun Jin is the only one absent.

686
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,580
You're right.

687
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:42,811
Was he here?

688
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:43,981
What are you doing?

689
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:45,551
Did you sleep until now?

690
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:48,921
Over there.

691
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:50,151
Are you all right?

692
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:52,121
Are you all right?

693
00:31:56,991 --> 00:31:58,061
You're trying.

694
00:31:58,731 --> 00:31:59,801
I don't know anymore.

695
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:02,161
I see it was your head.

696
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:03,331
Are you all right?

697
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:16,111
That made me feel so annoyed.

698
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:18,611
In my mind, I felt...

699
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:23,321
Are you all right?

700
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:25,451
I see it was your head.

701
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:26,761
Are you all right?

702
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:31,690
"What's happening?"

703
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:32,900
"What just happened?"

704
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:35,261
"There's something between the two."

705
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:37,770
How could you, Dong Ha?

706
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:40,400
- Dong Ha is playing hard to get.
- My goodness.

707
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,640
How many people is Dong Ha stirring up?

708
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:44,140
What will you do with Su Jin?

709
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:46,180
- Exactly. I'm getting a bit pissed.
- Now...

710
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:47,580
This is a total mess.

711
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,411
- It's like a jungle.
- Dong Ha. Oh, no.

712
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:55,280
- Did you enjoy your date?
- Yes.

713
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:56,691
I heard you came back and took a nap.

714
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:59,391
- Right.
- That was the only place, right?

715
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,261
Did you take any medicine?

716
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:07,261
Will it be okay for me to take medication after drinking?

717
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:08,831
What kind of medicine?

718
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,571
Do you have an upset stomach?

719
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:12,500
- Well...
- She said she had a slight cold.

720
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:14,470
It should be fine. You should take some medicine.

721
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:15,671
- Really?
- Yes.

722
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:22,511
It's on the second floor.

723
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,150
Didn't you have it yesterday? Hold on.

724
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:25,681
Do we have any emergency remedy?

725
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:28,480
- I got it out of my bag.
- I'll bring it down.

726
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:30,320
- It's on the second floor.
- I'll get it.

727
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,791
- She caught a cold?
- Yes.

728
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:43,401
- Everyone is exhausted.
- Why?

729
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:44,831
It's getting quieter.

730
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:50,111
I felt really annoyed,

731
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:54,041
but when I heard that she felt sick,

732
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:57,151
it made me feel upset.

733
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:00,081
- That was it.
- Right.

734
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,031
What was that?

735
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:17,830
Did he come out to get some fresh air?

736
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:19,300
- Right.
- He's feeling a mix of emotions.

737
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:20,871
(Jeong Geun stepped outside by himself.)

738
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,630
(While Jeong Geon went outside, )

739
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:48,101
(Ji Eun took the medicine that was in the house.)

740
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:13,661
(Where has Jeong Geun gone to by himself?)

741
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:23,170
I did hear that there were emergency remedies...

742
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:25,001
in the first-aid kit,

743
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,440
but I thought that it would be better for her...

744
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,571
to take an actual cold medicine.

745
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:33,511
I hurried out to buy that.

746
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:00,700
- Gosh!
- That was insane!

747
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,101
That was impressive.

748
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:04,540
It seemed like he was holding a grudge, but...

749
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,071
- That was insane from Jeong Geun.
- Right.

750
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,080
Is it okay if a guy binds you down...

751
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:10,380
but takes care of you until the end?

752
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:11,480
- That would be great!
- That would be great!

753
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:12,880
That's better than the guy being indifferent?

754
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,850
- Yes. That would be great.
- Ye Eun is going wild right now.

755
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:15,881
It's making my heart flutter.

756
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:18,650
The guy gets upset even with a small mistake.

757
00:36:18,651 --> 00:36:20,790
- That's totally fine.
- Fix Ye Eun's hair.

758
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,160
She must have shaken it hard.

759
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:25,131
The most important detail is how he will hand the medicine to her.

760
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:28,200
Oh, gosh! Isn't he going to hang it on the doorknob?

761
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,701
- My gosh!
- The doorknob or just in the front.

762
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:32,800
(Meanwhile, they start playing the Game of Truth.)

763
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:33,971
Ask me a question.

764
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:38,411
"I prefer cash over gifts."

765
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:40,441
No. I like gifts more.

766
00:36:50,651 --> 00:36:52,191
I want to give it a try too.

767
00:36:52,821 --> 00:36:54,161
- All right.
- "Out of..."

768
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:58,291
"all of the male participants in the Lovebud House,"

769
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:01,061
"I do not think I am in last place with my looks."

770
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,171
Yes.

771
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:08,471
But shouldn't that be done later? Isn't that more accurate?

772
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,340
- Gosh. Why is this so scary?
- It's scary.

773
00:37:12,341 --> 00:37:13,510
I'm scared that it might hurt.

774
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:15,440
- Get over here, Ji Eun.
- This is driving me crazy.

775
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,780
- We're playing too?
- What do I do?

776
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:18,151
Just go with a light one.

777
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:20,181
- "As..." - Right.

778
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:24,450
- "a producer." - As a producer?

779
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,991
"As a producer, I think that I'm on the pretty side."

780
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,191
Yes!

781
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:33,000
She's playing the Game of Truth without even knowing about...

782
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,131
Jeong Geun going outside to get her medicine.

783
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,270
- She is definitely...
- Gosh.

784
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:40,240
Her face was like, "You saw me, right?"

785
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:42,741
"I am a child of a rich family."

786
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:46,411
Hurry up and give an answer!

787
00:37:46,412 --> 00:37:48,681
- Yes! I am!
- Gosh.

788
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:50,111
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

789
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:54,020
(Hyun Jin being from a wealthy family turns out to be true.)

790
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,421
It turned out to be true.

791
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:57,591
How could you be like that?

792
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,760
I'm slightly worried about this. Will Jeong Geun return...

793
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:03,331
with the medicine while they're doing that?

794
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:05,130
- Bring it up.
- It won't be that strong.

795
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:08,661
"I am willing to give 3 free sessions."

796
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:10,270
No.

797
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:11,631
(The Lovebud House is filled with an exciting atmosphere.)

798
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:13,501
It would be funny it turns out to be false, too.

799
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:17,940
- But that's...
- Hold on.

800
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:20,980
- He's willing to do that then!
- Right.

801
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:23,910
(Jeong Geun returns...)

802
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:26,151
(but heads straight back out.)

803
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:33,361
That's important.

804
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,211
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

805
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:53,511
He isn't able to control his emotions.

806
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:25,041
I wrote just four words on that note.

807
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,781
"Please, don't be sick."

808
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:44,430
(Jeong Geun returns to the common area...)

809
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:47,831
(after getting everything prepared.)

810
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:56,870
Why were you so surprised?

811
00:39:56,871 --> 00:39:59,241
- I got so surprised.
- It wasn't that strong.

812
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:00,440
Really?

813
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,711
- It wasn't that strong?
- It felt a bit...

814
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:09,621
You should have it now.

815
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:28,871
(The atmosphere freezes up because of Jeong Geun's action.)

816
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:31,841
It really startled me.

817
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,951
I wondered if someone had happened while I was missing.

818
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:38,711
I got flustered.

819
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:47,420
The way he gave her the medicine was too loud.

820
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:48,521
It surprised me.

821
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:52,461
Everyone seemed to feel shocked, and they were reading the room.

822
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:56,600
Hasn't he just gone to buy the medicine?

823
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:58,200
- Right.
- Right. I think so.

824
00:40:58,201 --> 00:41:00,670
What got him to be this mad?

825
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,500
- Why is he being like that?
- Why?

826
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,941
He could've given it in a nicer way.

827
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:15,581
(How did it feel when Jeong Geun gave you the medicine?)

828
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:18,250
I found it difficult.

829
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:21,691
(I found it difficult.)

830
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,611
A witness?

831
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:44,681
That was how it was.

832
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:51,091
(Come on, Jeong Geun.)

833
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:53,720
It was hard for him to give it in a nice way in that situation.

834
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,360
How can Jeong Geun be nice in that situation?

835
00:41:55,361 --> 00:41:56,420
All he could do...

836
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:57,860
- was place it on the table.
- I understand, but...

837
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:01,460
I didn't really understand that situation.

838
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:02,930
He bought the medicine...

839
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:05,331
after making the effort to go all the way there.

840
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:06,770
Why did he just leave...

841
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:08,171
without saying a single word after passing the medicine?

842
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:10,410
- There was the letter for that.
- He said he felt annoyed.

843
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:12,271
- He said that.
- Right.

844
00:42:12,371 --> 00:42:14,510
Then what would've been the right way to pass the medicine?

845
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:16,950
He brought the medicine. After that...

846
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,411
"Take the medicine I got for you." He should've said this.

847
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:20,420
It should've been given to her quietly...

848
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:22,150
and they should've talked separately somewhere else.

849
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:24,691
It wasn't right to do that in front of the others...

850
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,090
who don't know about their relationship.

851
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:29,821
He showed too much of his feelings in front of the others.

852
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:31,960
If I were in that situation,

853
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:33,960
I would've said, "Come out, Shin Dong Ha!"

854
00:42:33,961 --> 00:42:35,460
"Come to the rooftop."

855
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:37,371
- As expected.
- I would've said that.

856
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:39,500
I would've wanted to have a serious conversation.

857
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:40,970
- That could be one method.
- Right.

858
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:42,641
(It's a relief that Jeong Geon isn't Gwan Hee.)

859
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:44,010
This is what I really liked.

860
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:46,140
He gave it to her in front of all of the others.

861
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:47,480
- I found that to be impressive.
- "Bring it on."

862
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,080
I like it when the guy expresses himself like that.

863
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:50,280
Expressing his feelings in front of the whole world.

864
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:52,150
- I like that too.
- Me, too.

865
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:53,250
- Letting the whole world know.
- I like that too.

866
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,081
Right? With a megaphone.

867
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:56,320
Isn't the most important part...

868
00:42:56,321 --> 00:42:58,051
- starting now?
- Right.

869
00:42:58,291 --> 00:42:59,790
- I'm dying to watch it.
- Come on!

870
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,260
He just left.

871
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:02,960
If this doesn't get solved between the two,

872
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:04,391
- things will...
- Yes.

873
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,130
- really become complicated.
- Right.

874
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:09,330
You know how tangled cables eventually snap?

875
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:10,701
I'm rooting for you, Jeong Geun.

876
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:28,520
You're not wearing it at all.

877
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:30,421
(You're not wearing the bracelet at all.)

878
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:34,121
I was wearing it at first,

879
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:37,661
but I didn't think it was polite to have it on.

880
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:39,191
- Polite?
- What?

881
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:41,500
- He was my date, - Right.

882
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:42,961
So I took it off during the date.

883
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,211
Okay.

884
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:54,811
- Well...
- Right.

885
00:43:58,051 --> 00:43:59,781
I was really surprised in the morning.

886
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:03,221
I didn't see your bracelet when we were eating breakfast.

887
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:08,920
I did the interview with the bracelet on.

888
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:10,131
Is that okay?

889
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,290
I don't know.

890
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:13,161
- I wasn't aware of that at all.
- Right.

891
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:16,331
What you said...

892
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:21,901
sounded like an excuse at that moment.

893
00:44:27,811 --> 00:44:29,541
Can I be honest?

894
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:31,511
But...

895
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:34,221
That also made me...

896
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:39,691
You went out on a date with Dong Ha, who I felt uncomfortable with.

897
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:44,830
You came back from the date...

898
00:44:44,831 --> 00:44:46,561
and the bracelet was completely missing.

899
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:49,861
That kept...

900
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:52,431
bothering me.

901
00:44:52,701 --> 00:44:54,941
I don't know. Overall,

902
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,341
everything felt complicated to me throughout this whole day.

903
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,781
I still carried it around with me...

904
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:06,551
even though I took it off.

905
00:45:08,381 --> 00:45:09,421
I have it with me.

906
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:11,651
Pass it to me.

907
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:20,560
You won't be putting it on now, right?

908
00:45:20,561 --> 00:45:21,701
I'll keep it.

909
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,271
- But honestly...
- Yes.

910
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:30,470
I understand that you express your feelings well.

911
00:45:30,471 --> 00:45:31,871
- Right.
- But...

912
00:45:32,871 --> 00:45:34,281
How should I put it?

913
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:39,451
- When everyone is together, - Right.

914
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:41,520
I feel a bit uncomfortable...

915
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:42,751
when you do that.

916
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:51,630
(Jeong Geun expressed his feelings in front of everyone.)

917
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:54,261
You kept saying that...

918
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:56,261
- you wanted to cook with me.
- Right.

919
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:58,771
When it's just the two of us together,

920
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,871
I can be more expressive.

921
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:04,840
(Ji Eun felt slightly uncomfortable...)

922
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:07,141
(when Jeong Geun expressed his feelings in front of the others.)

923
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:08,741
He could've just...

924
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:10,411
called me out separately...

925
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,251
and passed it to me.

926
00:46:13,011 --> 00:46:16,721
That wouldn't have been burdensome at all.

927
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:22,091
I wanted to sink through the floor.

928
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,630
I'm really struggling with this situation, to be honest.

929
00:46:28,631 --> 00:46:30,231
Of course, it must be hard for you as well.

930
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:31,901
I'm finding it to be tough.

931
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:44,980
I can't believe it. What is going on with them?

932
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:46,150
- My heart is racing.
- I know.

933
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:47,881
He's really into her.

934
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:50,190
- But...
- There is no way that is an act.

935
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:52,150
I think that was a sign of giving up.

936
00:46:52,151 --> 00:46:54,191
- That was what that smile meant.
- But when we...

937
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:57,991
- Oh, no.
- I know.

938
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:00,330
It seemed obvious that those two would be together.

939
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:02,101
Did that make them feel more pressure?

940
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:05,101
- Right.
- I think...

941
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:07,471
Isn't that obvious?

942
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:10,741
Should we talk on the second floor instead?

943
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:11,871
Why?

944
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:14,580
I think I'll regret it so much if our conversation ends...

945
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,081
if someone comes in.

946
00:47:16,581 --> 00:47:19,311
Wouldn't it be right to take some time to talk about this?

947
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,851
That's my opinion.

948
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:30,661
(The two move to a different place to have a longer conversation.)

949
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:42,470
You're saying that everything in this area...

950
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:44,011
- feels tough for you.
- Right. It's really tough.

951
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:46,341
But I feel like...

952
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:49,810
If it was because of me, I think I will feel extremely sorry.

953
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:51,281
- No.
- Seriously.

954
00:47:51,511 --> 00:47:53,350
I feel bad for saying that.

955
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:54,481
So...

956
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:57,351
It made me think that I put pressure...

957
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,491
on someone who could've felt comfortable without me.

958
00:48:02,821 --> 00:48:04,061
From now on,

959
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:08,931
I wish for you to use the time that's left here...

960
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:11,671
to recover.

961
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:15,271
I'll try not to make you feel any pressure from now on.

962
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,071
Wouldn't it be better for you...

963
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,281
to spend the time left here in peace?

964
00:48:25,911 --> 00:48:29,081
I'm not sure. I think that is the last thing I can say to you.

965
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:31,091
Right.

966
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:45,501
Is he crying?

967
00:48:58,711 --> 00:49:02,981
There was nothing else that I could do.

968
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:13,461
I'll go.

969
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:15,801
Staying here is making me feel pathetic.

970
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:19,571
Anyway,

971
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:25,111
don't push yourself too much tonight.

972
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:27,611
Don't catch a cold, seriously.

973
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:30,481
I'll go.

974
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:35,621
(Like that, Jeong Geun left.)

975
00:50:10,851 --> 00:50:12,991
Does it have to be this hard?

976
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:18,931
It's overwhelming.

977
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:23,060
The speed of love...

978
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,431
(It's hard for two people to match their speed of love.)

979
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:25,830
Did he cry?

980
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:28,370
Because everything was so sincere,

981
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:30,441
he was sad saying those things.

982
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,940
If he cried,

983
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:36,180
it could be because he felt so emotionally overwhelmed.

984
00:50:36,181 --> 00:50:38,150
I think he's leaving because he felt that he might cry...

985
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:39,411
- if he stayed any longer.
- Right.

986
00:50:40,681 --> 00:50:43,180
We can't say the conversation went well, right?

987
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:44,990
Because only Jeong Geun spoke.

988
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:47,860
I believe Jeong Geun left after he did everything he could.

989
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:50,290
I do think he expressed his sincerity.

990
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,330
Right.

991
00:50:51,331 --> 00:50:52,360
(Did Jeong Geun's sincerity reach Ji Eun?)

992
00:50:52,361 --> 00:50:53,691
Only if you have time, I mean.

993
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:55,131
What do you mean?

994
00:50:55,631 --> 00:50:57,031
Oh, T.

995
00:50:57,931 --> 00:51:02,241
That's why Jeong Geun asked me whether I was the T type.

996
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:06,841
I thought they were together,

997
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:08,311
morning and evening.

998
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:11,350
Oh, gosh.

999
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:12,451
Let's go have a drink.

1000
00:51:12,581 --> 00:51:13,821
Oh, okay. Go.

1001
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:16,120
(Dong Ha asked only Su Jin to join him outside.)

1002
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:17,291
See you later.

1003
00:51:18,421 --> 00:51:20,051
- Is this drink okay?
- Yes, I like this one.

1004
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:33,531
It's so pretty.

1005
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:35,100
It's pretty nice.

1006
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:39,171
(What does Dong Ha want to talk to Su Jin about?)

1007
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:41,681
- You don't think it'll rain, - No.

1008
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:42,911
Do you?

1009
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:48,851
I'm so curious about what he'll say.

1010
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:52,550
(Down the gently-lit path)

1011
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:53,721
Oh, it's so pretty.

1012
00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:55,290
It's not raining.

1013
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,361
You're right, it's not.

1014
00:51:57,391 --> 00:51:58,391
It's nice.

1015
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:02,861
He has to be planning to confess to her, seriously.

1016
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:05,201
It's so pretty.

1017
00:52:05,671 --> 00:52:08,071
What is this? It's so nice. It's so pretty.

1018
00:52:12,271 --> 00:52:14,381
- Oh, was that a mosquito?
- What is it?

1019
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:16,380
(Quickly sitting up)

1020
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:19,651
Something black came here, so I hit it.

1021
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:25,621
- Is it gone?
- Yes.

1022
00:52:25,821 --> 00:52:26,821
Cheers.

1023
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:28,421
This place is nice.

1024
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:32,831
How was your day today?

1025
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:35,301
- Me?
- Yes.

1026
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:40,001
- We went to a book cafe.
- Right.

1027
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:42,541
I like reading books,

1028
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,541
so we talked about books here.

1029
00:52:44,711 --> 00:52:47,281
I learned Geon Wu liked traveling too.

1030
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:48,841
- Who?
- Geon Wu.

1031
00:52:49,111 --> 00:52:52,651
Geon Wu said he also liked Paris.

1032
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:54,221
So, again...

1033
00:52:56,081 --> 00:52:57,491
Paris must have something to it.

1034
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:59,490
Thinking about Geon Wu makes me laugh.

1035
00:52:59,491 --> 00:53:01,521
- Why?
- What? Because he's cute.

1036
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:02,561
Because he's cute?

1037
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:04,591
How was it?

1038
00:53:04,861 --> 00:53:06,091
- Me?
- Back to you. Yes.

1039
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:10,201
- I became confused.
- Why?

1040
00:53:11,431 --> 00:53:15,971
(Why did Dong Ha become confused?)

1041
00:53:18,011 --> 00:53:19,911
- I became confused.
- Why?

1042
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:26,581
I just...

1043
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:30,081
I just felt that I may have gotten too nosy.

1044
00:53:30,891 --> 00:53:34,260
I've barely talked to Ji Eun.

1045
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:35,691
- Right.
- It was my first time today.

1046
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:38,160
- I didn't...
- You didn't have time...

1047
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:40,161
- to talk to her.
- Right. So we talked.

1048
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:44,271
The conversation...

1049
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:47,801
- Yes.
- How do I put it?

1050
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:02,351
I don't remember how this came up,

1051
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:06,220
but I guess Jeong Geun gave her a bracelet on their date.

1052
00:54:06,221 --> 00:54:07,521
- Right.
- He gave her a bracelet,

1053
00:54:08,061 --> 00:54:11,530
and she said she wasn't sure if it was right to keep wearing it.

1054
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:15,560
So I told her that it'd be good...

1055
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:18,101
to focus on how she feels.

1056
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:20,971
I'm being too nosy, but I keep giving advice...

1057
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:23,671
- But...
- Yes.

1058
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:25,840
You were worried about her, in a way.

1059
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:27,011
- That is true.
- Of course.

1060
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:30,751
- Maybe I shouldn't have said so.
- No.

1061
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:34,320
Let's just think of it as your concern for her.

1062
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:35,351
(Su Jin tries to cheer Dong Ha up.)

1063
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:40,090
We talked about many things.

1064
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:42,961
It felt like I was getting to know Ji Eun...

1065
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:46,261
as a person.

1066
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:48,860
- That's how it felt like.
- I see.

1067
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:51,701
I don't think there was any romantic feeling today.

1068
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:54,570
I think Ji Eun felt the same. So we could drink comfortably.

1069
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,001
- Really?
- Yes, we drank comfortably.

1070
00:54:58,341 --> 00:55:01,440
So I don't think Ji Eun and I...

1071
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:02,811
- need any more dates.
- Really?

1072
00:55:07,881 --> 00:55:09,921
I only need my remaining dates to be with you.

1073
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,221
- Really?
- Yes.

1074
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:18,991
It felt different from yesterday. It was so nice.

1075
00:55:19,161 --> 00:55:23,030
He honestly said he wanted to go on dates with me,

1076
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:26,701
and those words really hit me.

1077
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:30,070
That frankness really got me.

1078
00:55:30,071 --> 00:55:31,211
(Dong Ha's frank charm melted Su Jin's heart.)

1079
00:55:35,741 --> 00:55:36,911
So for today's vote,

1080
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:39,981
I didn't care about being polite to my date.

1081
00:55:41,481 --> 00:55:42,950
He's being really honest now.

1082
00:55:42,951 --> 00:55:43,981
(Smiling happily)

1083
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:45,891
"She didn't knock on the door of my heart."

1084
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:48,090
Am I being too arrogant?

1085
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:49,320
Am I being too arrogant? Is this making me unlikable?

1086
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:50,521
No.

1087
00:55:51,491 --> 00:55:52,890
- You're being honest.
- Right.

1088
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:53,961
(Dong Ha is going straight for Su Jin.)

1089
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:00,031
I got assurance on that.

1090
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:02,341
I could be smooth...

1091
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:06,110
and say, "Really? I like you too."

1092
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:07,981
But I'm so bad at things like this.

1093
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,980
I was more indirect about it.

1094
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:12,351
(Expressing affection is still hard for Su Jin, who is new at this.)

1095
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:14,251
"Since you feel that way, me too..."

1096
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:16,320
I said it half-heartedly.

1097
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:18,291
Oh, my goodness.

1098
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,090
Why can't I just say these things right away?

1099
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:22,391
I'm so me.

1100
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:28,861
- About Ji Eun catching a cold...
- Yes.

1101
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:32,131
I hadn't told you how my date went yet.

1102
00:56:32,401 --> 00:56:33,800
I thought you'd misunderstand...

1103
00:56:33,801 --> 00:56:35,740
if I took medicine to her, so on purpose,

1104
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:37,710
- I also...
- I didn't get the medicine myself,

1105
00:56:37,711 --> 00:56:39,011
and I was like, "Get it yourself."

1106
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:44,911
(Ji Eun was feeling unwell after catching a cold.)

1107
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:47,451
On the second floor.

1108
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:50,991
(Getting up)

1109
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:53,821
- Will you go? Hold on.
- I...

1110
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:56,761
I put two pills in my bag.

1111
00:56:57,261 --> 00:56:59,831
(He was heading up the stairs to get the medicine.)

1112
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:02,360
(Suddenly stopping)

1113
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:03,761
He didn't want her to misunderstand.

1114
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:07,130
(He quietly returned to Su Jin's side.)

1115
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:08,740
It's been a while since she drank.

1116
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:10,470
Right. Since she drank coffee,

1117
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:12,011
she must be okay now.

1118
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:18,581
Okay. I see.

1119
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:20,451
I mean...

1120
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:23,350
- I hurried back to my seat.
- Right. Eventually,

1121
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:25,591
Ji Eun went by herself, but I thought,

1122
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:27,961
"Oh, I see."

1123
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,461
I just thought, "I see."

1124
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,060
Anyway, that's that.

1125
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:36,730
Let's have a good time...

1126
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:38,471
for our remaining days here.

1127
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:45,471
I finished it.

1128
00:57:47,341 --> 00:57:48,341
Should we start heading back?

1129
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:49,911
Okay. Let's go.

1130
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:51,551
Let's go in.

1131
00:57:57,621 --> 00:58:00,320
(How much is your level of interest toward Su Jin?)

1132
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:01,461
Well,

1133
00:58:02,821 --> 00:58:04,490
out of 100, 100.

1134
00:58:04,491 --> 00:58:06,431
(It's 100.)

1135
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:10,060
Su Jin is finally beginning her first relationship.

1136
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:12,170
- We congratulate her on that.
- Yes.

1137
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:13,400
She is no longer single.

1138
00:58:13,401 --> 00:58:14,970
They're basically a couple now, right?

1139
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:16,200
- Yes.
- It's basically decided.

1140
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,141
He said, "I only want to go on dates with you."

1141
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,970
Young Kwang, should we...

1142
00:58:19,971 --> 00:58:21,310
(Young Ji asks Dong Ha's Lovebud to shake hands.)

1143
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,410
Thank you.

1144
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:24,141
Wait, Jeong Geun is crying right now.

1145
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:26,581
- Sorry.
- Why did he...

1146
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:29,420
do that to Ji Eun and Jeong Geun's relationship?

1147
00:58:29,421 --> 00:58:30,450
What will Ji Eun do now?

1148
00:58:30,451 --> 00:58:31,850
- Will she be able to go back?
- But everyone,

1149
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:34,120
please watch the videos again from the beginning.

1150
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:35,790
Dong Ha didn't do anything.

1151
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:36,890
Let's hear it out.

1152
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:37,960
- Yes.
- He didn't do anything?

1153
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:39,460
- He didn't do anything.
- He didn't do anything?

1154
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:40,861
He just...

1155
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:44,100
When Ji Eun was talking to him about the bracelet,

1156
00:58:44,101 --> 00:58:45,570
- Right.
- he shouldn't have told her...

1157
00:58:45,571 --> 00:58:46,571
- to take it off.
- No.

1158
00:58:46,571 --> 00:58:47,571
But that...

1159
00:58:47,572 --> 00:58:49,140
Now that I think about it, Dong Ha...

1160
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:51,710
was just talking to the person who chose him.

1161
00:58:51,711 --> 00:58:53,340
He was saying, "If you're worried about that..."

1162
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:55,510
He didn't mean, "I don't want you to wear that in front of me."

1163
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:57,910
He did things to persuade her to take the bracelet off.

1164
00:58:57,911 --> 00:58:59,750
So, with the bracelet...

1165
00:58:59,751 --> 00:59:00,880
Actually, Ji Eun first said,

1166
00:59:00,881 --> 00:59:03,050
"I'm wearing this against my will."

1167
00:59:03,051 --> 00:59:04,651
She brought up the bracelet first.

1168
00:59:05,151 --> 00:59:06,920
He said something along the lines of,

1169
00:59:06,921 --> 00:59:09,160
- "You shouldn't be bound by that." - But actually,

1170
00:59:09,161 --> 00:59:11,390
like Sin Young, I think Dong Ha...

1171
00:59:11,391 --> 00:59:13,260
- was just giving advice.
- You're right.

1172
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:14,930
You're thinking of him too negatively.

1173
00:59:14,931 --> 00:59:16,501
No.

1174
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:18,170
He totally got in the way.

1175
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:19,701
(Dong Ha totally got in the way!)

1176
00:59:19,831 --> 00:59:21,400
- Nam Hee...
- He just wanted...

1177
00:59:21,401 --> 00:59:22,741
- to destroy Jeong Geun.
- Wait, look.

1178
00:59:23,401 --> 00:59:25,540
- He wanted to break Jeong Geun.
- Come on.

1179
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:26,770
Nam Hee, I think this is how it is.

1180
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,141
- In my opinion, - Okay.

1181
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:30,010
When Jeong Geun approached Sin Young,

1182
00:59:30,011 --> 00:59:32,111
their conversation was like this.

1183
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:33,810
- "So I think..." - Exactly.

1184
00:59:33,811 --> 00:59:35,820
- It was like this. Dong Ha...
- Yes.

1185
00:59:35,821 --> 00:59:37,181
Was a bit closer.

1186
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:38,651
Like this.

1187
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:40,890
When did Dong Ha...

1188
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:42,560
- He didn't do that.
- sit that close?

1189
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:44,020
He looks like a player.

1190
00:59:44,021 --> 00:59:45,490
Dong Ha does, to other men.

1191
00:59:45,491 --> 00:59:46,991
Really? He's being a player?

1192
00:59:50,161 --> 00:59:51,371
Leave it there, I'll wash it.

1193
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:52,870
- Oh, this?
- Yes.

1194
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:53,900
(Su Jin and Dong Ha returned from their bamboo forest date.)

1195
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:54,941
These are all empty.

1196
00:59:57,841 --> 00:59:59,810
What is this...

1197
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:01,180
I drank little bits of everything.

1198
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,510
I'm done drinking now.

1199
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:03,611
- Soju?
- Yes.

1200
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:06,610
- We had meat earlier too.
- Did you get started?

1201
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:07,851
Are you going to drink more?

1202
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,151
Are you going to have some fun?

1203
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:11,791
Have a beer with me.

1204
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:13,551
You.

1205
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:14,821
Sounds good.

1206
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,921
Let's go on a date.

1207
01:00:15,961 --> 01:00:16,991
Sounds good.

1208
01:00:17,161 --> 01:00:18,991
Beer? No, I'll have soju.

1209
01:00:19,231 --> 01:00:20,891
Let's have soju, then.

1210
01:00:26,771 --> 01:00:28,771
Oh, my gosh. These two are going to talk?

1211
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:39,851
(What does Dong Ha want to talk to Jeong Geun about?)

1212
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:52,290
You knew that I wanted to go on a date with Ji Eun.

1213
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:53,990
- Yes.
- So you must've been worried.

1214
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:55,900
Ji Eun happened to choose me...

1215
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:56,930
- Yes.
- to be her date.

1216
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:58,500
I was worried, of course.

1217
01:00:58,501 --> 01:01:00,930
Your mind must've been with us all day...

1218
01:01:00,931 --> 01:01:02,771
- instead of on your date.
- Right.

1219
01:01:03,571 --> 01:01:05,441
I was thinking so.

1220
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:06,671
I also wanted...

1221
01:01:07,141 --> 01:01:09,040
to go on a date with Ji Eun,

1222
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,841
and I was relieved that I finally got to.

1223
01:01:11,311 --> 01:01:12,381
I...

1224
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:14,651
had a really fun time.

1225
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,581
It was really fun,

1226
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:17,891
but I...

1227
01:01:19,151 --> 01:01:21,521
didn't feel attracted to her.

1228
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:23,091
So I...

1229
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:27,861
"Ji Eun just felt..."

1230
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:29,960
"like a younger sister to me."

1231
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:32,330
"I didn't feel romantic attraction." He told me.

1232
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:33,971
Even when I heard that,

1233
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:37,471
I didn't feel that happy.

1234
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:41,381
I thought, "Why is he deciding on that?"

1235
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:44,211
Even then, I was thinking from Ji Eun's point of view.

1236
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:47,250
If they had such a nice date,

1237
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:48,751
that should be it, so why...

1238
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,460
I told you my conclusion.

1239
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:55,760
(I told you my conclusion.)

1240
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:56,791
Conclusion...

1241
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,961
I told you my conclusion.

1242
01:02:02,461 --> 01:02:03,530
Oh, Dong Ha.

1243
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:04,770
He doesn't want him to misunderstand.

1244
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:05,870
"This is how I feel."

1245
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:07,570
He's letting Jeong Geun know.

1246
01:02:07,571 --> 01:02:09,070
If I put myself in Jeong Geun's shoes,

1247
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:10,971
- He must not be happy.
- I don't feel happy.

1248
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,370
Dong Ha didn't know about the bracelet.

1249
01:02:12,371 --> 01:02:13,610
Right, he didn't know about the bracelet.

1250
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:14,710
She brought up the bracelet first.

1251
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:16,340
He's telling Jeong Geun now that he's not interested...

1252
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:17,850
after going on a date with her.

1253
01:02:17,851 --> 01:02:19,750
But it can't be helped.

1254
01:02:19,751 --> 01:02:22,220
Dong Ha did what he needed to,

1255
01:02:22,221 --> 01:02:24,520
- Right.
- and I just want Jeong Geun...

1256
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:26,890
- to overcome this in a wise way.
- Right.

1257
01:02:26,891 --> 01:02:27,891
They just have different ways...

1258
01:02:27,892 --> 01:02:29,391
- of doing things.
- Right.

1259
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:31,090
Jeong Geun could be annoyed...

1260
01:02:31,091 --> 01:02:32,860
or happy after hearing that,

1261
01:02:32,861 --> 01:02:34,560
but if he likes Ji Eun,

1262
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:35,730
- he needs to overcome it.
- You're right.

1263
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:37,560
- Overcome it.
- He needs to overcome it.

1264
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:38,631
Right.

1265
01:02:46,071 --> 01:02:47,510
We don't have much time left.

1266
01:02:47,511 --> 01:02:49,541
Tomorrow is almost the last day.

1267
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:51,910
It's almost over.

1268
01:02:51,911 --> 01:02:55,481
In a way, this one week was like a dream.

1269
01:02:57,451 --> 01:03:00,751
In that remaining time,

1270
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,721
I don't want Ji Eun to worry about me...

1271
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,391
and leave this place feeling fully recovered.

1272
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,030
Regardless,

1273
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:11,870
I'll keep looking at Ji Eun.

1274
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,971
I really feel...

1275
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:17,001
that I'll continue to circle around her like a satellite...

1276
01:03:17,271 --> 01:03:19,140
until the week is over.

1277
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:21,310
I no longer have the influence...

1278
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:23,341
to do anything else.

1279
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,351
I don't want to pressure her.

1280
01:03:31,151 --> 01:03:32,250
That's all.

1281
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:34,451
(That's all.)

1282
01:03:43,101 --> 01:03:44,731
That's the best form of pure love.

1283
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:46,400
I feel like Dong Ha must feel...

1284
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:48,971
- so bad right now.
- Seriously.

1285
01:03:51,441 --> 01:03:53,111
(Final Pick D-1)

1286
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:55,211
Express your true feelings.

1287
01:03:56,511 --> 01:04:03,951
(Their last chance to express their true feelings.)

1288
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:06,121
Opening up my heart to someone...

1289
01:04:06,691 --> 01:04:08,591
is a different thing to do.

1290
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:10,590
After the date,

1291
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:11,761
I was a bit worried.

1292
01:04:11,991 --> 01:04:13,890
I should've been a bit braver...

1293
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,901
and been honest about things.

1294
01:04:17,301 --> 01:04:21,840
(Our friends are slowly sorting out their feelings.)

1295
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:25,541
(Our friends are slowly sorting out their feelings.)

1296
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:29,081
(Do you want to know their true feelings?)

1297
01:04:29,381 --> 01:04:31,951
"Do you want to know their true feelings?"

1298
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:37,281
(Lastly, Pandora's Box will shake up their hearts.)

1299
01:04:37,991 --> 01:04:39,690
(Last night, someone picked someone.)

1300
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:41,490
I think I'd look. I'd look.

1301
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:43,591
Why would you look at that? You don't need to look.

1302
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:48,161
(And)

1303
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:53,601
(Shin Dong Ha, Ha Jeong Geun)

1304
01:04:54,201 --> 01:05:00,211
(Multiple women voted for Dong Ha.)

1305
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:02,741
What?

1306
01:05:03,311 --> 01:05:04,751
Three votes all of a sudden?

1307
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:06,751
I chose Dong Ha.

1308
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:14,790
(Final Pick is approaching, and their hearts are in turmoil.)

1309
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:16,120
He's a man of devilish charm.

1310
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,791
He really is a man of devilish charm.

1311
01:05:18,991 --> 01:05:20,090
(You know what?)

1312
01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:21,830
(I actually know someone really great.)

1313
01:05:21,831 --> 01:05:23,730
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

1314
01:05:23,731 --> 01:05:25,801
(Just open your heart a little.)

1315
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:28,941
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

1316
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:31,001
(Date My Friend)
