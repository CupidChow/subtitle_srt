1
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,317
(You know what?)

2
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:16,957
(I actually know someone really great.)

3
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,787
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

4
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:20,788
(Just open your heart a little.)

5
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:23,757
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

6
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:25,027
(Date My Friend)

7
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:26,874
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

8
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,137
- Hello.
- Hello.

9
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,097
(It was awkward.)

10
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:31,667
(It was exciting.)

11
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:33,067
(They were full of anticipation.)

12
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:35,584
(They were curious about each other after that first encounter.)

13
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:38,908
(The more time they spent together, )

14
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:43,048
(the more memories they made in the Lovebud House.)

15
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:49,388
(The more their relationships grew and built up.)

16
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:54,327
(With the Final Pick right around the corner, )

17
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:57,128
(who are their hearts drawn to?)

18
00:00:57,968 --> 00:00:59,327
- I was a bit surprised.
- Why?

19
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:00,767
We have the same wallpaper.

20
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:03,168
(Su Jin and Dong Ha sensed it was fate when they first met.)

21
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:10,178
(If I could choose my date today, I'd choose you!)

22
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,848
I’m acting like I'm pretty.

23
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:14,847
It's so cringy.

24
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:15,917
(You are pretty.)

25
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,587
(Dong Ha made his feelings for Su Jin clear.)

26
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:21,588
(I only need my remaining dates to be with you.)

27
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:23,357
Everyone.

28
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:25,028
Let's take a photo with Geon Wu.

29
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:29,497
I think she was trying to include me.

30
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:34,098
(Geon Wu felt drawn to Da Hye's attentiveness.)

31
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:37,738
(He carefully expresses his feelings.)

32
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:39,938
(I remember things about you.)

33
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:41,707
I like that it's knitted.

34
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:46,078
(Da Hye and Geon Wu bonded slowly over shared tastes.)

35
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,307
I do.

36
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,848
(I do want to get to know you because I'm interested in you.)

37
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:53,447
To express my feelings...

38
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,457
(Hyun Jin actively expressed his feelings...)

39
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,958
(through his words and actions.)

40
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:02,068
(Between Geon Wu and Hyun Jin. where does Da Hye's heart lie?)

41
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,028
Hold my hand.

42
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:06,067
(Meanwhile, Sin Young went on a date with Hyun Jin, )

43
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:07,628
(whom she'd always been curious about.)

44
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,038
All right.

45
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:11,738
This is so nice.

46
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,878
I could tell that Hyun Jin...

47
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:18,678
(I could tell that Hyun Jin is a good person.)

48
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:24,548
(Sin Young, is Da Hye inside?)

49
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:32,327
(Oh Hyun Jin chose Lee Da Hye last night.)

50
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:34,128
(But Hyun Jin's heart was drawn to Da Hye.)

51
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:37,128
I was right.

52
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:40,427
Look over here.

53
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:41,498
That's cute.

54
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:46,508
When I saw Ji Eun, I thought she was a K-pop idol.

55
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:50,278
(Jeong Geun went straight for Ji Eun.)

56
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,808
To make that...

57
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,048
(I hammered away to win your heart.)

58
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,087
(Jeong Geun expressed his feelings for her without any hesitation.)

59
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:01,617
(Who was Ji Eun's heart drawn to one day before the Final Pick?)

60
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:04,928
(Choi Ji Eun chose Shin Dong Ha last night.)

61
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:10,827
(The rift between Jeong Geun and Ji Eun deepened.)

62
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:12,988
Do I really have to go through all this because of it?

63
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:15,768
It's too much for me.

64
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:18,037
I feel like I could get over Ji Eun.

65
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:20,107
(They were at odds before the Final Pick.)

66
00:03:20,108 --> 00:03:21,908
(How will it end for Ji Eun and Jeong Geun?)

67
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:24,747
"On the last night, have a 30-minute conversation..."

68
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,047
(They were given the chance to have...)

69
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:27,888
(private conversations before the Final Pick.)

70
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,448
I consistently...

71
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:32,618
chose you,

72
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,688
but I don't regret that at all.

73
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:38,128
You're such a good person.

74
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:40,458
I thought, Hyun Jin...

75
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:42,427
is a really good person.

76
00:03:42,428 --> 00:03:47,398
(On the last night, what heartfelt words will they share in private?)

77
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:50,738
(The Final Pick, where a relationship begins)

78
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:04,587
(Dong Ha is waiting for someone.)

79
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:08,858
(Just then, someone walks in.)

80
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:20,368
(Who will Dong Ha be talking to?)

81
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,638
(It's Su Jin.)

82
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:27,607
I expected it, but I still felt good.

83
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:30,978
I felt good and slightly relieved.

84
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:36,347
We got to talk to each other alone,

85
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:38,247
and it was great.

86
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:40,017
- Did you recognize this place?
- Yes.

87
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,518
It's where we first met.

88
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:48,298
(On the first day, Su Jin went to pick Dong Ha up.)

89
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:57,838
(This is where they had their exciting first encounter.)

90
00:04:58,738 --> 00:04:59,968
Hello.

91
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:04,078
(Su Jin and Dong Ha had exchanged awkward greetings.)

92
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:08,677
(The two of them reunited at that very place for a conversation.)

93
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,518
- That's great.
- That's great.

94
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:14,117
That's where you picked me up.

95
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:15,818
Tell me how you felt in that moment.

96
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,357
Right when I showed up.

97
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,457
I don't think I ever told you.

98
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,328
I know. That's why I've been meaning to ask.

99
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:22,098
When I first saw you,

100
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:23,757
I was sitting down when you showed up.

101
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:26,527
You were so full of energy.

102
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:27,967
When I said hello?

103
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,797
- I thought you were...
- You thought I was a staff?

104
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:31,808
The host of the show.

105
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:35,037
- For about five seconds, - The MC?

106
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,577
I wondered, "Is she the host? But I don't recognize her."

107
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:39,977
Someone who says, "You can go this way."

108
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,817
Yes, it briefly crossed my mind.

109
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:43,947
But the way you said hello made me think you weren't.

110
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:47,517
Then I realized you were just full of energy.

111
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:50,318
For a second, I wondered if this show had a host.

112
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:52,528
That's understandable.

113
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,957
Did you have a hard time while you were here?

114
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,028
Me?

115
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,898
At first, I was very confused. After the first date.

116
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:04,297
In the beginning, I thought, if there's big age difference,

117
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,568
I would definitely be able to feel the generational gap.

118
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:08,238
That was my concern,

119
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,237
because my first date...

120
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:11,608
was Hyun Jin,

121
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:14,248
and I did feel the generational gap.

122
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:18,888
So I thought I wouldn't click with someone who's 10, 11 years older.

123
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,368
But then I found out you're only a year younger than him.

124
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:23,058
That took me by surprise.

125
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:26,528
But with you, I didn't feel that kind of generational gap.

126
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:29,628
I'm relieved you didn't feel that way...

127
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,968
about our age difference.

128
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:35,338
I'm also thankful about...

129
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:38,138
how you took the lead.

130
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,307
And how you kept wanting to talk to me.

131
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:43,338
I don't think I'm the only one who took the lead, though.

132
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,007
I think we both...

133
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:48,518
(I think we both pulled each other closer.)

134
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:51,218
Right.

135
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:55,957
For me, if you weren't here,

136
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,818
I think I would have...

137
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:00,457
struggled emotionally during that week.

138
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,728
- Really? Why?
- Yes.

139
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:06,098
You could have had fun with the other three.

140
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:08,997
I don't think so.

141
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:11,167
You gave me that sense of stability.

142
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,168
- I did?
- Yes.

143
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,937
I'm curious about that.

144
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:17,638
The reason you chose me.

145
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:20,008
Because I enjoyed our date so much.

146
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:23,518
I had fun on our date too.

147
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,288
I enjoyed our date,

148
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,557
but it's more than that.

149
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:32,927
I also had fun during my date with Da Hye,

150
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:34,657
but I didn't choose her that day.

151
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:36,228
Oh, is that so?

152
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:38,627
It's not just because I had fun,

153
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:41,497
or because I wanted to express my appreciation.

154
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:43,938
I chose you because my feeling toward you is beyond all that.

155
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:45,238
Right.

156
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:49,007
So the second date was the starting point.

157
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:50,337
- That was when it began.
- Yes.

158
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,278
The second date played a big part for me too.

159
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,617
I like the look on his face.

160
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:59,888
You were on my mind since the second date.

161
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:01,458
I kept choosing you after that.

162
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,857
I think that's when you kept choosing me too. Right?

163
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,328
- Right.
- Yes.

164
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,557
I knew it.

165
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,038
My feelings never changed after that.

166
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:13,067
We'll see how you feel...

167
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,538
after three women choose you today.

168
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:17,938
- Is it up to me?
- Yes.

169
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:20,408
We'll have to see. Nothing's final yet.

170
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,647
I can't believe this is our last night.

171
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,478
I know. Time flies.

172
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:33,847
I would love it if we don't end things here...

173
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,418
and just continue on outside.

174
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,058
Let's do our best.

175
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:46,928
Let's do our best.

176
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,737
- It's Ji Eun.
- It's Ji Eun.

177
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:54,878
Gosh, this is...

178
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,637
- I've been waiting for this.
- This is the main event.

179
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,207
- That's Dong Ha.
- It's Dong Ha, right?

180
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,348
- No, it's Jeong Geun.
- It's Jeong Geun.

181
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:03,348
- It's Jeong Geun?
- Yes.

182
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,587
- I think it's Jeong Geun.
- Jeong Geun? No, it's Dong Ha.

183
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,588
- It's Dong Ha.
- It's Dong Ha.

184
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:09,817
Hello.

185
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,528
(Ji Eun came here to see Dong Ha.)

186
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:15,698
Have a seat.

187
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,298
I can't wait to see what they talk about.

188
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:34,408
How was yesterday?

189
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,347
Yesterday? I had fun.

190
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:37,678
But I wanted to apologize.

191
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:39,048
- To me? Why?
- Yes.

192
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:41,688
Because I wasn't feeling well at the end.

193
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:44,118
I just thought...

194
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,927
- that was only natural.
- Really?

195
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:48,627
It's because we had so much fun...

196
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:51,027
- and enjoyed our time together.
- I guess.

197
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:53,127
- I'm relieved, then.
- You just used up all your energy.

198
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,737
I'm still sorry.

199
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:58,038
I felt bad about it.

200
00:09:58,738 --> 00:09:59,868
It’s nothing to worry about.

201
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,338
So do you feel better now?

202
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:07,477
I'm actually simpler than I seem, so I tend to recover quickly.

203
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,948
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

204
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:10,818
That's right.

205
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:12,048
It's okay.

206
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:16,757
I actually picked you in the voting.

207
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:19,827
I had a clear answer to the question.

208
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,928
Since I had fun.

209
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:23,998
Just...

210
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:27,928
That the date was fun?

211
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:29,737
My impressions from that day.

212
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:31,098
- About yesterday?
- Yes.

213
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:34,937
Still,

214
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,977
- we came together in the beginning.
- I know.

215
00:10:36,978 --> 00:10:38,208
We came together.

216
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:41,107
You gave me some comfort within.

217
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,877
- Me, too.
- You made me comfortable.

218
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:43,948
Since I had a buddy.

219
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:46,794
Since you weren't the only one? It was the same for me.

220
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:48,987
Everyone else had already become close.

221
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:50,058
I know.

222
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,688
Did you make up your mind for the Final Pick?

223
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,698
No comment on that.

224
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,097
Did you choose?

225
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:02,598
- No comment on that.
- Okay.

226
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,668
Alright, anyway.

227
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:10,308
(Ji Eun and Dong Ha's 1-on-1 conversation ends.)

228
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:20,818
(Hyun Jin is waiting for his 1-on-1 conversation opponent.)

229
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,057
- Why do you have an umbrella?
- Thank you.

230
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,658
- Is it raining?
- It's raining outside.

231
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,028
Let's move this back.

232
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:33,428
Gosh.

233
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:36,797
I wanted to ask Da Hye...

234
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:37,998
about...

235
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:39,608
her current thoughts.

236
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:44,837
- How is it?
- What?

237
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,347
How is your love life going?

238
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:47,648
- My love life?
- Yes.

239
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,248
For me...

240
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,657
I don't know if you voted for me or not...

241
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:56,658
yesterday, but...

242
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:57,957
- I did.
- Is that so?

243
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,887
- Come on, you already know.
- Really?

244
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:00,988
Is that so?

245
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:04,338
I always chose you except for one time on the second day.

246
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,728
So...

247
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:08,068
So, about that,

248
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:10,568
I think of it as...

249
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,807
something to appreciate.

250
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:15,337
Of course, hearing this...

251
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,677
might not really affect you,

252
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:20,077
but I still wanted to give you my gratitude.

253
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,647
I think, except when it was just us two,

254
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:25,117
I wasn’t good at...

255
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,717
getting along...

256
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:29,858
with everyone else.

257
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:31,318
That's what I think.

258
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,788
- Above everything else, - Yes.

259
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:37,057
That moment was when I had the most fun,

260
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:39,228
among all other 1-on-1 dates...

261
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,267
since I got here.

262
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:43,397
- That's a relief.
- When we went there.

263
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:44,898
- I had fun too.
- It was, for me.

264
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,937
- I only remember laughing.
- Yes.

265
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:49,278
- It was so fun.
- Yes.

266
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:52,707
- I just wanted to tell you that.
- Okay.

267
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,948
That I had those moments.

268
00:12:56,318 --> 00:13:00,888
(Hyun Jin shares his feelings with Da Hye.)

269
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:03,688
I think I stayed true the whole time.

270
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,288
You're right.

271
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:08,328
- I think you did, too.
- The person I was curious about,

272
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:10,027
the one who came to my mind,

273
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:11,668
and the one I wanted to get to know more.

274
00:13:12,598 --> 00:13:13,728
That's...

275
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:16,698
That was you, so I just did that.

276
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,538
You're right.

277
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,408
- I didn't have to think about it.
- Yes.

278
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,178
Even when I went in.

279
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:26,407
Oh, no.

280
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:27,477
- Da Hye isn't saying anything.
- She isn't.

281
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:28,678
Da Hye.

282
00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:33,288
But I...

283
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,188
The conclusion I came to is that…

284
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:37,918
I think...

285
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:43,397
After our date yesterday,

286
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:44,658
what I felt was that...

287
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:48,298
I realized that...

288
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:50,668
opening up to others...

289
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,077
isn't easy for me.

290
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:02,378
I think I’m especially like that.

291
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:04,418
So...

292
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:07,217
I felt like we did have plenty of conversations,

293
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:10,818
yet also that it wasn’t nearly...

294
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:13,428
an enough amount.

295
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:14,588
Anyway...

296
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:17,758
I don’t want to...

297
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:19,397
sugarcoat this.

298
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:21,127
I think that...

299
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,297
at this pace,

300
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:24,567
the result is that...

301
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:26,838
I am someone who still needs time.

302
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:41,548
(Will Hyun Jin’s true feelings never reach her?)

303
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:47,188
She told him clearly.

304
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,427
I guess she's going to Geon Wu.

305
00:14:50,428 --> 00:14:51,527
(I guess she's going to Geon Wu.)

306
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:52,967
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:55,068
No, it's not that.

308
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,568
She's true to her feelings.

309
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:00,837
Sure, since it's the last moment.

310
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,077
- She's being clear.
- Yes, clear.

311
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:03,078
It's better to say.

312
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:04,338
Rather than...

313
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:06,177
leaving hope for him.

314
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:07,747
Since she can feel that his feelings...

315
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,418
are sort of heading toward her...

316
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:12,258
- She wanted to tell him properly.
- That's why she told him.

317
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:20,258
(Jeong Geun is waiting for a long time.)

318
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:34,507
(As time goes by, the tension keeps building.)

319
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:36,028
- She didn't come?
- She's not coming?

320
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:45,987
"What should I tell her?"

321
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,487
"How should I express my feelings?"

322
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,117
I thought about that...

323
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:51,258
and...

324
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,457
I think I wrote it down like a script.

325
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,857
(He wrote down what he wanted to say...)

326
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,358
(before the last conversation.)

327
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:24,488
(Will Jeong Geun share his feelings with Ji Eun?)

328
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:30,197
At the sound of the stairs,

329
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,268
I couldn't bring myself to look back first.

330
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,438
Take a seat.

331
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:47,808
You didn't have anything to drink?

332
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:49,477
- I already did.
- Did you?

333
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:50,478
(He can't help but smile as soon as he sees Ji Eun.)

334
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,547
You're tired, aren't you?

335
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:53,587
No, are you okay after drinking?

336
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:54,588
- Drinking?
- Yes.

337
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,118
- Sure, I'm fine.
- Are you?

338
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:09,398
Is it still raining outside?

339
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,018
Wait a minute.

340
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:36,758
(Facing Ji Eun, he seems unable to speak.)

341
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,698
I think a week...

342
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,737
has already passed.

343
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:47,668
(He tries to slowly bring up the story.)

344
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:51,207
Spending time together,

345
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,208
I really loved the memories,

346
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:58,417
and I'm actually the type that can speak calmly,

347
00:17:58,418 --> 00:17:59,848
- but with you, - Yes.

348
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:02,058
Whenever I talk,

349
00:18:02,218 --> 00:18:04,657
it feels like I keep talking...

350
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:06,228
- No.
- brokenly.

351
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:07,588
So...

352
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,568
I wanted to resolve some misunderstandings,

353
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:15,437
but I couldn’t organize my thoughts...

354
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:17,498
to talk with you about them calmly.

355
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,268
To be honest,

356
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,208
thinking about it,

357
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:29,117
there were many things to be grateful for.

358
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:31,317
(There were many things to be grateful for.)

359
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,518
It's true.

360
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:36,888
I think...

361
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,727
you were just expressing your feelings,

362
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:41,788
and...

363
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:44,427
you did your best to do so.

364
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:46,027
And I did feel that.

365
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:47,727
You were considerate...

366
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:49,667
when you reached out...

367
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,468
and kept me in conversations.

368
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:53,268
You did that,

369
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,738
but...

370
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:58,308
I think I could’ve accepted...

371
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,208
your ways...

372
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,578
a little better.

373
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:05,817
If I had been...

374
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:09,017
a bit more...

375
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:10,217
(Ji Eun calmly admits that she was passive.)

376
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,318
clear to you...

377
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,788
I think I could have been more easygoing, as well.

378
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,697
I should have brought up the courage...

379
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,667
to tell you more clearly.

380
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:21,128
That's what I thought.

381
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:24,998
So...

382
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,208
in the process,

383
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,307
I only let the misunderstandings grow,

384
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:36,077
never really cleared them up...

385
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:39,218
and only mentioned what was visible...

386
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,787
and moved on.

387
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:43,018
So I think that could have pressured you.

388
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:46,788
That's what I regret the most.

389
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:53,797
(The misunderstanding between them started with the bracelet.)

390
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:54,968
No.

391
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,868
No, don't take it the wrong way.

392
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:00,067
Even yesterday,

393
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,337
after hearing that you were sick,

394
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:03,407
I went to buy medicine and brought it to you.

395
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:04,537
(Although he bought the medicine for Ji Eun when she was ill...)

396
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,607
But when I passed it to you,

397
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:09,048
I couldn't even look straight into your eyes.

398
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:13,518
So I unintentionally placed it down with too much force.

399
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,088
I guess I was nervous with my own actions.

400
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,928
After getting to know you,

401
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:25,097
one thing constant was...

402
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,098
that I wanted to make you feel comfortable.

403
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:29,667
But halfway through,

404
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:32,137
the misunderstandings that I mentioned prior to this...

405
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:36,308
and inevitable situations kept overlapping.

406
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:40,808
I will say this again.

407
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,117
I did not have any ill intentions.

408
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,238
(Jeong Geun tries to clear up the misunderstandings.)

409
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:53,658
I thought the time spent here...

410
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:57,328
was different from the time spent in my day-to-day life.

411
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:00,327
It's just one day outside,

412
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:03,168
but in here, it feels like five days or even a week.

413
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:05,807
I was so focused on this moment...

414
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:09,038
that my impatient side came out without me realizing.

415
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:12,178
And I think that burdened you.

416
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:15,347
I regret it so much.

417
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,817
(He got impatient while trying to express himself in limited time.)

418
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:20,448
Even if I'd wanted to act in such a way,

419
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:23,558
I should've matched it to your speed.

420
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:01,288
- Thank you so much.
- It's nothing.

421
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:04,098
It's nothing.

422
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:10,768
- Jeong Geun.
- He's about to cry.

423
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,307
He can't finish his sentence.

424
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:15,588
- He couldn't continue talking.
- He's quite sentimental.

425
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:23,377
- You're not crying, are you?
- No.

426
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:26,017
Gwan Hee is tearing up.

427
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,147
Don't cry.

428
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:28,987
- Goodness, Gwan Hee.
- Why would you cry?

429
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:30,818
- Why would you cry?
- Oh, dear.

430
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,827
- Why...
- Goodness.

431
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:34,857
(Why would you cry when even Jeong Geun is holding it in?)

432
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:37,698
Gwan Hee must relate...

433
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:40,227
to the moments his friend...

434
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:41,897
had to endure.

435
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:42,967
Are you okay?

436
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:44,438
I'm so embarrassed.

437
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,338
I'm embarrassed.

438
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:49,808
Gwan Hee, are you okay?

439
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:51,608
We have another sentimental guy here.

440
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:53,677
- You're a feminine man.
- A feminine man.

441
00:22:53,678 --> 00:22:55,848
(Gwan Hee is a sentimental, feminine man.)

442
00:22:59,348 --> 00:23:00,947
- Don't cry.
- I won't.

443
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:02,718
- Don't.
- I'll never cry.

444
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,418
My lovebud said...

445
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:08,128
that I shouldn't cry and embarrass myself.

446
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:09,757
But he cried.

447
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,857
- Did he cry?
- He cried.

448
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,427
- He cried before Jeong Geun did.
- You cried...

449
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:14,927
- before he did.
- He's crying.

450
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,438
Gwan Hee is crying.

451
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,068
Darn it.

452
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:19,868
It's...

453
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:22,978
(Two of them finally smile.)

454
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:27,648
As I spoke,

455
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:30,517
I must've teared up.

456
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:34,518
At the moment when I couldn't continue speaking,

457
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:38,888
Ji Eun held my hand.

458
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:40,928
His hands...

459
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,358
were trembling.

460
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:49,468
I wanted him to calm down,

461
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:52,608
so I kept holding his hands.

462
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:59,177
It feels like I rode a roller coaster...

463
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:00,878
to come here.

464
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:04,418
I felt all the emotions that exist.

465
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,348
Despite that,

466
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:11,088
I've always chosen and will choose you.

467
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:28,768
Jeong Geun.

468
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:33,008
- My heart aches.
- My heart aches indeed.

469
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:36,677
- Are you okay?
- Jeong Geun teared up,

470
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,848
- and Gwan Hee cried too.
- Are you okay?

471
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:44,018
I can relate to him more than anyone.

472
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:47,587
It was the first time I could hear his thoughts...

473
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:51,327
solely from his perspective.

474
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:53,868
I could sympathize with him.

475
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:59,307
I believe he got his message across clearly.

476
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:00,608
I think so too.

477
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,137
Even if she doesn't choose him...

478
00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:04,437
- He won't have any regrets.
- He won't have any regrets.

479
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:06,308
- That's right.
- I think...

480
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,547
Ji Eun realized that Jeong Geun's feelings for her...

481
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,247
- were greater than she thought.
- Yes.

482
00:25:10,248 --> 00:25:11,847
His hands were shaking and all.

483
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:14,087
So if she doesn't like him with all her heart,

484
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:15,387
she might not go to him.

485
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,517
- Would that have burdened her too?
- That might be what she's thinking.

486
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,027
Yes. It's...

487
00:25:19,028 --> 00:25:20,657
A man showing his tears...

488
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:23,198
and confessing with shaky hands...

489
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,528
holds a lot of weight.

490
00:25:25,768 --> 00:25:27,227
- It's up to Ji Eun now.
- Yes.

491
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:30,138
(He expressed his genuine feelings, and it's up to Ji Eun to accept it.)

492
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:31,568
(The final night in Lovebud House)

493
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:32,668
What are you going to do?

494
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,208
- Yes?
- What are you making?

495
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:35,407
Fried tofu stuffed with rice and tofu.

496
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,538
I see.

497
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,077
- Are you feeling okay?
- Sorry?

498
00:25:40,078 --> 00:25:41,378
Are you feeling okay?

499
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:43,848
Not yet? You're still feeling unwell?

500
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:51,688
There was something I wanted to cook.

501
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:53,687
We should eat it before we leave.

502
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:54,827
(On the first day, Jeong Geun bought the ingredients...)

503
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,588
(for fried tofu stuffed with rice and tofu.)

504
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,167
Did you buy fried tofu to make...

505
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:00,667
fried tofu stuffed with rice and tofu?

506
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:04,598
I bought it to make some when I felt like it.

507
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:07,967
I thought I wouldn't have the chance to make it...

508
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:09,978
for Ji Eun except today.

509
00:26:10,238 --> 00:26:12,137
Please don't say something like,

510
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,308
"This is for you," to Ji Eun.

511
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,117
- Really?
- Yes.

512
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,158
- But shouldn't she know?
- I hope he won't say it.

513
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:20,288
I hope he'll stop now.

514
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:25,458
(The ingredients for stuffed fried tofu are ready!)

515
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,758
It looks delicious.

516
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:30,027
- Just put some wasabi on it.
- How much?

517
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:31,597
Just a bit.

518
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:32,628
Is this enough?

519
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:34,768
- Yes. A bit more.
- This much?

520
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,037
- More?
- Yes, that's enough.

521
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:37,268
- This much?
- Yes.

522
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,568
- On the rice?
- Yes, there.

523
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:41,407
Just put it in the middle of the rice.

524
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:42,508
My goodness.

525
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:44,337
- Good job.
- I'm sorry.

526
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:46,247
- It's okay.
- It reminds me of the first day...

527
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:47,907
when they washed the dishes together.

528
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:49,218
Just keep it up.

529
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:50,947
If Jeong Geun loosens up,

530
00:26:50,948 --> 00:26:52,377
Ji Eun might be attracted to him again.

531
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:53,987
- Of course.
- I agree.

532
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,787
- Of course.
- If they maintain the current mood,

533
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:57,318
it will work for them a lot better.

534
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,127
(Fried tofu stuffed with rice and tofu by Jeong Geun...)

535
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:01,227
(and spicy whelk by Hyun Jin)

536
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,958
- It looks delicious.
- It looks good.

537
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:04,797
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

538
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:06,197
- Good job.
- Good job.

539
00:27:06,198 --> 00:27:08,127
- Good job.
- Good job.

540
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,998
And thanks for cooking.

541
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:19,358
- It tastes good.
- It's impossible not to.

542
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,408
This reminds me of the first day.

543
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:23,818
- Yes.
- Right?

544
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,918
Jeong Geun, I get why you wanted to make this for us so badly.

545
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,518
- It's delicious.
- It's so good.

546
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:32,157
It has bulgogi in it.

547
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,188
Yes.

548
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:39,428
(They try Hyun Jin's spicy whelk too.)

549
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:44,498
- It's delicious.
- It's delicious.

550
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:47,467
- It's spicy.
- Is it?

551
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:48,568
- Is it spicy?
- Yes.

552
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:51,538
- But it's nice.
- The noodles are a bit...

553
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,348
You didn't mix the sauce in it.

554
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:55,408
- In case it got soggy.
- In case it got soggy.

555
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:57,247
It's our last day.

556
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:59,464
- We can eat as much as we like.
- Everyone is wolfing down the food.

557
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:00,808
- I was hungry.
- It's delicious.

558
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:02,858
It's delicious.

559
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:05,717
Whenever Jeong Geun sees Ji Eun eat, he smiles.

560
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,957
- Yes. It's so cute.
- That makes my heart flutter.

561
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,627
- Right? He's observing her.
- Yes.

562
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:10,927
"She likes it."

563
00:28:10,928 --> 00:28:12,627
- He made it for Ji Eun, - Yes.

564
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:15,627
But he didn't say it outright.

565
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,497
If he says it one more time,

566
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:19,608
Ji Eun might really run away.

567
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:21,967
- He's reading the room now.
- Is that it?

568
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:23,777
He's being cautious.

569
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,458
(Jeong Geun has learned to read the room.)

570
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:30,317
- Let's go.
- Shall we get going?

571
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:31,848
- Shall we clean up?
- Sure.

572
00:28:32,748 --> 00:28:35,318
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

573
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,317
We need to pack.

574
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:39,727
- Da Hye.
- Yes?

575
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:41,258
- Wait there.
- Okay.

576
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:49,198
(Geon Wu suddenly enters the room.)

577
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:54,538
(He walks out with a book.)

578
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:58,637
- What is it?
- What is it?

579
00:28:58,638 --> 00:28:59,878
- It...
- Yes.

580
00:29:01,178 --> 00:29:02,547
- Read it.
- No way.

581
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:03,617
- Is it raining?
- Thank you.

582
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:04,678
Sure.

583
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:07,718
It's not raining.

584
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,787
I have a poetry book...

585
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,988
that Sae Ho, my lovebud, gave to me.

586
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:16,127
I read it,

587
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:18,958
albeit just a few pages.

588
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:21,267
Yes, the poetry book.

589
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:23,838
I hope the book will help him.

590
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:28,308
I found a nice phrase.

591
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:34,577
Using that phrase as an excuse,

592
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:36,447
I wrote down...

593
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:39,288
all the feelings I've felt until now.

594
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:45,058
(Da Hye comes upstairs right away.)

595
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:58,138
(Da Hye goes through each page of Geon Wu's poetry book.)

596
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:05,638
What is it?

597
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:15,517
Geon Wu has never...

598
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:16,787
rushed me...

599
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:18,917
or asked me...

600
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:21,988
to recognize his feelings.

601
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:24,227
So I was...

602
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:25,997
very grateful to him,

603
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,128
and I was very frustrated at myself.

604
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:31,037
I wanted to give him a definitive answer,

605
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,038
but I couldn't.

606
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,908
Why do I keep getting lost?

607
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:36,007
I couldn't say...

608
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:38,377
I had feelings for him romantically...

609
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,108
because I felt very comfortable around him.

610
00:30:40,408 --> 00:30:41,747
But he never got...

611
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:44,478
frustrated about it.

612
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:48,447
He just stayed quiet...

613
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:51,918
and said, "Stick to your own speed."

614
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,727
I was grateful for it.

615
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:54,788
(I was grateful for it.)

616
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:56,327
And I felt bad.

617
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:58,958
(And I felt bad.)

618
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:02,068
I went up to my room...

619
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:03,938
and opened the first page.

620
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:05,567
(To Da Hye, my lovebud Sae Ho recommended this poetry book.)

621
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:07,567
He'd written a letter there.

622
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:09,754
(I read a very nice phrase, and I want to gift this to you.)

623
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:12,078
"To a genuinely good person, Da Hye."

624
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:14,977
"Whatever happens, let's keep our relationship for a long time."

625
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:17,538
(Whatever happens, let's keep our relationship for a long time.)

626
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:21,788
I felt sorry.

627
00:31:26,158 --> 00:31:30,128
(What kind of choice will Da Hye make?)

628
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:36,237
- Are you okay?
- Sorry?

629
00:31:36,238 --> 00:31:37,267
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

630
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:38,537
What's with today too?

631
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:39,907
It's really sad today.

632
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:41,968
Everyone is crying today.

633
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,007
I sent her there to date.

634
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:47,778
Why is she feeling bad?

635
00:31:48,178 --> 00:31:49,618
This is driving me crazy.

636
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:52,248
Da Hye is confused and lost there.

637
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:54,787
And she feels bad for everyone.

638
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,018
It's hard for me to watch.

639
00:31:58,718 --> 00:32:00,427
More than a hundred words,

640
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:04,057
that short phrase in the poetry book moved her.

641
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:05,978
(Did the short phrase affect Da Hye's feelings?)

642
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:12,298
(Final Pick, D-Day)

643
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:53,347
Regardless of the result,

644
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,348
I don't regret my choice.

645
00:32:57,118 --> 00:32:59,847
I think the Final Pick has been decided...

646
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:02,748
based on whatever had happened before.

647
00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:05,488
Before I left,

648
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:08,228
I was very nervous.

649
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,098
My heart raced,

650
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,627
and I felt nervous.

651
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:16,968
I felt, "The time has finally come."

652
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:24,777
(Once again, Da Hye...)

653
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:28,108
(opens the poetry book that Geon Wu gave her.)

654
00:33:30,478 --> 00:33:32,518
She must have a lot on her mind.

655
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:34,948
Oh, dear.

656
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:39,928
I need to choose my Final Pick.

657
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,157
Before and after I made the choice,

658
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:45,828
I kept reading the poetry book.

659
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:48,967
I felt bad for him,

660
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:51,298
but at the same time, I felt warm and fuzzy.

661
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,087
(Shin Dong Ha, please head to the Heart Room.)

662
00:34:13,088 --> 00:34:14,557
They're choosing their Final Pick already?

663
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:16,598
I wonder who they'll choose.

664
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:19,028
- Who...
- I can't wait to find out.

665
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,177
(Who is the genuinely good person that knocked on your heart's door?)

666
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:34,008
(Their final choices in Lovebud House)

667
00:34:42,688 --> 00:34:44,918
I thought hard about it.

668
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:49,487
I thought about it long and hard,

669
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,057
but I'm still confused...

670
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:52,298
and unsure about my feelings.

671
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:57,667
I want to know more about him,

672
00:34:57,668 --> 00:35:00,108
but does he also...

673
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:02,468
want to know more about me?

674
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,907
I only had one choice from beginning to the end.

675
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:07,978
I was sure of my feelings.

676
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:16,358
(After pondering, they decide on their Final Picks.)

677
00:35:16,388 --> 00:35:22,998
(Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?)

678
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:28,997
This is hard to watch.

679
00:35:28,998 --> 00:35:30,497
I wonder who they chose.

680
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:31,697
- Same.
- Yes.

681
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:33,767
- They might not choose anyone.
- That's right.

682
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:35,167
- If they don't tear the name, - Yes.

683
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:37,248
- it means they don't choose anyone.
- You're right.

684
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:40,178
I don't think it will be straightforward.

685
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:42,078
What if there's a huge plot twist?

686
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:44,378
- That shouldn't happen.
- No way.

687
00:35:45,248 --> 00:35:46,747
We can't have any plot twist.

688
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,308
(He might cry if there's a plot twist.)

689
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:54,557
(It's time to find out the Final Picks.)

690
00:35:54,558 --> 00:36:00,498
(If they chose each other, )

691
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:08,708
(they'll meet at the same place.)

692
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:30,027
(Will they be able to meet each other...)

693
00:36:30,028 --> 00:36:37,098
(by becoming each other's Final Pick?)

694
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:39,837
(The first Final Pick, Oh Hyun Jin)

695
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:40,908
Even if...

696
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:43,378
the result is set,

697
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,838
I'll man up...

698
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:47,508
and make my choice.

699
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:49,278
And I'll face...

700
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:53,388
the ending coolly.

701
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:13,668
He must be very nervous.

702
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:26,378
The track felt very long.

703
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:41,828
(How will Hyun Jin's story end?)

704
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:11,558
(Hyun Jin's door)

705
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,338
(When he opens this door, )

706
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:28,148
(he can find out what choice the person he chose has made.)

707
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:32,878
(The first day at Lovebud House)

708
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:37,518
- Hello.
- Hello.

709
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:39,617
I don't like to get tan.

710
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:40,727
Would you like to cover yourself up...

711
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:41,787
- using this?
- The show... My gosh.

712
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:43,197
- Can I?
- Go ahead.

713
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:44,257
Thank you.

714
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:45,727
My sunblock might get on it.

715
00:38:45,728 --> 00:38:46,828
It's fine.

716
00:38:47,168 --> 00:38:48,397
Thank you.

717
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:52,998
(Da Hye's bright demeanor sparked Hyun Jin's interest.)

718
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:54,468
- This?
- Yes.

719
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,837
My goodness.

720
00:38:56,838 --> 00:38:58,537
- Did you hurt yourself? Oh, dear.
- My gosh.

721
00:38:58,538 --> 00:38:59,978
Did you hurt yourself?

722
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:01,178
I...

723
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,748
Where? Let me see. Hold on.

724
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:04,577
It's okay. I have a Band-Aid too.

725
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:05,817
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

726
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:08,717
(Hyun Jin opened the door of his heart to Da Hye...)

727
00:39:08,718 --> 00:39:11,988
(who took care of him.)

728
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:16,528
(He woke up early in the morning to brew coffee.)

729
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:20,398
Da Hye, would you like some coffee?

730
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:22,167
- You have coffee?
- Yes.

731
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:23,197
I made some.

732
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:26,668
(He gave the coffee to her and expressed his feelings.)

733
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,378
One of the two is me?

734
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,208
Right?

735
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:36,508
Am I that easy to read?

736
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:38,277
I'm interested in you.

737
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:40,848
(I'm interested in you.)

738
00:39:46,658 --> 00:39:49,897
(When he was with Da Hye...)

739
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:55,798
(Hyun Jin was full of laughter when he was with Da Hye.)

740
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:00,137
Well,

741
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:02,038
after going on a date with you,

742
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:04,108
I felt this.

743
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:10,118
Opening up my heart...

744
00:40:11,848 --> 00:40:13,718
is a difficult thing.

745
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:17,218
I did think that it wasn't an easy thing for the others too.

746
00:40:17,388 --> 00:40:21,757
But I thought it was especially hard for me.

747
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:23,718
(Hyun Jin found out about Da Hye's honest heart.)

748
00:40:25,128 --> 00:40:31,498
(Hyun Jin looks torn before making his Final Pick.)

749
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,937
Da Hye. It's Da Hye.

750
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:36,437
(Oh Hyun Jin picks Lee Da Hye for the Final Pick.)

751
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,078
He picked Da Hye.

752
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:40,608
(Lee Da Hye)

753
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,568
This was what Nam Hee said to me.

754
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:05,067
He said that I should fight until the end without giving up...

755
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:07,508
just because the other person's heart is facing toward me.

756
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:12,638
I should hold onto the five percent of hope.

757
00:41:16,378 --> 00:41:19,478
I think that led me to make my Final Pick.

758
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:31,598
(Hyun Jin waits for Da Hye with 5 percent of hope.)

759
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:35,827
It would be amazing if they are to meet.

760
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:40,608
(Will Da Hye come at the end of his wait?)

761
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:49,248
(Open your door.)

762
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:11,467
(Lee Da Hye has not chosen you.)

763
00:42:11,468 --> 00:42:12,938
Right.

764
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:18,408
This is so tough.

765
00:42:28,788 --> 00:42:32,958
(Da Hye has not come.)

766
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:41,468
I'm sorry.

767
00:42:44,038 --> 00:42:45,498
Well, that's his fate.

768
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:49,907
- That's true though.
- Right.

769
00:42:49,908 --> 00:42:52,477
- That's true. Right.
- She doesn't like him.

770
00:42:52,478 --> 00:42:53,607
- Right.
- That's true.

771
00:42:53,608 --> 00:42:56,108
- They made the decisions.
- Right.

772
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:59,178
I'm fine.

773
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:05,218
I think that he did well.

774
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:09,228
I expected Da Hye to be the closest one to his ideal type.

775
00:43:09,388 --> 00:43:11,068
This was one thing that was disappointing.

776
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:13,257
Right from the start,

777
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,367
- he said he wanted to get married.
- He said he wanted a child.

778
00:43:15,368 --> 00:43:16,767
He said he wanted a child,

779
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,768
and that might've brought too much pressure.

780
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:19,997
That was big.

781
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:21,667
- I believe that would've...
- That must've brought pressure.

782
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:23,438
Brought too much pressure to Da Hye.

783
00:43:23,738 --> 00:43:27,548
Let's say that Hyun Jin is right next to you right now.

784
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:28,908
I'm Hyun Jin.

785
00:43:30,118 --> 00:43:32,647
What do you want to say to him if he's right next to you?

786
00:43:32,648 --> 00:43:34,887
(Laughing)

787
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:36,118
He's making fun of him?

788
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:39,587
- That's what true friends would do.
- Gosh!

789
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:41,958
Gosh!

790
00:43:42,488 --> 00:43:44,558
But here's the thing.

791
00:43:45,198 --> 00:43:47,467
I sat next to him.

792
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:50,398
He was making fun of me, but his eyes were crying.

793
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:53,398
His eyes were comforting me so much.

794
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:55,567
I think I would burst into tears if I were Hyun Jin.

795
00:43:55,568 --> 00:43:57,437
His eyes said, "You've been through so much."

796
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:59,377
- "It's okay. You did well." - His eyes look tearful.

797
00:43:59,378 --> 00:44:02,547
He was laughing at me,

798
00:44:02,548 --> 00:44:04,547
- It's sad.
- but one's eyes don't lie.

799
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:06,817
- Right.
- This is how our friends are.

800
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:08,547
- Right.
- Deep inside...

801
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:09,618
Right.

802
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:12,357
- We make fun of each other...
- And comfort each other.

803
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,558
And drink together.

804
00:44:15,688 --> 00:44:19,658
(Who is Da Hye's Final Pick then?)

805
00:44:21,568 --> 00:44:24,168
I was struggling even at that moment.

806
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:27,908
Geon Wu...

807
00:44:28,308 --> 00:44:30,378
kept choosing me.

808
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,254
You didn't choose me consecutively, right?

809
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:34,354
Did you choose me consecutively?

810
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:36,108
- Yes. I chose you consecutively.
- Really?

811
00:44:37,848 --> 00:44:41,118
(Da Hye learned about Geon Wu's heart toward her.)

812
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:43,387
There will be a time to make the Final Pick.

813
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:44,887
Right.

814
00:44:44,888 --> 00:44:47,158
I think...

815
00:44:47,528 --> 00:44:49,788
(I think I will pick you.)

816
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,127
Red works well with me.

817
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:57,137
- It looks so pretty.
- I love red.

818
00:44:57,138 --> 00:44:59,998
(Geon Wu paid attention to Da Hye's words even from afar.)

819
00:45:00,368 --> 00:45:02,438
(During the vintage shop date the next day)

820
00:45:02,538 --> 00:45:04,538
I heard that red works well with you.

821
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:07,348
(I remembered that.)

822
00:45:12,278 --> 00:45:13,948
We have similar tastes in bread.

823
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:16,487
Of course, you did match my tastes a bit.

824
00:45:16,488 --> 00:45:19,088
- I like soft bread.
- Me too.

825
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,358
But earlier...

826
00:45:23,658 --> 00:45:26,698
(The one that kept expressing his heart)

827
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:30,198
(The one that kept receiving his heart)

828
00:45:30,738 --> 00:45:32,468
These are rice balls of the past.

829
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:37,638
(Geon Wu only had his eyes on Da Hye.)

830
00:45:40,078 --> 00:45:43,818
This was what I felt from Dong Ha.

831
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:46,348
He was someone that I would want to meet outside the show.

832
00:45:47,518 --> 00:45:50,047
I went on a date that made me feel comfortable,

833
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:54,388
and it made me realize what I wanted more.

834
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,458
Can you take my hand?

835
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:01,727
She must've really liked that date.

836
00:46:01,728 --> 00:46:02,968
It must've affected her a lot.

837
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:05,498
I love it!

838
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:07,207
It feels so therapeutic. What do you think?

839
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:09,137
- I feel great right now.
- Right.

840
00:46:09,138 --> 00:46:11,408
You know that INTPs really like ENTJs, right?

841
00:46:11,678 --> 00:46:13,808
(Da Hye's natural confession)

842
00:46:14,748 --> 00:46:16,748
I'm a handful.

843
00:46:17,348 --> 00:46:18,718
If you're a handful,

844
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,118
I can lend you my hand often.

845
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:26,258
(Da Hye developed great feelings toward Dong Ha.)

846
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,098
As I thought carefully about it,

847
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:33,768
it took a long time to make my decision.

848
00:46:38,768 --> 00:46:41,708
(Who is Da Hye's heart headed toward?)

849
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:45,278
(The second Final Pick spot)

850
00:46:46,538 --> 00:46:49,508
(Someone is waiting there.)

851
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:54,887
It's so pretty.

852
00:46:54,888 --> 00:46:58,758
(Da Hye has arrived at the Final Pick spot.)

853
00:47:01,158 --> 00:47:02,388
It feels so refreshing.

854
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:13,908
I think those feelings piled up...

855
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:17,608
based on the way he was being considerate of me all the time.

856
00:47:19,778 --> 00:47:23,308
(Dong Ha took care of Da Hye whenever she struggled.)

857
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:27,648
(Geon Wu took care of Da Hye whenever she was sad.)

858
00:47:27,988 --> 00:47:30,988
I think he expressed himself a lot toward me as well.

859
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:34,358
I think that was...

860
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,388
a positive point to me.

861
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:41,367
I felt shy...

862
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:43,528
as that moment came.

863
00:47:54,648 --> 00:47:59,818
(The two get closer and closer.)

864
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:03,988
Sir?

865
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:06,358
- What? Is it him?
- "Sir?"

866
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:08,088
Is she referring to the doctor?

867
00:48:13,028 --> 00:48:14,228
Sir?

868
00:48:15,098 --> 00:48:16,128
Gosh.

869
00:48:17,138 --> 00:48:18,668
- I have come.
- Hello.

870
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:24,007
Sae Ho!

871
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:25,177
(Da Hye chose Geon Wu after much consideration.)

872
00:48:25,178 --> 00:48:27,708
- This is amazing.
- Gosh!

873
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:30,208
- Gosh!
- Congratulations!

874
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:32,618
- This is so touching!
- Gosh!

875
00:48:33,988 --> 00:48:36,448
The warm book of poems played a part.

876
00:48:37,018 --> 00:48:39,417
Your book of poems played a huge part.

877
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:41,328
My eyes are tearing up.

878
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:44,898
Sir?

879
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:49,867
(Lee Da Hye picks Kim Geon Wu for the Final Pick.)

880
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:51,037
It's so pretty here.

881
00:48:51,038 --> 00:48:52,268
- It is, isn't it?
- Yes.

882
00:48:55,538 --> 00:48:57,577
I chose Da Hye.

883
00:48:57,578 --> 00:49:00,038
(Kim Geon Wu picks Lee Da Hye for the Final Pick.)

884
00:49:01,178 --> 00:49:02,248
And...

885
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:04,948
thank you so much.

886
00:49:05,978 --> 00:49:07,018
I also...

887
00:49:07,618 --> 00:49:09,788
thank you for being interested in me.

888
00:49:10,488 --> 00:49:13,318
I also want to thank you for understanding my pace.

889
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:27,308
As I told you before,

890
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:31,077
I'm someone who needs time as well.

891
00:49:31,078 --> 00:49:32,208
- Right.
- Right.

892
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:35,778
That was why I wrote that on the book of poems.

893
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:37,247
I wrote that I wanted to see you for a long time.

894
00:49:37,248 --> 00:49:38,918
The book of poems was the kick.

895
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:43,088
It would've been hard to express himself like that.

896
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:45,458
I thank him for making an effort for me.

897
00:49:46,218 --> 00:49:49,227
"I want to see you for a long time." I will not forget that line.

898
00:49:49,228 --> 00:49:50,708
Let's see each other for a long time.

899
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:52,897
(Final Couple, Lee Da Hye and Kim Geon Wu)

900
00:49:52,898 --> 00:49:54,898
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

901
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:56,227
My gosh.

902
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:57,397
What is going on?

903
00:49:57,398 --> 00:49:58,567
- It's a pleasure.
- How do you two feel,

904
00:49:58,568 --> 00:50:00,097
Sae Ho and Mi Joo?

905
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,968
At the thought that Da Hye realized his sincerity for her,

906
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:05,937
I learned that sincerity makes things work.

907
00:50:05,938 --> 00:50:08,047
- It worked.
- I think I got touched by that.

908
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:10,717
This was what I felt grateful for.

909
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:12,277
Da Hye takes things very slowly.

910
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:14,287
- Right.
- Geon Wu waited for her.

911
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:16,447
I felt so thankful for him being that way.

912
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:18,387
And at the last moment,

913
00:50:18,388 --> 00:50:19,717
the two showed that sincerity makes things happen.

914
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:22,158
I feel so relieved that the two have gotten together.

915
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:24,028
This was my view of it.

916
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:25,657
- You two should shake hands.
- Right.

917
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:26,758
- Thank you.
- Right.

918
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:28,228
Gosh.

919
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:31,197
- We finally have our first couple.
- Right.

920
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:33,198
I wish that this good atmosphere...

921
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:35,367
- will carry on.
- Right.

922
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:36,407
I wish to see another couple.

923
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,477
- Let's move on.
- Next couple!

924
00:50:37,478 --> 00:50:38,638
I can't wait.

925
00:50:39,108 --> 00:50:42,108
(Who is the next one to make the Final Pick?)

926
00:50:46,048 --> 00:50:50,348
(Jeong Geun heads to the Final Pick spot.)

927
00:51:22,348 --> 00:51:25,357
I felt really nervous.

928
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:27,438
It was hard to predict if she would be there or not.

929
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,568
How many shots are left?

930
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:46,208
(The film camera that contains his memories with Ji Eun)

931
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:53,177
I brought all of the items...

932
00:51:53,178 --> 00:51:55,018
that contained the memories I had with Ji Eun.

933
00:51:55,288 --> 00:51:59,388
I went with the bracelet on my arm.

934
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:02,388
I also brought with me...

935
00:52:02,628 --> 00:52:05,498
the film camera that we got at the vinyl record cafe.

936
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:08,397
Things felt so nice at that moment!

937
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:13,237
(The film camera that was used during the first date with Ji Eun)

938
00:52:13,238 --> 00:52:16,067
That film camera...

939
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:18,308
had only one shot left.

940
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,747
If Ji Eun were to come,

941
00:52:21,748 --> 00:52:23,648
I had a great desire...

942
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:27,388
to take that last shot with her.

943
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:50,808
(Jeong Geun arrived at the Final Pick spot.)

944
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:11,958
(Jeong Geun waits with a restless heart.)

945
00:53:42,528 --> 00:53:44,358
Jeong Geun looks so haggard.

946
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:49,798
But...

947
00:53:52,268 --> 00:53:54,038
if she isn't to come...

948
00:53:56,508 --> 00:53:59,208
If she chooses not to come,

949
00:54:02,078 --> 00:54:03,978
I want to...

950
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:06,148
completely respect her decision.

951
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:22,298
(Will Ji Eun's heart be heading toward Jeong Geun?)

952
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:29,767
Ji Eun!

953
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:30,977
I think she might be there.

954
00:54:30,978 --> 00:54:33,007
I think she would've just left...

955
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:34,608
based on her personality.

956
00:54:37,848 --> 00:54:41,718
(Meanwhile, above the sea, )

957
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:49,827
(there is someone that is sitting next to the orange door.)

958
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,498
(Su Jin)

959
00:55:20,488 --> 00:55:27,127
(Su Jin's Final Pick made this morning)

960
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:30,168
(Su Jin's Final Pick made this morning)

961
00:55:33,198 --> 00:55:34,638
I will pick Dong Ha.

962
00:55:38,238 --> 00:55:39,377
Dong Ha.

963
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:45,348
(Kang Su Jin picks Shin Dong Ha for the Final Pick.)

964
00:55:54,788 --> 00:55:55,928
- Hello.
- Gosh!

965
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,897
You startled me!

966
00:55:57,898 --> 00:55:59,198
I got so surprised.

967
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:00,498
Gosh.

968
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:03,344
I'm not curious about the age and occupations of the others.

969
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:04,868
I'm curious about who you picked.

970
00:56:07,538 --> 00:56:08,968
I feel very grateful.

971
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,767
If he hadn't taken that step,

972
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:12,308
I don't know how things would've went.

973
00:56:12,378 --> 00:56:15,278
I believe that he mustered up his courage first to reach out his hand.

974
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:20,818
(During the 3rd date request)

975
00:56:21,918 --> 00:56:23,147
- Let's go.
- Okay!

976
00:56:23,148 --> 00:56:24,517
(Dong Ha went straight to Su Jin without hesitation.)

977
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:26,118
We'll get going.

978
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:31,358
(And...)

979
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:34,428
I just need you for the remaining dates.

980
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:35,667
Really?

981
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:37,598
(I just need you for the remaining dates.)

982
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:47,277
"It will definitely be me."

983
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,707
I didn't have this thought.

984
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,408
You never know what will happen.

985
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:58,018
(Will Dong Ha be walking toward Su Jin?)

986
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:33,518
(Su Jin keeps looking back.)

987
00:57:36,188 --> 00:57:38,657
It was going to feel strange...

988
00:57:38,658 --> 00:57:40,928
if he didn't come.

989
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:43,228
There will be a sense of disappointment...

990
00:57:44,498 --> 00:57:46,797
after all of the expressions I made.

991
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:49,638
"What were the moments we spent together for?"

992
00:57:53,508 --> 00:57:57,948
(The sun starts to set.)

993
00:58:07,288 --> 00:58:09,658
She looks like someone who had her heart broken.

994
00:58:32,518 --> 00:58:34,017
(Open your door.)

995
00:58:34,018 --> 00:58:35,888
It will end once she gets the message.

996
00:58:36,088 --> 00:58:37,248
She will be told to check.

997
00:58:48,328 --> 00:58:49,867
(Open your door.)

998
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:51,668
It will end once she gets the message.

999
00:58:51,898 --> 00:58:53,038
She will be told to check.

1000
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:00,237
(What kind of decision will there be in Su Jin's door?)

1001
00:59:00,238 --> 00:59:01,577
Did he really not come?

1002
00:59:01,578 --> 00:59:03,778
(What kind of decision will there be in Su Jin's door?)

1003
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:06,017
Stop messing around!

1004
00:59:06,018 --> 00:59:07,477
This is unbelievable!

1005
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:09,548
- No way!
- Are you serious?

1006
00:59:09,648 --> 00:59:10,817
He won't be there?

1007
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:12,087
- Are you serious?
- He won't be there?

1008
00:59:12,088 --> 00:59:13,317
This is crazy.

1009
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:14,528
Seriously?

1010
00:59:16,658 --> 00:59:18,127
(There are two sheets?)

1011
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:19,357
What?

1012
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:20,758
(There are two sheets?)

1013
00:59:39,378 --> 00:59:44,118
(Shin Dong Ha picks Kang Su Jin for the Final Pick.)

1014
00:59:49,858 --> 00:59:50,928
Gosh, you surprised me.

1015
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:53,058
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

1016
00:59:53,228 --> 00:59:54,874
- That was too much.
- My heart almost stopped.

1017
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:56,097
I was so surprised!

1018
00:59:56,098 --> 00:59:57,397
- I almost cried.
- That really surprised me.

1019
00:59:57,398 --> 00:59:58,968
I almost cried.

1020
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,748
You came.

1021
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:13,378
Su Jin is happy.

1022
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,188
Su Jin is happy.

1023
01:00:15,348 --> 01:00:16,348
- You came.
- Oh, my.

1024
01:00:17,418 --> 01:00:18,458
I was happy to see him.

1025
01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:21,087
The person I expected came.

1026
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:22,788
The person I was waiting for came.

1027
01:00:23,258 --> 01:00:24,358
I was happy to see him.

1028
01:00:28,568 --> 01:00:29,798
Open it.

1029
01:00:29,898 --> 01:00:31,028
Let's take a look.

1030
01:00:38,408 --> 01:00:40,378
- Should I read it? Don't read it?
- No.

1031
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,278
Oh, my gosh.

1032
01:00:43,748 --> 01:00:45,047
(Kang Su Jin opened the door of her heart to you.)

1033
01:00:45,048 --> 01:00:46,547
I see.

1034
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:48,817
Both their feelings are inside.

1035
01:00:48,818 --> 01:00:51,558
(Shin Dong Ha opened the door of his heart to you.)

1036
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:57,487
"Opened the door of his heart." We chose each other, right?

1037
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:58,528
Right.

1038
01:01:10,468 --> 01:01:12,184
- What you wore on the first day.
- That's right.

1039
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,728
This is what I wore on the second day.

1040
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:16,007
I wore the clothes I wore the first day I met you.

1041
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:17,248
- On purpose?
- Yes.

1042
01:01:18,218 --> 01:01:19,578
- You thought of that?
- Yes.

1043
01:01:19,678 --> 01:01:22,417
Honestly, I thought,

1044
01:01:22,418 --> 01:01:24,317
"Should I wear a sky-blue shirt today?"

1045
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:25,558
Oh, to match this?

1046
01:01:26,218 --> 01:01:27,988
Yes, I also have a sky-blue shirt.

1047
01:01:28,558 --> 01:01:29,927
"Should I try to match his shirt?"

1048
01:01:29,928 --> 01:01:32,127
But if I just assumed,

1049
01:01:32,128 --> 01:01:33,598
and you didn't come,

1050
01:01:33,828 --> 01:01:36,198
I could end up alone, thinking, "What?"

1051
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:39,038
Anyway.

1052
01:01:41,738 --> 01:01:43,468
I've opened this so many times.

1053
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:45,278
- What?
- I've opened this so many times.

1054
01:01:46,278 --> 01:01:47,337
Right?

1055
01:01:47,338 --> 01:01:49,747
(He opened Su Jin's door so many times.)

1056
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,977
I always went, "Take this left one off."

1057
01:01:51,978 --> 01:01:53,578
"Take off another one today."

1058
01:01:54,178 --> 01:01:55,788
I brought this.

1059
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:00,617
- The one from today.
- From today?

1060
01:02:00,618 --> 01:02:03,858
(Su Jin brought Dong Ha's nametag.)

1061
01:02:09,628 --> 01:02:14,637
(Dong Ha also brought Su Jin's nametag.)

1062
01:02:14,638 --> 01:02:16,838
They really suit each other.

1063
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:19,708
"What is this? I got goosebumps."

1064
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:21,407
"It's so fascinating."

1065
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:23,408
There are so many fascinating things with Dong Ha.

1066
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,018
What is this besides destiny?

1067
01:02:28,348 --> 01:02:30,217
What was the reason you chose me...

1068
01:02:30,218 --> 01:02:32,518
even though you got three votes?

1069
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:36,058
Getting three votes...

1070
01:02:36,328 --> 01:02:39,457
wasn't that important to me.

1071
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,228
- It just made me feel nice.
- Right.

1072
01:02:41,898 --> 01:02:43,098
But your conclusion...

1073
01:02:46,538 --> 01:02:47,638
was this.

1074
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:51,038
It's so nice until the end.

1075
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:54,507
Walking here kind of reminded me...

1076
01:02:54,508 --> 01:02:55,807
of when we went running.

1077
01:02:55,808 --> 01:02:57,448
Oh, right.

1078
01:03:03,918 --> 01:03:05,488
Watching the sunset together...

1079
01:03:06,758 --> 01:03:07,918
gave me so many butterflies.

1080
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:12,597
After those six days,

1081
01:03:12,598 --> 01:03:14,668
we eventually chose each other...

1082
01:03:14,898 --> 01:03:16,544
and confirmed how we felt about each other.

1083
01:03:16,568 --> 01:03:18,997
Also, sunset is my favorite time of day,

1084
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:20,438
and we experienced it together.

1085
01:03:21,768 --> 01:03:23,807
"Shin Dong Ha opened..."

1086
01:03:23,808 --> 01:03:25,778
"the door to his heart to you."

1087
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:34,248
(Final Couple, Kang Su Jin and Shin Dong Ha)

1088
01:03:35,288 --> 01:03:37,318
Congratulations.

1089
01:03:38,758 --> 01:03:40,857
We already have two couples.

1090
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,427
Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1091
01:03:42,428 --> 01:03:43,787
Thank you. - Seriously.

1092
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:44,827
They escaped the single life.

1093
01:03:44,828 --> 01:03:46,758
They really did escape the single life.

1094
01:03:47,758 --> 01:03:50,467
- When it comes to love, - Exactly.

1095
01:03:50,468 --> 01:03:52,467
I guess two people connect when they have a common denominator.

1096
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:53,468
- Yes.
- These two...

1097
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:55,467
had a movie-like beginning,

1098
01:03:55,468 --> 01:03:57,037
and they had a movie-like ending.

1099
01:03:57,038 --> 01:03:59,708
- Even that last nametag. Right?
- You're right.

1100
01:03:59,738 --> 01:04:02,748
The destiny of the Eiffel Tower from their first meeting...

1101
01:04:03,078 --> 01:04:05,217
continued on until the end.

1102
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:06,978
Everyone, go to the Eiffel Tower.

1103
01:04:07,378 --> 01:04:09,717
- Now...
- Who is it?

1104
01:04:09,718 --> 01:04:11,118
Now, Jeong Geun...

1105
01:04:11,618 --> 01:04:12,618
The real star.

1106
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:14,317
- Jeong Geun picked Ji Eun.
- Oh, my.

1107
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:15,958
- He did.
- He picked her.

1108
01:04:16,258 --> 01:04:18,627
He's waiting now. I'm so curious about Ji Eun's decision.

1109
01:04:18,628 --> 01:04:20,398
- Will Ji Eun show up?
- Right.

1110
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:23,568
Or will Ji Eun choose someone else?

1111
01:04:23,728 --> 01:04:25,897
- So Ra is getting so nervous.
- Or will she give up?

1112
01:04:25,898 --> 01:04:27,658
I'm so curious. I'm most curious about this.

1113
01:04:30,168 --> 01:04:36,448
(The sky is getting darker and darker.)

1114
01:04:39,848 --> 01:04:40,978
He's still waiting.

1115
01:04:41,618 --> 01:04:43,858
Even looking at him from the back makes me feel for him.

1116
01:04:55,498 --> 01:04:56,898
"Did she not choose me?"

1117
01:04:59,738 --> 01:05:03,268
"Or did she choose someone else?" I was worried.

1118
01:05:09,508 --> 01:05:11,148
"Did she not choose me?"

1119
01:05:13,818 --> 01:05:17,418
"Or did she choose someone else?" I was worried.

1120
01:05:20,788 --> 01:05:23,428
I don't think she'll come.

1121
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,908
(The sun has almost set.)

1122
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:40,638
I think she'll come.

1123
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:55,728
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my gosh!

1124
01:05:56,128 --> 01:05:57,458
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my gosh!

1125
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,398
- What?
- She came!

1126
01:06:09,908 --> 01:06:12,008
That really surprised me!

1127
01:06:17,778 --> 01:06:22,687
(Ji Eun approaches...)

1128
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:25,418
(Jeong Geun, who is waiting alone.)

1129
01:06:36,268 --> 01:06:37,298
What?

1130
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:39,337
When did you get here?

1131
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:40,338
Just now.

1132
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,638
What took you so long?

1133
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:47,414
We didn't get to see the sunset together.

1134
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:49,008
Oh, we can now.

1135
01:06:56,018 --> 01:06:57,288
I thought you weren't coming.

1136
01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:00,358
Where else would I go?

1137
01:07:09,768 --> 01:07:10,868
Are you wearing it?

1138
01:07:12,598 --> 01:07:14,538
- She's wearing the bracelet!
- The bracelet!

1139
01:07:19,108 --> 01:07:20,337
They're holding hands!

1140
01:07:20,338 --> 01:07:21,578
(They grab each other's hands.)

1141
01:07:25,418 --> 01:07:28,918
- Is this a drama?
- They're so cool.

1142
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:33,188
"Where else would I go?" That said everything.

1143
01:07:36,558 --> 01:07:39,798
Oh, that was insane. Jeong Geun...

1144
01:07:40,928 --> 01:07:43,768
- That's amazing.
- She felt his sincerity.

1145
01:07:52,008 --> 01:07:53,578
I told you...

1146
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:56,408
that no matter what you chose to do,

1147
01:07:58,648 --> 01:08:00,178
it was always you for me.

1148
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:02,488
That's why I came.

1149
01:08:02,848 --> 01:08:04,018
Thank you for coming.

1150
01:08:05,388 --> 01:08:06,418
I was really surprised.

1151
01:08:27,038 --> 01:08:29,208
What could this be? I'll open it.

1152
01:08:32,348 --> 01:08:33,378
What is it?

1153
01:08:35,388 --> 01:08:36,548
There's something inside.

1154
01:08:38,018 --> 01:08:39,088
What is it?

1155
01:08:41,418 --> 01:08:44,388
"Ha Jeong Geun opened the door to his heart to you."

1156
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:47,298
I see.

1157
01:08:50,528 --> 01:08:52,198
You can keep it. I'll keep one too.

1158
01:08:55,308 --> 01:08:56,368
This is nice.

1159
01:08:56,968 --> 01:08:58,007
Treasure it.

1160
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,237
You should get it laminated.

1161
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:01,138
Right, I should treasure this.

1162
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:05,647
(Ha Jeong Geun opened the door to his heart to you.)

1163
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:07,718
- It's so cute.
- Seriously.

1164
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:13,858
It's so pretty.

1165
01:09:13,988 --> 01:09:15,927
- We need to take one like this.
- Oh, my.

1166
01:09:15,928 --> 01:09:16,928
This is it.

1167
01:09:19,128 --> 01:09:20,628
One, two, three.

1168
01:09:22,028 --> 01:09:23,368
This is so pretty.

1169
01:09:25,068 --> 01:09:26,797
(Choi Ji Eun opened the door to her heart to you.)

1170
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:28,878
(Ha Jeong Geun opened the door to his heart to you.)

1171
01:09:29,368 --> 01:09:30,708
They look good together.

1172
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:32,508
They do.

1173
01:09:35,178 --> 01:09:38,648
I noticed there was just one sheet left.

1174
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:42,948
Let's just take one photo together.

1175
01:09:45,418 --> 01:09:46,557
I can press it like this.

1176
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,278
Should we get our bracelets in the picture?

1177
01:09:49,288 --> 01:09:50,457
(Jeong Geun and Ji Eun are sitting so close together.)

1178
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:51,528
Like this?

1179
01:09:51,558 --> 01:09:53,198
Should we take it like this?

1180
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,797
I'll have to press it well.

1181
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:57,067
(A picture together after becoming a final couple)

1182
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,167
- This looks good, right?
- Yes.

1183
01:09:58,168 --> 01:09:59,798
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1184
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:02,037
- There we go.
- Nice.

1185
01:10:02,038 --> 01:10:03,168
That was good, right?

1186
01:10:03,538 --> 01:10:04,738
It's done now.

1187
01:10:04,838 --> 01:10:05,908
Zero.

1188
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:10,278
We finished the film with our picture.

1189
01:10:10,648 --> 01:10:12,418
That's romantic.

1190
01:10:20,118 --> 01:10:22,027
Okay. Let's go somewhere warm.

1191
01:10:22,028 --> 01:10:25,227
(Final Couple, Choi Ji Eun and Ha Jeong Geun)

1192
01:10:25,228 --> 01:10:26,697
Thank you for coming.

1193
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:29,928
(Final Couple, Choi Ji Eun and Ha Jeong Geun)

1194
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:37,538
- Gwan Hee.
- Oh, yes.

1195
01:10:37,808 --> 01:10:39,777
- There were some hardships, - Oh, yes.

1196
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:41,437
But good work.

1197
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:42,548
Good work.

1198
01:10:43,178 --> 01:10:44,807
I'm so relieved and glad.

1199
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:46,817
It took some time, but she felt his sincerity.

1200
01:10:46,818 --> 01:10:48,424
(Eventually, Ji Eun felt Jeong Geun's sincerity.)

1201
01:10:48,448 --> 01:10:50,687
Actually, So Ra and I...

1202
01:10:50,688 --> 01:10:53,257
each picked Jeong Geun and Ji Eun...

1203
01:10:53,258 --> 01:10:54,687
- For their dates, right?
- in the beginning. Yes.

1204
01:10:54,688 --> 01:10:57,327
I didn't imagine that connection...

1205
01:10:57,328 --> 01:10:59,127
- will last until the end like this.
- Yes.

1206
01:10:59,128 --> 01:11:01,828
Actually, until now,

1207
01:11:02,298 --> 01:11:04,327
I always thought...

1208
01:11:04,328 --> 01:11:06,837
my speed of dating was the only right one,

1209
01:11:06,838 --> 01:11:10,808
but from seeing many people's speeds they take when dating,

1210
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:13,007
I thought...

1211
01:11:13,008 --> 01:11:17,077
I should be better at matching the other person's speed.

1212
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:18,448
Self-reflection?

1213
01:11:18,748 --> 01:11:21,017
- It made me reflect on myself, yes.
- Of course.

1214
01:11:21,018 --> 01:11:22,917
- Yes, we can learn.
- Yes.

1215
01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:24,287
Now, we have...

1216
01:11:24,288 --> 01:11:26,318
- The last person.
- We have three couples.

1217
01:11:26,718 --> 01:11:27,787
Sin Young is up next.

1218
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:29,987
Why are you showing this part? It's sad.

1219
01:11:29,988 --> 01:11:31,057
Actually,

1220
01:11:31,058 --> 01:11:32,527
as we watched, we all said,

1221
01:11:32,528 --> 01:11:35,467
"This is a really good person,"

1222
01:11:35,468 --> 01:11:37,867
- most often about Sin Young.
- You're right.

1223
01:11:37,868 --> 01:11:39,238
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1224
01:11:42,368 --> 01:11:48,508
(One door has not yet opened.)

1225
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:55,018
(The eighth Final Pick, Kim Sin Young)

1226
01:11:57,748 --> 01:12:02,058
(Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?)

1227
01:12:09,028 --> 01:12:10,998
She's thinking about it quite a lot.

1228
01:12:13,098 --> 01:12:16,137
Honestly, Sin Young listened to many people's concerns,

1229
01:12:16,138 --> 01:12:18,208
but Sin Young could be the most confused right now.

1230
01:12:22,278 --> 01:12:26,578
(After thinking for a while, Sin Young make her Final Pick.)

1231
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:30,348
(And Sin Young chose...)

1232
01:12:30,918 --> 01:12:33,917
(No name tags have been ripped off.)

1233
01:12:33,918 --> 01:12:35,858
- She didn't vote.
- She didn't do it.

1234
01:12:42,598 --> 01:12:43,827
I...

1235
01:12:43,828 --> 01:12:47,238
had really opened my heart...

1236
01:12:47,768 --> 01:12:51,338
and closed it again, saying, "Bye!"

1237
01:12:52,038 --> 01:12:55,547
Since he specifically told me,

1238
01:12:55,548 --> 01:12:57,607
"I think it'll be hard because of these things,"

1239
01:12:57,608 --> 01:12:59,578
I was able to decide.

1240
01:13:01,348 --> 01:13:02,448
So...

1241
01:13:02,988 --> 01:13:05,258
I was able to get closure.

1242
01:13:05,758 --> 01:13:07,857
I really had no regrets.

1243
01:13:07,858 --> 01:13:09,088
(I have no regrets.)

1244
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:17,398
(Sin Young didn't choose anyone for Final Pick.)

1245
01:13:22,508 --> 01:13:25,538
(Previous night)

1246
01:13:28,038 --> 01:13:29,148
- What?
- What?

1247
01:13:30,248 --> 01:13:36,718
(Sin Young came out alone while everyone was asleep.)

1248
01:13:40,088 --> 01:13:44,658
(And one letter at a time...)

1249
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:46,228
- What?
- What?

1250
01:13:46,698 --> 01:13:47,797
A letter?

1251
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:50,997
(She wrote a letter through the night.)

1252
01:13:50,998 --> 01:13:52,198
Who did she write that to?

1253
01:13:55,438 --> 01:14:01,607
(The recipient of that letter)

1254
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:08,218
(Hyun Jin)

1255
01:14:09,818 --> 01:14:13,988
(He looked at the letter for a long time.)

1256
01:14:20,598 --> 01:14:21,758
One moment.

1257
01:14:22,868 --> 01:14:25,798
"Hyun Jin, you left a short but intense impression on me."

1258
01:14:25,968 --> 01:14:27,997
(Hi, Hyun Jin!)

1259
01:14:27,998 --> 01:14:30,107
"I could feel that each of your words and actions..."

1260
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:33,178
"were naturally full of consideration,"

1261
01:14:34,038 --> 01:14:35,447
"and thanks to you, I was able..."

1262
01:14:35,448 --> 01:14:37,048
"to have a comfortable time. Thank you."

1263
01:14:38,048 --> 01:14:39,717
"I hope you always remember..."

1264
01:14:39,718 --> 01:14:41,047
"that you're a cool person, just the way you are."

1265
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:42,087
(I hope you always remember...)

1266
01:14:42,088 --> 01:14:43,117
(that you're a cool person, just the way you are.)

1267
01:14:43,118 --> 01:14:44,148
Yes.

1268
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:46,988
One moment.

1269
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,728
What's wrong with me?

1270
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:51,228
This is...

1271
01:15:07,778 --> 01:15:08,948
I...

1272
01:15:09,348 --> 01:15:11,278
managed to hold my tears back...

1273
01:15:11,748 --> 01:15:13,318
when I was talking to Sin Young,

1274
01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:15,018
but I...

1275
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:19,288
Oh, this is so...

1276
01:15:22,058 --> 01:15:23,188
Oh, gosh.

1277
01:15:25,028 --> 01:15:29,668
I felt that she was even more of a warm-hearted person...

1278
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:32,198
than I previously felt or thought.

1279
01:15:33,038 --> 01:15:34,568
That's what I felt.

1280
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:42,278
Yes.

1281
01:15:55,288 --> 01:15:57,858
Sin Young is always so cool.

1282
01:15:58,288 --> 01:16:00,028
Oh, gosh. I...

1283
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:03,197
Even as she left, she wrote such kind words...

1284
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:04,327
- in her letter.
- Seriously.

1285
01:16:04,328 --> 01:16:05,538
That just...

1286
01:16:07,268 --> 01:16:09,567
Sin Young...

1287
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:11,408
- really is a good person.
- She is.

1288
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:13,807
I worried a lot...

1289
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:15,977
about recommending Sin Young for this...

1290
01:16:15,978 --> 01:16:20,118
because I didn't want to see my friend receiving hate.

1291
01:16:20,518 --> 01:16:22,217
I really didn't want her...

1292
01:16:22,218 --> 01:16:24,088
to get hurt..

1293
01:16:24,448 --> 01:16:25,517
I get you.

1294
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:27,917
(Ye Eun was worried about Sin Young getting hurt.)

1295
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:29,087
Don't cry.

1296
01:16:29,088 --> 01:16:32,498
(Ye Eun was worried about Sin Young getting hurt.)

1297
01:16:36,528 --> 01:16:39,368
She's my friend from middle school.

1298
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:42,267
She asked, "You're going to introduce me on TV?"

1299
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:44,608
She was deeply moved and started crying.

1300
01:16:44,868 --> 01:16:47,637
"It's a very hard thing to introduce someone like that."

1301
01:16:47,638 --> 01:16:50,078
"You think this highly of me?"

1302
01:16:50,248 --> 01:16:51,607
I felt so grateful...

1303
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:52,777
- to have a friend like her.
- Totally.

1304
01:16:52,778 --> 01:16:54,517
We became even closer.

1305
01:16:54,518 --> 01:16:55,817
I'm not normally the type...

1306
01:16:55,818 --> 01:16:59,688
that is very interested in other people's dating lives,

1307
01:16:59,858 --> 01:17:02,128
but this show was different.

1308
01:17:02,828 --> 01:17:05,697
Seeing such a good friend date...

1309
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:07,297
made me get more into it...

1310
01:17:07,298 --> 01:17:08,497
and enjoy it more.

1311
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:11,268
I laughed and cried with them as we watched.

1312
01:17:11,428 --> 01:17:14,697
That means we really introduced really good people.

1313
01:17:14,698 --> 01:17:16,737
- Totally.
- I feel so proud about that.

1314
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:22,038
(We laughed and cried with our really good friends.)

1315
01:17:22,278 --> 01:17:25,108
(Do you want to find love?)

1316
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,618
(When I think of "really good person," you come to mind.)

1317
01:17:29,018 --> 01:17:31,488
(Our story of finding love.)

1318
01:17:31,518 --> 01:17:32,817
First,

1319
01:17:32,818 --> 01:17:34,117
cover your mouth when you laugh.

1320
01:17:34,118 --> 01:17:35,118
Oh, you're always...

1321
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:36,187
(Because it was my friend, )

1322
01:17:36,188 --> 01:17:39,028
(I was extra sincere about it.)

1323
01:17:39,328 --> 01:17:41,004
(Warm, thoughtful advice from our Lovebuds)

1324
01:17:41,028 --> 01:17:42,567
Plan on becoming the second Lee Gwan Hee.

1325
01:17:42,568 --> 01:17:44,468
(If you add one more spoon, it'll be perfect.)

1326
01:17:44,568 --> 01:17:45,898
(Repulsed)

1327
01:17:46,138 --> 01:17:47,168
Come on.

1328
01:17:47,298 --> 01:17:48,638
If you really like someone,

1329
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:50,438
I want you to actively express yourself.

1330
01:17:50,468 --> 01:17:52,278
Take a noodle like this...

1331
01:17:52,538 --> 01:17:54,208
Accidentally, you...

1332
01:17:54,538 --> 01:17:56,847
(The good parts of my friend...)

1333
01:17:56,848 --> 01:18:00,678
(only real friends know about)

1334
01:18:01,118 --> 01:18:03,688
Just don't try to do anything, okay?

1335
01:18:03,718 --> 01:18:06,018
Just show yourself as you are.

1336
01:18:06,388 --> 01:18:08,017
Going forward,

1337
01:18:08,018 --> 01:18:09,927
I was to repay her in many ways...

1338
01:18:09,928 --> 01:18:12,088
and express my gratitude.

1339
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:14,328
Young Kwang.

1340
01:18:14,698 --> 01:18:16,967
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

1341
01:18:16,968 --> 01:18:17,968
(I'll definitely treat you to a nice meal.)

1342
01:18:17,969 --> 01:18:19,938
Now that I think about it,

1343
01:18:20,068 --> 01:18:22,467
I think it was right...

1344
01:18:22,468 --> 01:18:24,468
to mix in a spoonful of Lee Gwan Hee.

1345
01:18:24,538 --> 01:18:27,378
She really did feel bad for me.

1346
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:29,777
Please don't get mad at me...

1347
01:18:29,778 --> 01:18:31,077
while you watch.

1348
01:18:31,078 --> 01:18:32,594
(Don't get mad at me while you watch!)

1349
01:18:32,618 --> 01:18:33,777
Regardless, I got to meet...

1350
01:18:33,778 --> 01:18:36,848
many good people here, thanks to you.

1351
01:18:36,888 --> 01:18:38,188
Mi Joo.

1352
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,858
I think what we want most for each other...

1353
01:18:42,558 --> 01:18:44,128
is for us to be happy.

1354
01:18:44,658 --> 01:18:46,757
I'm so grateful...

1355
01:18:46,758 --> 01:18:48,397
for the Champagne and the poetry book.

1356
01:18:48,398 --> 01:18:49,868
(Thank you so much, Sae Ho.)

1357
01:18:49,968 --> 01:18:51,467
In the end,

1358
01:18:51,468 --> 01:18:53,398
I think she might be disappointed,

1359
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:55,408
but one-sided love is love too, you know.

1360
01:19:01,578 --> 01:19:04,907
I met a really good person.

1361
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:06,417
I'm grateful.

1362
01:19:06,418 --> 01:19:07,747
I'm honored.

1363
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:09,847
There were so many good people.

1364
01:19:09,848 --> 01:19:11,188
We made nice memories.

1365
01:19:11,218 --> 01:19:12,758
I want to see you all for a long time.

1366
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:15,517
Genuinely good people.

1367
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:21,097
(Date My Friend knocked on the door of our hearts!)

1368
01:19:21,098 --> 01:19:22,227
(So look.)

1369
01:19:22,228 --> 01:19:23,897
(I know a really good person.)

1370
01:19:23,898 --> 01:19:25,867
(I'll introduce you to them.)

1371
01:19:25,868 --> 01:19:27,868
(Knock on the door to their heart.)

1372
01:19:28,098 --> 01:19:30,868
(I guarantee my friend is a good person.)

1373
01:19:30,968 --> 01:19:33,178
(Date My Friend)
