1
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,190
(You know what?)

2
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,760
(I actually know someone really great.)

3
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,661
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

4
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,701
(Just open your heart a little.)

5
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,601
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

6
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:25,916
(Date My Friend)

7
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,434
(Right here, right now,)

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,150
(there are people looking for their special someone.)

9
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:31,775
(Mi Joo's friend, Lee Da Hye)

10
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,245
(Nam Hee's friend, Oh Hyun Jin)

11
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:35,115
(Gwan Hee's friend, Ha Jeong Geun)

12
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:36,815
(Ye Eun's friend, Kim Sin Young)

13
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:38,415
(Young Kwang's friend, Kang Su Jin)

14
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:40,355
(Sae Ho's friend, Kim Geon Wu)

15
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:42,385
(These genuinely good people...)

16
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:45,455
(had their intense first encounter.)

17
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:47,725
(The signals have begun.)

18
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:49,794
In terms of first impressions, I think...

19
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:51,565
Da Hye was the most attractive woman.

20
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:53,694
I want to get to know her.

21
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:54,935
Are you a musician?

22
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:58,805
(Tensions flared, even though they had just met.)

23
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,235
The bee is coming at me.

24
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:02,105
Isn't it supposed to go to her?

25
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:04,844
(Da Hye is the flower.)

26
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:06,844
Something about Da Hye...

27
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,415
caught my eye.

28
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:10,845
(Da Hye's signal...)

29
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:13,055
I was curious about Jeong Geun.

30
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:15,025
I was hoping we could have a private chat.

31
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:20,125
(Their feelings for each other started to blossom.)

32
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:21,924
You've got something on your clothes.

33
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:24,124
If that brought up my interest in him,

34
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,295
I believe it's true.

35
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:28,165
(He seemed like a warm person.)

36
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:31,235
(The more they spend time together, the more their feelings grow.)

37
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,734
(There are two more...)

38
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,035
(genuinely good people.)

39
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:36,145
(Young Ji's friend, Shin Dong Ha)

40
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,215
(So Ra's friend, Choi Ji Eun)

41
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:40,515
- Hello.
- Hello.

42
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,261
- What?
- Are there two more?

43
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,115
When I saw Ji Eun,

44
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,115
the impact was huge.

45
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:49,585
(I thought she was a K-pop idol.)

46
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,695
When I first saw Ji Eun,

47
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:55,025
I was in a good mood.

48
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,264
Hello. I am...

49
00:01:57,265 --> 00:02:00,335
Actress Kang So Ra's friend, Choi Ji Eun.

50
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:01,565
It's great to see you.

51
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:03,535
- We have finally all gathered.
- Right.

52
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:08,075
(They had to select the first person they were interested in.)

53
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:10,275
(The person Da Hye chose was...)

54
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:13,475
(Jeong Geun, with whom she had some private time)

55
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:17,145
(Jeong Geun's choice)

56
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,514
(Choi Ji Eun)

57
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,055
The person who knocked on my heart today was...

58
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:24,954
Choi Ji Eun.

59
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,965
(Lee Mi Joo and her friend, Lee Da Hye)

60
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,295
(Lee Gwan Hee and his friend, Ha Jeong Geun)

61
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:32,835
(Ji Ye Eun and her friend, Kim Sin Young)

62
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:35,505
(Cho Sae Ho and his friend, Kim Geon Wu)

63
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:38,005
(Kim Nam Hee and his friend, Oh Hyun Jin)

64
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:41,545
(Kim Young Kwang and his friend, Kang Su Jin)

65
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:45,375
(Hur Young Ji and her friend, Shin Dong Ha)

66
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:49,115
(Kang So Ra and her friend, Choi Ji Eun)

67
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:57,325
I'm already feeling butterflies.

68
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,755
I feel like they'll be going on dates today.

69
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:00,054
- Right.
- That's right.

70
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,294
I'd like to apologise first because my friend is...

71
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,635
- the star of the show.
- Be quiet!

72
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:06,634
- Be quiet!
- The rest won't have screen time.

73
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:07,765
Zip it!

74
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:09,564
- I am so sorry for that.
- She said, "Zip it."

75
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,834
- She said, "Zip it." - I'm sorry.

76
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:12,905
- She said, "Zip it." - This is so draining.

77
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:15,204
The name tags were the highlight of last week.

78
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:16,274
- Right.
- That's right.

79
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:17,474
I really couldn't sleep.

80
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:19,674
The choices each made by Mi Joo's and Gwan Hee's friends...

81
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,815
- had us going wild.
- Yes.

82
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,614
- It was the first impressions vote.
- Right.

83
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:25,054
I think Da Hye had faith in the first impressions vote...

84
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,854
when she chose Jeong Geun.

85
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:28,724
If you think about it, Da Hye...

86
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,125
- She's already angry.
- had also been swayed...

87
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:31,530
- by Geon Wu.
- Why are you so angry?

88
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,054
- What?
- Why are you so angry?

89
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,124
I have a right to be angry about my friend.

90
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,695
- That's right.
- Here's my reason.

91
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:39,165
Based on first impressions, Da Hye chose Jeong Geun.

92
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:42,104
However, Jeong Geun...

93
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:43,434
- Right.
- He chose Ji Eun.

94
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,104
- chose the last one to arrive.
- That's betrayal.

95
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:46,819
He chose Ji Eun.

96
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:49,244
- He grocery-shopped with Da Hye.
- Right, they went grocery shopping.

97
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:50,774
- He held her waist too.
- Right, he...

98
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,614
He dusted off the sugar from her back.

99
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,014
But as time passed,

100
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:56,214
if Da Hye had tried harder...

101
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,454
to win over Jeong Geun,

102
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,624
- Gosh.
- things could have been different.

103
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,654
- That's interesting.
- Okay.

104
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:03,754
- Okay.
- That's interesting.

105
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:05,094
- We have yet to see.
- It's only been the first day.

106
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,524
- It's only been the first day.
- The first day.

107
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:07,654
- We don't know yet.
- Of course.

108
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:09,095
- This isn't the important part.
- Right.

109
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:11,264
- When they leave Geoje Island, - Right.

110
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:13,494
- who they leave with is important.
- That's right.

111
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,605
Since we don't know yet, why don't we keep on watching?

112
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:16,935
- Knock knock.
- Sounds good.

113
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,644
(Nam Hee's friend, Hyun Jin, stepped up to man the grill.)

114
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:27,345
Hyun Jin is the only one working again.

115
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:30,784
- Why does he keep doing work?
- Do you want to add that...

116
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:32,355
- right now?
- It's for everyone's sake.

117
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,214
- I'm fine with anything. Yes.
- Anything?

118
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:36,055
- Well, then...
- Should we?

119
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,895
- Sure. What...
- This is salt.

120
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:44,017
This is going to be so good. Did you start the fire?

121
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:45,935
- Yes.
- What about that one? Is it ready?

122
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,134
That's beef, so it won't take long to cook.

123
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:49,965
We can grill it when everyone is here.

124
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,706
- Gosh.
- We believe in you, Chef.

125
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,575
The pork shoulder will take a long time, so I'll start with that.

126
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:58,044
Is Hyun Jin good with the grill as he is with coffee?

127
00:04:58,045 --> 00:04:59,844
- He enjoys grilling meat.
- He does?

128
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,945
He makes sure he's in charge of the grill every time.

129
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,684
That kind of behaviour tells me that when he gets married,

130
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:08,124
he’d be a really responsible husband in the future.

131
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,955
(Gentleman Hyun Jin takes over the grill for everyone.)

132
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:14,565
(All eyes are on Hyun Jin as he grills the pork.)

133
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:21,664
We'll grill the beef when everyone gets here.

134
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:23,005
It won't take long to cook anyway...

135
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:24,875
when the grill is lit.

136
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,374
- Do we have foil?
- We have to buy some tomorrow.

137
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,775
(He opens the lid.)

138
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:34,075
See? This is going to take longer than we thought.

139
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:37,615
Let me see.

140
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:38,615
(Turning the meat over)

141
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:40,815
Gosh.

142
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:43,925
If we keep the lid closed, the fire won't burn.

143
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:45,654
(First the coffee, and now the grill is also not working out.)

144
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:46,824
The coffee didn't turn out well.

145
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,825
And now the pork isn't grilling properly. Goodness.

146
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,395
The pork isn’t cooking at all.

147
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:52,635
It's really...

148
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,735
- Let me help you with the pork.
- Gosh.

149
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:01,305
I suddenly feel really pressured.

150
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:06,045
(Sae Ho's friend, Geon Wu, joins grill duty.)

151
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,115
(Eyes wide in panic)

152
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,985
- Call me if you need to take turns.
- Thanks.

153
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:10,785
But I'm fine.

154
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:13,285
(How is Geon Wu with the grill?)

155
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,355
(He's checking the temperature!)

156
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,295
The beef might take longer.

157
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,325
- I'm...
- That sounds great.

158
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:22,795
I'll have to do this.

159
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:30,234
What are you up to? Was this intentional?

160
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:32,605
- Yes, I followed the fire.
- I thought you were making art.

161
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:34,105
The fire is too weak.

162
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:36,905
- Goodness.
- Nice.

163
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:38,344
- That's art.
- Nice.

164
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:39,444
He's very attentive to details.

165
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,944
Did you like that? He's very detail-oriented.

166
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,714
Why does he have to do all that to grill pork?

167
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:46,054
It's because the heat is spread out across the grill.

168
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:47,055
So he followed the shape of the fire.

169
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:48,554
It doesn't seem like things are working out for Hyun Jin.

170
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,055
How's the pork?

171
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,055
(Meanwhile, Hyun Jin)

172
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:55,525
"This is a disaster."

173
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,735
I was a bit flustered.

174
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:02,565
I thought to myself, "What should I do?"

175
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:05,274
- It's not cooking.
- What is he doing?

176
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,505
That grill is the problem.

177
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,805
Nothing is working out for him.

178
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:09,974
(Hyun Jin is feeling pressure from Geon Wu's grilling skills.)

179
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:11,205
Fate is messing with him.

180
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:15,284
You must be hot. Maybe I should step in.

181
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:16,345
No, I'm fine.

182
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:20,785
- He's grilling artistically.
- Right? I saw that.

183
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:23,194
This wasn't my intention,

184
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:24,427
but somehow it turned out this way.

185
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,925
I enjoy grilling meat.

186
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:31,965
I've actually grilled meat for Sae Ho many times.

187
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:34,634
(Me?)

188
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,405
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

189
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:37,934
Maybe that's why he's so good.

190
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:39,174
(Did Geon Wu get his grilling skills thanks to Sae Ho?)

191
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:39,956
No, that's not...

192
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:41,147
But somehow it turned out this way.

193
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:46,875
(She can't seem to leave Geon Wu's side by the grill.)

194
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:50,545
I didn't make it obvious.

195
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:53,515
But when Geon Wu was grilling the pork,

196
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,824
I caught myself focusing on him.

197
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:58,325
I realised I was being drawn toward Geon Wu.

198
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,625
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

199
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:04,795
Goodness.

200
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,804
Right now, we have to do this first.

201
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,304
She's not leaving his side.

202
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:12,334
- She's really not leaving.
- This grill is different.

203
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:13,735
It's not like charcoal grills.

204
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:16,075
This is going to be great. The smell is amazing.

205
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,415
Goodness.

206
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:28,954
- Did you finish it?
- Yes.

207
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:31,085
I don't have to rinse it, right? It's empty.

208
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:33,425
You can give me your cup.

209
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:42,835
You don't have to finish it.

210
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,705
- What is it?
- I'll hang onto this for later.

211
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,905
- I'll take that for you.
- Gosh, thank you.

212
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:53,745
(Glancing over)

213
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:06,655
(After some thinking with Ji Eun's coke in his hand,)

214
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:12,494
(Jeong Geun puts the cup in the fridge to keep it cool.)

215
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:14,365
He's so considerate.

216
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:16,965
That definitely adds to his charm.

217
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:20,405
The vegetable juice is flowing out.

218
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,445
- This is...
- That's insane.

219
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,745
The pork looks amazing.

220
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,314
- Are you starting to feel hungry?
- Yes.

221
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,345
(Finally, it's cooked.)

222
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:33,955
(Grilled pork that Hyun Jin struggled to cook)

223
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:36,485
Take a photo.

224
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,125
(Artistic beef that Geon Wu grilled)

225
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:40,255
The meat looks great.

226
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,664
- Please come over now.
- Come over.

227
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,124
- Shall we eat now?
- Thank you for the work.

228
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,224
It looks a bit dangerous.

229
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:45,494
- Thanks.
- It doesn't look stable.

230
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:46,894
- Thanks for grilling meat.
- It was nothing.

231
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:48,904
Seriously. Thank you for grilling meat.

232
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:49,935
(The dinner table is filled with various foods.)

233
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:56,644
How about this? If I'm already on it,

234
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,145
- it's okay, right?
- I was once...

235
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:01,075
Exactly. When are you going to take it out?

236
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,985
I think you're scared of that sound.

237
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:08,884
When a drone was flying over here, I was...

238
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:10,154
- I was really startled.
- Are there more power cables?

239
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:12,424
- Yes, there are a lot.
- It tastes so good.

240
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,555
Do you need tissues?

241
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:17,595
Didn't you chew a bone?

242
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,195
- No?
- It's really good.

243
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,475
It's so good.

244
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,414
- Did you get it from the fridge?
- Yes.

245
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:35,545
I put it in the fridge.

246
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,515
- Thanks.
- It's probably flat, though.

247
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,514
- I actually like flat soda.
- Really?

248
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,555
I have a weird taste, don't I?

249
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:42,855
It's really tender.

250
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,334
- It's a party on Geoje Island.
- I would be so moved by that.

251
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:54,135
- I'd be touched, too.
- I'd be really touched.

252
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:58,734
(Da Hye is focusing on eating meat without joining the conversation.)

253
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:00,505
I don't think it's something to talk over dinner.

254
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,575
- She's eating well.
- Da Hye is so cute.

255
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:05,975
She's so cute.

256
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,445
The meat.

257
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,285
He's smiling.

258
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,285
Jeong Geun. Just choose one.

259
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:18,924
- But...
- Jeong Geun. Just choose one.

260
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,494
- He's just looking at her.
- Don't do that.

261
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:21,965
He's looking at everyone.

262
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:24,824
You're eating...

263
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:26,635
- quite a lot.
- Am I?

264
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:27,994
You look like you could...

265
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,965
only eat a small amount.

266
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:31,265
You eat more than I thought.

267
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,834
I don't gain much weight for how much I eat.

268
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:34,135
For how much I eat.

269
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:39,475
- I'll...
- Ji Eun, do you want more wine?

270
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:41,965
No, thanks.

271
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:43,606
Drink more. Why not?

272
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:45,139
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

273
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:47,014
- Drink more.
- No.

274
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:49,355
- Is she feeling tipsy?
- I bet my face turned red.

275
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:53,825
Didn't you put on blush?

276
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,160
I did, but...

277
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,095
it became pointless to put it on.

278
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:00,665
Did my face also turn red?

279
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:02,035
- No.
- No.

280
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:05,604
What's wrong with Jeong Geun?

281
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,435
Her love bud's face turned red now.

282
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,117
I'll be calm and quiet again.

283
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,685
Look at the camera.

284
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,384
One, two, three.

285
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:20,254
(Will this moment be remembered...)

286
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:21,354
You all look cute.

287
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:22,425
(as a special memory in someone's heart?)

288
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:27,524
Can I bring my camera?

289
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,665
- Yes, please.
- Good.

290
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:32,565
Gosh. That looks like a professional camera.

291
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,834
Everyone is an artist.

292
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:35,905
You're right.

293
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:37,834
- Isn't it Le... camera?
- Yes, it is.

294
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:39,204
I knew it.

295
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:41,004
- That's my dream camera.
- Really?

296
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:42,745
- That's a really expensive camera.
- Is that so?

297
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,274
I'll take a photo of you all together.

298
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,275
That sounds good.

299
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:47,675
Then, you can't be in the photo with us.

300
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:48,944
She cares about Geon Wu.

301
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:50,244
She said, "You can't be in the photo."

302
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:51,984
- "You can't be in the photo." - Then, he can't be in the photo.

303
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:54,115
How about putting the camera on there?

304
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:56,485
All of you, please look at the camera.

305
00:12:56,885 --> 00:12:59,025
I think he wants to take a photo of us first.

306
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:01,225
One, two, three.

307
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,505
- He looks cool.
- It's...

308
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,405
- Geon Wu is attractive.
- He is.

309
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:14,775
He doesn't talk much.

310
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:16,545
Here's how the photo came out.

311
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:22,245
(Da Hye burst into laughter after seeing the photo.)

312
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,944
Doesn't it look good?

313
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,684
(Sin Young becomes curious and also checks out the photo.)

314
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,955
I look so funny in that photo.

315
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:30,525
- Okay, I'll take a photo now.
- The photo came out great.

316
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,354
- Do I take a photo just like this?
- The exposure was high there,

317
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,664
- so the photo turned out like this.
- I see.

318
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:36,765
- Right.
- Okay.

319
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,594
- Do I take a photo just like this?
- The exposure was high there,

320
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:42,235
- so the photo turned out like this.
- I see.

321
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,404
- This side is too bright.
- Yes.

322
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:46,504
Would it work if we put it up here?

323
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:47,805
Should I sit over here?

324
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:49,774
Da Hye is stealing...

325
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,104
my friend's spot.

326
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,874
No, she's not.

327
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,245
- Da Hye didn't have any choice.
- That could be possible.

328
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:56,844
- That could be possible.
- Ji Ye Eun.

329
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:58,714
Can't you see my friend is only watching one man?

330
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:00,954
Just give it some time. My friend is also like your friend.

331
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,825
Let's just keep watching.

332
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,424
Should I sit here?

333
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:05,554
Everyone.

334
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:08,225
- Let's take a photo with Geon Wu.
- Okay.

335
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:12,595
One, two, three.

336
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,735
One, two, three.

337
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:16,435
One, two, three.

338
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:19,105
- Smiling? Smiling photo?
- You can eat now.

339
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:21,774
I like your camera, How did the photo turn out?

340
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:23,045
It looks great.

341
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,675
I felt grateful.

342
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,574
I'm usually not in photos since I’m the one taking them,

343
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,615
so I appreciated that she made sure to include me.

344
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:32,415
I checked the photo she took,

345
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:33,915
and they were great.

346
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,125
Cheers?

347
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:38,855
- Cheers.
- I finished...

348
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,034
- It was great.
- It was delicious.

349
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:50,434
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

350
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:52,005
- Why don't we drink after clean up?
- Sure.

351
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:57,774
Are you going to heat it before washing it? How?

352
00:14:57,775 --> 00:14:59,574
- You know that, don't you? It's...
- We don't have a choice.

353
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:01,445
- Be careful when it's hot.
- Yes.

354
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:02,884
Anyway, we'll use it...

355
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:04,344
- Jeong Geun.
- when we do the dishes.

356
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:05,654
Do the dishes. Help her.

357
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,384
Ji Eun, why don't you wear the rubber gloves?

358
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:08,554
- That's right.
- Yes.

359
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:10,825
- There are rubber gloves.
- Yes, why don't you wear them?

360
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:14,055
I don't usually wear rubber gloves.

361
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:17,894
Ji Eun, there are...

362
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:19,664
- just too many dirty dishes.
- We can take over here.

363
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:21,435
- Let's do it together.
- We'll switch for you.

364
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:23,935
- Hand them to me, then I'll rinse.
- They're doing it together.

365
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,675
They look like newlyweds.

366
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,744
- Are you good at doing the dishes?
- Me?

367
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,715
Why aren't you both wearing the rubber gloves?

368
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:38,554
I also don't wear rubber gloves when I do the dishes.

369
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:39,785
- Really?
- Yes.

370
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:41,114
I just do my best.

371
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:44,185
I'm not sure if I'm doing it well, but I just do my best.

372
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,854
- Could you pass me paper towels?
- Sure.

373
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:48,994
It's here.

374
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,725
- Thanks.
- Oh, sure.

375
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:52,195
It's finally here.

376
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:53,794
It's done.

377
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:56,064
- Thanks for doing the dishes.
- Thanks.

378
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:57,204
- Did you finish it?
- Thanks.

379
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:58,474
- Thanks.
- It was the least thing I could do.

380
00:15:58,475 --> 00:15:59,935
Good job.

381
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:01,135
(Good job and thanks, Ji Eun)

382
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:02,245
The least thing.

383
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:03,844
(High five?)

384
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,275
He made natural physical contact.

385
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,115
I never expected she'd do a high five.

386
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:10,184
The reason I kept telling her to drink more is...

387
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,085
because she always raises her guard.

388
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:13,484
So, I wanted her to open up.

389
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:14,884
But she seemed to have opened up already.

390
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:17,524
- I know. She did a high five.
- She opened up.

391
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:20,254
I have no idea who Jeong Geun...

392
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,354
- is into now.
- I have no idea.

393
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,195
I think Jeong Geun gave her a high-five...

394
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:25,564
- to say, "It's you." - What?

395
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:27,194
- I think it was along those lines.
- "From now on, it's only you."

396
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,264
- "It's you." - But...

397
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:29,704
I think that signal was meant for that.

398
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:31,135
I think my friend...

399
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:33,405
is interested in Geon Wu.

400
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,975
But...

401
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,875
Geon Wu seems to be into Da Hye.

402
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:39,114
- When Da Hye was taking a photo, - Right.

403
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,114
she flirted with him.

404
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:42,245
- I'm sorry.
- Right.

405
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:44,314
It's okay. You don't need to be sorry.

406
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:45,615
Is it okay?

407
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,814
Excuse me.

408
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:49,185
- I'm just going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

409
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,294
She's going to the Heart Room.

410
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:58,764
- I'm so curious.
- I was most curious about her pick.

411
00:16:58,765 --> 00:16:59,794
I'm really curious.

412
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,305
(Sin Young enters the Heart Room to make her choice.)

413
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:10,245
(Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?)

414
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:22,055
(Is she thrilled just by seeing his name?)

415
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:28,994
- She's removing the name tag.
- Yes.

416
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,194
Who is he?

417
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:31,294
(Sin Young chose Geon Wu, Sae Ho's friend.)

418
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:32,535
- She chose my friend.
- I knew it.

419
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,034
I chose him.

420
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:37,104
(I chose him.)

421
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:38,135
I want...

422
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:39,735
to get to know him more.

423
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:44,445
He seems to have a somewhat secretive side.

424
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,475
Yes.

425
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:51,245
What is it?

426
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:52,955
(Love bud Guarantee from the Love bud)

427
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:54,114
- Love bud Guarantee.
- Love bud Guarantee.

428
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,355
(Love bud Guarantee from the Love bud)

429
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,555
(How will the Love bud Guarantee from Sae Ho be helpful?)

430
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,125
In this photo,

431
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:03,864
he looks so cool.

432
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,694
(She likes his photo on Love bud Guarantee.)

433
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,894
She likes it. This is good.

434
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:09,704
- He's so cool.
- Oh, my gosh.

435
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:11,404
She seems to be in love.

436
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,675
- She looks like she fell in love.
- Yes, she looks like it.

437
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:21,874
I'll ask...

438
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,384
(To Sae Ho)

439
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:24,945
many questions to Geon Wu.

440
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:26,515
I see.

441
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:30,755
Because Geon Wu is shy,

442
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:33,224
I wrote that I hope someone comes to him first.

443
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:34,694
- You want someone to lead him.
- Sin Young...

444
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:36,064
approaches someone she's interested in.

445
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:37,664
- She's really straightforward.
- That's good.

446
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:38,864
That's great. They could be a perfect match.

447
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:40,635
- They could be a good fit together.
- She won't step back.

448
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:42,604
- She won't step back.
- Would she step back?

449
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:43,605
(She is a straightforward woman who does not step back.)

450
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,375
I really hope Geon Wu...

451
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:47,334
- has the same feelings for her.
- "The same feelings?"

452
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,375
- I know.
- Who is it?

453
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:49,974
- Who is it?
- It's Su Jin.

454
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,045
I see. It's Su Jin.

455
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:54,544
Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?

456
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:55,684
( The next visitor to the Heart Room is Su Jin.)

457
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,245
Dong Ha, Jeong Geun, Geon Wu, Hyun Jin.

458
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,629
I'll choose Dong Ha.

459
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:05,855
(She chooses Dong Ha without hesitation.)

460
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,495
Dong Ha. Because...

461
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:12,665
when I went to pick him up...

462
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:14,384
I'm Shin Dong Ha.

463
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:17,005
- Shin Dong Ha.
- Dong Hwa?

464
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:18,705
- Ha. Ha, as in "sky" in Korean.
- I see. Dong Ha.

465
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:20,675
- That's right.
- First of all, he's calm.

466
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,405
He's also prudent.

467
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,708
I found his personality attractive.

468
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:29,215
Surprisingly, the wallpapers on our phones...

469
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:31,265
were the same, The Eiffel Tower.

470
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:32,238
It's unbelievable.

471
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,454
I know. It was incredible.

472
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:36,024
That was big.

473
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,225
It's like they're meant to be.

474
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:42,164
I was curious what kind of person he would be...

475
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:46,135
when it was just the two of us and we got closer.

476
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,005
What is this?

477
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,635
- That's what I wrote.
- Can I read this?

478
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,075
Cool. Can I read it?

479
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,345
(Love bud Guarantee)

480
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:01,244
Shing Dong Ha. He's so kind and would give you everything.

481
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,444
He is a manly man with many hobbies.

482
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:03,645
He has no mood swings.

483
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:08,615
That's nice.

484
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:10,225
I think someone is here.

485
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,895
Anyway, I chose Dong Ha.

486
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,224
She probably couldn't help but choose Dong Ha.

487
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,325
Because she's naive.

488
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,734
The Eiffel Tower could've had a huge impact on her.

489
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:20,894
It's romantic.

490
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:22,205
- It's so romantic to her.
- Exactly.

491
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,105
She might've thought, "Am I finally seeing my man?"

492
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:27,534
I think she should open up and see other people,

493
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:29,074
instead of only thinking of the Eiffel Tower.

494
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:30,644
- He's right.
- It's only the first day, though.

495
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:31,944
- It's just a first impression.
- Consider it a coincidence...

496
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:33,374
- a coincidence.
- That's why I'm so worried.

497
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,485
I hope she opens up to others more.

498
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:41,015
(The next person is Jeong Geun.)

499
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:49,364
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

500
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:51,425
(Who knocked on the door of Jeong Geun's heart today?)

501
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,644
(Choi Ji Eun)

502
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:08,145
The person who knocked on the door of my heart...

503
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,115
is Choi Ji Eun.

504
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:13,915
Because...

505
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:20,425
Even when we were doing the dishes together,

506
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,264
I had the feeling.

507
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,994
I became really curious...

508
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:27,894
- about her.
- That's the most important thing.

509
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:31,035
- There are rubber gloves for you.
- He's becoming curious.

510
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:33,535
- He wants to get to know her.
- I usually don't wear them.

511
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:37,544
She looks delicate,

512
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:39,545
so I thought she couldn't do it well.

513
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:43,585
But she did the dishes with her bare hands without gloves.

514
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:47,115
When I saw that side of her, I found her...

515
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,324
more down-to-earth than I had expected.

516
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:52,325
That was when I became interested in her.

517
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:55,125
- Good job.
- It was the least thing I could do.

518
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:56,325
"The least thing."

519
00:21:57,795 --> 00:22:01,995
Maybe it was also because she was the last one to join,

520
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:06,174
but I still think she is...

521
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:09,875
full of mystery.

522
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:13,475
I'll choose Choi Ji Eun.

523
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,524
That's what I wrote.

524
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,224
It's the Love bud Guarantee for Ji Eun.

525
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:31,525
(Love bud Guarantee, with details about Ji Eun as seen by So Ra)

526
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:33,794
I want many people to know about her.

527
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:36,334
She's kind, beautiful, cute, and competent.

528
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:37,534
(I want many people to know about her.)

529
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:38,665
(She's kind, beautiful, cute, and competent.)

530
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,534
Even though I tell her how beautiful she is,

531
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:43,605
she doesn't believe it.

532
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:46,015
Seeing her like that really frustrates me.

533
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:49,845
Yes, thanks for the message.

534
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:53,754
- He's putting it in his pocket.
- Gosh.

535
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:55,315
I hope it'll work out with the two of you.

536
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:57,125
He put it in his pocket.

537
00:22:58,755 --> 00:23:00,755
What I told Jeong Geun was...

538
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:03,294
not to move forward right away.

539
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:05,794
- To open to other people?
- I told him to see many people...

540
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:07,764
- That's important.
- and find the right one for him.

541
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:08,835
Although I told him,

542
00:23:09,135 --> 00:23:10,505
he's already so into her.

543
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:12,335
Since he's already into her,

544
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:14,875
I'm a little worried that he might be too forward.

545
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,404
(The next person coming into the Heart Room...)

546
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:20,144
(is Dong Ha.)

547
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:22,415
- Please.
- I'm so curious.

548
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:29,955
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

549
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:39,395
The person I'm most curious about is...

550
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:41,735
Hi.

551
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:45,165
- Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Su Jin. Kang Su Jin.

552
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,804
- Yes, I'm here to pick you up.
- Really?

553
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:48,105
- Nice to meet you. Yes.
- Did you come to pick me up?

554
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:49,974
My name is Kang Su Jin.

555
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,975
- Kang Su Jin? Yes.
- Yes, Su Jin.

556
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,645
We need to go now.

557
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:56,644
- And also...
- Hi.

558
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,484
- Hi.
- Ji Eun.

559
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:03,185
(And Ji Eun)

560
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:09,425
The two have opposite charms.

561
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:11,694
One has a healthy and vibrant look.

562
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:13,094
I like to exercise in the mornings and run.

563
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:14,234
In terms of looks,

564
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:17,534
Ji Eun is closer to my ideal type, but...

565
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:18,705
"But?"

566
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:21,505
- It was interesting...
- That's right.

567
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:24,105
that Su Jin and I had the same phone wallpaper.

568
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,644
We just hit it off...

569
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:29,885
and had a good connection.

570
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:34,215
Ji Eun is also actually... How can I put it?

571
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:36,754
She's the one I'm curious about.

572
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:37,755
(He is curious about Ji Eun.)

573
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:43,795
(Who will be Dong Ha's first choice?)

574
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:57,305
(Dong Ha's first choice is Ji Eun.)

575
00:24:57,618 --> 00:25:00,388
I chose Ji Eun because...

576
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:03,644
she's the most beautiful.

577
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,644
(Because she's the most beautiful.)

578
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:07,015
He's being honest.

579
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:08,515
That's why I chose her.

580
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,734
- No couples have been matched.
- Ji Eun got two votes.

581
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,764
- You're right.
- Oh, my gosh.

582
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:23,304
I'm so happy.

583
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:25,504
- We already have someone...
- Yes.

584
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:26,934
- who got two votes.
- It's Ji Eun.

585
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:29,004
Is it close to what you expected?

586
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,104
- No.
- Look at her.

587
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:31,105
Yes.

588
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:32,574
Her posture shifted.

589
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:35,044
I can relax and watch like I'm at home now.

590
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,045
(After receiving 2 votes, she is now more laid back.)

591
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:37,814
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

592
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:38,815
(After choosing their first impressions)

593
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,954
Everyone is drinking soju.

594
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,314
- I'll take it slow.
- Enjoy.

595
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:43,325
- Sure.
- I'm taking it slow, too.

596
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:46,455
I've told Jeong Geun not to drink.

597
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:49,025
It's so good.

598
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:53,764
- Have some.
- Thanks.

599
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:55,665
Before we know our ages,

600
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:57,465
can we just speak casually?

601
00:25:57,865 --> 00:25:58,964
- Already?
- Can we speak casually?

602
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:00,134
- To everyone?
- Because...

603
00:26:00,135 --> 00:26:01,534
once we know our ages,

604
00:26:01,535 --> 00:26:04,344
- Because it'd be awkward?
- it's not easy to speak casually...

605
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:05,845
- Okay.
- to someone who is older.

606
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,874
How do we do it?

607
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,915
What should we do when we find out our ages later?

608
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:13,454
Should we say that? "You're older than I am. I'm sorry."

609
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,684
- We keep speaking casually.
- "I've been impolite."

610
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:16,954
- We just call names.
- Okay, then.

611
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,824
How do we address each other?

612
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:20,924
We call each other by name and speak casually.

613
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,625
- So, we call each other by name.
- "Dong Ha."

614
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:24,094
- "What are you up to?" - "Sin Young, did you eat?"

615
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:25,665
- We can be semi-formal.
- That's great.

616
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:27,094
That's great.

617
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:30,004
Like that? Okay. I like it.

618
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,204
Why don't we give a toast before speaking casually?

619
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:32,205
Let's toast.

620
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:34,634
- Once we give a toast, it begins.
- We start speaking casually.

621
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,674
Remember how we address each other.

622
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,174
Can we just call each other by first names?

623
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:40,175
- I think that's even harder.
- Dong Ha, is this okay?

624
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:45,085
(Surprised)

625
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:46,654
She's flirting with him.

626
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:48,014
They need that.

627
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:49,525
Dong Ha, is this okay?

628
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:53,194
- Dong Ha, is this okay?
- Is this okay?

629
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,855
- She's speaking in dialect.
- Is this okay?

630
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,794
- This is fine.
- This is fine. I like this.

631
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:58,765
I think it'll be more comfortable.

632
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,864
I like it.

633
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:01,264
Okay, just call each other by first names.

634
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:02,265
- Yes.
- You get closer quickly...

635
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,365
- once you speak casually.
- I like it.

636
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:07,175
Have you dated more people who are older or younger than you?

637
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,874
Since we don't know our ages, this question might be pointless.

638
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,544
I'm just curious about your preference.

639
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:13,145
- You could be curious about it.
- Yes.

640
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,014
- Should we take turns to answer?
- Okay.

641
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,885
- Okay. Let's take turns this way.
- Let's start with Dong Ha.

642
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:21,514
I've never dated anyone older than me.

643
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,524
- I see.
- I see.

644
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:24,055
I've never dated anyone older.

645
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:26,324
- So?
- What's your preference?

646
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:27,894
- Which one do you prefer?
- What's your preference?

647
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:28,924
Do you want to date someone older?

648
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,124
You've never dated anyone older,

649
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,524
so do you want to keep it that way?

650
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,794
I want to keep it that way.

651
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:34,034
- Not with anyone older?
- No.

652
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:35,194
What if I'm older than you are?

653
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,265
- You might be.
- Now...

654
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:38,404
What if I'm older than you are?

655
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:41,434
- See you tomorrow, big sister.
- Don't draw the line like this.

656
00:27:41,435 --> 00:27:42,505
Did you see her face?

657
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:44,004
You should be open to all possibilities for now.

658
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:45,944
- Don't limit yourself for now.
- Yes, don't do that.

659
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:47,374
- Older, younger, the same age...
- This is hilarious.

660
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,375
- Leave yourself open to all.
- Leave yourself open to all.

661
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,184
- You should, here.
- You should leave yourself open.

662
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,244
That was nice.

663
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,855
She's charismatic.

664
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:55,315
- Hyun Jin.
- For me...

665
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,125
I'm not open to all.

666
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:02,025
He is close-minded. I have my ears open.

667
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,295
I...

668
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,294
have never dated an older woman,

669
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:07,465
but I don't want to.

670
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:08,734
- You don't want to?
- I'm sure of that.

671
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:10,405
You're not in a position to say that!

672
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:13,305
- Why don't you?
- You should be grateful for all!

673
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,905
- Can I ask why you don't want to?
- Right.

674
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,275
- Why don't you?
- I won't comment on that.

675
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:22,045
Something had happened.

676
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:23,584
Well...

677
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:25,954
- You're fine with everything else?
- The same age or younger?

678
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:26,955
- Okay.
- I see.

679
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,014
No, I don't want someone the same age either.

680
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:30,755
- Only younger women?
- I think I prefer younger women.

681
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:32,224
That was...

682
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:33,794
important to me.

683
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,965
This might be a sensitive topic,

684
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:39,125
but...

685
00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:41,094
it's about having babies.

686
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,865
I really like kids.

687
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:44,535
I love kids.

688
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:48,735
I want to form a family...

689
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:51,144
and have kids.

690
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:53,615
That is what I have in mind.

691
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:54,874
Yes.

692
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:57,314
You'd prefer to get married as soon as possible...

693
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,114
- and have children.
- That's right.

694
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:02,215
- I do think about things like that.
- That's what you want.

695
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:06,795
How long has it been since you took a break from dating?

696
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:08,095
- Well...
- Gosh.

697
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,565
- About two years for me.
- Two years?

698
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:15,111
And last year, I enjoyed staying single.

699
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:19,534
And this year, I was ready to date.

700
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:21,705
I don't have a special reason behind it, though.

701
00:29:22,535 --> 00:29:24,144
About two years?

702
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,744
- You're being honest.
- Two years?

703
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:28,014
It was 2 for her, but it was 3 years for me.

704
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:29,115
- Three years?
- Three years?

705
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,045
- Everyone must be curious.
- Yes.

706
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:34,514
- I don't leave my house much.
- Me too.

707
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:35,784
Whenever I ask her what she's doing on her day off,

708
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:36,854
- she's always at home.
- I barely leave my home.

709
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:37,855
- I go to and fro work and home.
- Yes.

710
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:39,624
- Really?
- You didn't go on blind dates too?

711
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,724
Blind dates...

712
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:42,524
When they want to introduce me to someone,

713
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:44,125
- Right.
- I'd turn it down.

714
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,534
Do you not like getting set up with?

715
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,134
- I was quite busy...
- I see.

716
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,305
during that time.

717
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:52,235
I was very busy.

718
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:54,634
- That can happen.
- Yes.

719
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:55,905
So that was three years.

720
00:29:57,175 --> 00:29:59,315
As for me... You might be shocked.

721
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:01,414
- But it's related to my job...
- Don't tell me...

722
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:02,335
you've never dated.

723
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:04,691
- It's related to my job...
- Don't tell me you've never dated.

724
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:08,114
- Really?
- I don't look it, do I?

725
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:09,455
- I...
- You don't look it at all.

726
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:10,954
- But...
- You've never dated before?

727
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:12,285
- You've never dated?
- No.

728
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,824
I was very embarrassed about it at first.

729
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:15,854
- But later...
- Why would you be?

730
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,094
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

731
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:19,495
- People around me would say...
- Guys, calm down.

732
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:22,064
I thought I was the problem.

733
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,264
At first, I really thought that.

734
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:25,134
People around me would ask, "Why won't you date?"

735
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:26,534
But from the start,

736
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,904
when someone wanted to set me up, I'd turn them down.

737
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:31,475
- I was very sure about it.
- Right.

738
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:33,715
And I had a crush for a very long time.

739
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,975
But it never went well...

740
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,845
in the end.

741
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:41,915
I didn't expect that answer from her.

742
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,355
She said she had never dated before.

743
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:49,995
It was shocking.

744
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:54,235
(Dong Ha is deep in thought.)

745
00:30:55,865 --> 00:30:57,034
I didn't expect her to have never dated.

746
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:58,634
Su Jin has never dated.

747
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:00,135
- That's such a twist.
- Right.

748
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:01,974
We get to know a lot about them on the first day.

749
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:03,104
They're genuinely into it.

750
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:04,544
- Yes.
- That's admirable.

751
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:06,344
It's cool that they're being honest.

752
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:07,874
It might work for or against them.

753
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,485
- If they're too frank.
- That's right.

754
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:15,215
(Episode 2. Crossed Feelings)

755
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:18,554
(Current time, 7am)

756
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:21,055
I want to be cool like Su Jin.

757
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:23,494
- Oh, my gosh. Who is it?
- Yes,

758
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,664
they should start showing off their charms.

759
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:26,794
(Su Jin is out early in the morning.)

760
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:28,564
(And Sin Young)

761
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:30,535
Look at her physique.

762
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:40,775
(What is Geon Wu doing this early in the morning?)

763
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:43,314
I like running in the rain.

764
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:44,844
(Geon Wu likes running.)

765
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:47,114
That's cool. It's romantic.

766
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,755
It feels really nice to run around the house every now and then.

767
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:53,754
(Sin Young and Geon Wu promised to run together.)

768
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:54,854
I'll come to you.

769
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:56,025
Tomorrow morning, I...

770
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,794
(Su Jin joins them for the morning run!)

771
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:00,935
What nice weather.

772
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,665
What's that sound?

773
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:06,805
What's that?

774
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:11,575
What is this sound?

775
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:18,685
Who is groaning there?

776
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:22,454
It's Jeong Geun, of course.

777
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:23,684
(Gwan Hee is proud of his friend's muscles.)

778
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:24,885
Look at his arms.

779
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:29,524
(Jeong Geun is working out in the morning...)

780
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:30,624
He's showing off his charms.

781
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,524
He keeps very fit.

782
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:33,664
(according to his usual routine.)

783
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,595
He has his set routine.

784
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:40,475
- You're awake.
- Jeong Geun.

785
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:42,104
Were you working out?

786
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,344
- Amazing.
- Good morning.

787
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:44,475
Good morning.

788
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:46,414
Did you come back from running?

789
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:48,075
We're going to now. Aren't you joining us?

790
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:49,714
I'm going to run after my weight training.

791
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:51,615
- You'll run later?
- After my weight training.

792
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:58,755
(Geon Wu wears a matching top and pants for running.)

793
00:32:58,955 --> 00:33:00,095
The air is perfect.

794
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:01,655
Let's go.

795
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,934
- Look at those muscles.
- I...

796
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,804
- What's with those muscles?
- He had a hidden charm.

797
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,474
Did he have to do that in front of the camera?

798
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:17,074
I told him to show off.

799
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:18,104
- I'm sorry, - Yes?

800
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:19,544
but aren't those pants too short?

801
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:21,245
I told him to wear shorter pants.

802
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:22,985
You told him to wear shorter pants.

803
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:24,644
If he can get his hands on one.

804
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:26,384
"If Jeong Geun has his upper body, I have my lower body."

805
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:27,485
(Jeong Geun with his upper body versus Geon Wu with his lower body)

806
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,124
(The morning sea of Geoje Island...)

807
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,124
(welcomes Geon Wu, Sin Young, and Su Jin.)

808
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,855
I guess this is why people run.

809
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:36,664
Shall we start running past that corner?

810
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:37,895
- Sure.
- Sure.

811
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:39,664
- Yes. Go.
- Go.

812
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:40,794
Go. Let's go.

813
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:42,135
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

814
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:44,765
Are we running in a line? This is cute.

815
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:47,905
When they run like that,

816
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:49,904
- their feelings will grow.
- Their feelings will grow.

817
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,875
There's a reason why there are running clubs.

818
00:33:57,515 --> 00:34:00,085
- They look good.
- They look so cool.

819
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,584
It looks like a commercial.

820
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:02,955
What a picturesque view.

821
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:07,595
- Let me know if I'm too fast.
- Okay.

822
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:11,895
Keep going.

823
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,234
Tell me if I'm...

824
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,504
- going too fast.
- Okay.

825
00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:20,875
It's good so far.

826
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:22,774
Beware of the rocky ground.

827
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,675
Geon Wu is so charming.

828
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:27,244
One kilometre.

829
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:28,844
- Nice, he's doing well.
- You're a good runner.

830
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:30,645
- Keep running?
- Yes, keep running.

831
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:32,585
We can come here to run every day starting tomorrow.

832
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:34,255
Starting tomorrow?

833
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,325
Geon Wu, Su Jin, and I went running.

834
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:41,594
Geon Wu ran in front...

835
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:44,264
and became our pacemaker.

836
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,865
We ran together, and it was so fun.

837
00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:47,295
It was fun.

838
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:50,805
Imagine how cool the bamboo forest would feel after running.

839
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:52,835
Think about that and hang in there.

840
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:54,374
It would be heavenly.

841
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:56,744
Geon Wu keeps checking...

842
00:34:56,745 --> 00:34:58,675
- on Sin Young.
- Right.

843
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:01,145
- That's nice.
- It'll make her heart flutter.

844
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,985
It's the last one. Keep running until the end.

845
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:11,154
Good job.

846
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:13,224
- Good job.
- That was 25 minutes.

847
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:14,495
- Good job.
- Good job.

848
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:15,725
Good job.

849
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,095
- You're a good runner.
- I agree.

850
00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:21,894
Considering this is your first time.

851
00:35:21,895 --> 00:35:23,065
- You were so good.
- Yes.

852
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,464
Sin Young is trying her best.

853
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:26,534
She's trying.

854
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:28,334
I've never seen her working out.

855
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,475
- I see.
- Yes.

856
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:31,675
No wonder...

857
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:33,875
- her clothes were new.
- Really?

858
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:36,785
- Her clothes are new.
- It looked new.

859
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:41,015
(Meanwhile, in the women's dorm)

860
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,695
I need some coffee.

861
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:56,505
I am very low on energy.

862
00:35:57,705 --> 00:35:58,765
Right?

863
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:00,004
(Someone got Da Hye's telepathy.)

864
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:01,775
He's already making some.

865
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:04,804
- The ice...
- Will we finally see it?

866
00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:06,305
- Finally.
- The ice has frozen.

867
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,144
- Finally.
- Will Hyun Jin do it?

868
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:08,997
The ice.

869
00:36:10,245 --> 00:36:12,345
(Will he succeed this time?)

870
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,005
My gosh.

871
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,166
Who will he give it to first?

872
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:24,894
- I'm so curious.
- What if...

873
00:36:24,895 --> 00:36:27,735
I'll pass a cup of coffee to the person...

874
00:36:28,035 --> 00:36:29,035
I took a liking to.

875
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:31,305
I wanted to use it as a sign.

876
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:35,197
He kept thinking about coffee.

877
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:37,775
He really wants to make some today.

878
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:40,775
He couldn't afford to do it yesterday.

879
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:43,745
It's not completely frozen.

880
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:46,015
There was no ice.

881
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,085
So I failed.

882
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,050
Anyhow,

883
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,155
I took the coffee to her...

884
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,825
this morning to express my feelings.

885
00:37:03,465 --> 00:37:04,535
To whom?

886
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,135
Who is it?

887
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:08,574
- He's going.
- He's going to deliver it.

888
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:12,405
(Who did Hyun Jin want to pass the coffee to?)

889
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:16,785
Excuse me. Can I step in?

890
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:19,114
- I'm not wearing any makeup.
- Yes.

891
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:20,584
Okay, get ready.

892
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:22,215
It's not Sin Young, then?

893
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:26,125
Da Hye, would you like some coffee?

894
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:27,525
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

895
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:33,495
Da Hye, would you like some coffee?

896
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:35,165
I'd love some.

897
00:37:35,935 --> 00:37:37,134
Should I go up, or do you want to come down?

898
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:38,135
Two glasses?

899
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:39,235
I'll go down.

900
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,634
- There's coffee?
- Yes, I brewed it.

901
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,974
- I'm so glad to see it.
- Yesterday...

902
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:44,404
- I brewed it.
- I'm so glad to see it.

903
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:46,474
Yesterday, I said I would, but I couldn't.

904
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:47,714
- Thank you.
- Can you pass this...

905
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:48,914
- to Su Jin?
- I didn't dry my hair.

906
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:50,415
Neither did I. I need to get ready.

907
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:51,984
I'll pass this to Su Jin.

908
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:53,044
Okay. Su Jin.

909
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:57,385
(He sends a positive signal to Da Hye and Su Jin.)

910
00:37:58,185 --> 00:38:00,725
Why is Su Jin second?

911
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:04,394
Did he give one to Su Jin because he pitied her?

912
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:05,524
"Because he pitied her."

913
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:07,194
But look.

914
00:38:07,195 --> 00:38:08,494
He called Da Hye.

915
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,134
- He probably has more feelings...
- It's Da Hye, right?

916
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:11,634
- for the 1st person he gave it to.
- Yes, the 1st person.

917
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:14,434
- Wait. Timeout.
- He hid the coffee.

918
00:38:14,435 --> 00:38:15,704
- Go on.
- But look.

919
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:18,444
He greeted Sin Young first when he came over.

920
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:19,405
Go on.

921
00:38:19,406 --> 00:38:20,844
- He saw her first.
- Yes.

922
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:23,184
Does he think Sin Young doesn't have a mouth to drink?

923
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:24,945
(She's furious that her friend didn't get coffee.)

924
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:26,984
- I'm sorry.
- You...

925
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:28,684
He should've given her a cup regardless.

926
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:30,925
Sin Young didn't even get to drink coffee.

927
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,765
Come on. I'm tearing up.

928
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:42,339
(The recipient of Hyun Jin's signal...)

929
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:47,375
(is Da Hye?)

930
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,186
That's for you, Su Jin.

931
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,145
- Is this drip coffee?
- I think so.

932
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:51,723
I think he brewed it himself.

933
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,614
Is it good? Really?

934
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:57,185
- It's savoury and nice.
- My poor Sin Young.

935
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:02,427
(Meanwhile, in the men's dorm)

936
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:16,395
(The men are dressing up too.)

937
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,345
I look so feminine today.

938
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,974
You look like you should walk by the beach.

939
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:30,415
It suits the beach perfectly.

940
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:33,915
Is this right? Do I look better this way?

941
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:36,855
Is this better here than here?

942
00:39:37,285 --> 00:39:38,354
What do you think?

943
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:40,494
Placing it in the middle looks better...

944
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:41,755
- in my opinion.
- It's not bad?

945
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:44,465
It looked too plain when I let it down.

946
00:39:45,695 --> 00:39:47,135
It looks like tissue.

947
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:49,764
Tissue here.

948
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:50,935
Don't say that.

949
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:53,875
(Feeling antsy)

950
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:57,305
I'll be going on a date today.

951
00:39:58,305 --> 00:40:01,045
I felt more nervous than fluttery.

952
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:03,345
Since she's never dated before...

953
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,044
- Exactly. My gosh.
- She doesn't know what to expect.

954
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:08,385
- She's so lovely.
- Her dressing up is lovely.

955
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,225
Show them your charms.

956
00:40:10,685 --> 00:40:12,284
(Da Hye is wearing...)

957
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:16,925
(a red dress?)

958
00:40:18,695 --> 00:40:20,665
- That's her battle dress.
- My goodness.

959
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:23,095
- It's a battle dress.
- That's a party dress.

960
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:25,864
- What's up with everyone today?
- She brought it all from her house.

961
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:27,804
- They're going all out today.
- They should.

962
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:30,544
- Da Hye is going all out.
- Red is definitely that.

963
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:32,574
- Red.
- A red dress means a battle dress.

964
00:40:32,575 --> 00:40:33,815
- It's bold.
- Right.

965
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:38,085
Should we go to the common area?

966
00:40:38,315 --> 00:40:39,844
There's no sofa there, right?

967
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:42,214
- There is a sofa.
- There's one inside.

968
00:40:42,215 --> 00:40:43,854
(The three men head to the common area...)

969
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:45,355
(after dressing up.)

970
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:51,265
Why is Hyun Jin dressed like a young boy?

971
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,765
Why did he wear a yellow-striped shirt?

972
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:00,104
(This is what your hearts are saying.)

973
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:01,305
- What's that?
- What's that?

974
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:02,775
No way.

975
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:03,944
- What's that now?
- What's that?

976
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:05,504
(The board changed?)

977
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:06,744
- What's that?
- What is it?

978
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:08,044
- The ones they took?
- It's a polaroid.

979
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:09,415
That must be it.

980
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:11,744
- It's the name tags they took.
- Are those the results?

981
00:41:11,745 --> 00:41:13,584
- No way.
- They don't know who took whose.

982
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:15,084
It's not, right?

983
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:18,185
(Something is put up on the board.)

984
00:41:18,555 --> 00:41:20,124
- Hello.
- Hello.

985
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,825
- Good morning - Hi.

986
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:23,464
How was your sleep?

987
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:24,964
- Good.
- Good morning.

988
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:26,664
(Nobody has noticed the board yet.)

989
00:41:26,665 --> 00:41:28,894
- What a hot girl.
- A hot girl?

990
00:41:28,895 --> 00:41:30,604
Hot girl.

991
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:32,005
- You're in bright red.
- Seriously.

992
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:34,704
- Seriously.
- I look good in red.

993
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:36,004
You look so pretty.

994
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:37,405
- Thank you.
- She's so pale.

995
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:40,714
- They haven't noticed yet.
- Exactly.

996
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,015
(Lastly, Jeong Geun joins.)

997
00:41:43,685 --> 00:41:45,345
- He saw it.
- He saw it.

998
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:49,454
(Jeong Geun is the first to notice the difference on the board.)

999
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:51,485
- When the two of them...
- I don't want to have a look.

1000
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:54,454
We were suspicious of this.

1001
00:41:54,455 --> 00:41:55,624
- We were working out...
- What's that?

1002
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,264
This... Gosh, what's this?

1003
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,525
- My gosh.
- What is this?

1004
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:01,365
It's that.

1005
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:03,234
- It's the popularity vote.
- Should we step out for a bit?

1006
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:04,764
What is it?

1007
00:42:04,765 --> 00:42:06,334
- What is it? Tell us.
- What is it?

1008
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:08,574
- I saw it only now.
- It's so blatant.

1009
00:42:08,575 --> 00:42:10,505
- Exactly. It's so blatant.
- Oh, my gosh.

1010
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:16,248
This isn't a secret vote.

1011
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:18,684
(Love buds are shocked at the way the results are revealed.)

1012
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:20,884
- When you see it yourself, - The way they show it...

1013
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:22,054
you won't feel good.

1014
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:23,654
I might cry if I see that.

1015
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:25,924
They might also think that their friends are watching.

1016
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:27,754
I would cry.

1017
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:28,894
- It's so...
- Where is Da Hye's name?

1018
00:42:28,895 --> 00:42:31,564
- Me too.
- I... My goodness.

1019
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:32,664
(Everyone is thrown off by the way it's revealed.)

1020
00:42:32,665 --> 00:42:34,465
It's so blatant.

1021
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,835
I only saw this now.

1022
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,305
- This is so...
- Exactly.

1023
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:39,772
It's so blatant.

1024
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:40,679
Dong Ha.

1025
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:43,544
- You knew it, didn't you? He knew.
- I really didn't.

1026
00:42:43,545 --> 00:42:45,045
- No, I saw it now.
- Come on.

1027
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,214
- It's so blatant.
- I think it's...

1028
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:49,344
This is the kind of show we're on.

1029
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:51,484
- That's right.
- She looks very happy, though.

1030
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,885
- Yes.
- Right.

1031
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,184
Since it's the first day...

1032
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:00,754
(Three of them didn't get any votes.)

1033
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:03,355
(Oh Hyun Jin, Kim Sin Young, Kang Su Jin)

1034
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:05,465
This is bad.

1035
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:08,795
What I was worried about actually happened.

1036
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:12,935
Gosh, nobody voted for me.

1037
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:16,105
What's this? What happened?

1038
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,845
I was a bit worried too.

1039
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:30,255
(Da Hye and Ji Eun got 2 votes each from the men.)

1040
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,595
Honestly, I felt good.

1041
00:43:35,055 --> 00:43:39,025
I remember Ji Eun and I getting two votes each.

1042
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:43,034
I think we got two votes...

1043
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:46,035
because it was based on the first impressions.

1044
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:49,534
That's true. But Jeong Geun didn't vote for Da Hye.

1045
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:50,874
Who voted for her, then?

1046
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,244
(Who are the two people who voted for Da Hye?)

1047
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:55,675
(Lee Da Hye, Choi Ji Eun, Kim Sin Young)

1048
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:04,385
(Last night, who did Hyun Jin vote for?)

1049
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:07,295
"Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?"

1050
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:12,564
(His hand reaches for Da Hye's name without hesitation.)

1051
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:13,964
See? He didn't even hesitate.

1052
00:44:13,965 --> 00:44:15,765
I'm all for it, Da Hye.

1053
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:20,134
When I had a conversation with Da Hye,

1054
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:22,835
we made eye contact.

1055
00:44:22,905 --> 00:44:25,605
And the talk went smoothly.

1056
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:29,144
I choose...

1057
00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:31,245
(Geon Wu also chose Da Hye.)

1058
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:36,455
(He doesn't hesitate as well.)

1059
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:40,025
Guys. I want to take Geon Wu as well.

1060
00:44:40,225 --> 00:44:43,025
She was being considerate of me.

1061
00:44:43,795 --> 00:44:46,125
And I was very grateful for it.

1062
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:50,135
So I chose Da Hye.

1063
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:53,535
(Hyun Jin and Geon Wu chose Da Hye.)

1064
00:44:57,775 --> 00:45:01,315
(This is what your hearts are saying.)

1065
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,515
You got the most votes.

1066
00:45:04,545 --> 00:45:07,885
(Dong Ha is the only man who got 2 votes.)

1067
00:45:08,215 --> 00:45:10,584
Gosh, Dong Ha.

1068
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:12,585
(Shin Dong Ha)

1069
00:45:12,785 --> 00:45:14,294
(Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?)

1070
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,694
(1. After removing the name tag of the person of interest,)

1071
00:45:15,695 --> 00:45:17,065
(state the reason in front of the camera.)

1072
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:21,595
(Who did Ji Eun choose last night, then?)

1073
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:22,695
I choose...

1074
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,574
Dong Ha.

1075
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:33,575
(Choi Ji Eun chooses Shin Dong Ha.)

1076
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:36,414
I think he and I are most alike.

1077
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:37,544
(Dong Ha is the first man to catch her attention.)

1078
00:45:37,545 --> 00:45:40,515
He came to pick me up as well.

1079
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:42,915
What should I say... His personality?

1080
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,825
His seemed closest to mine.

1081
00:45:48,895 --> 00:45:51,494
So I chose Shin Dong Ha.

1082
00:45:51,495 --> 00:45:56,595
(Choi Ji Eun and Shin Dong Ha chose each other.)

1083
00:45:57,435 --> 00:46:01,205
(Jeong Geun can't move away from the board.)

1084
00:46:01,235 --> 00:46:05,904
(This is what your hearts are saying.)

1085
00:46:05,905 --> 00:46:07,144
(Choi Ji Eun)

1086
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:09,274
He must feel mixed feelings after seeing the decisions.

1087
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:11,385
(Ji Eun's two torn pieces catch Jeong Geun's attention.)

1088
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:15,455
Even if someone else likes someone that I like,

1089
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:18,655
I am confident...

1090
00:46:19,025 --> 00:46:20,595
against any competitor.

1091
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:23,525
As expected.

1092
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:24,825
That's impressive.

1093
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,165
He passes!

1094
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,594
- That's great.
- Nice.

1095
00:46:27,595 --> 00:46:28,734
- I like that mindset.
- He's burning up.

1096
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:30,034
- That's impressive.
- This is exciting.

1097
00:46:30,035 --> 00:46:31,405
Seriously.

1098
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:35,174
Young Ji, Mi Joo, and So Ra's friends...

1099
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:37,775
- have become the most popular ones.
- I'm jealous.

1100
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:40,144
Did you expect this, Mi Joo?

1101
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:42,314
I definitely thought that she would get all the votes,

1102
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:43,445
so I'm slightly disappointed.

1103
00:46:43,745 --> 00:46:44,814
I'm slightly disappointed,

1104
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:46,085
but I'm also grateful for her being able to get two votes.

1105
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:47,584
- This is how I feel.
- I'm jealous.

1106
00:46:47,585 --> 00:46:48,614
I still thought...

1107
00:46:48,615 --> 00:46:50,325
that my friend would get at least one vote.

1108
00:46:50,425 --> 00:46:51,484
At least one vote.

1109
00:46:51,485 --> 00:46:53,384
Every person has their own pair.

1110
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:54,754
- Right.
- It was just the first impression.

1111
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:56,324
I expected one vote too.

1112
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:58,294
They could all help each other as it's just the first impression.

1113
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,494
- We don't know what to expect yet.
- They just met each other,

1114
00:46:59,495 --> 00:47:01,065
- so they could help each other.
- They're being too honest.

1115
00:47:01,095 --> 00:47:02,964
You must feel great, So Ra.

1116
00:47:02,965 --> 00:47:04,004
Your friend got a lot of votes,

1117
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:05,564
- and the two chose each other.
- I feel really happy.

1118
00:47:05,565 --> 00:47:07,974
Also, the people that I wanted...

1119
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:09,974
chose Ji Eun.

1120
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:11,674
I'm feeling a lot of confidence right now.

1121
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:13,744
- Unfortunately, - Right.

1122
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:16,114
we weren't able to see the Love bud Guarantees...

1123
00:47:16,115 --> 00:47:18,815
- of the ones that got no votes.
- Right.

1124
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:19,885
So...

1125
00:47:20,385 --> 00:47:21,414
You look...

1126
00:47:21,415 --> 00:47:23,014
really down right now.

1127
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:24,724
- She even mustered up her courage.
- It's no fun.

1128
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:25,925
- What is no fun?
- This whole situation.

1129
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:27,995
It has to be fun. This is a variety show.

1130
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:29,555
It's no fun.

1131
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,765
It's no fun.

1132
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:33,124
But I think I can understand how you are feeling right now.

1133
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,194
Since last week,

1134
00:47:34,195 --> 00:47:35,535
she has been losing her dimples.

1135
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:37,835
- Those are her charms.
- Right.

1136
00:47:38,465 --> 00:47:40,035
Isn't there something inside that?

1137
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:42,104
Should we open it up?

1138
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:43,274
Yes. I think we can open it up now.

1139
00:47:43,275 --> 00:47:44,905
Right. I think there will be something inside it.

1140
00:47:45,205 --> 00:47:46,845
(There's a mysterious envelope next to the vote results.)

1141
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:54,515
- Is there something inside?
- Yes.

1142
00:47:55,315 --> 00:47:56,415
What is it?

1143
00:47:57,325 --> 00:47:58,425
What is it?

1144
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,124
- "Go on a date with the person..." - "Go on a date with the person..."

1145
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,325
- "recommended by the Love buds." - "recommended by the Love buds."

1146
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,024
- That's what it says?
- What?

1147
00:48:04,025 --> 00:48:05,524
- Hold on!
- The names are written!

1148
00:48:05,525 --> 00:48:06,795
- Hold on!
- There's something written?

1149
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:08,364
- I saw my name.
- We should all...

1150
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:09,534
- I saw my name.
- We should all gather.

1151
00:48:09,535 --> 00:48:11,465
So the Love buds made recommendations.

1152
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:12,935
- Gosh!
- Goodness!

1153
00:48:13,705 --> 00:48:15,134
- Oh, right.
- We did that earlier.

1154
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:16,774
- We did that earlier, didn't we?
- It will be revealed.

1155
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:17,805
- Right.
- I remember doing that!

1156
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,590
(During the pre-recording)

1157
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:22,302
What is this?

1158
00:48:22,998 --> 00:48:24,068
What is this?

1159
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:26,615
(An envelope gets secretly handed to the Love buds.)

1160
00:48:26,915 --> 00:48:27,985
Gosh, what is this?

1161
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:30,215
Do I open this up too?

1162
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:31,384
- What is this?
- What is this?

1163
00:48:31,385 --> 00:48:33,125
(What's inside the envelope?)

1164
00:48:33,585 --> 00:48:34,695
What?

1165
00:48:35,425 --> 00:48:36,554
(What?)

1166
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:38,765
So this was the one I wrote for Da Hye.

1167
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,595
- I felt so excited.
- Right.

1168
00:48:42,665 --> 00:48:43,695
What is this?

1169
00:48:46,305 --> 00:48:47,434
(Who do you think suits your friend the most?)

1170
00:48:47,435 --> 00:48:48,574
I think she'll be tall.

1171
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:49,735
In my opinion...

1172
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:51,904
Gosh.

1173
00:48:51,905 --> 00:48:53,404
I really don't have a clue. Hold on.

1174
00:48:53,405 --> 00:48:54,474
(The Love buds think deeply as it's the date of their friends.)

1175
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:55,614
What do I do?

1176
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:56,875
(The Love buds think deeply as it's the date of their friends.)

1177
00:48:58,345 --> 00:48:59,385
First of all...

1178
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:01,115
I choose this person.

1179
00:49:02,015 --> 00:49:03,184
It's because...

1180
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:05,424
he's known to be someone so nice that he would do anything.

1181
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:06,654
She does her best in everything that she does,

1182
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:08,924
and she is an angel who has never been seen to be angry.

1183
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:10,394
She may not realise it,

1184
00:49:10,395 --> 00:49:12,795
but I think she is someone others find cute.

1185
00:49:13,165 --> 00:49:15,334
A personality that seems to be willing to embrace anything.

1186
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:17,365
It seems like he's someone that's very considerate.

1187
00:49:17,965 --> 00:49:20,265
He lives in Mapo-gu.

1188
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:23,035
It's based on my impression.

1189
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,805
I think this person will be a good pick.

1190
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,175
I chose this person for you.

1191
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:28,745
You will feel happy about it.

1192
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:30,614
Right. Let's all gather together. Take a seat.

1193
00:49:30,615 --> 00:49:32,884
So the Love buds made recommendations.

1194
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:34,215
When did they do this?

1195
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:36,215
I feel so nervous.

1196
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:38,255
I hope she'll feel happy about her date.

1197
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,494
"The date course recommendations of the Love buds will be revealed..."

1198
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:43,154
- That is when we will know.
- "when you head out."

1199
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:44,395
- Here it is.
- What?

1200
00:49:45,495 --> 00:49:48,095
The men are written here.

1201
00:49:48,665 --> 00:49:49,895
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1202
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:51,805
I'll reveal the names one by one.

1203
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:53,265
Starting with me?

1204
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:54,874
That's nice.

1205
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,334
- Starting with me.
- I thought it was something else.

1206
00:49:56,335 --> 00:49:58,044
- Geon Wu?
- It's Geon Wu.

1207
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:59,145
- Who will it be for him?
- Who will it be for him?

1208
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:03,175
I think it might be Da Hye.

1209
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:10,855
I want to go on a date with Geon Wu.

1210
00:50:12,785 --> 00:50:13,895
All right.

1211
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:16,895
- Geon Wu and Sin Young.
- I picked Geon Wu.

1212
00:50:17,465 --> 00:50:19,495
- We went running together.
- Right. In the morning.

1213
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:20,695
That's great.

1214
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:21,994
"I'm so happy."

1215
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:23,464
"I feel so happy. What do I do?"

1216
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:24,534
I was curious about him,

1217
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:27,704
and my date happened to be Geon Wu.

1218
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:29,035
I thought that it would be exciting.

1219
00:50:30,775 --> 00:50:31,804
Jeong Geun.

1220
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:32,875
(Jeong Geun's date gets revealed next.)

1221
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:36,615
I want to spend time with Ji Eun.

1222
00:50:37,845 --> 00:50:41,255
(Was Gwan Hee able to connect with his friend Jeong Geun?)

1223
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,684
I'm curious about Ji Eun.

1224
00:50:44,685 --> 00:50:45,855
(Another person who wants to go on a date with Ji Eun)

1225
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,095
(Did Young Ji choose Ji Eun for Dong Ha just as he wished?)

1226
00:50:49,425 --> 00:50:54,095
(Who will be the one to go on a date with Ji Eun?)

1227
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:58,635
(Who will be the one to go on a date with Ji Eun?)

1228
00:50:59,035 --> 00:51:00,265
Jeong Geun.

1229
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,380
(Jeung Geun and Ji Eun get chosen to go on a date.)

1230
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:03,171
Jeong Geun.

1231
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:04,745
- Ji Eun.
- Ji Eun.

1232
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:08,714
Against the one...

1233
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:10,945
that also voted for Ji Eun,

1234
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:12,945
I thought that I had the chance to take advantage.

1235
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:14,515
Dong Ha.

1236
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:15,984
- Da Hye.
- Da Hye.

1237
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:17,115
- Dong Ha is with Da Hye.
- Da Hye.

1238
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,255
I was slightly disappointed.

1239
00:51:23,495 --> 00:51:24,624
I'm with Hyun Jin then.

1240
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:26,094
- Hyun Jin and Su Jin.
- Right.

1241
00:51:26,095 --> 00:51:27,635
Okay. So these are the pairs.

1242
00:51:27,665 --> 00:51:28,795
Let's have a good time.

1243
00:51:29,095 --> 00:51:30,234
The Love buds made these choices?

1244
00:51:30,235 --> 00:51:31,265
I guess so.

1245
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:33,364
- That's amazing.
- Gosh.

1246
00:51:33,365 --> 00:51:34,534
(A date with the partner chosen by the Love buds)

1247
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:35,875
I wonder how it was chosen.

1248
00:51:36,105 --> 00:51:37,105
Right.

1249
00:51:37,106 --> 00:51:39,004
- Yes.
- Right.

1250
00:51:39,005 --> 00:51:41,114
(Can the Love bud's matching move the hearts of the friends?)

1251
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:42,775
Let's take a picture of this.

1252
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,684
(Kim Geon Wu and Kim Sin Young, Shin Dong Ha and Lee Da Hye,)

1253
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,345
(Ha Jeong Geun and Choi Ji Eun, Oh Hyun Jin and Kang Su Jin)

1254
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:48,255
They weren't all matched perfectly by chance, right?

1255
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:49,714
- They were matched by chance.
- Really?

1256
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:50,825
- Really?
- Are you serious?

1257
00:51:50,885 --> 00:51:54,025
Right. The viewers might think we're lying.

1258
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,124
- This wasn't planned at all.
- Really?

1259
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,424
Gosh, that doesn't make sense.

1260
00:51:57,425 --> 00:51:58,864
The reason that I chose Su Jin...

1261
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,435
was because I heard she had a lot of hobbies and charms.

1262
00:52:01,795 --> 00:52:03,734
Hyun Jin is like that too.

1263
00:52:03,735 --> 00:52:06,735
I thought that they would enjoy being active together.

1264
00:52:07,605 --> 00:52:10,805
I'm really curious about how things will pan out.

1265
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:13,174
Our friends will be going on a date...

1266
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:14,645
based on our decisions.

1267
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:16,314
- Which couple will be first?
- They will go on a date.

1268
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:17,585
Which two will go on a date first?

1269
00:52:19,445 --> 00:52:21,015
- I wonder what we'll be doing.
- Right.

1270
00:52:21,315 --> 00:52:22,784
- It's Hyun Jin.
- It's Hyun Jin and Su Jin.

1271
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:24,225
- I don't know what to expect.
- It's Hyun Jin and Su Jin.

1272
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:26,055
- Gosh, I'm curious.
- Gosh.

1273
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:28,594
- Where was it again?
- I think it's this way.

1274
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:29,725
(Where are these two headed to?)

1275
00:52:30,255 --> 00:52:31,664
- What is this?
- Let's go inside first.

1276
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:33,495
(A bus stop?)

1277
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:36,065
There's a certain vibe that countryside buses give.

1278
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:38,534
While talking on the bus together,

1279
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,705
they can naturally get closer to each other.

1280
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:43,404
As they won't be driving,

1281
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:44,444
they can look around...

1282
00:52:44,445 --> 00:52:46,145
and talk about a lot more things.

1283
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,074
Looking around town together.

1284
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:49,075
(Love bud Nam Hee's date course recommendation)

1285
00:52:49,076 --> 00:52:50,415
That is my recommendation.

1286
00:52:51,445 --> 00:52:52,714
You're right. When you look around town,

1287
00:52:52,715 --> 00:52:54,614
- there will be many stores.
- I think that's a good idea.

1288
00:52:54,615 --> 00:52:56,884
They will be able to see how polite they are to the elders too.

1289
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:59,085
- That's possible too.
- Right.

1290
00:53:00,425 --> 00:53:01,795
It's romantic though.

1291
00:53:03,425 --> 00:53:05,624
- It's hot, isn't it?
- Thank you.

1292
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:07,064
As it was hot,

1293
00:53:07,065 --> 00:53:08,994
I did think it would've been better if it was indoors.

1294
00:53:08,995 --> 00:53:10,665
That was the thought that I had.

1295
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:13,135
In this heat?

1296
00:53:13,905 --> 00:53:15,074
- Are you okay with the market?
- The market?

1297
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:16,304
- The market sounds great.
- Okay.

1298
00:53:16,305 --> 00:53:17,474
Great. Let's go.

1299
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:18,604
- Let's go.
- What if it's too hot?

1300
00:53:18,605 --> 00:53:20,045
I'm feeling really worried now.

1301
00:53:25,185 --> 00:53:26,214
Where's the bus?

1302
00:53:26,215 --> 00:53:28,155
I've never seen a bus stop like this before.

1303
00:53:29,785 --> 00:53:30,855
It feels new.

1304
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:32,555
It feels graceful...

1305
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:35,024
- like a pavilion.
- You can avoid the rain here...

1306
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,694
- on rainy days.
- Right.

1307
00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:39,224
It suits Su Jin's outfit though.

1308
00:53:39,225 --> 00:53:41,794
Doesn't it feel like a melodrama in the summer...

1309
00:53:41,795 --> 00:53:42,964
with the countryside in the background?

1310
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:44,405
(The two start their date in a special way.)

1311
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:46,105
The bus is here.

1312
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:47,635
The bus is here.

1313
00:53:50,305 --> 00:53:51,344
Gosh.

1314
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:53,145
- Let's go.
- I'm so excited.

1315
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:54,445
- Is this the right one?
- Yes.

1316
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:56,244
- Hello.
- Hello.

1317
00:53:56,245 --> 00:53:59,744
(Hyun Jin and Su Jin's romantic date begins.)

1318
00:53:59,745 --> 00:54:00,885
It's so cool in here.

1319
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:03,815
Would you like to sit inside? Are you okay with that?

1320
00:54:03,915 --> 00:54:05,525
- Yes. I'm fine.
- Sit wherever you feel comfortable.

1321
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:07,225
- I'm fine here.
- Okay.

1322
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:09,095
Gosh, it's so cool in here.

1323
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:14,534
(Su Jin, who was never in a relationship,...)

1324
00:54:14,535 --> 00:54:17,095
(goes on her first date.)

1325
00:54:17,635 --> 00:54:18,804
We have to be careful with what we say.

1326
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:19,835
We both got zero votes.

1327
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:21,305
We both... Oh, right.

1328
00:54:21,935 --> 00:54:23,874
We have to comfort each other today.

1329
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,445
Why bring out that painful memory?

1330
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:30,014
We just started today.

1331
00:54:30,015 --> 00:54:31,345
- It's just the start.
- Right.

1332
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:35,014
We can make good memories at the market.

1333
00:54:35,015 --> 00:54:36,084
Of course.

1334
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,214
Let's ask him later.

1335
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:39,525
I wonder why he wanted us...

1336
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:41,355
- Well, - to go to the market.

1337
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:44,094
this person just loves going to the market.

1338
00:54:44,095 --> 00:54:45,125
He loves markets?

1339
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:46,895
- He loves markets.
- Really?

1340
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:49,495
He goes to Mangwon Market in front of his house.

1341
00:54:49,765 --> 00:54:51,104
Mangwon Market is a great place to go to.

1342
00:54:51,105 --> 00:54:52,564
I go to Mangwon Market too.

1343
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:53,764
- I go there too.
- I live there too.

1344
00:54:53,765 --> 00:54:55,634
- Right. We both live there.
- Right.

1345
00:54:55,635 --> 00:54:57,035
- Right.
- Right.

1346
00:54:57,135 --> 00:54:58,975
That's why he goes there often,

1347
00:55:00,075 --> 00:55:01,474
and he loves markets in general.

1348
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:03,675
Markets are fun to visit. There's a warm atmosphere too.

1349
00:55:03,715 --> 00:55:04,744
Markets are great.

1350
00:55:04,745 --> 00:55:07,114
Do you see him staying close to her?

1351
00:55:07,115 --> 00:55:09,014
- Hyun Jin is leaning toward her.
- His belly button is facing her.

1352
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:10,015
- Look at that.
- Right.

1353
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:11,085
First of all,

1354
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:12,484
let's start by having some good food.

1355
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:13,955
- I'm starving.
- I'm hungry too.

1356
00:55:15,325 --> 00:55:17,094
- What should we have?
- What should we have?

1357
00:55:17,095 --> 00:55:20,625
Should we have something that catches our attention?

1358
00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:24,134
- We don't know what will be there.
- Right.

1359
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:26,635
We'll know when we get there. That's the fun of going to a market.

1360
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:28,235
- I have a question.
- What could it be?

1361
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:32,005
Do you prefer Korean food or Western food?

1362
00:55:32,505 --> 00:55:34,215
- Korean food or Western food?
- Make a guess.

1363
00:55:34,515 --> 00:55:35,874
- Korean food.
- Totally.

1364
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:36,943
I prefer Korean food too.

1365
00:55:38,015 --> 00:55:39,914
Let's play the Balance Game again.

1366
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:40,985
The Balance Game?

1367
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:42,615
Jjajangmyeon or jjamppong.

1368
00:55:43,185 --> 00:55:44,855
- One, two, three. Jjajangmyeon.
- Jjajangmyeon.

1369
00:55:46,255 --> 00:55:48,654
- Those games must be played.
- They're a good match.

1370
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:49,695
Pizza or hamburgers.

1371
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:53,195
Gosh, this one is a bit tough.

1372
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,969
One, two, three.

1373
00:55:54,994 --> 00:55:55,618
- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers.

1374
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:57,565
- Gosh.
- Really?

1375
00:55:57,805 --> 00:56:00,404
Hamburgers are perfectly balanced...

1376
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:01,735
- with carbs, protein, and fat.
- Right.

1377
00:56:03,005 --> 00:56:05,144
What's another one? This is fun. What else could there be?

1378
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:06,444
Coke or Sprite. One, two, three.

1379
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:07,475
- Coke.
- Coke.

1380
00:56:08,145 --> 00:56:10,615
We have similar tastes when it comes to food.

1381
00:56:11,185 --> 00:56:13,344
It's a relief that they're talking nonstop.

1382
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:15,254
- Right. That's very important.
- Right.

1383
00:56:15,255 --> 00:56:16,954
He's completely leaning...

1384
00:56:16,955 --> 00:56:18,454
- toward Su Jin.
- Right. He's facing her.

1385
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:20,524
His whole body is facing toward her.

1386
00:56:20,525 --> 00:56:23,354
That feels so romantic though.

1387
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:25,164
I think you did a great job choosing their date course.

1388
00:56:25,165 --> 00:56:26,364
- Right?
- First of all, they are sitting...

1389
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:27,994
- right next to each other.
- Yes.

1390
00:56:27,995 --> 00:56:29,035
That's really nice.

1391
00:56:29,565 --> 00:56:30,665
I hope things turn out well for them.

1392
00:56:31,405 --> 00:56:32,934
The two of them look great together.

1393
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,134
- Let's get off.
- Right.

1394
00:56:34,135 --> 00:56:35,504
(They arrive near the market which is their date course.)

1395
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:37,135
We're here.

1396
00:56:37,705 --> 00:56:40,105
It will be hot when they get off. That is what concerns me.

1397
00:56:40,575 --> 00:56:42,044
Shall we go?

1398
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:43,075
Will he cover the sun for her?

1399
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:47,215
Gosh, it's hot.

1400
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:49,755
It's a relief that it isn't raining.

1401
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:50,955
- Right?
- Right.

1402
00:56:51,355 --> 00:56:52,385
Right.

1403
00:56:53,825 --> 00:56:55,955
Should we play some games before we go to the market?

1404
00:56:56,695 --> 00:56:58,094
- Will you be okay? Not hungry yet?
- I'm okay.

1405
00:56:58,095 --> 00:56:59,464
- Should we play some games?
- Let's play before we go.

1406
00:56:59,465 --> 00:57:00,564
- All right then.
- This is going to be fun.

1407
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:02,595
Okay. Let's go.

1408
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,365
The arcade.

1409
00:57:06,535 --> 00:57:09,574
But they should stick with the date vibes there.

1410
00:57:09,575 --> 00:57:11,374
They shouldn't go with the vibes of besties.

1411
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:12,375
I'm slightly worried about that.

1412
00:57:12,376 --> 00:57:13,444
- All of a sudden, - They will become best friends.

1413
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:15,314
they shouldn't be smacking at each other's backs.

1414
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:17,044
- Right.
- They just need to avoid that.

1415
00:57:17,045 --> 00:57:18,884
- They're still being lovey-dovey.
- It's not like that yet.

1416
00:57:18,885 --> 00:57:19,885
They're lovely-dovey.

1417
00:57:19,886 --> 00:57:21,055
- It still feels exciting.
- Here.

1418
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:23,555
Are you good at kicking the ball?

1419
00:57:24,385 --> 00:57:26,054
- He said he played soccer.
- Will he show his skills?

1420
00:57:26,055 --> 00:57:28,195
- Will he show his skills?
- Will he show his skills?

1421
00:57:29,895 --> 00:57:33,895
I will play to show your love bud.

1422
00:57:34,025 --> 00:57:35,895
- Really? Will you go for it?
- Yes.

1423
00:57:37,135 --> 00:57:40,465
My love bud is quite objective.

1424
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:45,975
Will you go for it?

1425
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:49,115
I guess I'll give it a try.

1426
00:57:51,715 --> 00:57:53,315
I have high hopes.

1427
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:56,985
My love bud will watch very closely.

1428
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,255
When I check his score,

1429
00:57:59,885 --> 00:58:02,094
- I can tell if he has fake muscles.
- "Fake muscles."

1430
00:58:02,095 --> 00:58:04,325
- Or if he has real muscles.
- Right. I will be able to tell.

1431
00:58:04,665 --> 00:58:06,765
Let's go.

1432
00:58:08,335 --> 00:58:10,035
Please.

1433
00:58:11,335 --> 00:58:12,335
Here I go.

1434
00:58:13,435 --> 00:58:14,435
Here I go.

1435
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,075
Here I go.

1436
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,405
He seems to have played soccer for a while.

1437
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:21,415
- He set a new record.
- Gosh.

1438
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:24,175
- He's really good at soccer.
- Really?

1439
00:58:24,515 --> 00:58:26,184
Gosh. That was awesome.

1440
00:58:26,185 --> 00:58:28,354
- They gave each other a high-five.
- A high-five.

1441
00:58:28,355 --> 00:58:30,654
That's how they can touch each other naturally.

1442
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:32,524
Going to the arcade was a great choice.

1443
00:58:32,525 --> 00:58:34,025
Su Jin could've fallen for him.

1444
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:35,925
You're good at this.

1445
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:40,595
I was very surprised as he did much better than I thought.

1446
00:58:41,135 --> 00:58:44,605
He really did his best,

1447
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:48,505
and I think I was touched by that.

1448
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:50,405
I really enjoyed watching that.

1449
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:52,605
Gosh, you're really good.

1450
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:54,275
I got so surprised.

1451
00:58:54,575 --> 00:58:55,945
Did I do well?

1452
00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:58,345
- Nice one.
- Did I do well, Young Kwang?

1453
00:58:58,645 --> 00:59:00,714
- You did really well.
- It's the karaoke room.

1454
00:59:00,715 --> 00:59:01,754
You said she was a great singer.

1455
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:03,515
- It's the karaoke room.
- It's the karaoke room.

1456
00:59:03,555 --> 00:59:04,954
- She's finally going to sing.
- She's going to show her skills.

1457
00:59:04,955 --> 00:59:06,254
- Awesome.
- Finally.

1458
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:07,584
- You said she was a great singer.
- It's finally time...

1459
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,395
to show off your charms.

1460
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,325
I'm not sure if the song is in.

1461
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:13,225
Just go for it.

1462
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:15,147
It's Hyun Jin's time.

1463
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:17,835
(Hyun Jin sings first even though he feels shy.)

1464
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:19,335
I'm excited.

1465
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:22,704
I think you'll be a good singer. I can imagine your voice right now.

1466
00:59:22,705 --> 00:59:23,935
This is so embarrassing.

1467
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:26,475
- You're a great singer.
- Gosh.

1468
00:59:27,475 --> 00:59:29,075
- Why are you on your knees?
- I'll sing with courtesy.

1469
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:35,955
- This is hilarious.
- Which song is he singing?

1470
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:39,684
("Stars are Falling" by Travel Sketch)

1471
00:59:39,685 --> 00:59:42,625
(It's filling up my heart)

1472
00:59:43,395 --> 00:59:44,495
I can't listen to this.

1473
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:46,595
(He ends up giving up listening to his singing.)

1474
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:47,964
(Laughing)

1475
00:59:47,965 --> 00:59:49,365
They're on a date.

1476
00:59:49,895 --> 00:59:52,434
- He's on his knees.
- Why is he on his knees?

1477
00:59:52,435 --> 00:59:53,435
(What am I watching?)

1478
00:59:53,535 --> 00:59:54,834
He wasn't standing?

1479
00:59:54,835 --> 00:59:57,074
- He's on his knees.
- He's on his knees?

1480
00:59:57,075 --> 00:59:58,175
(This night will also become rainy)

1481
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:01,115
This is hilarious. Why did he get on his knees?

1482
01:00:01,445 --> 01:00:04,115
Why are you on your knees there?

1483
01:00:04,315 --> 01:00:05,944
I've never seen anyone sing while being on their knees.

1484
01:00:05,945 --> 01:00:07,044
Same here.

1485
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:08,614
I thought it was "Confession" by Yim Jae Beom.

1486
01:00:08,615 --> 01:00:10,955
- It's just like that song.
- It's just like that song.

1487
01:00:11,155 --> 01:00:14,324
(This night will also become rainy)

1488
01:00:14,325 --> 01:00:18,125
(And make me cry again)

1489
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:41,615
It was my first time listening to that song.

1490
01:00:41,955 --> 01:00:44,055
It felt very clean,

1491
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:47,584
and he sang it with a lot of emotion.

1492
01:00:47,585 --> 01:00:51,465
He sang with all his heart all of a sudden.

1493
01:00:52,925 --> 01:00:54,935
I believe that part felt charming to me.

1494
01:01:13,685 --> 01:01:14,685
Thank you.

1495
01:01:15,455 --> 01:01:17,015
Gosh, that's a great song.

1496
01:01:17,485 --> 01:01:18,524
(He's still in tears.)

1497
01:01:18,525 --> 01:01:19,855
Why are you struggling to watch, Nam Hee?

1498
01:01:19,955 --> 01:01:22,895
It's my first time watching my friend on a date.

1499
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:24,194
- This is quite difficult.
- How is it?

1500
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:25,425
It must be hard to watch.

1501
01:01:25,795 --> 01:01:28,564
You kept complaining that he didn't appear enough last week.

1502
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:30,365
Why are you feeling embarrassed to watch him now?

1503
01:01:31,135 --> 01:01:32,564
It was really getting chaotic over here.

1504
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:34,404
He kept moving around like this.

1505
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:36,575
- He was moving around so much.
- He can't stand it.

1506
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:38,874
- Let's go for it.
- Gosh.

1507
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,444
- I won't look this way at all.
- Okay.

1508
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:41,675
It's finally Su Jin's turn.

1509
01:01:42,315 --> 01:01:43,674
You have to do well.

1510
01:01:43,675 --> 01:01:45,244
(How are Su Jin's singing skills that Young Kwang bragged about?)

1511
01:01:45,245 --> 01:01:46,945
Oh, my gosh.

1512
01:01:48,655 --> 01:01:50,484
(Peeking)

1513
01:01:50,485 --> 01:01:51,485
Here I go.

1514
01:01:52,825 --> 01:01:56,424
(It rained all day)

1515
01:01:56,425 --> 01:02:01,064
(It reminded me of your face)

1516
01:02:01,065 --> 01:02:04,494
(And it brought tears to my eyes)

1517
01:02:04,495 --> 01:02:07,004
Gosh.

1518
01:02:07,005 --> 01:02:08,675
She's so charming.

1519
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:20,685
She's really good.

1520
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,255
(Gazing)

1521
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:32,625
(Peeking)

1522
01:02:34,425 --> 01:02:35,795
She's a great singer.

1523
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:49,545
- She's a great singer.
- She's a great singer.

1524
01:02:49,815 --> 01:02:52,515
- She sounds like a singer.
- Right.

1525
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:11,765
I found her charming. She was a great singer.

1526
01:03:12,635 --> 01:03:15,775
We only got to know each other for a day.

1527
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:18,844
And going to a karaoke together...

1528
01:03:18,845 --> 01:03:20,744
and singing for each other...

1529
01:03:20,745 --> 01:03:22,514
could feel very embarrassing.

1530
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:24,045
But even in the midst of all of that,

1531
01:03:24,815 --> 01:03:26,645
she expressed herself through the song,

1532
01:03:27,885 --> 01:03:32,255
and I found her very charming.

1533
01:03:49,905 --> 01:03:51,075
He fell for her.

1534
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:54,175
She really showed off her charms with that song.

1535
01:03:58,115 --> 01:03:59,615
You're a great singer. Gosh.

1536
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:02,184
- You're amazing.
- Thank you.

1537
01:04:02,185 --> 01:04:04,515
- She's such a great singer.
- Right.

1538
01:04:04,725 --> 01:04:06,585
- She's so charming.
- That was great.

1539
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:08,595
- My shoulders are going up now.
- Gosh.

1540
01:04:09,455 --> 01:04:11,125
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1541
01:04:12,825 --> 01:04:13,825
It's Dong Ha.

1542
01:04:13,826 --> 01:04:14,894
- It's Dong Ha.
- Did you bring your sunglasses?

1543
01:04:14,895 --> 01:04:16,534
I didn't. I usually don't wear sunglasses.

1544
01:04:16,535 --> 01:04:18,365
- You don't?
- I should've brought them though.

1545
01:04:20,405 --> 01:04:23,105
Gosh, a date course recommended by Hur Young Ji.

1546
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:24,874
On the blue lake?

1547
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,645
- Activities?
- Enjoy activities?

1548
01:04:27,245 --> 01:04:28,315
Nice.

1549
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,875
Young Ji knows me well, indeed.

1550
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:34,614
When I thought of it, I was wearing a skirt,

1551
01:04:34,615 --> 01:04:36,384
which would not be okay...

1552
01:04:36,385 --> 01:04:38,454
if I were to fly around or so.

1553
01:04:38,455 --> 01:04:40,085
So, I was a bit worried.

1554
01:04:41,355 --> 01:04:42,925
- Activities?
- Activities?

1555
01:04:43,325 --> 01:04:45,064
It's a course recommended by Young Ji.

1556
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:46,694
- Did Young Ji recommend it?
- Yes.

1557
01:04:46,695 --> 01:04:48,065
Young Ji is out of her mind.

1558
01:04:48,835 --> 01:04:50,095
- What's wrong with her?
- Look at the time.

1559
01:04:51,465 --> 01:04:53,435
Doing activities on the first day is a bit much.

1560
01:04:53,505 --> 01:04:54,804
It's the second day.

1561
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:56,574
Let's talk after this, Young JI.

1562
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,735
(I need you to stay after this, Young Ji.)

1563
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:03,575
The weather outside...

1564
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:05,715
- is amazing.
- Isn't it amazing?

1565
01:05:08,955 --> 01:05:11,255
Did you vote based on the first impression yesterday?

1566
01:05:11,985 --> 01:05:13,855
- Solely on the first impression.
- Really?

1567
01:05:13,925 --> 01:05:15,025
Right.

1568
01:05:15,595 --> 01:05:16,655
Yes.

1569
01:05:17,895 --> 01:05:19,865
When you said the reason yesterday...

1570
01:05:21,195 --> 01:05:22,435
- What did I say as the reason?
- Yes.

1571
01:05:22,895 --> 01:05:23,934
Can I tell you that?

1572
01:05:23,935 --> 01:05:25,104
Can't you?

1573
01:05:25,105 --> 01:05:26,665
- You can watch the show.
- Okay.

1574
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:28,335
You want me to check it by watching the show.

1575
01:05:29,435 --> 01:05:31,504
She tested the waters to gauge his thoughts.

1576
01:05:31,505 --> 01:05:33,645
- Oh, dear.
- Why does it feel so awkward?

1577
01:05:34,775 --> 01:05:36,045
Do you work out?

1578
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:37,715
- I...
- Yes.

1579
01:05:38,075 --> 01:05:40,615
I'm someone who enjoys sports.

1580
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:42,384
In middle school and high school,

1581
01:05:42,385 --> 01:05:44,315
I played soccer like the other boys.

1582
01:05:44,715 --> 01:05:46,955
During the college years,

1583
01:05:47,185 --> 01:05:48,324
I was in a baseball club.

1584
01:05:48,325 --> 01:05:49,794
You played ball sports.

1585
01:05:49,795 --> 01:05:51,055
Yes. And,

1586
01:05:51,225 --> 01:05:52,665
I play ice hockey now.

1587
01:05:54,465 --> 01:05:56,864
It's already been three years since I started playing it.

1588
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,305
- Really? It's your hobby, then.
- Yes.

1589
01:05:59,605 --> 01:06:01,234
- Instead of fighting myself, - Yes.

1590
01:06:01,235 --> 01:06:02,304
Rather than fighting yourself?

1591
01:06:02,305 --> 01:06:03,305
I prefer fighting others.

1592
01:06:03,306 --> 01:06:05,045
- You're indeed an extrovert.
- Yes.

1593
01:06:06,145 --> 01:06:07,475
It sounds like fun.

1594
01:06:08,145 --> 01:06:09,515
It's so much fun.

1595
01:06:10,845 --> 01:06:12,344
Da Hye is trying hard...

1596
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:14,085
- to keep the conversation going.
- Yes.

1597
01:06:14,785 --> 01:06:15,815
Yes.

1598
01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:18,425
I want to learn how to play ice hockey.

1599
01:06:18,525 --> 01:06:19,754
It looks fun.

1600
01:06:19,755 --> 01:06:21,595
- You'll be totally into it.
- Really?

1601
01:06:21,725 --> 01:06:23,554
Isn't this a sign that they're interested?

1602
01:06:23,555 --> 01:06:25,564
The two are slowly talking to each other now.

1603
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,194
Da Hye is showing interest...

1604
01:06:27,195 --> 01:06:28,395
- in Dong Ha.
- Yes.

1605
01:06:28,835 --> 01:06:30,494
- Have you ever been ice skating?
- Yes.

1606
01:06:30,495 --> 01:06:32,405
- Are you a good skater?
- Not really.

1607
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:34,435
(Adorable)

1608
01:06:35,335 --> 01:06:36,735
It's because...

1609
01:06:37,335 --> 01:06:38,845
I used to be a dancer.

1610
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,375
She was the best dancer.

1611
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:46,414
- I became close to Mi Joo...
- Yes.

1612
01:06:46,415 --> 01:06:48,354
- at a dance academy.
- Really?

1613
01:06:48,355 --> 01:06:49,584
- Yes.
- I see.

1614
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:51,314
Why am I hearing this for the first time?

1615
01:06:51,315 --> 01:06:53,255
I didn't tell anybody about it.

1616
01:06:53,355 --> 01:06:55,195
- You didn't talk about it.
- No.

1617
01:06:56,325 --> 01:06:59,124
I think I was interested in Dong Ha at that moment.

1618
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:00,494
So,

1619
01:07:00,495 --> 01:07:02,635
I wanted to talk with him about a variety of stuff.

1620
01:07:04,165 --> 01:07:05,604
So when it comes to physical activities,

1621
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,204
- I'm not that bad.
- Of course not.

1622
01:07:07,205 --> 01:07:08,304
If you are a good dancer,

1623
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:10,505
- that's a given.
- You're right.

1624
01:07:10,905 --> 01:07:12,204
I had no idea.

1625
01:07:12,205 --> 01:07:13,345
- Really?
- Yes.

1626
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:15,444
When she said it, I thought,

1627
01:07:15,445 --> 01:07:16,815
"It's so interesting."

1628
01:07:17,975 --> 01:07:19,185
It was something...

1629
01:07:22,015 --> 01:07:23,155
unexpected.

1630
01:07:24,255 --> 01:07:25,455
I see it.

1631
01:07:25,555 --> 01:07:26,885
- There are a bunch of things.
- Yes.

1632
01:07:28,025 --> 01:07:29,125
There is a lot of stuff.

1633
01:07:30,395 --> 01:07:32,024
What is it? What activity is it?

1634
01:07:32,025 --> 01:07:33,195
What would it be?

1635
01:07:33,225 --> 01:07:34,225
(An exciting...)

1636
01:07:34,795 --> 01:07:35,894
- Pedal boat?
- A pedal boat.

1637
01:07:35,895 --> 01:07:36,895
No way.

1638
01:07:36,995 --> 01:07:38,435
- A pedal boat?
- A pedal boat?

1639
01:07:41,205 --> 01:07:42,335
Doesn't the pedal boat...

1640
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:44,235
- look like it's set up for us?
- Yes.

1641
01:07:45,475 --> 01:07:46,845
Can you hold my hand?

1642
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,445
Can you hold my hand?

1643
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:51,914
Thank you.

1644
01:07:51,915 --> 01:07:53,515
(Holding it without hesitation)

1645
01:07:55,485 --> 01:07:57,285
Da Hye. Gosh. Look at her.

1646
01:07:57,815 --> 01:07:59,284
She's cheeky.

1647
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:01,354
Good. A pedal boat is a nice choice.

1648
01:08:01,355 --> 01:08:02,695
Yes. It's not bad.

1649
01:08:03,425 --> 01:08:04,594
Thank you.

1650
01:08:04,595 --> 01:08:06,465
- It's too steep. Thank you.
- Yes.

1651
01:08:09,435 --> 01:08:10,664
- This one? No way.
- No. That one.

1652
01:08:10,665 --> 01:08:12,435
- The shape of that pedal boat is...
- Yes.

1653
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:14,265
You're right.

1654
01:08:14,805 --> 01:08:15,935
You're right.

1655
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:18,904
(The pedal boats look like a couple.)

1656
01:08:18,905 --> 01:08:20,075
I'm a bit embarrassed.

1657
01:08:20,905 --> 01:08:22,345
- Hello.
- Hi.

1658
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:24,115
Come this way.

1659
01:08:24,245 --> 01:08:25,645
Which one are we riding?

1660
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,185
Okay. You'll go kayaking.

1661
01:08:28,385 --> 01:08:29,615
- Kayaking?
- Yes.

1662
01:08:30,115 --> 01:08:31,284
Is it powered by a motor?

1663
01:08:31,285 --> 01:08:32,585
No. You'll get on board,

1664
01:08:33,255 --> 01:08:35,754
and you'll row. I want you to wear this.

1665
01:08:35,755 --> 01:08:37,495
But I'm all dressed up.

1666
01:08:38,225 --> 01:08:39,294
Gosh. Thank you.

1667
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,635
Does it make sense to wear the life jacket over the dress?

1668
01:08:41,765 --> 01:08:42,994
- Listen to me, everyone.
- You.

1669
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:45,035
Did Da Hye wear the dress to put on the life jacket over it?

1670
01:08:46,535 --> 01:08:47,704
- This one?
- Yes.

1671
01:08:47,705 --> 01:08:49,104
- Okay.
- Okay.

1672
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:50,504
(Unexpected looks for the date)

1673
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:51,535
Okay.

1674
01:08:52,175 --> 01:08:53,305
Right now,

1675
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,244
- I have to take a photo of this.
- This?

1676
01:08:55,245 --> 01:08:56,675
- Take it for me.
- Your backside looks...

1677
01:08:57,545 --> 01:08:58,585
so funny.

1678
01:09:02,015 --> 01:09:03,185
Look at the camera.

1679
01:09:09,225 --> 01:09:11,325
- Good.
- First.

1680
01:09:11,455 --> 01:09:13,524
- I'll hold the kayak.
- Okay.

1681
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:14,825
Be careful.

1682
01:09:15,065 --> 01:09:16,895
Okay. Careful.

1683
01:09:17,095 --> 01:09:18,134
Be careful.

1684
01:09:18,135 --> 01:09:20,064
(Casually taking Da Hye's hand)

1685
01:09:20,065 --> 01:09:21,135
Careful.

1686
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:25,075
Okay. Good.

1687
01:09:25,505 --> 01:09:26,544
Go on it this way.

1688
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:28,204
They sit facing each other.

1689
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,845
Okay. Be careful.

1690
01:09:29,975 --> 01:09:31,745
This feels like Ha Long Bay.

1691
01:09:31,915 --> 01:09:33,384
- Go.
- We'll get going.

1692
01:09:33,385 --> 01:09:34,784
- We'll go now. See you.
- Go.

1693
01:09:34,785 --> 01:09:35,785
Go.

1694
01:09:35,786 --> 01:09:37,355
See you later.

1695
01:09:37,455 --> 01:09:38,585
This is fun.

1696
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:44,925
It's so pretty.

1697
01:09:51,135 --> 01:09:53,035
It's really pretty.

1698
01:09:56,675 --> 01:09:58,305
Gosh. I love it.

1699
01:09:58,705 --> 01:09:59,974
It's relaxing. What do you think?

1700
01:09:59,975 --> 01:10:02,015
- I think this is nice.
- Yes. This is nice.

1701
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:05,045
Even if I pedal slowly, it moves smoothly.

1702
01:10:05,585 --> 01:10:07,015
And it's not hot.

1703
01:10:10,215 --> 01:10:11,654
It's a beautiful view.

1704
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:13,354
- It's crazy.
- It's picturesque.

1705
01:10:13,355 --> 01:10:14,685
It's a nice view.

1706
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,424
The town date seemed like a rom-com.

1707
01:10:18,425 --> 01:10:19,894
- But this is a romance movie.
- Yes.

1708
01:10:19,895 --> 01:10:21,265
- You're right.
- Yes.

1709
01:10:22,065 --> 01:10:24,035
It's so nice.

1710
01:10:24,435 --> 01:10:29,974
(A private moment together without any distractions)

1711
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:30,678
I love it.

1712
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:33,139
I'm on Geoje Island.

1713
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:35,875
- I've never had a date on a lake.
- Right.

1714
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:38,275
- This is my first time kayaking.
- I see.

1715
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:39,491
Also,

1716
01:10:39,998 --> 01:10:43,415
it's been a while since I came to such a beautiful place.

1717
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:47,725
You pulled a homebody out of her home.

1718
01:10:49,025 --> 01:10:50,454
Please take a photo of me pedalling hard.

1719
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,455
Yes. Right.

1720
01:10:51,925 --> 01:10:52,778
I'll take it.

1721
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:57,794
- I'll take a video of you.
- Yes.

1722
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:58,934
Do I look professional?

1723
01:10:58,935 --> 01:11:00,505
- Yes, you do.
- Do I look like a pro?

1724
01:11:02,275 --> 01:11:03,804
- How is it?
- It's nice.

1725
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:04,835
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1726
01:11:05,245 --> 01:11:07,845
My love bud made a perfect choice.

1727
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:09,315
Exactly.

1728
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:11,375
- They're satisfied.
- Thank you, Young Ji.

1729
01:11:11,415 --> 01:11:13,815
What a pleasant date it is.

1730
01:11:14,745 --> 01:11:15,914
Good.

1731
01:11:15,915 --> 01:11:17,185
It's pleasant for me too.

1732
01:11:17,415 --> 01:11:18,754
The breeze is blowing.

1733
01:11:18,755 --> 01:11:19,985
We're sitting.

1734
01:11:20,385 --> 01:11:22,055
- Doesn't it feel like overseas?
- Yes.

1735
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:24,355
- Like Canada?
- Yes.

1736
01:11:24,595 --> 01:11:26,625
You're right. It feels like a lake in Canada.

1737
01:11:27,525 --> 01:11:32,435
Watching the Northern Lights is on my bucket list.

1738
01:11:33,405 --> 01:11:34,834
I heard the Northern Lights in Canada...

1739
01:11:34,835 --> 01:11:36,534
- are so pretty.
- It's known for them.

1740
01:11:36,535 --> 01:11:38,075
- Yes. That's what I've heard.
- Yes.

1741
01:11:38,205 --> 01:11:40,775
Also Canada's...

1742
01:11:41,945 --> 01:11:43,414
- Quebec.
- Quebec?

1743
01:11:43,415 --> 01:11:46,345
The films by the directors from Quebec are all unique.

1744
01:11:46,585 --> 01:11:51,115
The longest dream I've ever had...

1745
01:11:51,155 --> 01:11:52,624
is to shoot a film.

1746
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:53,755
- Shooting the film.
- Yes.

1747
01:11:53,925 --> 01:11:55,425
- A film director?
- Yes.

1748
01:11:56,555 --> 01:11:59,025
I've never given up my dream, but the direction...

1749
01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:01,525
and the scale of it has shrunk.

1750
01:12:01,835 --> 01:12:03,935
You can go on with the smaller version of it.

1751
01:12:04,135 --> 01:12:05,505
When it pans out well,

1752
01:12:05,765 --> 01:12:07,505
- you'll never know.
- That's true.

1753
01:12:08,675 --> 01:12:10,401
Do you have such a dream?

1754
01:12:11,105 --> 01:12:12,081
- Well...
- Yes.

1755
01:12:13,545 --> 01:12:16,875
There's something I do for a living right now.

1756
01:12:17,675 --> 01:12:19,585
But it'll be unfortunate to do just that my whole life.

1757
01:12:20,915 --> 01:12:22,354
- Do you want to try something else?
- Yes.

1758
01:12:22,355 --> 01:12:23,515
One day,

1759
01:12:23,785 --> 01:12:24,855
I want to enter the artistic world.

1760
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:29,755
Either photography or video.

1761
01:12:29,955 --> 01:12:31,554
- A visual media.
- We have that in common.

1762
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:32,725
- Something visual.
- Yes.

1763
01:12:33,965 --> 01:12:34,965
What?

1764
01:12:35,165 --> 01:12:37,995
- They have something in common.
- And she mentions it.

1765
01:12:38,335 --> 01:12:39,765
She's very proactive.

1766
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:41,805
- That's what I want to try.
- That's right.

1767
01:12:42,135 --> 01:12:43,334
Okay.

1768
01:12:43,335 --> 01:12:45,444
Then I'll make a guess.

1769
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:46,445
I know one thing.

1770
01:12:47,145 --> 01:12:48,745
You're not in the art field.

1771
01:12:49,015 --> 01:12:50,275
I'm not in the art field?

1772
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:51,445
Are you sure?

1773
01:12:51,675 --> 01:12:53,884
Yes. What I think is...

1774
01:12:53,885 --> 01:12:56,055
you're an engineer or a producer.

1775
01:12:56,155 --> 01:12:57,185
I've narrowed it down.

1776
01:12:59,225 --> 01:13:01,285
But I'm certain you work in the music industry.

1777
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,455
While watching their conversation, I realised...

1778
01:13:03,555 --> 01:13:04,594
that Da Hye talks about herself...

1779
01:13:04,595 --> 01:13:05,964
before she knows it.

1780
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,664
Da Hye usually doesn't talk much about herself.

1781
01:13:07,665 --> 01:13:09,334
- Really?
- She usually doesn't.

1782
01:13:09,335 --> 01:13:11,464
- She mostly listens to me.
- Really?

1783
01:13:11,465 --> 01:13:12,605
That's the type of person she is.

1784
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:14,135
But she talks about herself a lot today.

1785
01:13:14,235 --> 01:13:15,835
Dong Ha leads the conversation well.

1786
01:13:16,075 --> 01:13:17,875
- So that Da Hye can talk.
- Yes.

1787
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:20,875
Dip your hand in the water.

1788
01:13:22,245 --> 01:13:23,545
It's nice and cool.

1789
01:13:25,015 --> 01:13:26,085
Dip deeper in the water.

1790
01:13:29,985 --> 01:13:31,984
- Don't do it.
- They look cute.

1791
01:13:31,985 --> 01:13:33,055
Don't do it.

1792
01:13:33,485 --> 01:13:34,525
- I...
- What?

1793
01:13:34,685 --> 01:13:36,094
Don't do it.

1794
01:13:36,095 --> 01:13:37,355
You changed the genre of the show.

1795
01:13:37,595 --> 01:13:38,824
- Is it going to be okay?
- It's okay.

1796
01:13:38,825 --> 01:13:40,094
(They can't stop laughing.)

1797
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,594
- The genre is changing.
- I always wanted to try this.

1798
01:13:41,595 --> 01:13:43,595
I've never played around like this.

1799
01:13:45,665 --> 01:13:47,335
- Your glasses are wet.
- Yes.

1800
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:49,804
Don't do it.

1801
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,475
Then it'll turn into "Physical: 100."

1802
01:13:53,575 --> 01:13:55,175
Don't leave me behind.

1803
01:13:56,845 --> 01:13:58,474
The thought of it suddenly scares me.

1804
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:01,445
- What?
- If you leave me behind here...

1805
01:14:02,515 --> 01:14:04,055
- Are you an N-type?
- I'm scared.

1806
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:05,585
I'm a hardcore-N.

1807
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:08,724
What are you again? You're N-type too.

1808
01:14:08,725 --> 01:14:10,025
- I'm an ENTJ.
- Yes.

1809
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:11,494
- You're an ENTJ.
- Yes.

1810
01:14:11,495 --> 01:14:13,664
Do you know the INTPs love ENTJs?

1811
01:14:13,665 --> 01:14:15,635
- Are you an INTP?
- I am.

1812
01:14:18,965 --> 01:14:21,034
- She flirts nonstop.
- Hold on.

1813
01:14:21,035 --> 01:14:22,575
It means, "I like you."

1814
01:14:23,135 --> 01:14:24,405
It's relaxing to be around them.

1815
01:14:25,205 --> 01:14:26,575
But it's not like...

1816
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:27,945
How it feels...

1817
01:14:28,045 --> 01:14:30,514
is important for us, the INTPs.

1818
01:14:30,515 --> 01:14:32,185
- To feel relaxed?
- Yes.

1819
01:14:33,815 --> 01:14:35,614
It's all thanks to the ENTJ, isn't it?

1820
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:36,785
(It's all thanks to Dong Ha.)

1821
01:14:43,895 --> 01:14:45,425
(Looking around)

1822
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:47,392
- What?
- Why?

1823
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:49,166
Why?

1824
01:14:49,935 --> 01:14:51,794
The sunlight is a bit strong.

1825
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:54,065
It must be around noon now.

1826
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:59,145
(Urgent hand moves)

1827
01:15:00,675 --> 01:15:02,444
(Pedalling at full speed)

1828
01:15:02,445 --> 01:15:04,845
He's trying to go back as fast as possible.

1829
01:15:06,445 --> 01:15:09,454
Am I the only one who's overly excited?

1830
01:15:09,455 --> 01:15:10,455
- He moved to the shade.
- To the shade.

1831
01:15:10,456 --> 01:15:12,624
- What?
- Nice.

1832
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:14,654
- That was nice.
- Gosh.

1833
01:15:14,655 --> 01:15:15,655
(Super touched)

1834
01:15:15,656 --> 01:15:17,195
- That's cool.
- Yes.

1835
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:19,195
Did you see the shade covering her all of a sudden?

1836
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:20,894
- I'm swooning.
- What?

1837
01:15:20,895 --> 01:15:21,965
- Gosh.
- That's interesting.

1838
01:15:22,465 --> 01:15:25,095
I think Mi Joo is the one falling for him. Am I right?

1839
01:15:25,235 --> 01:15:26,604
I think Mi Joo is the one falling for him.

1840
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,835
That was crazy.

1841
01:15:30,405 --> 01:15:31,229
I love it.

1842
01:15:31,885 --> 01:15:33,025
It's so nice.

1843
01:15:36,315 --> 01:15:37,374
- Watch your head.
- Okay.

1844
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:40,714
(Dong Ha looks after her attentively.)

1845
01:15:40,715 --> 01:15:41,561
Be careful.

1846
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,855
I'm so high-maintenance.

1847
01:15:45,885 --> 01:15:47,355
Is that the type of person you are?

1848
01:15:47,385 --> 01:15:50,554
But when I'm around my friends,

1849
01:15:50,555 --> 01:15:53,964
- I haven't really heard that.
- I see.

1850
01:15:53,965 --> 01:15:54,524
But...

1851
01:15:55,435 --> 01:15:56,682
But when...

1852
01:15:59,205 --> 01:16:01,805
I heard I was high-maintenance from my ex-boyfriends.

1853
01:16:02,499 --> 01:16:03,868
Is it because I rely a lot on them?

1854
01:16:04,007 --> 01:16:05,138
You shouldn't have said that.

1855
01:16:06,475 --> 01:16:09,045
She shouldn't have talked about her ex-boyfriends.

1856
01:16:09,275 --> 01:16:11,114
That's a no-no, Da Hye.

1857
01:16:11,115 --> 01:16:12,145
It works against you.

1858
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:15,715
Do you think I am high-maintenance?

1859
01:16:17,555 --> 01:16:18,954
If you need attention,

1860
01:16:18,955 --> 01:16:21,325
I can give you the attention.

1861
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:26,225
He's charismatic.

1862
01:16:26,965 --> 01:16:29,095
Gosh. It's so nice.

1863
01:16:34,435 --> 01:16:35,775
- Does it look pretty?
- Yes.

1864
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:40,975
- Watch your head.
- Okay.

1865
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:42,875
"Watch your head."

1866
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:44,838
Be careful.

1867
01:16:45,045 --> 01:16:46,415
He must be getting tutored on this.

1868
01:16:48,315 --> 01:16:49,714
- He went to a school for it.
- A school?

1869
01:16:49,715 --> 01:16:51,855
- Yes.
- Did he practice it beforehand?

1870
01:16:52,155 --> 01:16:54,685
Will you take a selfie with both of us in it?

1871
01:16:55,725 --> 01:16:56,612
Good idea.

1872
01:16:57,925 --> 01:16:59,394
- Can you see it?
- Yes.

1873
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:01,764
(The love bud-recommended date was romantic.)

1874
01:17:01,765 --> 01:17:03,395
Hey. I love it.

1875
01:17:04,135 --> 01:17:05,605
I'm happy.

1876
01:17:06,065 --> 01:17:07,935
- She said she's happy.
- She's happy.

1877
01:17:09,035 --> 01:17:12,205
It was a memorable date, and I was very satisfied.

1878
01:17:12,405 --> 01:17:15,075
The view was so pretty.

1879
01:17:15,175 --> 01:17:16,774
Not just because of the pretty view,

1880
01:17:16,775 --> 01:17:20,114
our conversation felt special.

1881
01:17:20,115 --> 01:17:23,985
I could understand what kind of vibe he had.

1882
01:17:24,955 --> 01:17:29,795
In fact, I didn't really get to talk to Da Hye yesterday.

1883
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,564
I was glad that I got to know...

1884
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:37,095
what kind of person she was.

1885
01:17:38,435 --> 01:17:40,634
Gosh. He said something amazing.

1886
01:17:40,635 --> 01:17:41,635
- Yes.
- Yes.

1887
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,934
When Da Hye said she needed attention...

1888
01:17:44,935 --> 01:17:47,075
Nam Hee, will you say it with your cool voice?

1889
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:48,475
"I can give you the attention."

1890
01:17:49,615 --> 01:17:51,174
Your voice is nice.

1891
01:17:51,175 --> 01:17:52,584
- It's so nice.
- I almost fell in love with him.

1892
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:53,914
- It's so nice.
- Gosh.

1893
01:17:53,915 --> 01:17:55,554
I don't have such a voice.

1894
01:17:55,555 --> 01:17:56,815
Not at all.

1895
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:58,614
Show us your version too.

1896
01:17:58,615 --> 01:18:00,525
- I can't do it.
- Why not?

1897
01:18:00,555 --> 01:18:02,025
Se Ho, I need lots of attention.

1898
01:18:02,555 --> 01:18:03,595
Is that so?

1899
01:18:04,725 --> 01:18:06,324
- Don't do it.
- Do you need attention?

1900
01:18:06,325 --> 01:18:07,465
- "Don't do it." - By the way,

1901
01:18:07,895 --> 01:18:10,094
Ye Eun watched the video...

1902
01:18:10,095 --> 01:18:13,035
- as if you were watching a movie.
- Yes, she did.

1903
01:18:13,065 --> 01:18:14,235
Which part did you like the most?

1904
01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:15,974
- It was heart-fluttering.
- Yes. A little.

1905
01:18:15,975 --> 01:18:16,975
Which part?

1906
01:18:17,775 --> 01:18:18,835
Riding the boat?

1907
01:18:19,545 --> 01:18:20,745
Ye Eun is...

1908
01:18:21,545 --> 01:18:24,114
- You're so frank.
- She's a very frank person.

1909
01:18:24,115 --> 01:18:25,885
- Yes. I'm frank.
- Right.

1910
01:18:26,445 --> 01:18:28,885
When they are on a 1-on-1 date....

1911
01:18:29,015 --> 01:18:30,584
- It felt totally different.
- Yes.

1912
01:18:30,585 --> 01:18:31,915
- It was very different.
- I loved it.

1913
01:18:40,695 --> 01:18:42,994
(Did they knock on each other's hearts...)

1914
01:18:42,995 --> 01:18:45,264
(through the 1-on-1 matching dates by the Love buds?)

1915
01:18:45,265 --> 01:18:46,865
(Who is the person who knocked on the door of your heart today?)

1916
01:18:53,545 --> 01:18:54,675
What?

1917
01:18:54,775 --> 01:18:56,644
- Are they choosing again?
- They are choosing...

1918
01:18:56,645 --> 01:18:57,674
- for the second day.
- Who will he pick?

1919
01:18:57,675 --> 01:18:59,245
This is after the first date.

1920
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:03,415
(They face the four people's names once again today.)

1921
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:07,725
(On the 2nd night, who will Dong Ha choose?)

1922
01:19:08,455 --> 01:19:10,695
I'm so curious about their second choices.

1923
01:19:10,825 --> 01:19:12,725
- I can't wait to find out.
- Will it be Da Hye?

1924
01:19:13,025 --> 01:19:15,395
- It has to be Da Hye.
- I'm curious.

1925
01:19:16,895 --> 01:19:20,034
(Who will Dong Ha choose after going on a date with Da Hye?)

1926
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:21,064
I'm curious.

1927
01:19:21,065 --> 01:19:23,035
(Who will Dong Ha choose after going on a date with Da Hye?)

1928
01:19:24,935 --> 01:19:27,904
(Who will Dong Ha choose after going on a date with Da Hye?)

1929
01:19:27,905 --> 01:19:28,905
I'm curious.

1930
01:19:28,906 --> 01:19:30,575
(Who will Dong Ha choose after going on a date with Da Hye?)

1931
01:19:33,915 --> 01:19:34,634
Choi Ji Eun.

1932
01:19:36,915 --> 01:19:38,085
- Gosh.
- I knew it.

1933
01:19:38,785 --> 01:19:40,954
- Exactly.
- We were right.

1934
01:19:40,955 --> 01:19:42,324
What? Why?

1935
01:19:42,325 --> 01:19:44,054
- Our guess was...
- It's over.

1936
01:19:44,055 --> 01:19:45,325
- What? That's it?
- Is it finished?

1937
01:19:45,355 --> 01:19:47,164
- Wait. Hold on.
- Come on.

1938
01:19:47,165 --> 01:19:49,065
- Are you ending it like this?
- It's because...

1939
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:50,879
Why are you doing this to me?

1940
01:19:51,765 --> 01:19:54,535
Why are you hurting Da Hye two weeks in a row?

1941
01:19:54,835 --> 01:19:55,975
Mi Joo.

1942
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:57,934
Hey, Mi Joo. Come back.

1943
01:19:57,935 --> 01:19:59,974
Come back here for now.

1944
01:19:59,975 --> 01:20:02,444
Honestly, I envy Ye Eun.

1945
01:20:02,445 --> 01:20:03,945
It's better not to be shown at all.

1946
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:05,274
(Staring)

1947
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:07,115
What are you talking about?

1948
01:20:07,215 --> 01:20:09,114
It's better not to be on it at all, girl.

1949
01:20:09,115 --> 01:20:10,115
Aren't you going to shut it?

1950
01:20:10,116 --> 01:20:11,554
- They're on the show.
- Can't you see us?

1951
01:20:11,555 --> 01:20:12,924
Da Hye got dumped twice.

1952
01:20:12,925 --> 01:20:14,585
Aside from everything...

1953
01:20:14,725 --> 01:20:16,094
Aside from everything,

1954
01:20:16,095 --> 01:20:17,455
what kind of a show ends this rudely?

1955
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:19,194
- Exactly.
- It was out of the blue.

1956
01:20:19,195 --> 01:20:22,895
We need to hear from Dong Ha the reasoning behind his choice.

1957
01:20:22,995 --> 01:20:25,734
But when Dong Ha was on the date,

1958
01:20:25,735 --> 01:20:27,064
he didn't express himself that much.

1959
01:20:27,065 --> 01:20:28,134
So, I think it's understandable.

1960
01:20:28,135 --> 01:20:30,434
Still, Dong Ha gave his full attention...

1961
01:20:30,435 --> 01:20:31,474
- to the date.
- That's true.

1962
01:20:31,475 --> 01:20:33,074
- He kept the line.
- Yes.

1963
01:20:33,075 --> 01:20:35,074
He made his decision.

1964
01:20:35,075 --> 01:20:37,614
You're right. Everything is right, including the decision.

1965
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:39,114
But why does this end...

1966
01:20:39,115 --> 01:20:41,184
with Da Hye getting hurt two weeks in a row?

1967
01:20:41,185 --> 01:20:43,015
The important thing is Sin Young...

1968
01:20:43,315 --> 01:20:45,255
- She's invisible.
- wasn't shown at all.

1969
01:20:45,515 --> 01:20:47,785
- That's better.
- No, now...

1970
01:20:47,925 --> 01:20:50,454
The dates are turning out differently than we expected.

1971
01:20:50,455 --> 01:20:52,394
- You're right.
- I can't wait...

1972
01:20:52,395 --> 01:20:54,395
- what will happen next.
- I'm so curious.

1973
01:20:54,895 --> 01:20:57,765
Who will be the person who will knock on the door of your heart?

1974
01:20:58,135 --> 01:20:59,138
Knock, knock.

1975
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:00,734
- Is this how it ends?
- Yes.

1976
01:21:00,735 --> 01:21:01,765
Is it over?

1977
01:21:01,865 --> 01:21:03,304
- Bye.
- Everyone...

1978
01:21:03,305 --> 01:21:05,745
- Does it end with that knock?
- Yes. Well done, everyone.

1979
01:21:06,145 --> 01:21:09,015
(I'm interested in two people,)

1980
01:21:09,175 --> 01:21:12,345
(but I went on a date with people other than those two.)

1981
01:21:12,585 --> 01:21:15,445
In a way, today was...

1982
01:21:15,755 --> 01:21:17,514
(For me, today...)

1983
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,795
(wasn't a very productive day.)

1984
01:21:21,425 --> 01:21:24,125
(I don't want to end it without doing anything.)

1985
01:21:24,925 --> 01:21:27,625
To Ji Eun...

1986
01:21:27,725 --> 01:21:30,664
(He might suggest something to her.)

1987
01:21:30,665 --> 01:21:33,634
(That put me under psychological pressure.)

1988
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:34,964
(A 1-on-1 date alone...)

1989
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:37,605
(with the person they like)

1990
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:39,645
(Your skirt is too short.)

1991
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,605
Do you want to place it over them for a second?

1992
01:21:43,015 --> 01:21:44,275
Let me give you some pasta on your plate.

1993
01:21:45,015 --> 01:21:48,385
(I could feel that he was making lots of effort.)

1994
01:21:49,085 --> 01:21:50,185
I appreciated that.

1995
01:21:50,685 --> 01:21:52,214
(And on that night,)

1996
01:21:52,215 --> 01:21:54,184
(she faces...)

1997
01:21:54,185 --> 01:21:58,455
(a new fact she didn't expect.)

1998
01:21:59,395 --> 01:22:00,063
What?

1999
01:22:00,695 --> 01:22:02,465
- What is it?
- What?

2000
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:04,465
(Her dilemma has begun.)

2001
01:22:06,305 --> 01:22:11,335
(I spent most of the time with Jeong Geun.)

2002
01:22:11,435 --> 01:22:12,905
- Why?
- What is it?

2003
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:14,669
What is it?

2004
01:22:16,675 --> 01:22:18,374
- You're here.
- Yes.

2005
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:21,845
(A delicate tension in the kitchen)

2006
01:22:22,115 --> 01:22:24,615
(A silent exchange of glances)

2007
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:28,584
(The tension grows.)

2008
01:22:28,585 --> 01:22:32,025
(What do their hearts say after their dates?)

2009
01:22:32,095 --> 01:22:33,294
(You know what?)

2010
01:22:33,295 --> 01:22:34,925
(I actually know someone really great.)

2011
01:22:34,995 --> 01:22:36,795
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

2012
01:22:36,865 --> 01:22:38,935
(Just open your heart a little.)

2013
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:41,865
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

2014
01:22:42,135 --> 01:22:44,135
(Date My Friend)
