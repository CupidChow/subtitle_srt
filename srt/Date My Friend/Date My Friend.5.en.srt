1
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,301
(You know what?)

2
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:16,930
(I actually know someone really great.)

3
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:18,801
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

4
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:20,841
(Just open your heart a little.)

5
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,840
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

6
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,010
(Date My Friend)

7
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:26,931
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

8
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,710
This place might turn into a jungle.

9
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:31,921
(This is a jungle.)

10
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:36,591
(I want to cook with Ji Eun.)

11
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,491
Should we get matching bracelets?

12
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:42,831
Until Sunday,

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,131
no matter what happens...

14
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:47,870
(We won't take them off!)

15
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:50,391
(Matching bracelets and a promise just between the two of them)

16
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:54,241
I woke up so I could talk with Su Jin.

17
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:56,440
- Hello.
- Gosh.

18
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,881
(Dong Ha waited for Su Jin to come out.)

19
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,540
(If I could choose...)

20
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,151
(a date today, )

21
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:03,781
(I'll choose you!)

22
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,280
(I like tall people.)

23
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:08,251
(Su Jin and Dong Ha grow closer as if by fate.)

24
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:11,221
(The men chose their dates.)

25
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:13,221
(The one who makes the move first is the winner.)

26
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,000
(The person I want to get to know most right now is Su Jin, )

27
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,681
(so there's no reason for me to hesitate.)

28
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:22,631
(It was clear to me.)

29
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:24,571
(Express your feelings openly.)

30
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,341
(Let's go.)

31
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,271
(Dong Ha went straight to Su Jin without hesitation.)

32
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,311
("What was that?" I was irritated.)

33
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:42,450
(I'll just express how I feel...)

34
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,921
(and give it everything I've got.)

35
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:49,761
(The Lovebud House has become a jungle. What lies ahead for them?)

36
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:54,331
(Episode 5. At a Dangerous Pace)

37
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:59,501
(After the second date)

38
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:01,340
I was going to get ready, but before that...

39
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:03,041
I had a talk with Dong Ha.

40
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:05,281
I asked him if he had talked with Su Jin,

41
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:09,551
and he said they had talked when they went running in the morning.

42
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,881
So I told him that's not a 1-on-1 conversation.

43
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,551
I was hanging around here earlier...

44
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:15,921
when Su Jin came.

45
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,297
She said she was going upstairs to read by herself.

46
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:20,191
But then Dong Ha followed her upstairs.

47
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:22,960
(Dong Ha?)

48
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:25,321
It seemed like they talked for a while on the second floor.

49
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,947
(Just then, Su Jin and Dong Ha returned from their date.)

50
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,300
What are you two doing here?

51
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,640
(Peeking)

52
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,740
We got home earlier...

53
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:37,341
and now we're just chatting over a beer.

54
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,140
- Nothing's going on, right?
- Hey, Su Jin.

55
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:40,980
- Yes?
- You look very tired.

56
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,251
Where did you go?

57
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:43,411
- We made a movie.
- Yes, we made a movie.

58
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,080
- What?
- We made a movie.

59
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,120
Did you film "La La Land?"

60
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:47,650
- Yes, "La La Land." We danced.
- Really?

61
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,490
No, we're just joking.

62
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:50,851
Really? All right.

63
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,861
- I'll watch it later on TV.
- Your eyes are full of doubt.

64
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:56,961
He's hardly looking at them.

65
00:02:58,631 --> 00:02:59,801
Right.

66
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,971
So...

67
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:07,371
spill the tea.

68
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:08,941
What tea?

69
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:10,111
About your date.

70
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:11,480
- The date was...
- What did you do?

71
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:13,210
I'm sure the others will ask you about it later,

72
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,580
but I'm just curious.

73
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:15,901
- What did you do?
- Where is it?

74
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,431
- Take a seat right here.
- Okay.

75
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:21,921
- We ate and rode a cable car.
- Yes.

76
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:26,091
We went to a mountain top...

77
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:29,790
just in time for the sunset.

78
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,591
We took a cable car and went up the mountain.

79
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,070
- A cable car?
- Gosh, a cable car?

80
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:36,400
(Men's selection date)

81
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,641
(Su Jin and Dong Ha's date activity: Riding a cable car)

82
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:41,641
I hope the others don't come here.

83
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,331
So we can be the only ones to see this?

84
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:46,081
I'm going to brag to them.

85
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:52,721
(They spent a sweet, private moment together up in the air.)

86
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:55,690
We’ve come quite a long way.

87
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,720
(The cable car shook and she got a fright.)

88
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,191
- Now!
- What?

89
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,361
- Look at that.
- Now.

90
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,760
(He didn’t want to miss the chance to take a photo with her.)

91
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,130
They look good together.

92
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:07,531
- Right.
- They look good together.

93
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,501
Come over here.

94
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:10,881
We'll be arriving soon. Quickly.

95
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,477
(Posing with her hands under her chin, like a flower)

96
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:14,811
I’m acting like I'm pretty.

97
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:16,970
It's so cringy.

98
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,011
You are pretty.

99
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,080
(Another quote from Dong Ha: "You are pretty.")

100
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,411
It's over.

101
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:25,650
- It's over.
- It's over.

102
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:27,521
That came out so effortlessly.

103
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:29,720
When he goes for it, he really goes for it.

104
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:32,261
He really is taking initiative.

105
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:35,891
This is amazing.

106
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:38,801
It's breezy.

107
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:41,121
I don't think we'll be able to see it.

108
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,900
- No, I can see it. We can.
- You can?

109
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:44,101
Should I hold onto some hope?

110
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,821
Do you think we'll get to come here again?

111
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:48,911
Come here again?

112
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:51,211
Like in the future? Or...

113
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,081
- I don't know.
- Like within this week?

114
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,580
No. In the future.

115
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,811
- In the future?
- Yes.

116
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:02,921
To be honest, today was perfect for me.

117
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,521
Me too.

118
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:09,461
(Dong Ha's date with Su Jin felt perfect to Dong Ha.)

119
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:10,890
What was it that Dong Ha said...

120
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,700
about his date with Da Hye? How did he describe it?

121
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,931
- He said it was unproductive.
- Right.

122
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,130
He said the date was unproductive.

123
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:20,100
But today, he said this date was perfect.

124
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,510
Watching them makes us feel all warm and sweet.

125
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:24,911
- It was a genuine date.
- That was the vibe of the footage.

126
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,861
I think, since Su Jin has never had a boyfriend,

127
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:29,350
she wouldn't have had that kind of experience before.

128
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,480
So because of Dong Ha's words...

129
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:34,180
and this view, she's falling hard.

130
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,551
Actually, as Dong Ha's Lovebud, I'm concerned that...

131
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:40,220
once Su Jin finds out about my friend's age,

132
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:42,860
it might throw her off...

133
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:43,890
- just a little.
- I don't think it will.

134
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:45,600
- From what I know, - Yes.

135
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,130
I don't think Su Jin's feelings will change.

136
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:49,771
At this point, age wouldn't matter to her.

137
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:52,300
The view was incredible.

138
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,940
That's why we said we made a movie.

139
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:55,841
The view was really amazing. Truly.

140
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,511
You made a movie indeed.

141
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:00,901
We admired the view before coming back down.

142
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,481
Must have been nice seeing that.

143
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,681
It bothers him.

144
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:09,691
The day feels so long.

145
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:11,861
- Does it?
- Yes.

146
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,991
I should take this to him.

147
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:17,900
(Meanwhile, Su Jin is looking for someone.)

148
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,201
Knock knock.

149
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:22,270
- Come in, Dong Ha. Over.
- Dong Ha's over there.

150
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:23,370
- What?
- In there.

151
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:24,641
- I see.
- Yes.

152
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:26,000
I didn't think to check inside.

153
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:30,611
(Su Jin was looking for Dong Ha.)

154
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,841
Dong Ha.

155
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:35,611
Yes, thank you.

156
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,781
For freshening up when you feel gross.

157
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,551
I have the same one.

158
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:44,960
- This one?
- Yes.

159
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,620
The wind blew all over us when we were outside, so we felt gross.

160
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,130
But we can't shower right now.

161
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:50,661
We were up in the clouds.

162
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,330
- Do I just wipe myself with this?
- Yes.

163
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,231
And when it dries, you'll feel nice and fresh.

164
00:06:56,801 --> 00:07:00,541
(Hyun Jin watches them in silence.)

165
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:13,781
I could tell something was up by their interaction with each other.

166
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:18,521
It felt different from the way she was with me.

167
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:21,190
I thought he got along with her much better than I did...

168
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,591
and that they looked good together.

169
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,360
- Gosh.
- He looks so sad.

170
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,261
No, we don't know that yet.

171
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:38,181
(Meanwhile, at the women's dorm)

172
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:39,810
We rode a cable car.

173
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:41,551
- Really?
- You rode a cable car?

174
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:43,480
- Gosh.
- That's great.

175
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:45,161
I almost fainted from looking at the view.

176
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,680
- The view was insane.
- I can imagine.

177
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,551
The view from a cable car is amazing.

178
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:51,291
- He bought me this.
- Did you guys eat?

179
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,190
- That t-shirt? Is it vintage?
- Yes, Geon Wu bought it for me.

180
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:55,790
- It's so pretty.
- Right?

181
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,130
- It looks good on you.
- Right?

182
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,800
- It looks so good on you.
- Right.

183
00:07:58,801 --> 00:07:59,831
It's pretty.

184
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:02,230
(During their date at the vintage shop, )

185
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,001
(Da Hye and Geon Wu picked out clothes for each other.)

186
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,370
You said you wear oversized clothes, right?

187
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,511
- I look good in oversized clothes.
- Okay.

188
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:12,340
- Geon Wu.
- Yes.

189
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:14,781
Can you maybe fit into a pair of size 55 pants?

190
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:16,611
Size 55?

191
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:18,581
I don't think so.

192
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,280
Wait, these aren't size 55.

193
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:21,751
They're 55 dollars.

194
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:28,060
- You seem to like vintage shirts.
- That's right.

195
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,090
Shirts with a cozy vibe.

196
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,260
I don’t even need to try it on. I know it’s mine.

197
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,601
That's perfect.

198
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:32,931
It looks nice on you.

199
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:36,071
Right? Let me just fix that. I think it looks nice on you.

200
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,041
I like this outfit on you.

201
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:40,701
You can wear jeans with that too.

202
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,041
How about this?

203
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,741
Gosh, I like this. It looks nice.

204
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,180
- Perfect.
- It's chic.

205
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:48,010
- This isn’t really my usual style.
- Right.

206
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,211
- This bag too.
- Yes.

207
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:50,911
I like it.

208
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:53,221
I want to change into it.

209
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:55,621
I'll buy this for you.

210
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,920
Thank you. I'll wear it well.

211
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,061
It's nothing.

212
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:01,990
So we picked each other's outfits.

213
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,430
We decided to change into them later.

214
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:04,530
- That's why I'm wearing mine.
- Really?

215
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,761
It suits you.

216
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:08,830
- Geon Wu has feelings for Da Hye.
- He does. He totally does.

217
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:10,301
- We all know this.
- Yes.

218
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:13,801
As Da Hye's best friend, I think Mi Joo will know how she's feeling.

219
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,840
I think Da Hye is also...

220
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,640
getting curious about him.

221
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,680
She wants to get to know him...

222
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:20,710
and is opening up.

223
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,980
- She finally realized his charms.
- She had no idea before. Right.

224
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,120
It's because Da Hye is someone who values what's on the inside.

225
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:26,350
So she's now like, "This person seems nice."

226
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,480
- I think they can also relate to...
- Their age gap is good too.

227
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,620
Each other well in terms of work.

228
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:31,490
How likely do you think it is...

229
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:32,860
that they’ll become a couple?

230
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:34,320
Based on this feeling.

231
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,361
I think...

232
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:36,791
they won't become a couple.

233
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,000
(Destroying the mood)

234
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,830
- Why would you say that? Ye Eun.
- No.

235
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,870
- Sit down.
- Ye Eun.

236
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,200
You don't want it to work out for any of them, do you?

237
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:44,201
- Since Sin Young likes him?
- Ye Eun.

238
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:46,200
- I mean...
- How could you say that?

239
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,640
Personally, I think that...

240
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:50,541
In the honest eyes of the viewers,

241
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:55,381
I don't think it will work out.

242
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:57,210
Then...

243
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:58,321
Ye Eun.

244
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,880
- In order to say something, - Hold on.

245
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,990
You need a proper start. How can you just say,

246
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:03,190
- "I don't think it will work out?" - No, I mean...

247
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,790
She's so funny.

248
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,271
(The Lovebuds end up bickering due to the tangled love lines.)

249
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:08,560
When did you get here?

250
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,261
- Five minutes ago.
- I see.

251
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,561
What did you do?

252
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:15,030
- We went to an underground tunnel.
- "An underground tunnel?"

253
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,230
There's a tunnel like this,

254
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,270
and you can see the ocean at the back.

255
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:18,671
It's a place to take good photos.

256
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:22,270
We also went to a cafe...

257
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,371
where we could see a good sunset.

258
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,011
And so...

259
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:30,081
the deck was really pretty.

260
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:33,350
And if you go out,

261
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:35,220
there are only chairs there,

262
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:36,941
and you can sit there and watch the sunset.

263
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,120
- I wanted something refreshing.
- Yes.

264
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,730
(Ji Eun and Jeong Geun's date was at a seaside cafe.)

265
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:42,961
It's an ade.

266
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:45,101
(Glancing)

267
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:48,371
(He scoops the cake.)

268
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,631
Open your mouth.

269
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,971
(He feeds Ji Eun first.)

270
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:56,070
At this point, it seems like Jeong Geun...

271
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:59,011
is focusing only on her.

272
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,211
You can only feed each other if you're together.

273
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,080
I felt a bit relieved.

274
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,981
I felt a bit...

275
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:12,621
You were the one who knew me the best,

276
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,990
so I was relieved that you asked me out first.

277
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,591
(That you asked me out on a date first.)

278
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,601
Well...

279
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:21,771
Did you think that I could choose someone else?

280
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,200
- No.
- You didn't?

281
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:25,271
No.

282
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:28,240
Honestly, there was no question about it.

283
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:29,811
There was no question about it.

284
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:32,051
I was expecting you to be waiting for me,

285
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:34,181
and in the end,

286
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,181
you accepted it.

287
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:38,881
So now we're on this date.

288
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:40,621
Can't they go out already?

289
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:50,290
To be honest, when we were being matched...

290
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,031
at the pool,

291
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,530
- I thought...
- You kept...

292
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:55,770
What is it?

293
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,440
- You kept saying that...
- Yes.

294
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:01,141
- you wanted to cook with me.
- Can't I say that?

295
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,211
I felt so shy.

296
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,541
(Sighing)

297
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:07,840
I do feel shy as well.

298
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,411
I'm not good at saying those things.

299
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:11,550
When I say that with others around,

300
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:12,881
I do feel aware of them.

301
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,851
But I thought I should say it...

302
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:20,521
in order to make my presence...

303
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:24,560
bigger to you in the eyes of the other people.

304
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:25,731
That's why...

305
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:28,931
- I felt so shy.
- Right.

306
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,601
And...

307
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:35,811
(Jeong Geun can't slow down his feelings for Ji Eun.)

308
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:37,611
We sat down and watched the sunset.

309
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:40,110
- So you only went to the cafe?
- Yes.

310
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:41,341
The cafe...

311
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,451
was like a complex cultural space.

312
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,581
They sold items and more.

313
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:52,820
Last time, from what I saw,

314
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:55,930
it felt like Dong Ha was still interested in Ji Eun.

315
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:58,700
- He did. Right.
- As well as an interest in Su Jin.

316
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:00,260
Between the two,

317
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:02,670
it seems like he still wants to go on a date with both of them.

318
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:04,070
- Dong Ha.
- Yes.

319
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,570
I have a feeling that he will turn the tables,

320
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:08,041
so I'm a bit nervous for Jeong Geun.

321
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,841
But did Dong Ha end his feelings for Ji Eun?

322
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:12,011
At this point?

323
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:13,981
I think we need to see.

324
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:15,911
- I'm curious.
- Me too.

325
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:22,951
(Meanwhile, Ji Eun is looking for something in the kitchen.)

326
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:24,721
Were you hungry?

327
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,481
I should eat something before going to bed.

328
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:31,531
There's only that.

329
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,531
Should we make scrambled eggs?

330
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:38,401
Do you want some? You can eat eggs, right?

331
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:45,081
(He quickly starts to cook for Ji Eun.)

332
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:56,751
(Golden brown)

333
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,361
(He quickly makes French toast to eat with the eggs.)

334
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:07,801
I hope it works out for them.

335
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:09,731
No one is coming when they are together.

336
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:17,041
(He cuts up the toast into bite-sized pieces.)

337
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,150
(Thanks to Jeong Geun's care, Ji Eun enjoys the food.)

338
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:27,321
It's sweet and salty.

339
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:30,591
- Is it good?
- Yes.

340
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:41,001
(Fidgeting)

341
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,471
(Glancing)

342
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,741
It will break.

343
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:50,540
Doesn’t it feel like no one noticed...

344
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,741
that I had this on?

345
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:55,481
But it goes well with your outfit.

346
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:57,011
- With this?
- Yes.

347
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,621
When else would I get to wear these kinds of accessories?

348
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:02,421
- Other than now.
- Right now.

349
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:10,661
Let's do this.

350
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:15,631
Until Sunday,

351
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:19,141
no matter what happens,

352
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:20,870
let's not take this off.

353
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,871
(Let's not take this off!)

354
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,441
What?

355
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,881
"What?" That's what I thought.

356
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:32,681
Can you do that?

357
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:35,250
I'm just asking,

358
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,551
Should we do that?

359
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:40,961
Okay.

360
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:52,641
What's wrong, Ji Eun?

361
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,771
You went too far, Jeong Geun.

362
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:58,480
The speed...

363
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:00,041
seems to be too rapid.

364
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:01,911
I'm curious to hear what you think, So Ra.

365
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:04,550
It does seem a bit too early.

366
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:05,650
There are three days left.

367
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:07,997
It's not the latter half yet. They are still in the middle.

368
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:09,990
I think it could come as a burden to Ji Eun.

369
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:12,460
"Why is he asking me not to take it off?"

370
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:14,121
- Yes.
- Yes.

371
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,001
(Geon Wu appeared in the outfit that Da Hye chose for him.)

372
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,761
- Is that it?
- Yes.

373
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,570
You look like a band member.

374
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,700
- Yes, you should play something.
- You need an instrument.

375
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,301
This is a band shirt.

376
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:28,710
(Proud)

377
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:30,841
I did think of it as a band-member concept.

378
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:32,540
(Really?)

379
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,410
Did you even match the jeans? Thank you.

380
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,250
- I should go like this.
- It suits you.

381
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:37,450
You folded the edge.

382
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:39,050
He didn't get to try it on before buying it.

383
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,120
Yes, I couldn't try it on.

384
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:42,821
- But the fit is really my style.
- It's nice.

385
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:44,161
- It suits you well.
- Does it?

386
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:47,561
- I think you chose well.
- Right.

387
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:49,861
That's so nice.

388
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,801
(Searching)

389
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,570
Actually, I'm craving some fried chicken.

390
00:16:57,571 --> 00:16:59,470
"Chicken?" Then we need to order delivery.

391
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:01,340
- Right.
- I want to order something.

392
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:02,540
Order one.

393
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,041
I'll order the chicken, then.

394
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:05,980
Any sides?

395
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,480
Sides? Cheese balls?

396
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,557
- Cheese balls. That's good.
- I want something good.

397
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:10,751
Potato wedges.

398
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:12,020
Potato wedges. That's good.

399
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,181
Add the sauce.

400
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:15,851
- Won't two be enough?
- Two.

401
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:19,261
But Su Jin can't eat spicy food, right?

402
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:24,690
What is it?

403
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:26,130
- It's a bit spicy.
- It's okay.

404
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:27,860
- I can handle that.
- Right.

405
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,070
She can handle it.

406
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,301
Then...

407
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,441
Goodness.

408
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:37,141
Why is my heart breaking?

409
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,210
Su Jin got really cold,

410
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:40,681
after closing herself off.

411
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,780
Why is my heart breaking?

412
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:44,580
(Hyun Jin...)

413
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:46,020
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

414
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:47,421
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

415
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:50,951
(Today's dinner is chicken.)

416
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:58,291
They're enjoying it.

417
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,771
- We...
- Yes?

418
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,921
We need to check the envelope on the board.

419
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:09,071
Did something arrive?

420
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,680
(Please open and read the envelope with your name on it.)

421
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:14,780
Is it thick?

422
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:16,061
- Yes, it's thick.
- What is it?

423
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:20,221
(What is inside the envelope?)

424
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:26,091
(They all check what's inside the envelopes.)

425
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,860
(They all sigh.)

426
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:28,861
Come on.

427
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:30,391
- What is it?
- What is it?

428
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,260
I have to say this for myself?

429
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:33,541
(I have to say this for myself?)

430
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,230
This is driving me crazy.

431
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,370
(This is driving me crazy.)

432
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:40,371
(What's written inside the envelope?)

433
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:41,800
(It's the card with their age and occupation information.)

434
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:43,511
They will reveal themselves?

435
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:45,680
It's about time now.

436
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:47,181
Since they didn't know until now?

437
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,551
- I'm so curious about Jeong Geun.
- Yes.

438
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:52,121
I think he will have a really unexpected job.

439
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:54,120
- I'm curious.
- I'm so curious.

440
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,321
I was born...

441
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:57,121
in 1993.

442
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:59,090
- Then how old is that?
- 32 years old.

443
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,190
Thirty-two?

444
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:01,291
And my job is...

445
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,531
I'm an M and A investment strategist.

446
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:09,071
- That's why you're strategic.
- He kept talking about strategies.

447
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:11,401
I didn't expect that.

448
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:15,871
I didn't think he would work in finance.

449
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,470
He's so handsome and has a good build,

450
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:21,210
so I naturally assumed that he'd have a sports-related job.

451
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:23,811
I can't help but feel bothered by it.

452
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,551
Okay. Next.

453
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:26,821
I'll go first.

454
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:29,321
- Dong Ha.
- She's curious.

455
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,531
I am a doctor.

456
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,660
- Really?
- Yes.

457
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,381
- You threw me off completely.
- What kind?

458
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,830
I run a dermatology clinic in Cheongdam-dong.

459
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:46,470
- Where?
- Cheongdam-dong.

460
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:47,541
Cheongdam-dong?

461
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:49,340
Su Jin's expression...

462
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:50,541
isn't so bad.

463
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,811
It wasn't what I expected, so I was shocked.

464
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,821
I think I can guess your age.

465
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:03,621
I say you're 33 years old.

466
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,791
I think 33 too.

467
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:07,661
I...

468
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,501
I was born in 1987, so that makes me 37.

469
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,571
That was shocking.

470
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:19,700
When you think about it, he's just a year younger than Hyun Jin.

471
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,401
Hyun Jin is ten years older than me.

472
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:24,441
He was older than I thought, so I was...

473
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:26,881
rather shocked.

474
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:30,350
The maximum age difference...

475
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:32,981
- Six years.
- she can accept is six years.

476
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:35,490
But Dong Ha is nine years older than her.

477
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:36,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

478
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:39,591
Su Jin said she wasn't comfortable with a big age difference.

479
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,630
But what's more important is...

480
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:44,790
how much she's attracted to the person in front of her.

481
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,100
The soccer community has a lot of men.

482
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,431
That's the kind of sports.

483
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:51,900
- Why was she single all the time?
- Exactly.

484
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:55,300
It isn't easy to succeed as a woman soccer player.

485
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,010
She probably focused on her career to become successful.

486
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:00,440
- She wanted to keep progressing.
- She wanted to keep progressing.

487
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:03,051
She probably didn't have time to date.

488
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:05,381
As her Lovebud,

489
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:09,151
I'm hoping she'll find her destined one.

490
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:10,521
I hope she finds one.

491
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,420
Next.

492
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,891
- Next, athlete.
- The athlete.

493
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:16,760
- Yes, she...
- They must've noticed...

494
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:18,361
- that she's an athlete.
- Yes.

495
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,131
I was an ex-woman soccer player.

496
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:24,670
I expected that.

497
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,700
- Really?
- Now I'm working as a soccer coach.

498
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:27,771
- But...
- My gosh.

499
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:29,810
That suits you so well too.

500
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:31,247
- Right?
- Yes, it suits her so well.

501
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:33,041
- What about your age?
- Your age.

502
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:36,911
I have a feeling she's young.

503
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,181
That's another of my concerns.

504
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:43,120
- I was born in 1997.
- See? They're the same.

505
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:44,751
But I'm 28.

506
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:46,190
- Your birthday has passed?
- My birthday has passed.

507
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:48,521
You're the youngest so far.

508
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:49,931
Don't worry.

509
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:52,501
(Sighing)

510
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:54,961
For both the younger ones...

511
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,101
and the older ones,

512
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:59,100
their ages could become a concern.

513
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,141
I agree.

514
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:01,901
Next.

515
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,310
- Should I say it?
- Yes.

516
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,841
- Please.
- I was...

517
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,481
born in 1996, so I'm 28 years old.

518
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:10,211
My job is...

519
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:12,821
a producer.

520
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:14,021
- What?
- What?

521
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:17,251
- I got chills.
- You're a producer?

522
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:20,251
I work at an entertainment company where Actress Kang So Ra is signed,

523
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:24,431
And I'm a producer in charge of video clips.

524
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:26,900
That's cool.

525
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,401
Gosh. That's amazing.

526
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:32,641
Should I go next?

527
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:34,570
I have no clue...

528
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:36,511
- about your job.
- I bet you're an artist.

529
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:40,311
I was born in 1996.

530
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,980
So that makes me 29.

531
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:44,410
I work at a fashion news company.

532
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:45,651
That company?

533
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,780
- Da Hye must be familiar with it.
- Seems like it.

534
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:50,290
I'm a project manager...

535
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,621
at a digital magazine company.

536
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,981
- Yes, in that line of work.
- Our jobs are so varied.

537
00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:59,130
In a way,

538
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:02,001
I could get in contact with Geon Wu's job.

539
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:05,171
So his job was most interesting.

540
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:09,041
I think Sin Young is the same age as Ye Eun.

541
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:10,141
Born in 1994.

542
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:12,610
The way you speak about her shows that you've been close...

543
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,341
- since you were young.
- I agree.

544
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm 30 years old,

545
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:18,580
- I knew it.
- born in 1994.

546
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,380
But my birthday has yet to come.

547
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:22,390
- You're right.
- I'm 30.

548
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:24,521
- My job is...
- I knew they were the same age.

549
00:23:25,251 --> 00:23:27,191
(Nobody knows Sin Young's job yet.)

550
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:29,631
a social worker.

551
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:33,430
- It suits you.
- It suits you so well.

552
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:34,660
It suits you.

553
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:37,630
I work at a welfare center for the disabled.

554
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:38,900
Yes. I'm a social worker.

555
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,340
Your actions are in line with your work.

556
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:42,341
- Do they?
- Yes.

557
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:45,510
You must be great at spreading happiness.

558
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,541
You'll be great at looking after people.

559
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:52,451
She's a warm-hearted and beautiful person.

560
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:54,051
What a cool lady.

561
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:57,790
- Can I ask how you guys met?
- The two of you.

562
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,891
We met in middle school.

563
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:04,131
- I see. In middle school.
- We met in our second year.

564
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,060
What was her dream back then?

565
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,631
Her dream was to become a social worker from the start.

566
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,300
- My goodness.
- What a surprise.

567
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:11,701
- She's so cool.
- My gosh.

568
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:13,000
We saw her work,

569
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,640
- and that suits her so well.
- I agree.

570
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:16,110
She would understand...

571
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:17,770
- a wide range of people.
- I think so too.

572
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,610
She's a very good person.

573
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,111
- Exactly.
- I mean it.

574
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:24,381
I'm 39 years old.

575
00:24:26,821 --> 00:24:27,881
I work as...

576
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:30,091
a play and musical actor.

577
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:32,691
It suits you perfectly.

578
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:35,990
- I was right.
- It suits you.

579
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,061
I was right.

580
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:39,030
When he said he was a stage actor,

581
00:24:39,031 --> 00:24:40,391
I thought it suited him very well.

582
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,230
He was a bit older...

583
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,571
than I thought,

584
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:46,401
but age is just a number.

585
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:49,011
He doesn't look his age anyway.

586
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:52,671
Me? Do I reveal it right away?

587
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:55,040
I thought she could be an announcer.

588
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,880
She does have the vibe...

589
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:57,881
- now that you mention it.
- She has the vibe, right?

590
00:24:57,882 --> 00:24:59,051
A weather forecaster.

591
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:03,191
I am 30 years old.

592
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:06,761
And I work as...

593
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:09,691
a beauty product commercial model.

594
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:13,230
- That's exactly what I thought.
- I knew it.

595
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:14,430
I'm a model.

596
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,501
(Everyone's age and occupation are revealed.)

597
00:25:17,071 --> 00:25:18,771
- Everything has been revealed.
- Yes.

598
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:20,741
Both their age and job are known.

599
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:26,411
- I know.
- What is it?

600
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:27,781
What's there?

601
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:31,111
"Lovebud Kang So Ra introduces her friend."

602
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:32,551
"Choi Ji Eun..."

603
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:34,981
"is a nerd who hides her beauty,"

604
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:37,220
"and she's like a female protagonist of a romance fantasy story..."

605
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:38,701
"who doesn't know how pretty she is."

606
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,661
"She is innocent and very kind."

607
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:46,131
"When she gets married, I want to MC her wedding."

608
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,441
You should get married soon.

609
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:55,501
- I should get married.
- I'm jealous.

610
00:25:58,271 --> 00:26:00,410
"Lovebud Kim Nam Hee introduces his friend."

611
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:02,450
(This time, Lovebud Nam Hee introduces his friend.)

612
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:03,451
What does it say?

613
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:05,050
- Why are you laughing?
- What is it?

614
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:06,651
- This is driving me crazy.
- Here I go.

615
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:09,650
(Nam Hee's friend, Hyun Jin)

616
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,591
"A magician with pretty smiley eyes."

617
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,720
- Hyun Jin has magical dimples too.
- Right.

618
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,161
"The young master of Mapo-gu's noble family."

619
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,130
That's a good thing.

620
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:22,400
In brackets, it says, "He owns two houses in Seoul."

621
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,630
(A magician with pretty smiley eyes. He owns two houses in Seoul.)

622
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:26,070
- This is crazy.
- Lastly,

623
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:28,600
"He has strict self-discipline."

624
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:30,140
- That's good.
- That was all.

625
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:32,940
- Why don't you like it?
- He wrote such good things for you.

626
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:34,440
He wrote things that you'd feel awkward saying yourself.

627
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:35,640
- That's right.
- Exactly.

628
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,511
- He's witty.
- He's witty.

629
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:44,251
"Lovebud Lee Mi Joo introduces her friend."

630
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:47,521
I wonder what she wrote.

631
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:50,490
"Lee Da Hye is..."

632
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:52,691
(What does Lovebud Mi Joo think of her friend, Da Hye?)

633
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,031
"She gives her all at everything."

634
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:57,631
"I've never seen her get angry. She's an angel."

635
00:26:58,101 --> 00:26:59,771
Hey. Don't cry.

636
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:11,651
(Since they were young, they shared the same dream.)

637
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:19,891
"I want to be like her."

638
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:21,860
- She wants to be like you.
- Oh, my.

639
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:23,760
(They became each other's role model...)

640
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,631
(and genuinely good people.)

641
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:37,510
My gosh.

642
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:40,680
My angel, Lee Mi Joo.

643
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:44,111
(My angel, Lee Mi Joo.)

644
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:51,921
I had a rough day today.

645
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:59,031
(During the swimming pool game)

646
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:05,870
(She unintentionally hurt Jeong Geun.)

647
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:09,641
(And the mood slowly turned sour.)

648
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:17,251
(She was upset because she thought everything was her fault.)

649
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,950
I'm sure she expected me to be bright and happy,

650
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,221
but I'm worried I'll look timid.

651
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,920
Mi Joo would feel upset when she sees me like that.

652
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:31,461
(She was worried Mi Joo would be upset seeing her like that.)

653
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,000
That's why she cried. Thank you.

654
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:41,170
I thought...

655
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:42,741
she was hurt again.

656
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:48,440
Da Hye...

657
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:49,950
did worry quite a bit.

658
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:52,581
She was worried about how she should act.

659
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,321
I think she was afraid...

660
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:56,321
I would worry about her as well.

661
00:28:56,491 --> 00:28:58,821
And I wrote those words for her.

662
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,090
I think that made her cry...

663
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:02,730
as well. I'm not sure.

664
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,090
She was mentally exhausted...

665
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:05,560
and intimidated,

666
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,460
- and she heard such nice words...
- Her friend. Yes.

667
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:08,800
From her Lovebud.

668
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:10,801
The moment she heard "Mi Joo," she started crying.

669
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:13,271
I understand how she feels.

670
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,671
Me too. I teared up a bit.

671
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,411
Yes. Me too.

672
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:18,710
Exactly.

673
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:19,841
I love you.

674
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:23,310
Oh, dear.

675
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:25,310
(Geon Wu gets up when Da Hye starts crying.)

676
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:27,120
It's so touching.

677
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:28,620
(Geon Wu gets up when Da Hye starts crying.)

678
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:29,850
I was feeling sorry.

679
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,391
- Don't be.
- Da Hye.

680
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:33,391
It's okay.

681
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:34,521
It's okay.

682
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:37,291
Today...

683
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:39,701
It's okay.

684
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,541
(The night at the Lovebud House deepens.)

685
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:53,180
(While everyone is getting ready to sleep, Geon Wu's in the kitchen.)

686
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:54,311
What is it?

687
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:58,081
- What is he doing?
- Is he preparing an event of sorts?

688
00:29:58,151 --> 00:29:59,451
Is he preparing breakfast?

689
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:06,761
Something smells good.

690
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:07,961
Nice.

691
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:10,791
Tuna mayo? What is it?

692
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:12,801
- Tuna mayo rice balls.
- Sounds great.

693
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:15,760
Tuna mayo rice balls are great.

694
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,501
Way to go.

695
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,410
- That's crazy.
- My gosh.

696
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,241
- They sell it like that.
- Is it sesame oil?

697
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:28,611
Yes. It has sesame oil, so it's very savory.

698
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:31,151
Tuna is a protein.

699
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:34,151
- Is this size all right?
- Yes.

700
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,151
That looks good.

701
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:39,821
(Tasting)

702
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:42,021
- Is it good?
- It's really good.

703
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:46,131
The rice balls bring back memories.

704
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,231
It's easy to make.

705
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,131
I'll eat one too.

706
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:53,777
- Have you tried it?
- Do you want it? I'm trying it now.

707
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:54,801
(Eating)

708
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:58,041
It's good, isn't it?

709
00:30:58,741 --> 00:30:59,741
(Eating again)

710
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,281
It's tasty.

711
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,711
- It's so good.
- It's delicious.

712
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:06,181
It's not too strong,

713
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:07,720
but it is savory. I couldn't stop eating it.

714
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:09,590
So I ate the most.

715
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:12,090
I said it was really delicious.

716
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:15,120
(Da Hye complimented your tuna rice balls so much.)

717
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:16,801
I should approach her more using that now.

718
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:18,691
What's this?

719
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:20,560
I'm making a new dish.

720
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:21,701
- Would you like one?
- Yes.

721
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:24,771
It's here.

722
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:27,341
I'm so hungry. I'd love to try one.

723
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:28,570
Me too.

724
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:30,140
It has sesame oil.

725
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:31,271
- In the tuna?
- Yes.

726
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:32,640
It's savory...

727
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,680
and mild. It has everything.

728
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:36,250
- Can I try one?
- Sure.

729
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:37,891
- Of course. Let me give you one.
- Sure.

730
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:39,951
Tell me if it's too big.

731
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:43,191
- It's fine.
- Is it good?

732
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:45,020
It's fine, right?

733
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:46,221
- It's so good.
- Yes.

734
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:47,661
Amazing.

735
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:52,030
(They can't stop eating the savory tuna rice balls.)

736
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:53,931
- It's so good.
- Right?

737
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:58,471
(The delicious late-night snack is over.)

738
00:31:59,941 --> 00:32:01,040
That would be a dopamine...

739
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,701
Should I turn off the lights?

740
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:04,371
What should I do?

741
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,971
Sure. Let's sleep now.

742
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:08,380
Or would you like a drink?

743
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:09,710
No.

744
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:11,011
That's not it.

745
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:14,980
Can we talk a bit longer?

746
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:16,150
- Or are you tired?
- No.

747
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:17,720
I'm very awake, as you can see.

748
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:19,091
- I was curious.
- About what?

749
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:21,391
How are things with Su Jin?

750
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,991
- Su Jin.
- What about?

751
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:25,011
- What are your feelings for her?
- My feelings?

752
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:26,891
You look like you've made up your mind.

753
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:28,231
- Me?
- Yes.

754
00:32:28,561 --> 00:32:29,570
- No.
- At least...

755
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,131
that's how I feel.

756
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:33,870
I said yesterday...

757
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,500
that I shouldn't stay this way.

758
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:39,781
I thought I should talk with her.

759
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:42,441
So we went running in the morning.

760
00:32:42,851 --> 00:32:44,510
While running, I asked Su Jin,

761
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:46,851
"Would you like to run a bit longer?"

762
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:48,451
And we did, the two of us.

763
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:49,950
You ran more?

764
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:51,121
Yes, we ran together.

765
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:52,651
We asked each other...

766
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:55,791
- about yesterday's date.
- Right.

767
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:59,501
"If I could choose my own date next time,"

768
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:02,430
"I'd like to go on a date with you." When I said that,

769
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,501
Su Jin said she was going to do the same.

770
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:06,801
Why would...

771
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,670
Once I knew...

772
00:33:08,671 --> 00:33:11,040
that we were of the same mind,

773
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,210
it was easier for me...

774
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:14,241
to interact with her.

775
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:17,511
That's when I felt the blow.

776
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:20,881
How was your date with Su Jin yesterday?

777
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:22,850
She's definitely someone...

778
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:24,351
I'm attracted to as a date.

779
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,961
But I don't think Su Jin feels the same.

780
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,121
Why? Why do you think so?

781
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:32,760
I think Dong Ha and Su Jin...

782
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,900
- had a talk.
- That's right.

783
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:38,101
When that happened...

784
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,640
How Su Jin acted after her talk with him.

785
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:44,510
- She looked like...
- The atmosphere.

786
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:47,280
- she felt a lot more comfortable...
- You felt something.

787
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:50,250
And natural than when she was with me.

788
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,551
That's what I thought.

789
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:54,851
(And now that he knows what Dong Ha is thinking)

790
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:57,850
Su Jin and Dong Ha's relationship...

791
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:00,361
is smooth sailing.

792
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:03,530
Her relationship with me might end...

793
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:06,131
just like this, in an undefined state.

794
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,931
For me, I'm interested in...

795
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,531
both Su Jin...

796
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:13,671
and Ji Eun.

797
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:16,741
From morning until the end of our date,

798
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:20,911
I spent the day with Su Jin, and that changed my feelings.

799
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:24,651
If I had to go on a date with someone besides Su Jin,

800
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:26,820
I'd choose Ji Eun.

801
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:28,581
But right now, I'm not sure...

802
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:30,151
how I feel.

803
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:33,391
(Su Jin or Ji Eun? Who does Dong Ha have feelings for?)

804
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:36,891
Well...

805
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:40,401
I did pick Ji Eun two days in a row.

806
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:44,031
So if I get the chance tomorrow,

807
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:46,941
I'd like to go on a date with Ji Eun.

808
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:51,341
He's so diligent.

809
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,610
- I don't believe this.
- He works so hard for the show.

810
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:56,140
- Gosh.
- How can he...

811
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,810
- What's up with him?
- Gosh.

812
00:34:58,811 --> 00:35:00,680
Didn't I tell you that he'd go for Ji Eun?

813
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,791
- He's not trustworthy.
- Exactly.

814
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,450
I get it,

815
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:07,020
but can he settle with one person now?

816
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,090
He's working diligently.

817
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:10,130
- He went on a date...
- Su Jin has never dated before.

818
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:11,260
They went on a date.

819
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:12,960
- She might get hurt.
- What if she's shocked?

820
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,060
- He asked Su Jin, - Poor Su Jin.

821
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:15,530
"Do you think we can come back next time?"

822
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,870
- He even called her pretty.
- Right.

823
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:19,000
If he ever hurts Su Jin, I'll hunt him down.

824
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:21,300
From what I observed, he didn't flirt like that...

825
00:35:21,301 --> 00:35:23,340
- with Da Hye.
- That's right.

826
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:24,570
- Dong Ha...
- But with Su Jin,

827
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:26,610
- there was still...
- With Da Hye,

828
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:28,611
- something more.
- he wasn't like that.

829
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:31,180
- I think he's doing great.
- But...

830
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:33,580
He came here to find a genuinely good person.

831
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:35,250
On the other hand, Dong Ha...

832
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:37,490
After going on a date with Ji Eun,

833
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:39,220
he could appreciate his date...

834
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,320
- with Su Jin even more.
- That's right.

835
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:41,490
He doesn't want to leave any regret.

836
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:43,391
That's possible. Right.

- It's so good.
- Let's eat.

(Everyone gathers around for breakfast.)

848

- They look so good.
- If you want more...

849
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,831
You even added parsley. Nice.

- I want a lot.

- Do you want some on your plate?
- Yes, please.

- Here.

- Sin Young, it tastes incredible.
- Really?

- Yes.
- It is.

Our in-house charming chef...

- should give his evaluation.
- Right.

878

The onion is the kick.

879
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:45,921
- The onion is the kick.
- The kick.

880
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:47,321

00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:41,971
It's hard to pack lunches every day.

888
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:47,381
She wasn't wearing the bracelet we promised to wear.

889
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,911
That got me a bit flustered.

890
00:38:50,211 --> 00:38:51,371
I wondered what was going on.

891
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:54,751
(Was there a reason you didn't wear the bracelet?)

892
00:38:58,591 --> 00:38:59,591
Why?

893
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,061
Why did she not wear it?

894
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,830
She nodded...

895
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:07,660
- and it felt really significant.
- Right.

896
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,830
Was there someone else she wanted to go on a date with?

897
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:11,731
That could be possible.

898
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:13,841
No wonder she didn't look all that bright.

899
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,641
(That can't be true.)

900
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:20,111
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

901
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:24,850
It's like a stage here. It's show time.

902
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,951
It feels like a cafe exhibition.

903
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,251
Right.

904
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,520
(Hyun Jin, who was always in charge of the coffee, )

905
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:31,751
(washes the dishes today.)

906
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:35,921
- Doesn't it suit him so well?
- It does.

907
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:38,390
I think I can drink some coffee now.

908
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:39,830
- You learned how to here.
- You can't drink other types.

909
00:39:39,831 --> 00:39:41,200
It's different from drip coffee.

910
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:42,401
Thanks to Hyun Jin,

911
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,070
- Right.
- I learned how to drink coffee.

912
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:46,941
- "Thanks to Hyun Jin?" - "Thanks to Hyun Jin!"

913
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:50,370
- Would you like to try smelling it?
- Yes.

914
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:51,870
- But it could be smelt...
- It could be smelt...

915
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:53,511
- as soon as you opened it.
- Really?

916
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:02,251
(Jeong Geun doesn't look toward Ji Eun.)

917
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:04,251
- He has changed a bit.
- Right.

918
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:06,961
He looks really upset.

919
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,890
But that is definitely something to feel upset about...

920
00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:11,231
without any sort of explanation.

921
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:17,270
(Peeking)

922
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:18,531
(Turning away)

923
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:20,861
There aren't any more of these bowls, right?

924
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:22,871
Here.

925
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:24,341
- Is it washed?
- Yes.

926
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:26,371
Yes, sir.

927
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:28,441
"Yes, sir?"

928
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:30,351
(Laughing)

929
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:34,821
(Peeking)

930
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:50,130
(They no longer look at each other.)

931
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:54,401
(They no longer look at each other.)

932
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:10,051
(Ji Eun leaves without saying anything.)

933
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:19,791
Jeong Geun!

934
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:22,660
Jeong Gun. Get yourself together!

935
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:24,301
- I did.
- You did?

936
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:27,970
You're quiet today and look quite lost.

937
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:29,071
No.

938
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,341
Are you okay?

939
00:41:30,441 --> 00:41:31,511
I'm fine.

940
00:41:55,831 --> 00:41:59,731
(He fiddles around with his bracelet.)

941
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:09,981
Actually, it's quite hard for me to handle.

942
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:13,081
She wasn't able to keep her promise.

943
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:20,221
(Did you not take off the bracelet at least once?)

944
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,490
- No.
- Even while taking a shower?

945
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,691
No. I never took it off.

946
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,701
That was why...

947
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:32,970
it felt like an invisible wall...

948
00:42:32,971 --> 00:42:34,871
suddenly formed in between us.

949
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:40,280
The bracelet was a big deal for Jeong Geun.

950
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:43,550
(His heart won't easily calm down.)

951
00:42:43,551 --> 00:42:44,750
Let's go.

952
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:46,551
- Great work today.
- Great work today.

953
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:48,651
Is this rain or fog?

954
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:59,091
Did you do a lot of talking yesterday?

955
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:03,571
Su Jin and Sin Young were my dates.

956
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:05,441
I did have a conversation with those two.

957
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:08,941
Well, you kept being with...

958
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:10,911
- Ji Eun the whole time.
- Ji Eun.

959
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:14,711
Actually, this is what happened with Ji Eun yesterday.

960
00:43:15,281 --> 00:43:16,911
While being on a date with her,

961
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,080
- I got matching bracelets with her.
- Right.

962
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:21,220
I chose her one,

963
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:23,020
- and she chose me one.
- I see.

964
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:24,651
- That must be it.
- Right.

965
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:27,191
I told her that I can't put on cute accessories.

966
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:32,461
That was why me putting this on...

967
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:34,000
had a great significance.

968
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,500
I'm keeping this on...

969
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,181
- even though it doesn't suit me.
- Right.

970
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:38,900
You got a shirt that looked good on you.

971
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:40,740
- Oh, right.
- Right.

972
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:42,217
(The matching bracelets meant a lot to Jeong Geun.)

973
00:43:42,241 --> 00:43:44,671
I was having scrambled eggs and coffee in the morning.

974
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:47,010
I checked her wrist, and something was missing.

975
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:49,141
That was when I felt something was off.

976
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:51,651
So that was it.

977
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:56,381
I took my seat, and her wrist was the first thing I saw.

978
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:59,650
That day started with the bracelet...

979
00:43:59,651 --> 00:44:01,260
and ended with the bracelet.

980
00:44:01,261 --> 00:44:03,560
The next day had to start with the bracelet again,

981
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:05,031
but it was missing.

982
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:18,171
No, don't get me wrong.

983
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:20,341
No, don't get me wrong.

984
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:23,781
Don't get me wrong.

985
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:26,580
Don't get me wrong. I took it off for the interview.

986
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,981
I'm sorry. Don't get me wrong.

987
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:31,341
- I'm sure they wanted to ask.
- Right.

988
00:44:31,821 --> 00:44:33,860
I was already prepared for...

989
00:44:33,861 --> 00:44:36,860
That was when I lost my mind.

990
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:39,660
I felt upset in the morning after that happened.

991
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:42,560
That could be seen as cute...

992
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:45,501
or petty to be upset about that,

993
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:48,671
but I thought that it would be better for me to express myself...

994
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:52,141
before accepting everything.

995
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:54,841
Well done. That's understandable.

996
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:58,480
I thought that I needed to see how things go.

997
00:44:58,481 --> 00:45:01,081
I'm not sure. I just want to understand what it was.

998
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:03,721
I want to know what she was feeling.

999
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,991
I want to know if it really was a mistake...

1000
00:45:07,391 --> 00:45:09,421
or she briefly needed to...

1001
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:13,561
How should I put it?

1002
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:18,801
She might have wanted to...

1003
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:20,970
leave space for someone else.

1004
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:22,601
She's free to do whatever she wants.

1005
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:24,511
I respect that.

1006
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:30,351
(Jeong Geun was lost in thought for a while after that.)

1007
00:45:32,151 --> 00:45:33,311
I'm torn.

1008
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:36,481
Should I take it off or not?

1009
00:45:38,651 --> 00:45:39,891
Keep it on for now.

1010
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:45,691
No. She broke the promise first.

1011
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:53,811
- He took the bracelet off.
- Right.

1012
00:45:55,901 --> 00:45:57,741
You can't take it off, Jeong Geun.

1013
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:05,611
(Ji Eun is lost in thought as well.)

1014
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:11,921
I felt really concerned.

1015
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:17,330
- She put it back on right away.
- Right.

1016
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:18,690
She put in back on right away...

1017
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:21,561
and said that it was taken off because of the interview.

1018
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:23,531
He still felt upset about it.

1019
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:25,030
- What do you think about that?
- Well...

1020
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:29,640
Jeong Geun expressed his disappointment right away...

1021
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:34,410
- but that kind of reaction...
- Right.

1022
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:36,881
Could feel quite burdensome to Ji Eun.

1023
00:46:37,051 --> 00:46:38,680
- Right.
- Him being upset like that...

1024
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:41,421
- could make her feel awkward.
- Right.

1025
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:43,450
But there was no reason for her to take it off during the interview.

1026
00:46:43,451 --> 00:46:45,721
I find it cute that he's upset like that.

1027
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:48,360
It does seem cute that he's behaving like that.

1028
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:50,120
That shows how much he likes her.

1029
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:51,930
I also think it's understandable to be upset about that.

1030
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:53,800
That is something you could feel upset about.

1031
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:56,200
I think it's okay because she put it back on.

1032
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:58,001
She had it with her anyway.

1033
00:46:58,101 --> 00:47:00,370
But anxiety stirs...

1034
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:02,200
because today's dates...

1035
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:03,540
- will happen soon.
- Right.

1036
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:04,541
This had to happen right before that.

1037
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:06,040
- It is unknown...
- Right.

1038
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:07,610
How they will be matched.

1039
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:09,380
The one that will be on a date with Jeong Geun...

1040
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:11,781
will feel very uncomfortable.

1041
00:47:12,051 --> 00:47:14,021
But neither of them has done anything wrong.

1042
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:16,550
Geoje Island has suddenly become...

1043
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:18,031
- a place full of incidents.
- Right.

1044
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:25,561
(The men head to the common area after a while.)

1045
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:30,831
Has it been updated?

1046
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:32,901
No. Or has it?

1047
00:47:33,271 --> 00:47:35,351
- Right. It has been updated.
- It has been updated.

1048
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:36,600
(This is what your hearts are saying.)

1049
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:41,511
(Last night's selection results get revealed once again today.)

1050
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:46,780
(Ha Jeong Geun)

1051
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,051
Jeong Geun got one vote.

1052
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:54,191
All I need is just one vote.

1053
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:55,620
And I wish that vote...

1054
00:47:55,621 --> 00:47:56,961
is from Ji Eun.

1055
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,931
(How many votes did Dong Ha get?)

1056
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:05,670
(Shin Dong Ha)

1057
00:48:05,671 --> 00:48:07,140
I expect it to be Su Jin.

1058
00:48:07,141 --> 00:48:08,241
(I expect it to be Su Jin.)

1059
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:12,870
- Su Jin and I were different.
- Of course, it should be different.

1060
00:48:12,871 --> 00:48:13,880
I'm here.

1061
00:48:13,881 --> 00:48:15,081
- You're here.
- You're here.

1062
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:16,841
Today's star.

1063
00:48:17,211 --> 00:48:18,250
Today's star.

1064
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:20,281
- Oh, you're right.
- Yes.

1065
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:22,420
(Today's star, Da Hye got 2 votes today.)

1066
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:24,820
You got two votes, Da Hye! Congratulations!

1067
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:26,461
(Today's star, Da Hye got 2 votes today.)

1068
00:48:26,691 --> 00:48:30,931
(Geon Wu voted for her for 3 days straight.)

1069
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,531
(He voted for her as well.)

1070
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:35,831
The person who knocked on the door of my heart today...

1071
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:39,400
is Lee Da Hye.

1072
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:40,641
(Oh Hyun Jin picks Lee Da Hye.)

1073
00:48:42,171 --> 00:48:46,211
I thought that I only wanted to learn more about Su Jin and Da Hye.

1074
00:48:46,741 --> 00:48:50,281
I thought that I had a pretty good relationship...

1075
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:53,211
with Su Jin.

1076
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:56,750
But after seeing her reaction after her date with Dong Ha,

1077
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:58,050
I thought that she suited him...

1078
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:00,390
and was compatible with him a lot more than me.

1079
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:01,591
So...

1080
00:49:02,761 --> 00:49:04,361
If I am to get the time or opportunity,

1081
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:07,501
I wish to talk with Da Hye some more.

1082
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:11,130
- He could feel confused.
- That's fine.

1083
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:12,200
- Right.
- But...

1084
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:14,100
it's inevitable for them to feel confused in that place.

1085
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:15,271
You're right.

1086
00:49:17,841 --> 00:49:19,240
What do we do now? Did we open this yet?

1087
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,241
- No, not yet.
- It has to be opened.

1088
00:49:20,242 --> 00:49:21,557
- Shall we open it up now?
- Yes.

1089
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:23,410
- Da Hye. Open it and read it to us.
- Da Hye should open it.

1090
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:24,651
- Really?
- You should do it.

1091
00:49:24,851 --> 00:49:26,150
Well...

1092
00:49:26,151 --> 00:49:27,957
- Do that for us.
- It's making me feel nervous.

1093
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:29,720
- It really is.
- What?

1094
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:31,121
- What is it?
- Gosh.

1095
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,790
- What is it?
- Should I read it there?

1096
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:34,121
- Should I read it there?
- Yes.

1097
00:49:34,591 --> 00:49:36,761
I only read the first line.

1098
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:41,900
I'll read it.

1099
00:49:41,901 --> 00:49:43,200
- I'll read it after taking my seat.
- Okay.

1100
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:44,361
Please read it nice and loud.

1101
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:46,200
"Who do you wish to get to know more?"

1102
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:48,841
"The date partners are selected by the women today."

1103
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:50,041
That's crazy.

1104
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:53,540
(The women get to pick their dates today.)

1105
00:49:53,541 --> 00:49:55,380
"The women should now head to the Heart Room..."

1106
00:49:55,381 --> 00:49:56,410
"and open the door."

1107
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:59,281
"Gather here after 30 minutes and request a date."

1108
00:50:02,181 --> 00:50:03,481
The time has come.

1109
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:10,161
I was hoping for Da Hye to ask me out on a date.

1110
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:14,060
We will head to the Heart Room...

1111
00:50:14,061 --> 00:50:15,530
- and open the door.
- Open the door.

1112
00:50:15,531 --> 00:50:16,960
- You four can stay here.
- We'll be back.

1113
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:18,171
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1114
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:19,701
- See you later.
- See you later.

1115
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,241
- My gosh.
- This is making me nervous.

1116
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:27,640
(The door of the Heart Room opens.)

1117
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:28,841
(Open your door.)

1118
00:50:29,681 --> 00:50:31,710
(When the doors of their names are opened...)

1119
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:32,780
What?

1120
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,857
Why are they asked to open the doors of their names?

1121
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:36,020
(Who are the ones who have chosen you until now?)

1122
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:37,951
The ones who have chosen them until now.

1123
00:50:38,021 --> 00:50:40,860
They get to know the ones who have chosen them until now.

1124
00:50:40,861 --> 00:50:43,420
(A chance to know about the ones who have chosen them)

1125
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:45,291
- Gosh, that's insane!
- Gosh.

1126
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:49,560
I was curious, but it's making me feel nervous...

1127
00:50:49,561 --> 00:50:50,601
to actually open it up.

1128
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:56,940
I knew it.

1129
00:50:56,941 --> 00:50:59,611
"The ones who have chosen Lee Da Hye until now."

1130
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,110
(Day 1: Oh Hyun Jin, Kim Geon Wu, Day 2: Kim Geon Wu)

1131
00:51:01,111 --> 00:51:02,140
(Day 3: Oh Hyun Jin, Kim Geon Wu)

1132
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,981
- Kim Geon Wu.
- It's Kim Geon Wu and Oh Hyun Jin.

1133
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,951
My prediction was correct.

1134
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,550
I've been on a date with Geon Wu.

1135
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:15,120
I felt a lot more certain...

1136
00:51:15,121 --> 00:51:17,491
that I should go on a date with Hyun Jin today.

1137
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:19,561
What? All of a sudden?

1138
00:51:19,562 --> 00:51:21,560
- What is that about?
- She's right.

1139
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:23,131
She has to go on a date with him too.

1140
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:24,201
She has to go on a date with him too.

1141
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:25,201
What is going on?

1142
00:51:25,202 --> 00:51:26,300
- Well, - But...

1143
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:28,670
She has the right to do that.

1144
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:30,540
Da Hye could be curious about Hyun Jin too.

1145
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,140
- Curious about Hyun Jin?
- Definitely.

1146
00:51:32,141 --> 00:51:34,611
(Enjoy your date, my friend.)

1147
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:40,551
What?

1148
00:51:42,821 --> 00:51:44,720
"Open your door."

1149
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:47,961
"We hope that it will help with your decision today."

1150
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:55,401
(The hearts that have headed toward her until now)

1151
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:57,001
(Day 1: Shin Dong Ha, Ha Jeong Geun Day 2: Shin Dong Ha, Ha Jeong Geun)

1152
00:51:57,002 --> 00:51:58,070
(Day 3: Ha Jeong Geun)

1153
00:51:58,071 --> 00:51:59,130
Shin Dong Ha.

1154
00:51:59,131 --> 00:52:00,371
Jeong Geun...

1155
00:52:03,571 --> 00:52:05,571
Dong Ha and...

1156
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:08,341
Dong Ha and Jeong Geun.

1157
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:12,811
Dong Ha voted for me twice,

1158
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:15,281
and I couldn't quite understand why.

1159
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:16,351
He voted for me twice?

1160
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:19,451
Why?

1161
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:21,860
(Who will Ji Eun pick as her date after reading the card?)

1162
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:22,961
Okay.

1163
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:24,390
All right then.

1164
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,331
(Who will Ji Eun pick as her date after reading the card?)

1165
00:52:29,261 --> 00:52:31,630
- Dong Ha kept picking Ji Eun?
- Yes.

1166
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:32,770
She will figure it out then.

1167
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:34,100
- She can figure it out now.
- Right.

1168
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:35,640
That is why this is significant.

1169
00:52:35,641 --> 00:52:36,740
- That's insane.
- This could make Ji Eun...

1170
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:38,611
- feel curious about Dong Ha.
- Right.

1171
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:41,110
Dong Ha didn't express anything to Ji Eun.

1172
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:42,991
(Dong Ha has never approached Ji Eun directly.)

1173
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:44,680
- My gosh.
- Tell me it's not true, So Ra.

1174
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:46,357
- Why am I feeling anxious?
- Tell me it's not true.

1175
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:48,250
It can't be. Come on.

1176
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:49,451
Come on.

1177
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:52,691
But she has the right to meet someone else.

1178
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:54,760
Ji Eun has never gone on a date with someone else...

1179
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:55,990
- other than Jeong Geun.
- Right.

1180
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:57,020
She can go on a date with someone else.

1181
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:58,060
She could be curious about the others.

1182
00:52:58,061 --> 00:52:59,061
But that one date...

1183
00:52:59,062 --> 00:53:00,407
shouldn't be happening at this point.

1184
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:02,830
- Jeong Geun has been with Ji Eun...
- They even got bracelets.

1185
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:04,501
So many times.

1186
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:06,470
It's going to end soon.

1187
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:07,617
Is it okay for things to go like this now?

1188
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,170
- It's not over yet.
- Da Hye.

1189
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,241
(Who said it was over?)

1190
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:15,741
(Dong Ha and Jeong Geun are sitting together.)

1191
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:25,321
I don't know why, but I'm feeling nervous.

1192
00:53:25,421 --> 00:53:26,491
Are you nervous?

1193
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:31,431
Do you have someone in mind who you wish would pick you?

1194
00:53:32,931 --> 00:53:34,261
Well, to be honest,

1195
00:53:35,861 --> 00:53:38,231
there isn't a date...

1196
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:41,100
that I'm that excited about.

1197
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:42,201
- Really?
- Yes.

1198
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:43,841
I just feel...

1199
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:46,371
But you still feel nervous?

1200
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:52,481
I'm nervous in a different way. Do you know what I mean?

1201
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:55,231
What does that mean? You just feel nervous?

1202
00:53:56,121 --> 00:53:59,891
I wonder who Ji Eun will ask out on a date.

1203
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:05,060
I'm just waiting...

1204
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:08,131
as Ji Eun has to get to know about the other guys too.

1205
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:10,941
That will make her understand her heart better.

1206
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:12,231
She will know...

1207
00:54:12,731 --> 00:54:14,570
who she is more compatible with...

1208
00:54:14,571 --> 00:54:16,701
and who she clicks with more.

1209
00:54:17,741 --> 00:54:20,171
You can never predict what will happen with someone's heart.

1210
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:24,650
I will have to wait and see. But I am quite bothered about...

1211
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:25,851
who she will pick.

1212
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:31,790
He said it wasn't because of his date.

1213
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:33,420
He said he was bothered about...

1214
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:35,320
who Ji Eun will pick to go on a date with.

1215
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:36,737
But he was actually referring to me.

1216
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:40,361
"I'm worried that Ji Eun. might go on a date with you."

1217
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:42,261
He was saying that.

1218
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:47,270
(Dong Ha was always curious about Ji Eun.)

1219
00:54:47,271 --> 00:54:50,670
(Jeong Geun wants to clear the misunderstanding...)

1220
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:52,471
(caused by the bracelet.)

1221
00:54:58,581 --> 00:55:00,411
- Gosh, this is awkward.
- Oh, no.

1222
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:02,721
It's a very close match.

1223
00:55:02,751 --> 00:55:05,220
Well, as for me,

1224
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:08,420
I'm okay with Ji Eun going on a date with Dong Ha.

1225
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:10,590
I just want her to go after getting the bracelet incident solved.

1226
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,430
- Right.
- If she goes on a date...

1227
00:55:12,431 --> 00:55:13,660
- before that gets solved, - Right.

1228
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:15,030
Jeong Geun will spend all day...

1229
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:16,960
- thinking about that.
- This was what I felt.

1230
00:55:16,961 --> 00:55:20,600
Jeong Geun got upset about the bracelet incident,

1231
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:22,140
and Ji Eun couldn't understand that.

1232
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:23,840
- It could've been about her work.
- "What's wrong with him?"

1233
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:24,841
I felt like this was her response.

1234
00:55:24,842 --> 00:55:27,940
Even so, Jeong Geun wants to...

1235
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:29,911
go on a date with Ji Eun...

1236
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:32,380
- He wants to get it solved.
- and quickly solve things.

1237
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:34,220
- There's no room for that.
- But if Ji Eun...

1238
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:35,851
is to pick Dong Ha at this point,

1239
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:37,081
that means...

1240
00:55:37,181 --> 00:55:38,550
there is no chance to get things solved.

1241
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:39,690
- The two will just...
- Based on Jeong Geun's personality,

1242
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:40,720
I think he will take off the bracelet right away.

1243
00:55:40,721 --> 00:55:42,001
That will be the start of a war.

1244
00:55:44,231 --> 00:55:46,090
(The women return to the common area after visiting the Heart Room.)

1245
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:47,190
Are they all here?

1246
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:49,907
(The women return to the common area after visiting the Heart Room.)

1247
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:51,701
Did you all decide on your date partners?

1248
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:52,731
Yes.

1249
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,000
How did you decide? Can you tell us?

1250
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:56,471
- Well...
- You can't tell us?

1251
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,040
We were gathered together,

1252
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,370
but we didn't discuss it with each other.

1253
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:00,611
- I see.
- Really?

1254
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,940
- So I'll go first.
- You can go first.

1255
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:05,681
I will go on a date with Hyun Jin.

1256
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:07,827
Well, she has to go on a date with the others.

1257
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:09,020
She should.

1258
00:56:09,021 --> 00:56:10,380
Right.

1259
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:11,951
My moment has finally come.

1260
00:56:12,591 --> 00:56:13,951
To be honest,

1261
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:17,961
I was wishing for Da Hye to pick me to go on a date.

1262
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:19,930
As she picked me,

1263
00:56:19,931 --> 00:56:21,830
I thought that I should...

1264
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:25,101
have a good conversation with her during the date.

1265
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:27,470
We decided to start with the one with the most votes.

1266
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:28,670
- I will pick Hyun Jin.
- The one with the most votes?

1267
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,070
- That's the order we're following.
- Right.

1268
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:32,140
Next.

1269
00:56:32,141 --> 00:56:34,810
(It's Ji Eun's turn to choose.)

1270
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:35,880
Oh, no.

1271
00:56:35,881 --> 00:56:37,711
(It's Ji Eun's turn to choose.)

1272
00:56:39,711 --> 00:56:41,051
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1273
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:42,681
It's so...

1274
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,021
That awkward mood was unavoidable.

1275
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:52,131
I just wanted to go out and have fun instead.

1276
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:57,900
(Who does Ji Eun want to go on a date with?)

1277
00:56:57,901 --> 00:57:02,070
(Who does Ji Eun want to go on a date with?)

1278
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:03,601
- No way.
- Please.

1279
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:08,441
That awkward mood was unavoidable.

1280
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,481
I just wanted to go out and have fun instead.

1281
00:57:12,981 --> 00:57:17,180
(Who does Ji Eun want to go on a date with?)

1282
00:57:17,181 --> 00:57:21,390
(Who does Ji Eun want to go on a date with?)

1283
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:22,821
- No way.
- Please.

1284
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:25,931
- I'll choose Dong Ha.
- Okay.

1285
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:32,271
(Ji Eun chose Dong Ha instead of Jeong Geun.)

1286
00:57:32,571 --> 00:57:33,671
Oh, my neck.

1287
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:37,241
- Wait, that's insane.
- Oh, no.

1288
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:39,641
- I feel so bad for Jeong Geun.
- But right now...

1289
00:57:40,071 --> 00:57:42,781
Someone stay by Jeong Geun's side.

1290
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,580
This makes the bracelet incident a bigger deal.

1291
00:57:44,581 --> 00:57:45,750
- Oh, no.
- This is bad.

1292
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:48,281
(Did Ji Eun's feelings change?)

1293
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:49,820
She's wearing the bracelet now.

1294
00:57:49,821 --> 00:57:51,790
Will she take it off for her date with Dong Ha...

1295
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:53,220
We don't know that for sure.

1296
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:54,690
Because there's a misunderstanding,

1297
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:56,990
it'll be totally over if she doesn't wear this.

1298
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,860
But what should she do, then?

1299
00:57:58,861 --> 00:58:00,360
Do you think she should take off the bracelet,

1300
00:58:00,361 --> 00:58:01,500
or do you think she should wear it?

1301
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:03,761
She should take it off to be polite.

1302
00:58:03,961 --> 00:58:06,530
She should wear the bracelet, but with a long-sleeve shirt,

1303
00:58:06,531 --> 00:58:07,741
so the bracelet isn't visible.

1304
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:10,200
Oh, kind of like this?

1305
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:11,611
I think that'd be good.

1306
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:13,441
It's the best way.

1307
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:17,540
You're wise.

1308
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:19,927
(Will Ji Eun take off the bracelet for her date with Dong Ha?)

1309
00:58:19,951 --> 00:58:21,521
- I'll choose Dong Ha.
- Okay.

1310
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:23,850
- I'll choose Dong Ha.
- Okay.

1311
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:30,021
(Ji Eun chose Dong Ha instead of Jeong Geun.)

1312
00:58:32,261 --> 00:58:35,031
I thought today would be the day...

1313
00:58:35,401 --> 00:58:36,731
my relationship with Ji Eun...

1314
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:39,371
would come to a crossroads.

1315
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:45,210
(Ji Eun's choice on the first day)

1316
00:58:45,211 --> 00:58:46,241
I...

1317
00:58:46,711 --> 00:58:48,041
Right, on the first day,

1318
00:58:49,941 --> 00:58:51,080
she chose Dong Ha.

1319
00:58:51,081 --> 00:58:52,950
(It was Dong Ha.)

1320
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:56,081
I choose Dong Ha.

1321
00:58:57,681 --> 00:59:02,861
(She finally got a chance to go on a date with Dong Ha.)

1322
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:06,830
I was a bit jealous of the others.

1323
00:59:06,831 --> 00:59:09,260
Talking to this person,

1324
00:59:09,261 --> 00:59:10,700
and then talking to that person.

1325
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:13,970
They naturally talked...

1326
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,841
to different people.

1327
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:20,841
I think I can be a bit free too.

1328
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:22,441
It's a date after all.

1329
00:59:22,811 --> 00:59:24,911
I'm spending time with that person.

1330
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:28,681
So I think I'll try to have a fun time.

1331
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:31,221
- Next is Su Jin.
- Me.

1332
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:34,051
(For her date, Su Jin can choose...)

1333
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:37,561
(Geon Wu or Jeong Guen.)

1334
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:40,791
I choose Geon Wu.

1335
00:59:41,561 --> 00:59:42,661
- Okay.
- Okay.

1336
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:47,131
Geon Wu was my running partner,

1337
00:59:47,371 --> 00:59:49,771
and he seems to like music and photography.

1338
00:59:50,141 --> 00:59:51,710
So I was really curious about him.

1339
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:55,140
I thought it would be fun to try talking to him,

1340
00:59:55,141 --> 00:59:58,711
so I chose Geon Wu.

1341
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:05,220
Then I get Jeong Geun.

1342
01:00:05,221 --> 01:00:07,290
(Sin Young will go on a date with Jeong Geun.)

1343
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:09,120
There we have it.

1344
01:00:09,121 --> 01:00:12,961
(All the dates have been determined.)

1345
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:15,231
- Right.
- It's going to be fun.

1346
01:00:15,531 --> 01:00:16,531
Does it hurt?

1347
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:18,831
- Have a fun time.
- But imagine...

1348
01:00:34,151 --> 01:00:36,480
His appearance was the closest to Ji Eun's ideal type.

1349
01:00:36,481 --> 01:00:37,521
The guy from church.

1350
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:39,720
Ji Eun is fierce.

1351
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:41,020
She's fierce.

1352
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:42,991
- She's an expert.
- She's fierce.

1353
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,391
I'm worried about Sin Young's date.

1354
01:00:46,061 --> 01:00:47,590
She's going to be a counselor again.

1355
01:00:47,591 --> 01:00:48,600
(Please take care of my friend.)

1356
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:50,361
She's going to be a counselor again.

1357
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:52,830
(What is going on today?)

1358
01:00:52,831 --> 01:00:54,501
What is going on?

1359
01:00:57,701 --> 01:01:02,311
(Half-worried and half-excited, Ji Eun and Dong Ha head out.)

1360
01:01:03,511 --> 01:01:04,910
She's wearing the bracelet.

1361
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,211
She's wearing the bracelet.

1362
01:01:09,221 --> 01:01:12,791
On the second day, when we were voting,

1363
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:14,221
I grabbed your name tag.

1364
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:18,591
I grabbed yours on the 1st and 2nd days.

1365
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:21,200
On the first day, I read the letter,

1366
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:24,570
and on the second day, I saw your age and job.

1367
01:01:24,571 --> 01:01:25,671
So...

1368
01:01:26,801 --> 01:01:28,340
How can I put it?

1369
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:31,071
From your proportions and everything,

1370
01:01:31,511 --> 01:01:34,211
you looked like a model or a rookie actress.

1371
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:37,341
Oh, my.

1372
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:39,551
Right.

1373
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:41,081
I feel embarrassed.

1374
01:01:44,221 --> 01:01:46,261
Do you get told often that you have a unique laugh?

1375
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:49,221
- I...
- It's not weird.

1376
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:50,661
I...

1377
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:52,891
I laugh without any reserve, right?

1378
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:55,101
I think that's your charm.

1379
01:01:57,031 --> 01:01:58,031
(Embarrassed)

1380
01:01:58,032 --> 01:01:59,731
I haven't heard it before...

1381
01:02:00,931 --> 01:02:02,471
- A laugh like this?
- Yes.

1382
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:06,570
I laugh too heartily. How do I put it?

1383
01:02:06,571 --> 01:02:07,841
I just...

1384
01:02:09,911 --> 01:02:11,381
I'm holding back a lot.

1385
01:02:11,851 --> 01:02:13,411
I don't think you need to hide it.

1386
01:02:13,651 --> 01:02:14,681
- No.
- Why would you?

1387
01:02:15,121 --> 01:02:16,221
No, I have to.

1388
01:02:20,891 --> 01:02:23,691
I did expect that it'd be comfortable.

1389
01:02:24,561 --> 01:02:26,231
I felt a sense of stability.

1390
01:02:27,591 --> 01:02:29,231
Something like that.

1391
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:32,531
I can have a fun time.

1392
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:34,640
Let's go.

1393
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:39,741
(Ji Eun and Dong Ha headed to a grilled clam place by the sea.)

1394
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:42,081
- This is nice.
- It is.

1395
01:02:44,111 --> 01:02:45,650
- Should we order 2 to 3 servings?
- Yes.

1396
01:02:45,651 --> 01:02:49,121
Let's get 2 to 3 servings of the grilled clams.

1397
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:52,250
(Glancing over)

1398
01:02:52,251 --> 01:02:53,571
- Should we have a drink?
- What?

1399
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:55,391
Sounds good.

1400
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:58,390
- Are you okay with soju?
- Yes. We have to have soju.

1401
01:02:58,391 --> 01:02:59,391
Okay.

1402
01:02:59,392 --> 01:03:00,731
Anything else is illegal.

1403
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:02,800
- When you're having grilled clams.
- "Illegal?"

1404
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:03,860
- What?
- It has to be soju.

1405
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:05,371
(She loves it.)

1406
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,540
(During their fun chat, they get their grilled clams.)

1407
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,541
- This looks delicious.
- This looks so delicious.

1408
01:03:13,671 --> 01:03:15,080
I'll grill it up nicely.

1409
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:16,241
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1410
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:18,611
This looks amazing.

1411
01:03:19,611 --> 01:03:20,711
Seriously.

1412
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:24,051
Are you ready?

1413
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:26,820
- Yes.
- It's hot. Be careful.

1414
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:30,620
(The first one that's ready naturally goes to Ji Eun.)

1415
01:03:30,621 --> 01:03:32,261
Thank you.

1416
01:03:37,631 --> 01:03:38,771
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

1417
01:03:39,501 --> 01:03:40,801
It's delicious.

1418
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:48,680
Weren't you surprised when we had to vote on the first day?

1419
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:50,680
- We arrived late.
- Right. Exactly.

1420
01:03:50,681 --> 01:03:51,910
We barely ate some rice and meat,

1421
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,011
and they told us to vote.

1422
01:03:53,711 --> 01:03:55,351
We didn't even know everyone's names yet.

1423
01:03:56,181 --> 01:03:58,890
After we voted, they asked us to say the reason...

1424
01:03:58,891 --> 01:04:00,650
we voted for that person.

1425
01:04:00,651 --> 01:04:01,661
Oh, right.

1426
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:06,760
(Why did Dong Ha choose Ji Eun two days in a row?)

1427
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:08,061
Do you know what I said?

1428
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:11,801
I voted for Choi Ji Eun. They said, "Say the reason."

1429
01:04:12,671 --> 01:04:13,731
"Because she's pretty."

1430
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:16,341
"She's the prettiest."

1431
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:18,241
That was what I really said.

1432
01:04:19,271 --> 01:04:21,211
You're telling her that now?

1433
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:25,210
He's a player.

1434
01:04:25,211 --> 01:04:27,210
I completely give up.

1435
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,527
(The almighty Gwan Hee admitted defeat.)

1436
01:04:28,551 --> 01:04:31,321
I think he said the pretty thing...

1437
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:33,621
only to Ji Eun.

1438
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:35,261
Earlier, in the cable car...

1439
01:04:35,321 --> 01:04:37,190
In the cable car, he told Su Jin...

1440
01:04:37,191 --> 01:04:38,530
- that she was pretty.
- She is pretty.

1441
01:04:38,531 --> 01:04:40,960
Wasn't he saying the view from the cable car was pretty?

1442
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,531
- No, he said that to Su Jin.
- No.

1443
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:44,231
"Will we get to come back here?"

1444
01:04:44,901 --> 01:04:45,971
Oh, you're right!

1445
01:04:46,671 --> 01:04:48,300
He keeps leading people on.

1446
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,240
- Why does he keep doing that?
- Why is he doing that?

1447
01:04:50,241 --> 01:04:52,140
- Why is he doing that, seriously?
- He's saying it to her, and...

1448
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:54,141
I like that he's honest.

1449
01:04:54,341 --> 01:04:55,610
I like that he's honest.

1450
01:04:55,611 --> 01:04:56,851
(You're doing well, my friend!)

1451
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:58,950
- Actually, on the first day, - What?

1452
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:00,680
- I chose you too. Yes.
- Really?

1453
01:05:00,681 --> 01:05:01,751
- Because.
- Yes.

1454
01:05:02,721 --> 01:05:03,851
On the first day,

1455
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:09,160
we came in last together.

1456
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:11,591
- Right.
- I felt at ease.

1457
01:05:11,691 --> 01:05:13,630
- I felt close to you.
- I get that. Yes.

1458
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:16,201
- I felt that way. Yes.
- Right.

1459
01:05:26,011 --> 01:05:28,211
Honestly, I didn't even imagine.

1460
01:05:28,381 --> 01:05:29,941
I didn't expect...

1461
01:05:30,881 --> 01:05:33,080
that Ji Eun chose me.

1462
01:05:33,081 --> 01:05:34,751
"What? Really?"

1463
01:05:39,491 --> 01:05:40,721
So I...

1464
01:05:42,321 --> 01:05:45,230
On the 1st and 2nd days,

1465
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:47,490
and even before I got here,

1466
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:48,761
I kept thinking...

1467
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:51,091
- Our time here is short.
- Right.

1468
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:53,671
I'm not a fast kind of person.

1469
01:05:54,901 --> 01:05:57,071
Right.

1470
01:05:57,771 --> 01:06:01,310
For me to get to know someone and get into someone,

1471
01:06:01,311 --> 01:06:03,411
it takes me some time.

1472
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:07,410
But other people...

1473
01:06:07,411 --> 01:06:09,120
were faster than me.

1474
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:10,321
So I thought,

1475
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:12,551
"Am I doing too little here?"

1476
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:14,591
And this is when...

1477
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:16,461
I came to my senses.

1478
01:06:17,261 --> 01:06:18,461
Well...

1479
01:06:19,161 --> 01:06:21,260
When we all went on dates on the second day,

1480
01:06:21,261 --> 01:06:22,531
you and Jeong Geun left,

1481
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:24,870
and I left with Da Hye.

1482
01:06:24,871 --> 01:06:26,430
I thought...

1483
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,500
after you were back,

1484
01:06:27,501 --> 01:06:30,940
I would get a chance too,

1485
01:06:30,941 --> 01:06:33,410
but Jeong Geun kind of went, "I want Choi Ji Eun!"

1486
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:34,640
and refused to let you go.

1487
01:06:34,641 --> 01:06:36,711
- What do you mean?
- I kind of resented him.

1488
01:06:37,381 --> 01:06:38,511
"What should I do?"

1489
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:40,891
"If I don't do anything, it'll just end like this."

1490
01:06:42,851 --> 01:06:45,421
That's when I came to my senses.

1491
01:06:50,921 --> 01:06:52,031
But...

1492
01:06:56,001 --> 01:06:57,601
I didn't have time to...

1493
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:00,131
- Talk to me.
- Right.

1494
01:07:00,171 --> 01:07:01,400
- There wasn't time.
- Of course,

1495
01:07:01,401 --> 01:07:02,871
there was some time. It's an excuse.

1496
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:05,061
I could've gone to you and said, "Let's talk, Ji Eun."

1497
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:07,141
That's a bit hard for me.

1498
01:07:08,281 --> 01:07:09,740
Suddenly going to the women's dorm...

1499
01:07:09,741 --> 01:07:10,810
I can't do that either.

1500
01:07:10,811 --> 01:07:13,150
- "Choi Ji Eun, come here." - I could never do that.

1501
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:14,380
"Let's go on a walk."

1502
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:16,051
I could never do that.

1503
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:17,350
- It's hard for me too.
- Right.

1504
01:07:17,351 --> 01:07:18,851
(It's hard for me too.)

1505
01:07:19,591 --> 01:07:21,251
Jeong Geun seemed...

1506
01:07:23,091 --> 01:07:25,730
a bit worried about you and me...

1507
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:26,961
going out together.

1508
01:07:31,031 --> 01:07:33,031
Do you wish you could have gone on more dates?

1509
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:35,991
You were the only one who had the same date two times in a row.

1510
01:07:37,871 --> 01:07:39,551
Why does he keep talking about Jeong Geun?

1511
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:52,151
Well...

1512
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:58,191
Do you wish you could have gone on more dates?

1513
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:01,081
You were the only one who had the same date two times in a row.

1514
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:04,861
Well...

1515
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:17,141
Well...

1516
01:08:21,581 --> 01:08:23,621
It is a bit emotionally tough.

1517
01:08:25,051 --> 01:08:26,220
- "Emotionally?" - Yes.

1518
01:08:26,221 --> 01:08:27,251
Why?

1519
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:31,020
I was being so careful.

1520
01:08:31,021 --> 01:08:32,391
- Because of Jeong Geun?
- Yes.

1521
01:08:32,891 --> 01:08:34,630
- That's interesting too.
- But I...

1522
01:08:34,631 --> 01:08:35,760
- Are you a couple?
- My personality...

1523
01:08:35,761 --> 01:08:37,731
- No, my personality...
- Are you a couple?

1524
01:08:37,931 --> 01:08:39,171
- Right.
- Right.

1525
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,941
I feel so bad that I can't take off this bracelet.

1526
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:45,341
- Oh, my.
- Wait.

1527
01:08:45,441 --> 01:08:46,810
- Hold on.
- Gosh.

1528
01:08:46,811 --> 01:08:49,291
Look. She couldn't take off her bracelet because she felt bad.

1529
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:52,211
This is not good.

1530
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:55,621
I think this is why Jeong Geun was so forward.

1531
01:08:55,751 --> 01:08:58,491
Ji Eun said she liked guys who were expressive.

1532
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:00,920
- So Jeong Geun expressed himself.
- Right.

1533
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:03,090
- A lot.
- But the expression...

1534
01:09:03,091 --> 01:09:04,920
Ji Eun was talking about could be different...

1535
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:07,001
- from what Jeong Geun did.
- An appropriate amount.

1536
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:10,061
She wants things to move along at a nice pace, but...

1537
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:12,400
- Right.
- It is true...

1538
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:14,370
that Jeong Geun was moving a bit too fast,

1539
01:09:14,371 --> 01:09:15,470
but...

1540
01:09:15,471 --> 01:09:18,470
it was Ji Eun who suggested the bracelet.

1541
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:19,670
- That's true.
- Right.

1542
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:21,310
So I said so last week.

1543
01:09:21,311 --> 01:09:23,280
When the bracelet came up,

1544
01:09:23,281 --> 01:09:24,910
you all said, "Once they get the bracelet,"

1545
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,680
- "it's a done deal." but I asked...
- Right.

1546
01:09:26,681 --> 01:09:29,580
Whether a bracelet carried that much meaning.

1547
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:33,150
I think when they were in the gift shop during their date,

1548
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:35,490
Ji Eun thought it would be good to get something...

1549
01:09:35,491 --> 01:09:38,260
- for the two of them.
- Right.

1550
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,290
- If not...
- After that, Jeong Geun...

1551
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:42,300
- He put too much meaning in it.
- He put too much meaning in it.

1552
01:09:42,301 --> 01:09:44,431
That made her feel the bracelet was too much.

1553
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:49,800
I feel so bad that I can't take off this bracelet.

1554
01:09:49,801 --> 01:09:50,901
We bought it that day.

1555
01:09:51,401 --> 01:09:52,441
Really?

1556
01:09:52,871 --> 01:09:54,811
I didn't know they got matching bracelets.

1557
01:09:54,911 --> 01:09:56,811
She didn't tell me.

1558
01:09:57,481 --> 01:09:59,081
I thought,

1559
01:09:59,411 --> 01:10:00,750
"There's something between them."

1560
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:03,651
"Something happened between them."

1561
01:10:08,021 --> 01:10:10,061
I don't think it's polite...

1562
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:12,491
for me to wear this bracelet on our date.

1563
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:13,990
- To me?
- Yes.

1564
01:10:13,991 --> 01:10:15,431
I don't think it's polite,

1565
01:10:17,761 --> 01:10:20,471
but if he finds out that I went on this date without the bracelet,

1566
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:22,270
I know he'll be really upset.

1567
01:10:22,271 --> 01:10:23,471
I feel bad about that.

1568
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:26,111
It's driving me crazy.

1569
01:10:27,611 --> 01:10:28,911
- Even now?
- Yes.

1570
01:10:33,511 --> 01:10:34,780
She was very concerned.

1571
01:10:34,781 --> 01:10:36,480
She was very concerned,

1572
01:10:36,481 --> 01:10:39,991
and I thought she was struggling more than necessary.

1573
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:47,731
I don't know how you feel about Jeong Geun.

1574
01:10:50,601 --> 01:10:53,170
But in my opinion,

1575
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:54,831
I think that's unnecessary guilt.

1576
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:58,641
That's making me feel off.

1577
01:11:02,881 --> 01:11:05,351
You have to follow your heart.

1578
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:08,551
Right. I'm really bad at that.

1579
01:11:09,321 --> 01:11:10,451
In a way,

1580
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:13,790
that's the best way to express how you feel...

1581
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:16,761
without hurting him directly with your words.

1582
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:23,631
It's too hard.

1583
01:11:26,271 --> 01:11:27,801
I want to run away, seriously.

1584
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:29,071
- Really?
- Yes.

1585
01:11:33,441 --> 01:11:34,770
(Did your feelings about Jeong Geun change?)

1586
01:11:34,771 --> 01:11:36,110
My feelings are kind of...

1587
01:11:36,111 --> 01:11:39,311
(Did your feelings about Jeong Geun change?)

1588
01:11:43,121 --> 01:11:44,551
They're kind of emptying out.

1589
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:48,250
(Is your heart completely closed off now?)

1590
01:11:48,251 --> 01:11:50,561
"Closed off?" Not exactly that...

1591
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:53,061
Well...

1592
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:00,101
I don't want to hold onto him.

1593
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:04,971
(Childish Gwan is very shocked.)

1594
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:06,241
That was scary.

1595
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:10,381
But I do understand how Ji Eun feels.

1596
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:24,661
So...

1597
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:26,990
When I got two votes...

1598
01:12:26,991 --> 01:12:28,461
If I got two votes,

1599
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:31,731
that meant someone didn't get any votes.

1600
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:35,441
It's hard for me...

1601
01:12:36,371 --> 01:12:38,941
to see things like that.

1602
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:44,041
That person is here now.

1603
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:46,310
That person is here now.

1604
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:49,321
(Taking his chance)

1605
01:12:50,651 --> 01:12:52,390
It's too hard.

1606
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:53,491
(It's too hard.)

1607
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:56,691
What if I were more aggressive?

1608
01:12:56,891 --> 01:12:58,021
Like...

1609
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,060
I keep asking you to talk.

1610
01:13:01,061 --> 01:13:02,360
"I don't have any dates,"

1611
01:13:02,361 --> 01:13:03,561
"so come out."

1612
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:06,301
What would you have done if I did that?

1613
01:13:06,571 --> 01:13:07,800
I would've gone.

1614
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:08,970
If you had asked to see me, I would've gone.

1615
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:10,340
- Right?
- Yes.

1616
01:13:10,341 --> 01:13:12,187
You can't take off your bracelet. Of course, you'd come when asked.

1617
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:13,491
- Gosh.
- Of course, you'd come.

1618
01:13:15,511 --> 01:13:17,081
It was really different.

1619
01:13:17,611 --> 01:13:18,811
Jeong Geun...

1620
01:13:19,581 --> 01:13:22,120
was very forward about how he felt,

1621
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:23,621
and I'm really grateful for that,

1622
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:25,250
but it did feel...

1623
01:13:25,251 --> 01:13:27,251
a bit burdened and overwhelmed.

1624
01:13:28,761 --> 01:13:32,191
Dong Ha isn't that forward,

1625
01:13:32,361 --> 01:13:35,961
but he talked to me in a way that made me feel comfortable.

1626
01:13:36,831 --> 01:13:39,001
From that conversation, I felt...

1627
01:13:39,771 --> 01:13:41,031
a sense of stability?

1628
01:13:45,141 --> 01:13:46,470
- You took off your bracelet.
- What?

1629
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:47,641
You took off your bracelet.

1630
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:49,481
Well...

1631
01:13:50,141 --> 01:13:51,541
I thought it wasn't polite.

1632
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:54,071
- She took it off?
- Oh, my.

1633
01:13:55,151 --> 01:13:56,151
She took it off.

1634
01:13:56,152 --> 01:13:57,221
That's crazy.

1635
01:13:57,951 --> 01:13:59,020
Oh, my gosh.

1636
01:13:59,021 --> 01:14:00,721
I can't watch this.

1637
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:02,520
Some part ways, and some come together.

1638
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,691
Right.

1639
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:08,031
(From next week, we'll see you all on Mondays at 10:10pm.)

1640
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:11,101
(On the night after their dates)

1641
01:14:14,271 --> 01:14:16,311
She must've had so much fun to be sleeping already.

1642
01:14:18,141 --> 01:14:23,441
(The atmosphere has changed.)

1643
01:14:23,841 --> 01:14:27,350
(Relationships have changed.)

1644
01:14:27,351 --> 01:14:30,221
That irritated me so much.

1645
01:14:30,381 --> 01:14:31,450
Let's have a beer.

1646
01:14:31,451 --> 01:14:35,821
(A turbulent night in the Lovebud House)

1647
01:14:35,991 --> 01:14:37,961
(Why am I watching his reaction all the time?)

1648
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:40,190
Ji Eun ended up choosing me.

1649
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:41,761
It was good that we finally got to try.

1650
01:14:42,861 --> 01:14:44,021
I said my conclusion already.

1651
01:14:45,901 --> 01:14:47,071
The conclusion...

1652
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:49,271
I told you my conclusion.

1653
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:53,770
(The Lovebud House is being rocked...)

1654
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:57,440
(by the changes in emotions, relationships, )

1655
01:14:57,441 --> 01:15:00,551
(and the atmosphere.)

1656
01:15:00,781 --> 01:15:02,050
This is insane. What's up with everyone?

1657
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:03,751
Everyone is so serious.

1658
01:15:04,281 --> 01:15:07,791
(The butterfly effect of a small issue)

1659
01:15:08,121 --> 01:15:11,090
(What happened overnight at the Lovebud House?)

1660
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:12,260
(You know what?)

1661
01:15:12,261 --> 01:15:13,930
(I actually know someone really great.)

1662
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:15,830
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

1663
01:15:15,831 --> 01:15:17,931
(Just open your heart a little.)

1664
01:15:18,031 --> 01:15:20,971
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

1665
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:23,141
(Date My Friend)
