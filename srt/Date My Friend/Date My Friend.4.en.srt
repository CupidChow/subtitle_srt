1
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,131
(You know what?)

2
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:16,731
(I actually know someone really great.)

3
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,661
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

4
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,661
(Just open your heart a little.)

5
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,631
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

6
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:24,840
(Date My Friend)

7
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:25,901
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:28,471
(The moment of selection starts on the second night.)

9
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,970
(Behind the closed door, )

10
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:31,511
(there is a piece of paper.)

11
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:35,051
(Open the door and check it.)

12
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,521
- What?
- Gosh...

13
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:45,161
(Sighing)

14
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,361
(Exclaiming)

15
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:52,301
I was so wrong.

16
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,730
(What is on the paper...)

17
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:57,101
(that surprised them?)

18
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,671
I am a doctor with 13 years of experience.

19
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:02,171
(Shin Dong Ha, 37, a doctor with 13 years of experience)

20
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,410
I currently work as a member of an investment strategy team,

21
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:07,581
and am a M and A strategist with five years of experience.

22
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,820
I am a producer in the planning division...

23
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,420
of my Lovebud Kang So Ra's agency.

24
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,491
(Choi Ji Eun, 28, producer)

25
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,421
I am a retired soccer player.

26
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,860
Now, I teach soccer to youth and adults.

27
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:21,631
(Kang Su Jin, 28, soccer coach)

28
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:24,900
I don't need to hesitate today.

29
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,931
Hyun Jin.

30
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:30,001
His manners and each of his actions made my heart flutter.

31
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:32,571
I think we connected a lot.

32
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,670
(She opens the door to her heart.)

33
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:35,711
Hyun Jin.

34
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,281
(She checks Hyun Jin's information.)

35
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,811
(Oh Hyun Jin is a 39-year-old stage and musical actor.)

36
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:44,951
For me,

37
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:48,221
six years is the maximum age gap that I can consider.

38
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:51,521
Gosh, 11 years won't be easy.

39
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:57,861
(Will they be able to overcome the age gap and get closer?)

40
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,141
My mind is heavy tonight.

41
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:11,041
How was the interview for you, Da Hye?

42
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,780
Was it shocking or not?

43
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:14,281
- It was shocking.
- What?

44
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:16,181
- Was it wrong?
- Me too.

45
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,151
What was it?

46
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,990
- But we opened this up.
- We did.

47
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:23,351
If it were today's date or another person.

48
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:24,560
Today's date.

49
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,090
- Yes.
- It's the same for all.

50
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,330
Why do you think I was shocked?

51
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,431
You were completely off?

52
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,900
I want to crawl into a hole.

53
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,060
When we were talking about that...

54
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:34,771
Then what should I do?

55
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:35,871
Do I stay still?

56
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,471
I really got into the details.

57
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,841
You were practically Detective Conan.

58
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:45,280
He must have thought you were really cute.

59
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:46,310
Right.

60
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:49,010
Thinking, "Let's see how well you can guess."

61
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,410
I know. This is so...

62
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:52,921
Then the question we asked earlier was,

63
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:55,620
other than your date today...

64
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,891
- If I'm curious about anyone else?
- Yes.

65
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:58,990
- I was very satisfied...
- I am.

66
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:00,560
With my date today.

67
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:02,231
It was different from yesterday.

68
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,961
Anyway, so I don't know what to do.

69
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,871
I'm the type that goes for it.

70
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:10,501
- Me too.
- That's why...

71
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,301
it's the same person for me.

72
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,441
(Did Sin Young really choose her date, Geon Wu?)

73
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:21,651
(Sin Young went on a yacht date with Geon Wu.)

74
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:28,851
(Sin Young picks Geon Wu.)

75
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,041
"Kim Geon Wu is..."

76
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:50,371
"a 29-year-old online fashion magazine project manager."

77
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:59,551
I am working as a PM, a project manager,

78
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:03,251
for an online fashion magazine.

79
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,731
I connect with different brands...

80
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,861
to identify the clients' requirements,

81
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,571
and plan and execute events.

82
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:27,381
(Kim Geon Wu, 29, online fashion magazine PM)

83
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:34,991
(Geon Wu is next for the Heart Room.)

84
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:38,991
"The person who knocked on the door of your heart."

85
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:49,731
(Geon Wu's choice is Da Hye.)

86
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,501
When we first met,

87
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:55,310
I was interested in Da Hye,

88
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:59,910
so I took the name tag with the same feelings from yesterday.

89
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:01,981
I didn't have to think much.

90
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,691
"Lee Da Hye is..."

91
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:14,091
"a 30-year-old model."

92
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:21,831
I'm a model with five years of experience.

93
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:30,271
I made my debut in 2021 through a video commercial...

94
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:33,811
and have appeared in various TV commercials for different brands.

95
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,550
Lately, I’ve also been modeling for print and digital content...

96
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:45,361
with domestic and international premium beauty brands.

97
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:50,631
(Lee Da Hye, 30, model with 5 years of experience)

98
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,241
It was really unexpected.

99
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:05,010
I thought she was probably about that age.

100
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:07,181
But with her clean short hairstyle,

101
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:08,650
fair skin,

102
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,950
and the aura of someone well-brought-up...

103
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:14,380
made me assume that she was in the medical line of work,

104
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:16,590
such as a physical therapist,

105
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:21,191
But it never crossed my mind that she would work in modeling.

106
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,801
So I wanted to talk with her.

107
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:26,560
I am very curious.

108
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:29,271
(Geon Wu became even more curious about Da Hye.)

109
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:33,300
Last week, when we heard the occupation and age...

110
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:34,810
of Gwan Hee's friend, we were shocked.

111
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,910
- Yes.
- Yes.

112
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,370
And also the occupation and age...

113
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:38,840
- Occupation and age.
- of the other friends.

114
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,511
Was there anyone who really surprised you?

115
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,911
For me, Su Jin.

116
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:43,750
- Yes.
- Su Jin is...

117
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,450
- so bright...
- Right.

118
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:48,020
And doesn't seem like she can teach or scold others,

119
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,120
- but she was a soccer coach.
- Yes.

120
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,760
- I didn't even imagine it.
- Yes.

121
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:54,120
- Because even with Dong Ha, - Right.

122
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:56,490
We all guessed other jobs,

123
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:58,360
but they were all outside of our predictions.

124
00:06:58,361 --> 00:06:59,361
- Yes.
- Yes.

125
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:01,270
I'm also curious,

126
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:05,541
because my friend, Dong Ha, outright declared it at night...

127
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:07,810
that he's interested in Su Jin and Ji Eun.

128
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:11,210
- I think it will start today.
- Today will be the true start.

129
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,640
- Until now, it was just a preview.
- For today,

130
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,440
will Dong Ha see any big results?

131
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,580
- I know.
- Yes. I'm curious.

132
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,880
I think Jeong Geun could get hurt...

133
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:23,250
from Dong Ha's straightforward actions.

134
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:25,190
I came somewhat mentally prepared.

135
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,290
Dong Ha will go straight to it.

136
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,091
You reap what you sow.

137
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:33,301
So I don't think it will be easy today.

138
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:36,071
(Mi Joo's friend, Lee Da Hye)

139
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,001
(Gwan Hee's friend, Ha Jeong Geun)

140
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,401
(Ye Eun's friend, Kim Sin Young)

141
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:42,941
(Sae Ho's friend, Kim Geon Wu)

142
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,581
(Young Kwang's friend, Kang Su Jin)

143
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:48,381
(Nam Hee's friend, Oh Hyun Jin)

144
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,911
(So Ra's friend, Choi Ji Eun)

145
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:53,481
(Young Ji's friend, Shin Dong Ha)

146
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,931
(Episode 4. Timing)

147
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:09,200
(They wake up, holding the secret of their love interest.)

148
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,001
I didn't go this way yesterday.

149
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,971
Let's go here.

150
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:15,040
It's Jeong Geun. I knew it.

151
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,640
- Gosh, they met up separately.
- Around the dullegil.

152
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:19,211
(Ji Eun and Jeong Geun go for a walk, like promised.)

153
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,711
"Older?"

154
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:27,251
I’m suddenly feeling a bit upset.

155
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:28,591
"Older?"

156
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,790
(During Ji Eun and Jeong Geun's first date)

157
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,661
I guess you could be older than I am.

158
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,231
You could be right.

159
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:40,161
Are you older than me?

160
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,131
You never know.

161
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:45,001
- "You never know?" - You never know.

162
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,201
Don't regret it.

163
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,471
Whatever.

164
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,140
(Last night)

165
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,640
(Ji Eun opened Jeong Geun's door and checked his information.)

166
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:54,750
- Wait.
- They are four years apart.

167
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:55,780
He is older than her.

168
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:57,211
(Jeong Geun is 4 years older than Ji Eun.)

169
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,450
(Jeong Geun also opened Ji Eun's door...)

170
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:02,391
(and checked her information.)

171
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,720
- They now know each other's age...
- Yes.

172
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:04,890
- and occupation.
- Yes.

173
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:05,921
(Ji Eun and Jeong Geun know each other's age and occupation.)

174
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:07,491
Did you check it?

175
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:11,531
It seems like you checked it.

176
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,600
But it was really similar to what I had guessed.

177
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,601
Was it similar? What did you guess?

178
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,400
I mentioned the studio,

179
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,970
- and photo shoots.
- The photo shoots.

180
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,811
No, it's quite different from that.

181
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,111
- Let's sit here.
- I'm out of breath.

182
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:34,691
Catch your breath.

183
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,121
Catch your breath before speaking.

184
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:43,561
What was written as my occupation?

185
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,430
M and A...

186
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:47,301
(M and A strategist)

187
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:48,770
Somehow...

188
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:50,630
(They reveal their picks without hesitation.)

189
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,940
It wasn't that surprising.

190
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:52,970
- Really?
- Yes.

191
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:55,010
"Okay."

192
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,140
"That sounds possible."

193
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:57,271
- Really?
- Yes.

194
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,411
I guess you were curious, then?

195
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:01,910
Yes, well...

196
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:03,181
As soon as you see it,

197
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:04,980
you can see the age first.

198
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,151
It's on top.

199
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:09,290
"Older?"

200
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,161
(Jeong Geun had said that Ji Eun was older.)

201
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,591
- And I arrived late, right?
- Yes.

202
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,561
I joined later,

203
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:23,800
and I couldn't see any opportunity in my perspective.

204
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:26,141
During that short time.

205
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:28,210
I couldn't see any opportunity...

206
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,671
and you didn't seem to have the room either.

207
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,241
- I didn't have any room.
- Yes.

208
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,281
That's why I kept trying to carve out a chance.

209
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:40,821
Keep going, Jeong Geun.

210
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:42,321
Keep going.

211
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:46,921
The first day was very hard.

212
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:50,391
It was clear that...

213
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,531
you felt more relaxed...

214
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,971
with people who made you...

215
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:59,571
more comfortable,

216
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,171
and seeing that,

217
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:04,511
I didn't want to...

218
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:08,151
make you feel uncomfortable.

219
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,680
No matter what I did.

220
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:11,581
I wanted you to feel comfortable in every way.

221
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:15,051
I did feel comfortable. I was actually thankful.

222
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:17,051
- When we were talking, - Yes.

223
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,461
The way you asked questions...

224
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:25,601
You asked a lot of questions that I could comfortably answer.

225
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,860
That's right.

226
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,571
(Ji Eun was thankful that he made the conversation easy.)

227
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:34,140
Yesterday, I felt awkward about taking pictures...

228
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,010
next to someone.

229
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:39,210
I felt very awkward...

230
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,381
- having my pictures taken as well.
- Yes.

231
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:46,251
But those moments came to me...

232
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,590
- Stop it.
- as a really...

233
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:49,920
In 1, 2, 3.

234
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:51,420
Strong impression at night...

235
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,890
when I sat back and thought about...

236
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:55,430
- what I did during the day.
- Was it?

237
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,761
- When we took the pictures?
- Just...

238
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:58,631
When we took pictures and things.

239
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:00,631
So...

240
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:03,830
How did it leave such a strong impression?

241
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,271
You asked Geon Wu to take your picture first.

242
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,171
Is that still so...

243
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:12,241
You asked Geon Wu to take your picture.

244
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,081
You're a baby.

245
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,321
What do you mean, "baby?" I'm quite old.

246
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:21,321
You are, but you're still a baby compared to me.

247
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,421
Not exactly a baby.

248
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:25,621
Baby is...

249
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,561
- "You're a baby." - Wait a minute.

250
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:32,230
- What is it?
- I think it explains it all.

251
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:33,301
- With "baby?" - Yes.

252
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:35,101
What?

253
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:38,401
But isn't that something you can say only when you're dating?

254
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,470
- He just said, "You're a baby." - "You're a baby."

255
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:41,611
- "You're a baby." - Yes.

256
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,210
That's not too much.

257
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,281
For example, it's like this.

258
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:47,440
If we were eating with you,

259
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:50,311
- and you only ate sausages...
- Yes.

260
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:52,180
- or foods that are easy to eat, - Yes.

261
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,520
We'd say, "Ye Eun is a baby."

262
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:55,521
- That's what it's like, right?
- Sure.

263
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:56,591
What was that?

264
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:59,190
Or do you not like that?

265
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:03,090
For example, if you gave Gwan Hee water,

266
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:04,490
and he said, "Thank you, Ye Eun,"

267
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:05,730
and gave you a pat on the head.

268
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,801
- That will make your heart flutter.
- When you're not dating?

269
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:08,930
When he does that when you're not dating?

270
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:10,700
When you're starting to flirt with each other.

271
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:11,771
Then that's being fox-like.

272
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,341
It's being fox-like if you do that when you're not official.

273
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:15,970
Oh, really?

274
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,171
- I see.
- I'd like that.

275
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:20,311
- So Ra said it's okay.
- Yes.

276
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,380
Yes.

277
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:22,580
When you're not officially going out?

278
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,250
Getting a pat on the head is not bad for me.

279
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:26,350
- When you're not going out?
- Yes.

280
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,120
Is it not okay even if you're at the flirty stage?

281
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,150
Isn't that okay?

282
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,490
It's when you both know that you're interested.

283
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,960
But you need to make it official before you touch.

284
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:34,990
- All kinds of touching?
- Yes.

285
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:36,090
All kinds of touching...

286
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:37,560
needs to start after you make it official.

287
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,531
- You’re such a traditional girl.
- Completely.

288
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:40,960
- Really?
- Completely.

289
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,230
What kind of touching can you do before you make it official?

290
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:44,831
- Nothing.
- Not at all?

291
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,400
For anyone who’s going to start flirting with Ye Eun,

292
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:49,810
- don't touch her.
- Watch out.

293
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,980
You're very conservative, aren't you?

294
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,980
But it depends on...

295
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:55,580
- personal preference.
- Yes, it is.

296
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,581
Yes.

297
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,481
But those two are practically already a couple.

298
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:02,990
From what I've sensed...

299
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:07,361
from the conversations going on between the guys,

300
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:11,030
the guys will continue on...

301
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:13,761
with their bold moves until the end.

302
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,471
- So I really...
- Really?

303
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:18,671
It's...

304
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,901
This place...

305
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:22,971
might turn into a jungle.

306
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:26,611
- Really?
- That's what I think.

307
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:29,081
But,

308
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:31,080
I won't worry.

309
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,880
(I won't worry.)

310
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:34,951
Whatever.

311
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:38,090
- But...
- Should we go up?

312
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:39,691
I think I'll get eaten up by mosquitoes.

313
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:42,731
Let's go back up and get ready.

314
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,261
It doesn't matter if you change your mind.

315
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:51,641
Just don't have too much fun.

316
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:56,071
I hope you're not as comfortable as you were yesterday.

317
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:01,180
But listen.

318
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:03,211
Ji Eun changed the subject here.

319
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:04,950
Listen.

320
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:08,080
Jeong Geun said, "My mind won't change,"

321
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,290
- but Ji Eun didn't say...
- "Don't worry."

322
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,350
- She didn't say that.
- No.

323
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:12,720
- She didn't answer, but avoided it.
- Yes.

324
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:14,390
- This is the third day, right?
- Yes.

325
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:18,430
He should have stopped that on the second day,

326
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,300
but he kept going until the third day,

327
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,100
and I think it could have been...

328
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:24,800
- a bit burdensome for Ji Eun.
- Right.

329
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:28,270
Because Ji Eun didn't get to know the others yet.

330
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:30,270
- I really didn't notice that...
- Right.

331
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:31,540
- she had avoided the question.
- Yes.

332
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,541
Because if you're really into them,

333
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,640
it won't matter if you get eaten by mosquitoes.

334
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,051
You would want to stay longer to talk.

335
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:40,181
The hydrangea is so pretty. They must be in season.

336
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,151
Let's go down here.

337
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,290
It's the Eiffel Tower couple.

338
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,990
(It's the Eiffel Tower couple.)

339
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:49,030
- What should we do today?
- I know.

340
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,291
(Are they going on a run together?)

341
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:52,600
But yesterday,

342
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,801
since I know one person's occupation and age...

343
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:55,931
Yes.

344
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,271
It's so...

345
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:00,401
Why?

346
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,840
- Can I ask who it is?
- What?

347
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:05,011
We can ask who it is, right?

348
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:06,681
- The one I chose?
- Yes.

349
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:09,051
It's not that...

350
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:11,851
I'm curious about others' age and occupation.

351
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:13,681
I'm curious to know who you chose.

352
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,621
This is very clear.

353
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:18,390
I chose my date.

354
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:19,691
- Your date?
- Yes.

355
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:22,091
So...

356
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:23,430
I came on a run with you to ask that.

357
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:25,861
Really? That's touching.

358
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:29,901
The second day is over,

359
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:33,271
so I thought it could all end...

360
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,211
without me doing a thing.

361
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:37,770
(Dong Ha and Hyun Jin's conversation last night)

362
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:40,280
Sure. Because...

363
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:42,881
I'm interested in Su Jin and Ji Eun,

364
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:46,181
but I went on a date with another person.

365
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:47,781
Yes.

366
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,491
That's why I asked her to go on a run tomorrow morning.

367
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,621
So I can talk with Su Jin.

368
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,330
Su Jin is going on a run.

369
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,460
I like running,

370
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,400
but I do it at night, not in the morning.

371
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,230
I do it at night when the weather is nice.

372
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:03,531
- It's better when it's breezy.
- It's sunny in the morning.

373
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,841
(This morning)

374
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:10,611
(Dong Ha waited for Su Jin to come out.)

375
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:15,911
- Hello.
- Oh, gosh.

376
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:17,681
You scared me.

377
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:18,951
That really scared me.

378
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,321
What is it?

379
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:23,490
Don't you think they will let us choose now?

380
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:24,721
- The date partner?
- Yes.

381
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:28,991
Do you have anyone in mind who's different from yesterday?

382
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,431
- "Different from yesterday?" - Yes.

383
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:31,961
- If I get the chance...
- Yes.

384
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,631
- to choose myself today, - Yes.

385
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:35,231
Then you.

386
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,801
- Me too.
- Really?

387
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:40,270
- That openly?
- They're so cool.

388
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:41,941
This is so heart-fluttering.

389
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:43,271
My heart just stopped.

390
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:45,981
Okay. It's confirmed.

391
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:47,881
Okay.

392
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,351
Then let's say we go on a date. Where do you want to go?

393
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:52,421
Did you have a place in mind?

394
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,481
Where should we go?

395
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:56,251
For me, I prefer...

396
00:17:58,091 --> 00:17:59,191
a cable car.

397
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,420
- Since we're here...
- That's good.

398
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:02,631
I love it.

399
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:06,160
They even finished talking about going on a date.

400
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:07,330
(Dong Ha expressed his true feelings to Su Jin.)

401
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:10,000
"I came out to run with you."

402
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,840
He told me everything.

403
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,900
"If I had the choice,"

404
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:14,500
"I really want to go on a date with you."

405
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:16,211
"I was curious about you."

406
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,711
I was like, "Really?"

407
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:23,381
I was grateful that he mustered up his courage to tell me.

408
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:28,221
I was glad that he expressed his feelings for me.

409
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:30,521
I really enjoyed our morning run.

410
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,091
We're done.

411
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,491
- Should we... Yes.
- Let's rest for a bit.

412
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:39,001
- It's so... Exactly.
- I want to go in the water.

413
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:40,460
- Would you like to?
- What?

414
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,030
(They headed to the beach without a camera.)

415
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,501
- Without a camera?
- What?

416
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:50,110
We'll get our clothes wet.

417
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:51,641
We're drenched in sweat anyway. Come here.

418
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,081
We're drenched in sweat anyway.

419
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,250
(The two of them swam in the sea without any interruption.)

420
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,281
It's so cool.

421
00:18:58,311 --> 00:18:59,720
This will be a memorable experience.

422
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,951
(The two of them swam in the sea without any interruption.)

423
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,221
When I suggested we go into the sea...

424
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,090
As a woman,

425
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:10,261
she might not have been keen due to several reasons.

426
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,430
She'd put her sunscreen on,

427
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,001
and she couldn't get her hair wet. But...

428
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:18,501
she gladly said, "Sure, let's go in."

429
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:22,271
She joined me, which made my heart flutter.

430
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:27,141
- Dong Ha is very assertive.
- Yes.

431
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,550
He's heading straight for her and making it obvious.

432
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:33,480
- He's very assertive.
- He sure acts differently.

433
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:36,650
He's never shown that side of himself to me.

434
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:37,690
- That's cool.
- Yes.

435
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,460
He's turned over a new leaf overnight.

436
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:40,490
- Exactly.
- Yes.

437
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:42,830
My friend had said that he was interested in...

438
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,790
Ji Eun and Su Jin.

439
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,300
He knew Su Jin went for a run in the morning,

440
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:49,370
- Yes, he joined her on purpose.
- and he decided to get to know...

441
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:50,371
Su Jin first.

442
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:52,500
And he put it into action immediately.

443
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:56,671
I think Dong Ha had perfect timing.

444
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:59,981
Su Jin had feelings for Hyun Jin.

445
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:01,280
But yesterday night,

446
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:02,410
After she found out about his age and occupation.

447
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,081
- she saw the revealed information.
- Yes.

448
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:06,620
- She was a bit shocked.
- That's right.

449
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:08,990
She was very perplexed...

450
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,891
- about it herself.
- She was distraught.

451
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,561
With Dong Ha's sudden appearance,

452
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,090
she'll think, "How would it be like to date him?"

453
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,031
Now she has something else to look forward to.

454
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,800
- Yes.
- Now that he's set his mind to it,

455
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,331
Dong Ha flirts differently, doesn't he?

456
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:22,770
He's not curious about her age or job.

457
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,270
"I'm curious about who you chose." That's what he said.

458
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,500
- My heart skipped a beat at that.
- That...

459
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:27,900
"Who would you choose if you could choose a date?"

460
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:28,911
- "I'll choose you." - "I'll choose you."

461
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:30,411
"You."

462
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:32,710
I'm looking forward to how things will unfold.

463
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:33,780
Jeong Geun said...

464
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:36,080
- that it would turn into a jungle.
- Yes.

465
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:38,050
- I wonder what will happen next.
- It's fascinating.

466
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:39,451
- Shall we continue watching?
- Yes.

467
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:42,920
- Good job.
- Good job.

468
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:44,721
(The busy morning flirting is over.)

469
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,921
- Have a good rest. See you later.
- You too.

470
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,221
- See you later.
- Bye.

471
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:51,261
What?

472
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:54,061
- Why?
- Seriously...

473
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:55,800
(What did Dong Ha and Su Jin see?)

474
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:56,801
What is it?

475
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,641
- It just says you can use it today.
- You can use it.

476
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:01,900
(The infinity pool is available between 9am and 12pm today.)

477
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:04,470
- "The infinity pool?" - Swimming!

478
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,081
They're going to swim.

479
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,110
Jeong Geun, show them.

480
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,410
Show them.

481
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:15,321
(The infinity pool, soon to turn into a jungle, is now open!)

482
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:22,131
(What kind of charms will they show off in the pool?)

483
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,861
Is it a bit short?

484
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:30,271
No, it looks fine.

485
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:32,940
Your lower body is so fit.

486
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:35,611
- I have strong legs.
- They're no joke.

487
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:43,911
(Jeong Geun, who is proud of his upper body, walks in leisurely.)

488
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:48,321
(An investment strategist's strategy to show off in the pool)

489
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:49,620
(Pumping up his muscles)

490
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:51,851
He's doing push-ups now.

491
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:54,761
He wants to pump up his muscles.

492
00:21:56,391 --> 00:22:00,701
(This time, he focuses on his arms.)

493
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:11,041
Look at those veins.

494
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:22,420
Isn't 6kg too easy for you?

495
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:23,920
- Sorry?
- Isn't 6kg too easy for you?

496
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:25,721
- No more than 6kg.
- Isn't it too light?

497
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,061
This is the most I can do.

498
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,260
Do men get sensitive at times like that?

499
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,591
Of course.

500
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:34,331
Dong Ha isn't even thinking of holding one.

501
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,071
He's already lost.

502
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,170
(What about the women's dorm?)

503
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,341
- Stay calm.
- Stay calm.

504
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:42,711
Choi Ji Eun, stay calm.

505
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,540
- Did she wear that?
- But this is too...

506
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,410
- What is it?
- I picked her swimsuit for her.

507
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:50,811
- I find it too cringey.
- I'm checking if she wore it.

508
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:52,521
It's not cringey at all.

509
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:56,091
- I should wear this on top.
- Yes, wear it on top.

510
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,251
That's it.

511
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,591
- Like this.
- Yes.

512
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:02,690
- It's good.
- Or...

513
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:03,730
(She's serious about styling her swimwear.)

514
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:04,830
No.

515
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:05,961
- Go with that.
- Like this.

516
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:08,131
Yes. If you're going to wear that, go with that one.

517
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:12,470
(She's so pretty!)

518
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:13,970
What a hot girl!

519
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:15,671
- It's "Too Hot to Handle." - She looks stunning.

520
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,011
Hot girl.

521
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:19,040
(Amazed)

522
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,441
- You look so cool.
- Look.

523
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,350
I did want to go to a swimming pool.

524
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:26,351
It'll be fun.

525
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:29,390
It gives off "Single's Inferno" vibe.

526
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:30,950
I told her to bring a swimsuit that would suit "Single's Inferno."

527
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,991
(It suddenly became "Single's Inferno.")

528
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:35,091
- Look at the weather.
- It's insane.

529
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:37,060
It's so nice.

530
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,961
(They walk confidently toward the swimming pool.)

531
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:43,931
- I can hear the water.
- It's so nice.

532
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:47,940
You can't resist going in.

533
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:49,171
As soon as I come up...

534
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:51,771
The water looks cold, doesn't it?

535
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,781
- Shall we go in?
- Should we go in first?

536
00:23:57,611 --> 00:23:59,281
Shouldn't we warm up first?

537
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,521
Or you might have a heart attack.

538
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:07,291
- Not bad, isn't he?
- My gosh.

539
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,931
He's in great shape.

540
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:11,960
- Hold on.
- He's in great shape.

541
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:14,000
Rather than revealing strategically...

542
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,201
Goodness. What?

543
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:18,331
- That was so unexpected.
- You should know when to undress.

544
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:20,701
The water looks pretty deep.

545
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,771
- No?
- It's okay.

546
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:31,350
- My gosh.
- As expected.

547
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:33,220
Hyun Jin doesn't lose to him.

548
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,781
- He doesn't.
- Right?

549
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:41,420
(His upper body muscles are pumped up.)

550
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:42,831
It's not that cold.

551
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:47,261
Are you going in already?

552
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:01,641
(Staring)

553
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,411
My body isn't ready.

554
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:07,020
(Squeezing out)

555
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:08,720
Sunscreen. He's cute.

556
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,650
He's a dermatologist, you see.

557
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:11,790
He's a dermatologist.

558
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,791
- A dermatologist sure is different.
- He needs to have perfect skin.

559
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:16,590
(Blocking the UV comes before pumping up muscles.)

560
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:18,591
Well...

561
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:20,700
It wasn't easy for me.

562
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:21,831
So...

563
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:24,701
You guys are amazing.

564
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:29,910
- The best-looking one.
- An idol singer.

565
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,110
- The center member.
- An idol singer.

566
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:32,510
(Chatting)

567
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:33,581
You're the idol.

568
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:35,910
- Wasn't it embarrassing?
- It was.

569
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,480
- Right?
- Look at Sin Young.

570
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,120
- She's cool.
- So cool.

571
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,581
- Look at Su Jin.
- You look cool, Sin Young.

572
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:45,220
- They all look so good.
- They really keep themselves fit.

573
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:46,361
(The ladies arrive at the pool in their unique swimsuits!)

574
00:25:47,061 --> 00:25:48,521
- My gosh.
- What is it?

575
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,461
They're shirtless.

576
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:52,761
Of course. It's a swimming pool.

577
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:56,630
I told her not to bring that windbreaker.

578
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:57,671
Really?

579
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:00,140
They're already in the pool.

580
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,300
(Everyone has gathered at the pool.)

581
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:02,741
- Are they already in?
- Be careful.

582
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,181
(Suddenly lying down)

583
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:09,511
- Who is that?
- Who's that?

584
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:10,781
Is that you, Hyun Jin? Hyun...

585
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:14,251
It's dangerous. You might fall.

586
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:16,620
It's tilted to this side.

587
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:17,820
Exactly. Be careful.

588
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:20,561
You're not there to have fun yourself, Hyun Jin.

589
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:23,160
Did you go all the way there to play in the pool?

590
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:24,431
(He is frustrated by his friend acting like a seal.)

591
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:29,571
By the way...

592
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:33,701
(Geon Wu, who is proud of his legs, takes off his shirt too.)

593
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:38,240
(She watches it happen right in front of her eyes.)

594
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:40,541
(Oh, my gosh.)

595
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:46,850
Look at his body.

596
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:50,221
(Geon Wu joins the muscular men.)

597
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:52,591
What's up with them all?

598
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:54,791
I didn't expect this.

599
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:58,231
Hyun Jin caught my eye.

600
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,701
I could tell that he worked out a lot.

601
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:04,300
They all seem to exercise a lot.

602
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:05,771
I'm sure they were waiting to show off.

603
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:10,810
(These muscular guys have been waiting to swim.)

604
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:13,010
Hold on. What's this?

605
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:15,341
(Her eyes are fixed on them.)

606
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:17,550
Jeong Geun always wore revealing clothes,

607
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:19,251
- so I knew about him.
- What are you talking about?

608
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:21,751
- He only showed his arms.
- I mean...

609
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:23,150
- It's so...
- You could expect that much...

610
00:27:23,151 --> 00:27:24,290
- from Jeong Geun, but Hyun Jin...
- Exactly.

611
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,790
- was totally unexpected.
- Hyun Jin.

612
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,061
He had himself fully covered.

613
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:30,490
- His muscles are...
- Seriously.

614
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:31,960
- very angry.
- What a man.

615
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:33,130
- What a man he is.
- It's so...

616
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,500
He loves to exercise.

617
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,200
He's done crossfit and kickboxing for a long time.

618
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:37,770
- Really?
- That's impressive.

619
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:38,831
Yes, so...

620
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:41,000
I told him, "Don't show off..."

621
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:43,410
- "your muscles intentionally." - Intentionally.

622
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,010
He really didn't do it purposely.

623
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,111
It was natural.

624
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,511
I'll take it off later.

625
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:50,011
Are you going in with that on?

626
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:52,551
For now...

627
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:54,980
I'll take it off for now.

628
00:27:54,981 --> 00:27:56,591
I'll run in quickly.

629
00:27:58,251 --> 00:27:59,291
I...

630
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,820
This isn't it.

631
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:04,631
Sin Young stood out to me.

632
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,760
Her skin was tanned a healthy shade,

633
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,801
and she was overflowing with confidence.

634
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:12,771
Sin Young had a very firm body,

635
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:16,071
and I think she stood out the most to everyone.

636
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:18,970
The water isn't that cold.

637
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:22,811
(Sin Young's charms shine even more at the swimming pool.)

638
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:25,651
(Ji Eun enters the water slowly.)

639
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:28,320
Why is she wearing that top?

640
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:29,491
(She is upset about her friend's fashion.)

641
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,921
(Lastly, Su Jin gets ready to enter the water.)

642
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:37,590
(Su Jin chose a striking red swimsuit.)

643
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,961
She definitely works out a lot.

644
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:41,200
Look at her abs.

645
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:42,571
(Su Jin chose a striking red swimsuit.)

646
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:50,941
I saw Su Jin and could tell she kept herself fit.

647
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:53,041
It was a different side of her.

648
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:59,121
Su Jin. She wore a striking red swimsuit.

649
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:00,251
She looked cool.

650
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:04,720
- No, this...
- Here.

651
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:08,520
(This is a heart-pounding moment. They start playing in the water.)

652
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,861
It's war.

653
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:12,331
Let's play a game.

654
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:15,361
- Let's start here.
- The winners get to make a wish.

655
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:16,530
Sure.

656
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:17,671
- I like that.
- What did you say?

657
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:20,601
How are you going to split up?

658
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,300
Ladies, decide on a number each from 1 to 4.

659
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,410
We men will decide too.

660
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:24,571
- Play rock, paper, scissors.
- Yes.

661
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:25,741
Okay.

662
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:26,910
Two-on-two games?

663
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:28,780
Who you get paired up with is important too.

664
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:29,951
Don't let us hear you.

665
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:31,910
Rock, paper, scissors.

666
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:33,680
(Who will they partner with?)

667
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:34,780
Rock, paper, scissors.

668
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,421
(Who will they partner with?)

669
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:38,990
- Number 1, get going.
- Number 1, go.

670
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:41,220
Go, Number One.

671
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:42,731
(Who will become Sin Young's partner?)

672
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:44,630
Who is Number One?

673
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:47,461
(Male Number 1 quietly appears.)

674
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,631
(Couple Number 1, Sin Young and Dong Ha)

675
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:53,001
I wanted to become Dong Ha's partner.

676
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:55,501
It was a pity when I didn't.

677
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,270
(Who is Number 2 Su Jin's partner?)

678
00:29:58,271 --> 00:29:59,941
Here comes Number Two.

679
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,751
(Submerging)

680
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:04,711
It's Hyun Jin.

681
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:06,720
Is it Hyun Jin?

682
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,351
(Couple Number 2, Su Jin and Hyun Jin)

683
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,720
(They were paired up both yesterday and today.)

684
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:12,820
"What is this?"

685
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:14,060
(Yesterday's Lovebud Matching Dates)

686
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:18,760
"Is this luck or fate or something like that at work?"

687
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:20,761
(Is it luck or fate or something like that at work?)

688
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:25,301
(The remaining men are Jeong Geun and Geon Wu.)

689
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:27,471
We played a game in pairs.

690
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:30,211
Honestly, in that situation, I feel most at ease with Jeong Geun.

691
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:31,640
Let's go.

692
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:32,910
- Number 3, go.
- Number 3, go.

693
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:34,140
Number Three.

694
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:36,281
(Who will become Number 3 Da Hye's partner?)

695
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:39,881
Are you Number Three?

696
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:41,250
It's Jeong Geun.

697
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:42,790
- Jeong Geun.
- Jeong Geun and Da Hye.

698
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,920
Are we a pair?

699
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:45,221
Yes, this works.

700
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:46,790
Number Four.

701
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:51,331
(Couple Number 4, Ji Eun and Geon Wu)

702
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:58,230
Let's see...

703
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,670
- who runs faster.
- Okay.

704
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:00,700
(Warm-up game, the couple running)

705
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:02,670
Whether you carry one on the back or in your arms...

706
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:04,141
- Okay.
- Okay.

707
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:05,981
A piggyback, of course.

708
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,180
(The standard piggyback, Sin Young and Dong Ha)

709
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:09,281
I'll do that too.

710
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,380
(Submerging)

711
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:13,851
(A submerged piggyback, Su Jin and Hyun Jin)

712
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,320
Should we get ready?

713
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:17,291
(A light piggyback, Ji Eun and Geon Wu)

714
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,160
(Glancing)

715
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,220
- So I should sit down?
- Yes.

716
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:22,760
Go up there.

717
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:23,990
It's hot.

718
00:31:23,991 --> 00:31:25,691
What stunt are you going to show us?

719
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:32,400
- Is this easier for you?
- Yes.

720
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:34,170
- I can hold onto you.
- It's okay.

721
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:35,370
No.

722
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:36,810
- I'm scared.
- Hurry up.

723
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,370
"What if I'm too heavy for him?"

724
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:40,041
I was a bit worried.

725
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:43,981
- No. I'm scared.
- Hurry up.

726
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:47,050
- She doesn't look happy.
- She doesn't look happy.

727
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:48,151
She doesn't look happy.

728
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:49,850
Is carrying her on his shoulder...

729
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:51,921
- a big problem? Why?
- Yes.

730
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,261
It's an uncomfortable posture.

731
00:31:54,661 --> 00:31:57,531
If he wins despite that, it's fine.

732
00:31:57,661 --> 00:31:59,330
- No.
- He could never win.

733
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:00,360
That's not important.

734
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:01,561
- He could never win.
- That's not important.

735
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:04,771
I think he'll win. Let's watch.

736
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:06,540
Hurry up.

737
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:07,840
- Hurry up.
- Get ready.

738
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:09,201
- Hold me tight.
- Let's go.

739
00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:11,840
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

740
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:13,880
(For the warm-up game, the couple running starts.)

741
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:14,941
We can win!

742
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:17,380
- That's so much better.
- Push.

743
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:18,381
That's crazy.

744
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:20,080
- That's so much better.
- Push.

745
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:21,220
He's in the lead.

746
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:22,850
- I told you that he'd win!
- He's winning.

747
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:24,650
I told you that he'd win!

748
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,891
You're right. He's winning.

749
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,461
Wait.

750
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,730
(They win!)

751
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:30,860
Be careful.

752
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:32,191
How did you do that?

753
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:34,700
Good job.

754
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:36,071
(In 3rd place are Ji Eun and Geon Wu.)

755
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,501
(Submerging)

756
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:42,870
- I'm sorry. It's so slippery.
- It's okay.

757
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:44,940
(In 4th place are Su Jin and Hyun Jin)

758
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:46,410
The loser... I was the slowest.

759
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:47,510
You guys lost.

760
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:48,581
We lost.

761
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:50,351
I slipped there.

762
00:32:50,711 --> 00:32:52,150
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

763
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:53,721
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

764
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:58,351
It was so slippery that he almost tripped three times.

765
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:02,121
Frankly, I might've been faster if I had carried him instead.

766
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:05,890
(After the warm-up game)

767
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:07,001
- Should we do it in pairs?
- Yes.

768
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,700
(What will Jeong Geun and Da Hye, the couple in 1st place, wish for?)

769
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:10,530
Entrust the cooking to me.

770
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,230
I'm getting more confident...

771
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:13,841
in cooking since I came here.

772
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,441
Okay, you're the chef in charge.

773
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,441
Should I be the assistant chef, then?

774
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:19,240
As for the assistant chef,

775
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:20,341
can I choose myself?

776
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:21,740
Can I choose myself?

777
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:22,781
Sure, you can.

778
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:25,750
I want to cook with Ji Eun.

779
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:27,981
(I want to cook with Ji Eun.)

780
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,921
The two of them are set on each other.

781
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:38,990
- Let's play that.
- Chicken fight.

782
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,561
Yes, chicken fight.

783
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:42,300
(Team game, 4-on-4 chicken fight)

784
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:43,670
They're playing chicken fight too?

785
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,130
Should we have the losers cook breakfast tomorrow?

786
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:48,470
That sounds good.

787
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:49,610
- Here.
- We're one.

788
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,810
(Sin Young, Su Jin, Hyun Jin, and Dong Ha are in one team.)

789
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,071
- We're going to win.
- Yes.

790
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:53,981
Use this tactic.

791
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:56,350
Can Geon Wu carry me?

792
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:57,680
- I'm stronger than you think.
- Da Hye...

793
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:58,751
(Da Hye, Ji Eun, Geon Wu, and Jeong Geun are in one team.)

794
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:01,381
I'm very sure I won't lose to them.

795
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:02,750
Me too, actually.

796
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,151
- We're going to win anyway.
- We'll win.

797
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:07,461
- Me too, actually.
- I can hear you loud and clear.

798
00:34:07,991 --> 00:34:09,691
That was so loud and clear.

799
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,061
There's not a chance that we'll lose to you.

800
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:15,930
- The match against Sin Young.
- Sin Young...

801
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:17,230
Just give up on winning that round.

802
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:19,201
- Yes.
- You're right.

803
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:21,770
- Who knows?
- She has the upper hand.

804
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,311
- She has long arms.
- She does have long arms.

805
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:25,240
Who will start?

806
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:26,610
(Who'll play the first round?)

807
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:27,981
Should we do this?

808
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:29,611
- Exactly. How...
- Take it slow.

809
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,750
You can do it. Show them, Sin Young.

810
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:32,850
- Get closer.
- Be careful.

811
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:35,320
(Sin Young versus Ji Eun)

812
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,790
You can do it, right?

813
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,721
I can't. What are you talking about?

814
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:43,690
She puts her hand only on him.

815
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:45,531
(Ji Eun naturally places her hand on Jeong Geun's shoulder.)

816
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:49,300
I could approach him more easily.

817
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:52,400
When I had to put my hand on one of them,

818
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:54,071
I chose Jeong Geun.

819
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:55,941
Let's go.

820
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,570
- You can do it.
- Let's go.

821
00:34:58,571 --> 00:34:59,980
Try this. Let's go!

822
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:01,441
I'm not confident at all.

823
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:02,910
I'm so scared.

824
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:04,080
- Let's go.
- You guys come.

825
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:05,411
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

826
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:06,980
- Why?
- Wait.

827
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,851
- Wait. Calm down.
- Can I go?

828
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,250
- Let's go.
- I'm so scared.

829
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:11,691
She asked, "Can I go?"

830
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:13,290
Go.

831
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,660
(Initiating)

832
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:15,820
Show them what you've got.

833
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:16,831
It looks fun.

834
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,160
Watch your back.

835
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,331
Hold on.

836
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:22,301
Hold on.

837
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:25,070
I'm so scared. Hold on.

838
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:26,101
Go back!

839
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:28,240
- Okay.
- Be careful.

840
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:30,310
You won't lose to her. You can do it.

841
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,311
(Ji Eun starts to retaliate.)

842
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:32,340
Go on.

843
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:33,981
Go!

844
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:36,141
Sin Young, you must avoid her.

845
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:38,351
No, it...

846
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,920
- They might get hurt.
- She fights back.

847
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:41,981
Wait.

848
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,490
Okay, now is the time.

849
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:46,621
- Let's go!
- Go.

850
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:50,791
(Hyun Jin tries to support Sin Young who leans back.)

851
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,830
- She won.
- Yes!

852
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:59,100
(Unexpectedly, Ji Eun wins.)

853
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:00,171
Oh, my gosh.

854
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:02,041
- Good job.
- I...

855
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,010
I'm done for today.

856
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:05,340
(The paper doll announces that she's done for the day.)

857
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:07,811
- Good job.
- I'm done for today.

858
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:11,751
I saw the competitive side of her.

859
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:14,721
In that sense, she is very charming,

860
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:17,351
like a femme fatale.

861
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:19,561
That's what I thought.

862
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:22,190
If it concerns just me,

863
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:23,590
I'm not competitive in games at all.

864
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:26,931
But if I have someone on my team,

865
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:30,001
I believe that I have to do my best.

866
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:31,301
That was why I really did my best.

867
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:34,341
I really gave it my all.

868
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:36,340
It's okay.

869
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:38,611
(The next player gets ready.)

870
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:39,981
We're fine.

871
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:41,740
Right.

872
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,680
Look forward to it so that we don't get caught.

873
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,611
- No. Look at them.
- Does it hurt?

874
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:49,520
(Dong Ha puts Su Jin's hat on for her.)

875
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:50,521
Like this?

876
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:51,791
This way...

877
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,761
I couldn't hide my face.

878
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,931
- It bothered me too.
- This way...

879
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:00,831
- I see. Nice.
- It will be hidden.

880
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:02,861
- That's a good strategy.
- Nice one.

881
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:05,000
(Coming up with a plan for the game)

882
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:06,030
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

883
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,040
It's our strategy.

884
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,470
- What?
- What's wrong?

885
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:10,340
The hat will be hard to take off with that.

886
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:11,570
- It falls off like this.
- You can't do that.

887
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:14,441
I'll just untie my hair.

888
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:21,721
(Dong Ha kindly fixes Su Jin's hat.)

889
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,051
(Da Hye watches that happen.)

890
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:27,660
Shall we begin?

891
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:29,360
- Just like that.
- We can attack and retreat.

892
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:31,131
- Don't worry about us.
- Right.

893
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:33,001
It's getting hot in here.

894
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:34,630
- Here we go.
- Let's go!

895
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,130
Let's go!

896
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,700
- I'll use my lower body now.
- Right.

897
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:39,071
- Or...
- Just let go of your hands.

898
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:41,801
- This is a good balance.
- All right.

899
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:43,570
- Don't hold onto it.
- Okay.

900
00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:45,341
- They keep running away.
- Come at me.

901
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:48,581
Gosh, that looks exciting.

902
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:53,351
- This is a good balance.
- All right.

903
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,551
Gosh.

904
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:58,691
- I'm sorry! I hit your eye.
- She hit her.

905
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:02,991
Gosh.

906
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,061
- I'm sorry! I hit your eye.
- She hit her.

907
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:08,531
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

908
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:12,531
Her elbow got him.

909
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:14,240
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay? I'm really sorry.

910
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,401
Hold on.

911
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:17,840
What's wrong?

912
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:19,071
- Right.
- Are you okay?

913
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,540
- Bring her down.
- Are you okay?

914
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,081
- I'm okay.
- Did he get hit?

915
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:24,411
- Are you okay?
- Did he get hit too?

916
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:25,650
What's wrong?

917
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,050
(Jeong Geun got hit hard by Da Hye's elbow.)

918
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:28,081
Jeong Geun.

919
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:30,091
- What's wrong?
- Was it her elbow?

920
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:31,490
- Are you okay?
- Did he get hurt?

921
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:32,491
Was it my elbow?

922
00:38:32,851 --> 00:38:34,791
- I think when she came down...
- Are you okay?

923
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:37,560
Where did you get hit? Your nose or your eye?

924
00:38:37,561 --> 00:38:39,391
- Was it his nose?
- His nose got hit.

925
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:41,201
- Are you not bleeding?
- Let me take a look.

926
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,961
- Is your bone okay?
- Gosh.

927
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:44,530
- Oh, no.
- Are you okay?

928
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:45,731
- I don't think he will be okay.
- That must have made him dizzy.

929
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:47,141
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm okay.

930
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:51,041
I got really worried.

931
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,641
Don't force yourself.

932
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:55,281
I'm okay.

933
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,050
(Jeong Geun tries to carry on with the game...)

934
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:59,051
(while pretending to be okay.)

935
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:00,521
I felt very flustered at that moment,

936
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:03,991
and Da Hye got really worried about me.

937
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:07,390
After that moment had went by,

938
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:09,361
I was totally fine about it.

939
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:13,831
But I knew that Da Hye was a soft-hearted person.

940
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:18,201
I knew that she was someone who was sensitive to emotions.

941
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:23,611
I really didn't like the fact that someone got hurt because of me.

942
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:24,871
I kept feeling bad about...

943
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:27,540
not being able to apologize properly to Jeong Geun.

944
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:28,581
He got hurt too.

945
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:33,950
(The time at the pool ends.)

946
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:35,380
Is your eye okay?

947
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:36,381
(In the women's room after being at the pool...)

948
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:38,321
My eye is fine. I just feel...

949
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:44,030
I just feel bad that someone got hurt because of me.

950
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:45,630
- Right.
- I know nobody would care.

951
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:47,130
You just feel bad about it.

952
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:49,031
It would've been better if I was the one to get hurt.

953
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:52,571
Since I was the one to make someone get hurt...

954
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,140
- It wasn't done on purpose.
- Definitely not.

955
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:57,111
It just happened while playing the game.

956
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,111
- It just happened out of nowhere.
- Right.

957
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,810
We had to carry on as the mood can't go down too much.

958
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:07,451
Things would've been serious if we had taken some time off.

959
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:10,090
Da Hye feels worse as she was the one to hit him.

960
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:11,290
- Right.
- Right.

961
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,320
I thought that we would take some time off.

962
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:13,520
- I think so.
- Yes.

963
00:40:13,521 --> 00:40:15,961
(Da Hye feels bad as she was the one to hurt Jeong Geun.)

964
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:18,531
That was why I lost my mind.

965
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:20,801
And...

966
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:23,301
I didn't like how things became awkward.

967
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:25,531
It just...

968
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:37,951
(Da Hye keeps shedding tears.)

969
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:54,001
Knock, knock.

970
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:55,961
Excuse me.

971
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:57,931
Yes?

972
00:40:58,601 --> 00:40:59,841
I'm coming in.

973
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:02,141
- Are you on the second floor?
- Yes.

974
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:06,641
I'm okay though.

975
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,411
- Is Da Hye in there?
- Yes.

976
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,380
- What is it?
- Were you talking?

977
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,250
- We were talking.
- Really?

978
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,920
- Who is it?
- Could I talk for a while?

979
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:16,051
- With Da Hye?
- Yes.

980
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:17,850
- I think...
- Who is it?

981
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,191
This is the only time I can talk to her.

982
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,590
- It's me, Hyun Jin.
- But...

983
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:22,921
- Is this a bad time?
- Turn back.

984
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:24,691
- Well...
- Turn back.

985
00:41:24,991 --> 00:41:27,730
Gosh, this is a bad time.

986
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:29,231
(This is not the time, Hyun Jin.)

987
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:31,971
Dating must be about luck.

988
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,571
(Gritting his teeth)

989
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:37,570
I think it'll be better if you come later.

990
00:41:37,571 --> 00:41:38,571
What is it, Hyun Jin?

991
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:40,940
I just wanted to talk to you.

992
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:42,210
- Sounds good.
- That was why I came.

993
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,550
- I was just...
- Right. I got worried.

994
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:46,720
It's something that Hyun Jin can hear about.

995
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,450
- Just give me 5 minutes.
- Just 5 minutes?

996
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:49,451
- Just five minutes.
- Will you be okay with that?

997
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:50,520
You want to be just with me, right?

998
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:51,751
- Right.
- Okay.

999
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:54,020
Okay.

1000
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:56,991
Hyun Jin suddenly appeared at that moment.

1001
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:01,101
He said he wanted to talk to me...

1002
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:03,800
at that moment.

1003
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:06,071
I wondered if something happened...

1004
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:08,171
or if he figured out that I cried.

1005
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:11,211
- I needed some time.
- Right.

1006
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:13,281
I'm fine now.

1007
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:14,680
Did something happen?

1008
00:42:14,681 --> 00:42:16,651
No. It's just what happened in the pool.

1009
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:17,951
Was it because of that moment?

1010
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:20,151
Well...

1011
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,491
I thought that I was the only one to get hurt.

1012
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:25,190
Right. Jeong Geun.

1013
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,921
I'm totally fine with what happened to me.

1014
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:31,530
- But... You know, right?
- Right. I know what you mean.

1015
00:42:31,531 --> 00:42:32,630
(Hyun Jin understands Da Hye's heavy heart.)

1016
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,431
I felt bad about that moment.

1017
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:37,531
That was why...

1018
00:42:37,571 --> 00:42:38,871
- Would you like some candy?
- Sure.

1019
00:42:39,401 --> 00:42:41,370
- It will make you feel better.
- Right.

1020
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:43,201
- I didn't eat too. Sure.
- Two pieces?

1021
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:45,711
I'll take two. I did have a cookie.

1022
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:47,681
It was something that I brought.

1023
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,651
I was just talking about that moment.

1024
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:55,521
- That was why I felt upset.
- Right.

1025
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,421
Don't feel upset.

1026
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:58,590
- I'm fine now.
- Do you need more water in that?

1027
00:42:58,591 --> 00:43:00,691
- I mean, let it out.
- Right.

1028
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:02,361
- Forget about it.
- Right.

1029
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:05,090
Hyun Jin feels like an older brother.

1030
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:07,961
He came to her as he wanted to talk.

1031
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:11,000
Right now, all he can do is listen to Da Hye.

1032
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:14,901
It seemed like a bad time to approach her at first,

1033
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:17,470
- but it seemed to have worked out.
- It worked out?

1034
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:18,570
(The timing was a blessing in disguise?)

1035
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:19,640
It turned out to be a good time to approach her.

1036
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,811
- He's hearing her heart?
- Right.

1037
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:25,210
The two of us kept mentioning this.

1038
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:26,750
We said that Hyun Jin felt very charming...

1039
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:28,350
the more and more we saw him.

1040
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:29,821
- Right?
- Yes. Seriously.

1041
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:33,591
- We had our first 1-on-1 dates.
- Right.

1042
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:34,891
That was when...

1043
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:37,761
- I talked to Su Jin.
- Right.

1044
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,401
- How was it for you?
- I confidently said...

1045
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:44,170
that I was interested in two people.

1046
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:46,000
- Right.
- I told her that...

1047
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:47,570
when Su Jin asked me.

1048
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:50,670
There definitely are people who you are more concerned about.

1049
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,710
Right.

1050
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,411
Am I one of those two?

1051
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:55,540
You're asking me that straight up like that?

1052
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:58,750
Since you mustered up your courage,

1053
00:43:58,751 --> 00:44:01,480
I think it will be better for me if I clearly know how things are.

1054
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:03,721
I think I know who the other person is then.

1055
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:05,621
Who do you think it is?

1056
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,361
- It's Su Jin.
- Right.

1057
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:08,461
Right?

1058
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:10,131
- It's Su Jin.
- Right.

1059
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:11,431
Right?

1060
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,530
- Was I that easy to read?
- Right.

1061
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:16,401
No. Just the timing of everything...

1062
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:17,931
Well..

1063
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:20,771
I'm right, aren't I?

1064
00:44:21,401 --> 00:44:23,371
Is there a hole around here I can hide myself in?

1065
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:24,971
That's not something to be embarrassed about.

1066
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,541
Even if...

1067
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:31,450
I try to hide my heart and express myself carefully,

1068
00:44:31,451 --> 00:44:32,681
it will be obvious.

1069
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:34,121
If that's the case,

1070
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,420
there's no need to hide things.

1071
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:39,391
I should just express myself while following my heart.

1072
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:42,960
I thought,

1073
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:45,690
"Does Da Hye find me to be uncomfortable?"

1074
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,430
- These conversations are great.
- Right.

1075
00:44:48,431 --> 00:44:50,000
I didn't feel that before.

1076
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:51,970
I'm not saying I was offended or anything,

1077
00:44:51,971 --> 00:44:53,671
but I was just curious.

1078
00:44:54,141 --> 00:44:56,540
- "Why is she like that to me?" - I'm not uncomfortable around you.

1079
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:58,410
- "Is it awkward to be with me?" - No.

1080
00:44:58,411 --> 00:44:59,610
"Am I uncomfortable to be with?" I had these questions in mind.

1081
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:00,910
There was this though.

1082
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:03,910
During our first night, when we ate late at night,

1083
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:06,611
we talked about marriage and family plans.

1084
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:09,880
You were so detailed about it,

1085
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:12,890
and you shared about your love toward your nephews and family.

1086
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:14,921
To be honest, I couldn't really relate to what you said.

1087
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:18,461
(First night)

1088
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,761
This could be a sensitive topic.

1089
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:23,130
It's the same with kids.

1090
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:25,131
I really like kids.

1091
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:26,571
I really do.

1092
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:29,100
- That's understandable.
- I love my nephews too.

1093
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,670
- You have nephews.
- I find them to be adorable.

1094
00:45:30,671 --> 00:45:32,140
Your nephews could make you feel that way.

1095
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:33,611
My older brother had kids,

1096
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:37,750
and it made me go crazy.

1097
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:40,950
It made me think that life would feel so meaningful that way.

1098
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:42,681
That was why I wanted to make my own family,

1099
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:45,150
have kids,

1100
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:47,621
and live that life.

1101
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:52,060
He was a bit too honest from the first night.

1102
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:53,430
(Hyun Jin went ahead of himself on the first night.)

1103
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:55,760
- I was worried about that.
- That could've felt burdensome.

1104
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:57,000
- That could've felt burdensome.
- Right.

1105
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,270
Women would definitely find it burdensome...

1106
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:00,841
to hear something like that during their first encounter.

1107
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:03,371
Hyun Jin said that it was his goal...

1108
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:05,210
to get married.

1109
00:46:05,211 --> 00:46:06,610
I understand why.

1110
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:07,640
Regardless of his age,

1111
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:09,580
Hyun Jin wanted to make his own family...

1112
00:46:09,581 --> 00:46:11,610
- ever since he was young.
- Right. That's understandable.

1113
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:13,250
- Age doesn't matter.
- Right.

1114
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:14,680
He wants to be settled down quickly too.

1115
00:46:14,681 --> 00:46:16,050
He wasn't able to make that happen...

1116
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:17,420
and ended up coming this far.

1117
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:18,750
(He ended up coming this far.)

1118
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:20,190
Love is such a difficult thing.

1119
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:21,820
I should've told him not to be like that.

1120
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,220
- It's difficult, - Gosh.

1121
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:25,461
- and the timing has to work out.
- I wasn't able to tell him.

1122
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,661
No. It's okay. Let's keep going.

1123
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:30,831
To be honest, I couldn't really relate to what you said.

1124
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:33,101
That was why I thought...

1125
00:46:33,641 --> 00:46:35,170
you already had...

1126
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:37,670
- marriage in your mind.
- Right.

1127
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:40,180
That was why I felt that you were more of an elder.

1128
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:41,240
- "Elder?" - Right.

1129
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:42,640
I felt that from you.

1130
00:46:42,641 --> 00:46:45,210
It wasn't based on your looks or actions.

1131
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:46,781
I felt that from your words.

1132
00:46:49,281 --> 00:46:50,851
- Elder isn't the right word.
- That's understandable.

1133
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:53,290
I thought that you were more mature than me.

1134
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:54,461
I'm someone...

1135
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:57,030
who still finds my job and career...

1136
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:58,831
to be important as of right now.

1137
00:46:58,991 --> 00:47:02,930
You seemed to be certain about your values, so...

1138
00:47:02,931 --> 00:47:04,470
Rather than calling it a barrier,

1139
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:06,330
I thought that these things could become a problem...

1140
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:08,101
if we got closer.

1141
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,470
I think that was what was going through my mind...

1142
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:11,471
- now that I think about it.
- Right.

1143
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:12,570
I'm being completely honest right now.

1144
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:13,710
- I see. That's understandable.
- Right.

1145
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:15,681
Understood. I know what you mean.

1146
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,811
Right. Anyway...

1147
00:47:20,981 --> 00:47:23,480
We still have...

1148
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:25,920
Whether it is a lot or a short amount of time,

1149
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:27,360
- but we still have time left.
- Right.

1150
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:29,720
- Let's keep things open.
- Sounds good.

1151
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,190
- We can spend more time together.
- Right.

1152
00:47:32,191 --> 00:47:34,031
- We started our conversation.
- Right.

1153
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:36,600
- He did well to talk to her.
- It felt as if...

1154
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:38,070
he confessed his feelings to her and got dumped right away...

1155
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:39,530
- in a calm manner.
- No. That's not true.

1156
00:47:39,531 --> 00:47:40,570
- That's not true.
- That's not true.

1157
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,970
- After having some coffee, - He did well.

1158
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:43,740
It feels like the two of them are over now.

1159
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:45,070
- No.
- She was just honest.

1160
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,540
What do you think as the strategist?

1161
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,611
In my opinion, it's safe to say it's over for them.

1162
00:47:49,081 --> 00:47:50,380
- Really?
- Yes.

1163
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:51,650
- I see.
- Right.

1164
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,880
- I think the same way.
- I believe it's over...

1165
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:55,481
for the two of them.

1166
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,290
This was what I thought...

1167
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,851
after listening to that conversation.

1168
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:00,220
There was a misunderstanding,

1169
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:02,360
and she just wanted to solve that misunderstanding.

1170
00:48:02,361 --> 00:48:05,131
Hyun Jin asked if...

1171
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:06,930
she felt uncomfortable about him.

1172
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:12,031
That conversation was to solve that misunderstanding.

1173
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:13,640
It wasn't a conversation...

1174
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,841
about wanting to learn more about each other.

1175
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:17,710
I don't think they would work out.

1176
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:19,511
Right. That was what I thought too.

1177
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:24,981
Hey.

1178
00:48:25,951 --> 00:48:27,051
What are you drinking?

1179
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:28,850
- Coffee.
- Alone?

1180
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:30,450
- I was about to read.
- What?

1181
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:31,691
- I was about to read.
- Alone?

1182
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:34,221
Let's drink coffee together. I want some too.

1183
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:37,961
(Dong Ha tries to spend time with Su Jin.)

1184
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:40,631
He's so expressive.

1185
00:48:41,601 --> 00:48:43,801
Dong Ha is amazing with his timing.

1186
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:47,301
Gosh, it's so nice. This place is really nice.

1187
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:52,311
(Su Jin and Dong Ha spend a relaxed afternoon together.)

1188
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:57,051
I have a question.

1189
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:59,350
Why is the Eiffel Tower your phone wallpaper?

1190
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:00,951
I think I already told you my reason.

1191
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:04,891
The reason why the wallpaper is the Eiffel Tower?

1192
00:49:06,851 --> 00:49:08,021
I love Paris.

1193
00:49:08,521 --> 00:49:10,590
I went to Paris around five times.

1194
00:49:10,591 --> 00:49:11,760
You feel attached?

1195
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:12,831
I love Paris the most.

1196
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:15,601
That's amazing.

1197
00:49:16,761 --> 00:49:18,400
We have the same wallpaper.

1198
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:20,501
Really? The Eiffel Tower?

1199
00:49:20,971 --> 00:49:22,771
Really? I got chills.

1200
00:49:22,971 --> 00:49:24,510
Should we show it to the camera?

1201
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:27,041
(The two had the same wallpaper.)

1202
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:30,811
Dong Ha was always by Su Jin.

1203
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:31,950
But I'm okay today.

1204
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:33,011
You're right.

1205
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:34,720
(Su Jin showed Dong Ha her tattoo.)

1206
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,951
Oh, I see.

1207
00:49:36,081 --> 00:49:37,251
Guess what it is.

1208
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:38,821
Can I see it again?

1209
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:42,491
No...

1210
00:49:42,591 --> 00:49:43,661
Right.

1211
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:45,490
No... Is that your baptismal name?

1212
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:46,660
What? How did you know?

1213
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:47,801
- Noella?
- What?

1214
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:49,630
- What is it? What did he say?
- Awesome!

1215
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:50,670
Guess what this is.

1216
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:51,671
(Dong Ha was the only one to understand her tattoo.)

1217
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:53,740
- I have no idea.
- Guess what it is.

1218
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:54,870
What? Matcha?

1219
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:56,371
Ne...

1220
00:49:56,571 --> 00:49:57,610
What? Ne...

1221
00:49:57,611 --> 00:49:58,940
I asked him to guess, and he got it right away.

1222
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:00,010
Really? What is it?

1223
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:01,841
- It's her baptismal name.
- My baptismal name.

1224
00:50:02,181 --> 00:50:03,181
How did you know? Are you catholic?

1225
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:04,181
Yes.

1226
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:07,120
- They follow the same religion too.
- They follow the same religion.

1227
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:08,181
They follow the same religion too.

1228
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:11,650
I got goosebumps when you guessed my baptismal name.

1229
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:12,651
Your baptismal name?

1230
00:50:12,652 --> 00:50:14,291
How did you know that this was "Noella?"

1231
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:16,991
My older brother has "Noel" here just like me.

1232
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:18,260
- "Noel?" - Noel and Noella.

1233
00:50:18,261 --> 00:50:19,361
"Noel and Noella."

1234
00:50:20,661 --> 00:50:21,931
I have this.

1235
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:25,601
The pilgrim routes?

1236
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:27,171
That's what it represents?

1237
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,301
You recognized it right away.

1238
00:50:29,971 --> 00:50:31,070
It's because you're Catholic too.

1239
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:32,671
- The Camino de Santiago.
- The Camino de Santiago.

1240
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:34,610
- What?
- What is it between these two?

1241
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:35,640
- Gosh.
- They have so much in common.

1242
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:37,511
- This is a big connection.
- Right.

1243
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:39,511
- After my first visit, - Yes.

1244
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:42,251
I got baptized because I wanted to.

1245
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:49,761
(They have tattoos on the same spot that represent their religion.)

1246
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:51,760
This is amazing.

1247
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:53,661
No one else understood what it was.

1248
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:56,231
This is amazing.

1249
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:04,740
(Dong Ha and Su Jin find out that they have a lot in common...)

1250
00:51:04,741 --> 00:51:06,311
(as they learn about each other.)

1251
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:09,541
We just clicked and understood each other right away.

1252
00:51:10,451 --> 00:51:14,151
We could talk about religion freely too.

1253
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:16,350
It was great that...

1254
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,490
we didn't have to explain things to each other...

1255
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:19,591
in different aspects.

1256
00:51:22,091 --> 00:51:23,490
Do you take time to think?

1257
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:24,561
What is your ideal type?

1258
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:26,991
- My ideal type?
- Yes.

1259
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:32,530
When I was asked about what I saw first,

1260
00:51:32,531 --> 00:51:33,731
I said it was height.

1261
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:35,171
I like tall people.

1262
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:38,841
When I first met you,

1263
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,781
you were a tall person who came to pick me up.

1264
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,180
- You came to pick me up.
- Right. I picked you up.

1265
00:51:43,181 --> 00:51:45,011
- I was the first person you met.
- Right.

1266
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:46,981
That's it?

1267
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:49,821
As I'm a bit extroverted,

1268
00:51:50,121 --> 00:51:52,091
I find it hard to be with people who prefer to stay at home.

1269
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:56,560
Even when I'm alone and have nothing to do on a Sunday.

1270
00:51:56,561 --> 00:51:57,630
I go to a cafe.

1271
00:51:57,631 --> 00:51:59,591
I'm someone who gets sick if I stay at home.

1272
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:02,501
You're just like me.

1273
00:52:06,571 --> 00:52:09,541
Is there someone else you wish to talk to other than me?

1274
00:52:09,871 --> 00:52:10,971
- Me?
- Yes.

1275
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:16,981
Well...

1276
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:21,751
I'm not sure.

1277
00:52:21,752 --> 00:52:25,491
I might get shaken if the other men make a move.

1278
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:28,060
I've really left my heart open.

1279
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,121
- What? Right.
- I've really left it open.

1280
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:31,891
I think...

1281
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:36,100
- That was a vague answer.
- What?

1282
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:37,501
That was a vague answer.

1283
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:44,211
(Su Jin's answer was vague.)

1284
00:52:46,471 --> 00:52:49,511
I can't even expect what will happen today.

1285
00:52:51,811 --> 00:52:55,781
(What are Su Jin and Dong Ha feeling right now?)

1286
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:58,751
- She didn't answer him.
- What could that mean?

1287
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,420
- What could that mean?
- She gave a vague answer.

1288
00:53:01,421 --> 00:53:03,460
(Su Jin didn't answer Dong Ha's question.)

1289
00:53:03,461 --> 00:53:05,990
So Dong Ha isn't interested in her, right?

1290
00:53:05,991 --> 00:53:08,630
- He was straightforward all along.
- Right.

1291
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:11,470
He had an interest in Su Jin and Ji Eun,

1292
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:13,530
so he wanted to learn more about them and talk to them.

1293
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:15,670
He expressed that he wanted to go on dates with them too.

1294
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:17,310
He said that last night,

1295
00:53:17,311 --> 00:53:19,070
so he's putting things into action.

1296
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,810
I think he will go straight to Ji Eun...

1297
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:22,511
after talking to her.

1298
00:53:23,081 --> 00:53:24,110
Really?

1299
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:25,250
- Let's see.
- I felt this...

1300
00:53:25,251 --> 00:53:26,710
after listening to their conversation.

1301
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:28,280
He did pick two women,

1302
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:30,150
but he seemed to start this conversation...

1303
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:34,690
- just to learn about who Su Jin is.
- Right.

1304
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:36,361
The tone of the conversation...

1305
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,861
- feels like...
- There's no feeling of love.

1306
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:41,360
- he isn't really into her.
- You saw that?

1307
00:53:41,361 --> 00:53:42,400
That was a sharp analysis.

1308
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:43,900
How would Dong Ha look when he's in love?

1309
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:45,130
In my opinion,

1310
00:53:45,131 --> 00:53:46,831
he hasn't shown his true emotions yet.

1311
00:53:53,171 --> 00:53:54,510
What is it? Can we go inside?

1312
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:56,281
- Come on!
- Hold on.

1313
00:53:56,811 --> 00:53:58,850
- It's torn off. It's a mess.
- I got a rush of dopamine.

1314
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:00,581
Gosh, there's something on the wall again.

1315
00:54:03,821 --> 00:54:04,990
Oh, no.

1316
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,350
(There's something on the board like it did on the second day.)

1317
00:54:06,351 --> 00:54:07,361
Oh, no.

1318
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:10,560
(The result of their second pick last night)

1319
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:12,790
(This is what your hearts are saying.)

1320
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,830
Again?

1321
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:15,001
Da Hye got one vote.

1322
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:16,761
Didn't Hyun Jin get a vote?

1323
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:20,470
(Kim Sin Young)

1324
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:21,471
It's okay.

1325
00:54:22,871 --> 00:54:24,670
You shine just on your own.

1326
00:54:24,671 --> 00:54:26,211
(You shine just on your own.)

1327
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:28,881
Stop me from seeing this.

1328
00:54:29,341 --> 00:54:30,681
Please stop me from seeing this.

1329
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:35,121
Okay. I got it.

1330
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:37,280
And Geon Wu is there to check it too.

1331
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:39,650
- I know.
- Okay. I got it.

1332
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:44,061
(Geon Wu picked Da Hye after going on a date with Sin Young.)

1333
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:46,630
(Sighing)

1334
00:54:46,631 --> 00:54:50,261
Honestly, I was a bit disappointed.

1335
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:56,140
Is Sin Young the only one...

1336
00:54:56,141 --> 00:54:57,971
who doesn't get to disclose her age and job, then?

1337
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:00,271
She is a mysterious woman.

1338
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:02,281
- Until the end?
- Yes. She's mysterious.

1339

(Welfare Center for People with Disabilities)

1340
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:09,280
(This welfare center serves as a stepping stone...)

1341
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:10,990
(to independence for people with disabilities.)

1342
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:12,021
(Integrated Office)

1343
00:55:19,931 --> 00:55:23,001
Hello. I'm a social worker with eight years of experience.

1344
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:26,271
(Ms. Kim is cute. I love you.)

1345
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:29,041
- Five, six, - Five, six,

1346
00:55:29,571 --> 00:55:32,371
- seven. That's enough.
- seven, eight.

1347
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:37,110
What I do is plan various programs for adults with disabilities...

1348
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:41,881
so that they can enjoy cultural and leisure activities.

1349
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:45,791
Two, three.

1350
00:55:45,921 --> 00:55:47,391
- Look up.
- Five.

1351
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:48,921
- Raise your chin.
- Two.

1352
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:51,561
(Counseling in session)

1353
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,760
When the visitors come for the first time,

1354
00:55:54,761 --> 00:55:56,461
I introduce them to various programs,

1355
00:55:56,561 --> 00:56:04,241
including sports, arts and crafts, cooking, and excursions.

1356
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:10,611
(Kim Sin Young, 30, a social worker with 8 years of experience)

1357
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:13,281
I got it.

1358
00:56:26,331 --> 00:56:30,971
(Shin Dong Ha)

1359
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:35,671
I think Da Hye picked me.

1360
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:39,370
(After taking a break, )

1361
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:41,641
(Jeong Geun comes to the common area.)

1362
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,740
Yes. That's our memories.

1363
00:56:43,741 --> 00:56:45,351
- Look at that.
- You're here.

1364
00:56:45,681 --> 00:56:50,050
(Which name is at the end of Jeong Geun's gaze?)

1365
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:51,190
(Choi Ji Eun)

1366
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:54,421
(Ji Eun's name was taken by two people again.)

1367
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:57,420
(Jeong Geun seems to have a lot on his mind.)

1368
00:56:57,421 --> 00:56:59,460
Only Ji Eun...

1369
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:03,201
got two votes again.

1370
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:07,700
In fact, I suspected that 1 of the 2 votes...

1371
00:57:07,701 --> 00:57:09,971
was cast by Dong Ha.

1372
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:17,140
(Lastly, Hyun Jin and Da Hye join them.)

1373
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:18,850
- I don't want to see it.
- I want to be alone,

1374
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:19,981
so everyone leave.

1375
00:57:24,151 --> 00:57:25,920
(After getting 0 votes for the first impression, )

1376
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:27,621
(Hyun Jin's name is finally taken.)

1377
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:31,291
I assumed it was Su Jin.

1378
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:38,800
Can I leave the door open?

1379
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:39,930
- Yes.
- I don't have to close it, right?

1380
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:41,501
Let's open it now.

1381
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:43,171
It will be revealed now, won't it?

1382
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:47,140
(They check the envelope on the board together.)

1383
00:57:47,141 --> 00:57:48,441
Please read it out loud.

1384
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,110
- There's only 1 sheet.
- Only 1 sheet?

1385
00:57:50,111 --> 00:57:52,181
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1386
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:54,781
- Those who got chosen last night...
- Those who got chosen...

1387
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:58,291
Geon Wu, Dong Ha, Hyun Jin, and Jeong Geun.

1388
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:03,921
Ask the person you want to know better on a date.

1389
00:58:05,161 --> 00:58:06,161
(Geon Wu, Dong Ha, Hyun Jin, and Jeong Geun.)

1390
00:58:06,162 --> 00:58:07,190
(Ask the person you want to know better on a date.)

1391
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:09,401
- Since all four got a vote.
- That's right.

1392
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:12,201
Ask the person you want to know better on a date.

1393
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:14,800
- Now, we can clearly see...
- But...

1394
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:16,600
- who they're into. Yes.
- it might overlap.

1395
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:17,740
- They might choose the same person.
- In that case,

1396
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:18,870
will they still go on a date?

1397
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:19,971
- Will they?
- Please.

1398
00:58:20,011 --> 00:58:21,210
One might have a date with a group.

1399
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:22,380
- That's possible.
- Yes.

1400
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:24,711
- Just grab her hand and leave.
- Hurry.

1401
00:58:24,811 --> 00:58:25,811
Hurry and go for it.

1402
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,880
They told the guys to ask out on a date.

1403
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:31,491
But it sounded like it was on a first-come, first-served basis.

1404
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:33,721
The one who makes the move first is the winner.

1405
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:40,091
(After reading the announcement, a subtle tension is created.)

1406
00:58:40,491 --> 00:58:43,131
I didn't need time to think.

1407
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:45,601
It was clear who I wanted to ask out on a date today.

1408
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:49,401
I should go for it.

1409
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:53,311
Good. Who should I go with?

1410
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:57,141
I thought that when the opportunity presents itself, I should take it.

1411
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,851
(Who will the guys ask out on a date?)

1412
00:59:02,181 --> 00:59:05,751
(Who will the guys ask out on a date?)

1413
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,331
Don’t hesitate to express your feelings.

1414
00:59:13,831 --> 00:59:15,930
- Let's go.
- Okay. I'm going.

1415
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:17,600
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1416
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,901
- It's Su Jin!
- He's cool.

1417
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:22,171
He's cool.

1418
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:23,941
"Hey, let's go."

1419
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:25,770
- That was cool.
- He just went,

1420
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,040
- "Let's go." - I was right, wasn't I?

1421
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:29,211
- It's the Eiffel Tower couple.
- Gosh.

1422
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:30,741
- I'll just say it.
- Okay.

1423
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:33,080
- Ji Eun, let's go.
- Right away.

1424
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:34,151
(Nodding)

1425
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:37,951
(The second match is Ji Eun and Jeong Geun.)

1426
00:59:38,651 --> 00:59:39,691
I'll dash...

1427
00:59:39,851 --> 00:59:42,061
to the person I was curious about.

1428
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:43,690
- I'll ask her out on a date.
- Say it.

1429
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:44,791
Say it.

1430
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:45,961
- Sin Young.
- Yes.

1431
00:59:46,091 --> 00:59:47,230
Nam Hee!

1432
00:59:47,231 --> 00:59:48,330
- "Sin Young." - Sin Young.

1433
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:49,860
- Gosh. Really?
- Let's go out on a date.

1434
00:59:49,861 --> 00:59:50,930
- Really?
- Okay.

1435
00:59:50,931 --> 00:59:52,500
- Okay. Good.
- Let's go.

1436
00:59:52,501 --> 00:59:53,531
- Good.
- I...

1437
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:56,700
The courageous ones go for it right away.

1438
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:58,241
- Yes. Right away.
- Yes.

1439
00:59:58,741 --> 01:00:00,870
This is new. It's a new way of picking.

1440
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:02,441
- Do you want to come?
- What? Yes.

1441
01:00:02,911 --> 01:00:06,781
(The last match is Da Hye and Geon Wu.)

1442
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:10,351
I'll take this opportunity to talk more with Da Hye.

1443
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:15,961
I didn't know Hyun Jin had a feeling toward Sin Young.

1444
01:00:16,191 --> 01:00:17,290
(What's with the two?)

1445
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:18,730
- Ye Eun...
- I thought he'd pick Da Hye.

1446
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:19,990
Made a dolphin sound for the first time on the show.

1447
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,161
- Really?
- Ye Eun made the sound. Yes.

1448
01:00:23,261 --> 01:00:25,031
- I'm proud for some reason.
- This is fun.

1449
01:00:27,531 --> 01:00:29,200
(A date chosen by the men)

1450
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:32,110
Gosh. It's sunny now.

1451
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:33,441
(Su Jin and Dong Ha are the first to leave.)

1452
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,751
- The trees are dense here.
- Yes.

1453
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:41,321
We're going through a mountain.

1454
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:47,121
I wanted to take her to an open space.

1455
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:52,160
The guys have chosen the course for the date, right?

1456
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:53,560
- That's right.
- Yes.

1457
01:00:53,561 --> 01:00:54,661
(Where is this open space Dong Ha has prepared for Su Jin?)

1458
01:00:56,231 --> 01:00:59,001
Good. When the sun sets, it will be crazy.

1459
01:00:59,101 --> 01:01:01,001
(Reaching)

1460
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:02,570
Thank you.

1461
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:04,771
(Sensitive Dong Ha noticed it right away.)

1462
01:01:05,141 --> 01:01:06,410
- Well...
- Yes.

1463
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:07,640
We met for the first time two days ago.

1464
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:09,210
- Yes.
- It feels like a long time ago.

1465
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:10,281
I know.

1466
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:18,691
I'm worried about one thing a little right now.

1467
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:19,751
Yes? What is it?

1468
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:21,661
The age difference between you and me.

1469
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:25,131
- If there's a big age gap, - Yes.

1470
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:27,860
It'll be hard for me to make a move.

1471
01:01:27,861 --> 01:01:31,371
It might be hard on you.

1472
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:33,631
- It might look ugly.
- Well...

1473
01:01:33,671 --> 01:01:35,270
It would be a big burden.

1474
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:36,841
- For the other person?
- Yes.

1475
01:01:37,871 --> 01:01:38,971
That's possible.

1476
01:01:40,211 --> 01:01:43,441
(Last night)

1477
01:01:44,811 --> 01:01:46,310
(She chose Hyun Jin...)

1478
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:48,381
(and found out about his occupation and age.)

1479
01:01:49,121 --> 01:01:52,151
"Oh Hyun Jin is 39. He is a stage and musical actor."

1480
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,721
"Thirty-nine years old."

1481
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:56,921
I was shocked.

1482
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:58,961
For me,

1483
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:02,301
the maximum age difference is six years older or younger.

1484
01:02:02,461 --> 01:02:03,501
Seriously.

1485
01:02:04,201 --> 01:02:05,370
She has an age gap limit,

1486
01:02:05,371 --> 01:02:07,130
- which is 6 years.
- It's 6 years.

1487
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:08,640
- The limit is six years?
- Su Jin.

1488
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,741
It's okay to go over six years, Su Jin.

1489
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:16,411
Since she's never dated before, she might be more careful.

1490
01:02:17,681 --> 01:02:19,351
Will they grow apart again?

1491
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:21,320
But Su Jin is...

1492
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,481
(Will she change her mind after knowing Dong Ha's age?)

1493
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:23,980
- The smell of the sea?
- Yes.

1494
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:25,890
(Ji Eun and Jeong Geun were the second to leave.)

1495
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:28,221
They have women's clothes.

1496
01:02:29,021 --> 01:02:32,090
We can also check out fashion accessories...

1497
01:02:32,091 --> 01:02:34,261
- and jewelry.
- I see.

1498
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,661
Let's take a look.

1499
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:40,900
Ji Eun was wearing...

1500
01:02:40,901 --> 01:02:44,771
a beaded necklace.

1501
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:47,911
I wanted to get her something that suited her.

1502
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:49,440
That was what I wanted to do.

1503
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:51,011
(Jeong Geun wanted to give her a meaningful gift.)

1504
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,811
Do you not like plushies?

1505
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:55,981
- I like them, - I see.

1506
01:02:57,351 --> 01:02:58,521
But I try to refrain myself.

1507
01:02:59,051 --> 01:03:00,051
- Really?
- Yes.

1508
01:03:00,052 --> 01:03:01,391
Do you collect them?

1509
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:05,231
I used to buy them when I traveled overseas.

1510
01:03:09,431 --> 01:03:11,271
It will be great...

1511
01:03:11,331 --> 01:03:15,601
if it's something you can hang on your bag or suitcase.

1512
01:03:17,871 --> 01:03:19,541
- What about that one, then?
- Which one?

1513
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,411
That one's cute.

1514
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:25,710
What? Hold on.

1515
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:28,151
- I can put it up here.
- Not me.

1516
01:03:30,481 --> 01:03:33,351
- No, not on me.
- It suits perfectly.

1517
01:03:34,421 --> 01:03:36,160
I just realized that you don't have a bag.

1518
01:03:36,161 --> 01:03:37,790
I don't carry bags around.

1519
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:38,891
Really?

1520
01:03:40,961 --> 01:03:42,060
I can do something like this.

1521
01:03:42,061 --> 01:03:43,100
Isn't this adorable?

1522
01:03:43,101 --> 01:03:44,630
This is my type.

1523
01:03:44,631 --> 01:03:45,800
- Is that Jeong Geun's type?
- Yes.

1524
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:47,101
I have nothing to say, then.

1525
01:03:47,531 --> 01:03:48,700
A card wallet.

1526
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:52,411
(What would suit Ji Eun's taste?)

1527
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:56,380
Let's buy something we can take away...

1528
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:57,981
as souvenirs.

1529
01:03:58,281 --> 01:03:59,711
Should we get matching bracelets?

1530
01:04:00,081 --> 01:04:01,250
- What?
- "Matching bracelets?"

1531
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:02,981
Ji Eun asked him to buy a pair.

1532
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:05,691
Ji Eun brought it up first.

1533
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:11,230
What? We can handle it.

1534
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:12,631
Am I a feminine man?

1535
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:14,561
You can wear it.

1536
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:16,661
Why? Why not?

1537
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:20,971
I was very flustered.

1538
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:24,841
When it comes to cute little things,

1539
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:28,311
I haven't tried them or even thought of trying them.

1540
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:30,280
- Should we get matching bracelets?
- Still,

1541
01:04:30,281 --> 01:04:31,351
- Bracelets?
- Yes.

1542
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:32,951
Deep down,

1543
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:35,581
I was really happy.

1544
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:38,621
He's obviously not the type of person...

1545
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:40,851
who would wear something showy.

1546
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,231
I was a bit excited.

1547
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:50,731
Are they becoming an official couple?

1548
01:04:51,131 --> 01:04:53,230
If they wear matching bracelets while staying there,

1549
01:04:53,231 --> 01:04:54,330
- it's obvious.
- Yes.

1550
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:55,400
It's like, "Don't bother us."

1551
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:56,401
Aren't they like fetters?

1552
01:04:56,402 --> 01:04:57,641
- Fetters?
- That's right.

1553
01:04:57,941 --> 01:05:00,111
- But, as for me...
- Yes.

1554
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,440
- personally, - Yes.

1555
01:05:01,441 --> 01:05:04,310
I think we're reading too much...

1556
01:05:04,311 --> 01:05:06,651
into wearing matching bracelets here.

1557
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:07,950
- What?
- It's obvious.

1558
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:09,650
- They can all see them.
- It's plain to see.

1559
01:05:09,651 --> 01:05:11,080
I'll read into it.

1560
01:05:11,081 --> 01:05:12,550
It's a done deal.

1561
01:05:12,551 --> 01:05:14,820
I think Ji Eun just casually asked...

1562
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:15,990
- No.
- No?

1563
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:17,120
- It's not casual.
- It isn't.

1564
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,260
- No, they're matching...
- It's a couple's item.

1565
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:21,860
They're literally the bracelets for couples.

1566
01:05:21,861 --> 01:05:22,900
In the early stages of dating,

1567
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:24,970
when a woman asks to get a matching item,

1568
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:26,870
- what should we think of it?
- That's surely...

1569
01:05:26,871 --> 01:05:27,930
- a way to ask...
- "Do you want to go out?"

1570
01:05:27,931 --> 01:05:29,171
- "Do you want to see each other?" - That's right.

1571
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:31,340
Is it like, "Say you have feelings for me right now?"

1572
01:05:31,341 --> 01:05:33,310
Also, asking to get matching items...

1573
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:34,410
is being flirty too.

1574
01:05:34,411 --> 01:05:35,880
She knows that he likes her,

1575
01:05:35,881 --> 01:05:37,040
so she asks, "Should we get matching items?"

1576
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,210
To throw the ball into his court.

1577
01:05:38,211 --> 01:05:39,510
- To see how he reacts?
- Knowing he wouldn't refuse it.

1578
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:40,981
- "He wouldn't refuse it." - Now,

1579
01:05:41,181 --> 01:05:44,121
- Jeong Geun is in Ji Eun's palm.
- You're right.

1580
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:45,850
- The tables have turned.
- She has control over him.

1581
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:48,061
He has become a feminine man from a masculine man.

1582
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:50,790
You choose one for me.

1583
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:51,931
Really?

1584
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:53,860
- If you choose one, - You...

1585
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:55,201
- I'll wear it.
- don't know what I'll pick.

1586
01:05:57,931 --> 01:06:00,571
In return, I'll choose yours.

1587
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:05,841
(They pick bracelets for each other.)

1588
01:06:10,581 --> 01:06:12,450
I think this will look good on you.

1589
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:13,480
Unlike how they look,

1590
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:14,650
they are a masculine woman and a feminine man.

1591
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:15,721
- In reverse.
- Right.

1592
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:18,521
A very cool-headed investment strategist...

1593
01:06:18,651 --> 01:06:20,790
- has met a girl...
- Yes.

1594
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:22,061
And has softened.

1595
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:28,431
Do you like pink?

1596
01:06:28,661 --> 01:06:30,201
- No.
- No? Try this.

1597
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:33,831
It looks good on you.

1598
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:35,400
That's yours.

1599
01:06:35,401 --> 01:06:36,471
- Really?
- Yes.

1600
01:06:36,771 --> 01:06:40,210
(A white-pearl bracelet that suits Ji Eun well)

1601
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:41,440
Can I pick one for you now?

1602
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:42,441
Go ahead.

1603
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:49,720
(Thinking hard)

1604
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:51,181
No. That's not it, either.

1605
01:06:52,321 --> 01:06:53,621
Okay. Then...

1606
01:06:55,461 --> 01:06:56,521
You're careful.

1607
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,061
Here.

1608
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:04,631
- Okay. Let's get this one.
- Okay.

1609
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:06,700
- I cut you some slack.
- Okay.

1610
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:08,171
- Is this it? Okay.
- Yes.

1611
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:11,101
Good. I'll wear it from now on.

1612
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:12,770
- In Jeong Geun's life, - Yes.

1613
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:14,070
- it's the only one.
- You're right.

1614
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,541
(The first bracelet in his life was picked by Ji Eun.)

1615
01:07:17,311 --> 01:07:19,380
It has a smiley here too.

1616
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:22,381
I'm not used to wearing this kind of bracelet at all.

1617
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,550
I...

1618
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:27,651
liked it.

1619
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:30,120
I could tell...

1620
01:07:30,121 --> 01:07:31,861
that he was trying for me.

1621
01:07:32,891 --> 01:07:35,130
He was really cute.

1622
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:37,561
(She adores Jeong Geun wearing the bracelet.)

1623
01:07:40,271 --> 01:07:43,340
Jeong Geun has mellowed out all of a sudden.

1624
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:44,600
- I mean...
- He has become a softie.

1625
01:07:44,601 --> 01:07:46,240
When he wants to win her heart,

1626
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:48,210
- he doesn't hesitate.
- He has softened.

1627
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:49,240
But suddenly,

1628
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:50,280
- This is what it feels like.
- he is softer.

1629
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:53,110
When a man truly loves someone,

1630
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:54,921
- he acts like Jeong Geun.
- You're right.

1631
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:56,621
That's what a man does when he is in love.

1632
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:59,620
When they're not fully in love, they act like Dong Ha.

1633
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:01,590
When they're not as much in love, they act like Dong Ha.

1634
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:03,190
- When he's totally in love, - Right.

1635
01:08:03,191 --> 01:08:04,291
- He's a player.
- he acts like Jeong Geun.

1636
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:07,090
- I thought Jeong Geun would lead.
- Exactly.

1637
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:08,500
- Yes.
- I didn't expect he'd be led...

1638
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,660
- especially by Ji Eun.
- He's led by her.

1639
01:08:09,661 --> 01:08:10,800
I didn't expect Ji Eun to act like that.

1640
01:08:10,801 --> 01:08:13,101
Ji Eun is dragging him around by his collar.

1641
01:08:13,231 --> 01:08:14,600
- He's been dragged around.
- Not by the collar.

1642
01:08:14,601 --> 01:08:16,800
- He's on the leash.
- He's like a puppy.

1643
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,740
He's not a feminine man, but a puppy man.

1644
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:20,040
- He's a puppy man.
- A puppy man.

1645
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:22,181
He's become a puppy man, indeed.

1646
01:08:23,581 --> 01:08:27,851
(That evening)

1647
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:32,551
You'll break the bracelet.

1648
01:08:34,721 --> 01:08:36,460
No one has noticed...

1649
01:08:36,461 --> 01:08:37,591
the bracelet I'm wearing, right?

1650
01:08:37,991 --> 01:08:41,361
It goes better with what you're wearing right now.

1651
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:42,901
- With this?
- Yes, actually.

1652
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:46,431
When would I wear an accessory like this?

1653
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:48,441
- If not now, then when?
- Now.

1654
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:56,481
Here's what we'll do.

1655
01:08:57,781 --> 01:09:00,951
(What is Jeong Geun about to say?)

1656
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:08,151
Here's what we'll do.

1657
01:09:13,091 --> 01:09:14,591
Until Sunday,

1658
01:09:15,061 --> 01:09:18,131
no matter what happens,

1659
01:09:18,671 --> 01:09:20,931
we won't take them off.

1660
01:09:22,471 --> 01:09:23,601
Will you be able to do that?

1661
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,171
(What?)

1662
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:28,141
I was like, "What?"

1663
01:09:30,781 --> 01:09:31,981
Will you be able to do that?

1664
01:09:33,481 --> 01:09:34,950
I'm just asking.

1665
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:36,521
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

1666
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:43,221
(But later on, these bracelets...)

1667
01:09:46,331 --> 01:09:52,231
(sparks a misunderstanding.)

1668
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:55,041
No. Don't get me wrong.

1669
01:09:55,471 --> 01:09:57,201
No. Don't get me wrong.

1670
01:09:57,601 --> 01:09:59,340
I wanted to turn back time.

1671
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:00,411
- Really?
- Yes.

1672
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:02,180
You won't put on in from now on.

1673
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:03,341
I'll keep it.

1674
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:05,511
I regretted it a little.

1675
01:10:06,381 --> 01:10:07,951
At that moment,

1676
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:10,151
my face really went stiff.

1677
01:10:10,621 --> 01:10:12,621
This is driving me nuts. Seriously.

1678
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:14,390
When I recall it now,

1679
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:15,821
I still get extremely upset.

1680
01:10:17,021 --> 01:10:18,191
Should I run away?

1681
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:23,401
(What will happen to these two?)

1682
01:10:23,731 --> 01:10:25,270
- What?
- Why?

1683
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:26,431
- Why?
- What is this all of a sudden?

1684
01:10:26,801 --> 01:10:28,300
She must have taken it off.

1685
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:30,800
Wait. Wasn't the guy sitting in front of Ji Eun...

1686
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:32,171
Dong Ha?

1687
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:33,711
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1688
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:35,180
Was it? Was it Dong Ha's clothes?

1689
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:36,340
- Was it him?
- Hold on.

1690
01:10:36,341 --> 01:10:38,010
- Please rewind it a little.
- Wait a second.

1691
01:10:38,011 --> 01:10:39,650
- What's going on?
- This is getting interesting.

1692
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:40,981
(This is getting interesting.)

1693
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:44,991
(The dates picked by the men are not over yet.)

1694
01:10:45,191 --> 01:10:46,621
Is it okay if I don't answer it?

1695
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:48,191
It wasn't consecutive, was it?

1696
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:50,190
- Was it consecutive?
- Yes, it was.

1697
01:10:50,191 --> 01:10:51,261
- Really?
- Yes.

1698
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:53,491
(Finding out about their true feelings)

1699
01:10:53,591 --> 01:10:55,631
(A date to reveal the feelings they couldn't express before)

1700
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:58,100
I wish the others wouldn't come here.

1701
01:10:58,101 --> 01:10:59,471
Here? You want this place just for us?

1702
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:01,771
Come. Come this way.

1703
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:03,171
Come here.

1704
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,411
Who is this person?

1705
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:08,241
(A time that brings them closer together)

1706
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:12,210
(Knocking on their hearts more without hesitation)

1707
01:11:12,211 --> 01:11:14,111
(While looking at them, he feels...)

1708
01:11:14,381 --> 01:11:16,821
Something between them is different from what I have with her.

1709
01:11:18,351 --> 01:11:19,550
Is this it?

1710
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,651
It looks good on you.

1711
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:22,961
It fits just the way I like it.

1712
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:25,960
(And...)

1713
01:11:25,961 --> 01:11:27,961
(a confusing change in the atmosphere)

1714
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,800
When I sat down,

1715
01:11:29,801 --> 01:11:31,401
her wrist was the first thing I saw.

1716
01:11:33,371 --> 01:11:36,070
(The bracelet is nowhere to be seen.)

1717
01:11:36,071 --> 01:11:37,941
I don't know. I just want to make sure.

1718
01:11:38,241 --> 01:11:42,511
Does she want to leave some room for someone else?

1719
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:44,611
Do I have to suffer this badly?

1720
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:46,411
It's overwhelming.

1721
01:11:48,921 --> 01:11:51,380
(At that moment, a new card arrives.)

1722
01:11:51,381 --> 01:11:54,191
Today, the women will pick their dates.

1723
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:56,461
Who do you want to get to know more?

1724
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:58,561
Ask the person out on a date after 30 minutes.

1725
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:00,130
I was relieved.

1726
01:12:00,131 --> 01:12:03,131
I could do what I wanted to do more freely.

1727
01:12:04,431 --> 01:12:06,501
I'm nervous about this.

1728
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:07,831
Are you nervous?

1729
01:12:08,471 --> 01:12:09,941
I'm nervous in a different way. Do you get it?

1730
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:11,740
Which way?

1731
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:14,141
You can never know what's in someone's heart.

1732
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,411
I wonder who Ji Eun will ask to go on a date.

1733
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:19,680
(When the date begins, )

1734
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:22,681
(the atmosphere shifts again.)

1735
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:27,150
(You know what?)

1736
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:28,820
(I actually know someone really great.)

1737
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:30,790
(I’d love to introduce you this time.)

1738
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,791
(Just open your heart a little.)

1739
01:12:32,991 --> 01:12:35,831
(You won’t regret meeting them.)

1740
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:38,031
(Date My Friend)
