00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,620
I told you not to quit.

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,720
Boss...

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,160
I said I need you.

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,040
Don't work anywhere else.

 Episode 10, Hello, My Love

64
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,920
 Producer: Lee Gun Young, Kim Mi Jin, Hwang Hyuk

65
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,890
Boss! It isn't fully dried yet, 
how can you eat it all?

66
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,390
It tastes best when it's half dried.

67
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,720
Do you want one too?

68
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,430
This is good.

69
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,560
I told you so.

70
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,290
- Boss, let me have a row of half-dried persimmon.
- What?

71
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:08,360
Just give me one.
I'll give you a feast in return.

72
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,220
Grandpa, it's only half-dried so fully
 dry it on the balcony before you eat it.

73
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,740
Who makes dried persimmon
 using sweet permission?

74
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,030
You use astringent persimmon
 to make dried persimmon.

75
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,260
That way it's less 
sweet and slightly bitter.

76
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,230
Life is like that too.

77
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,770
You can't just eat astringent 
persimmon because of its bitterness,

78
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,600
but it's more flavorful
 and precious once dried.

79
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,670
Just eat what I give you. I'm going to take it back!

80
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,860
You punk, how are you supposed to take back what you gave.

81
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,520
I love dried persimmon.

82
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,510
You were just lecturing me
 about different types of persimmon.

83
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,880
Why did you move out? Did you feel uncomfortable?

84
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,260
My house is somewhere else, why would I stay here.

85
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,760
You and your attitude.

86
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,250
Okay, I'll take to Mr.Park and

87
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,950
exclude the second floor.
I guess I can lower his rent.

88
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,670
Really?

89
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,860
Who can win that temper of yours?

90
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,840
Grandpa

91
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,320
What?

92
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,680
Don't you have another box 
of persimmons? Can I have it?

93
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,150
I'll make you more dried persimmon.

94
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,620
-Bo Ah will love it right.
-Of course.

95
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,460
Bo Ah!

96
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,250
Bo Ah

97
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,430
What is it?

98
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,190
You can

99
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,640
quit working at the chicken restaurant.

100
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,990
What?

101
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,590
You said you quit because it
 was awkward with the Chef

102
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,150
but you couldn't find another
 job that paid 10,000 won hourly.

103
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,350
So you went back to work at the restaurant, without any other choice.

104
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,630
Right, I have to earn to survive.

105
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,030
So, we took care of it.

106
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,250
You don't have to 
work there anymore.

107
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,580
I'm really okay. 
The work is manageable.

108
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,850
So I asked for a

109
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,200
really good job.
 -Awesome,awesome

110
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,540
It's not often there's an opening

111
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,930
but my friend needs to
 find someone to replace him.

112
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,930
So I told him I have someone.

113
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,290
Guys, I don't like learning new things

114
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,280
I like doing what I'm used to. 
-No

115
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,850
You don't have to do anything.

116
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,800
There is nothing to learn

117
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,400
What are you talking about.

118
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,010
Its the best job, listen

119
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,630
What this means is

120
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,540
If you're sleepy sleep

121
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,090
If you're feeling frustrated walk, if you're legs hurt sit.

122
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,370
No, you can lay down too. Laying down will be better.

123
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,430
When people are passing by, if you feel a bit down, you can just curse at them.

124
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,470
-What?
-You can do it

125
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,530
That's what the work is, what do you think?

126
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,730
Its awesome right.

127
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,680
Even pay...

128
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,270
is higher than the chicken joint.

129
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,070
No, how could that be

130
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,040
It exists, a bum at an amusement park.

131
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,840
- What?
- You just dress up like a beggar

132
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,900
You can go around and do nothing

133
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,750
You said so yourself, that you don't like working hard

134
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,920
Its perfect for you, right. Its awesome.

135
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,790
Hey!

136
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,230
What are you thinking?

137
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,960
How could you tell your friend to be a bum? Does that make sense?

138
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,730
I'm not telling you to be a real bum

139
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,760
Forget it

140
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,560
I won't do it! I won't be a bum!

141
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,880
I won't do it!

142
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,640
What? It was a really good job though.

143
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,010
How unfortunate.

144
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,840
Why is she all twisted?

145
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,370
This is driving me crazy.

146
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,490
How can I tell them
 anything when they're like that?

147
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,170
Bo Ah, you're here?

148
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,150
Oh, you were there.

149
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,800
What's with the persimmons, did you buy them.

150
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,930
I told you

151
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,510
I would fill you with one line of half-dried persimmons.

152
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,320
What?

153
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,500
Go up.

154
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,830
Put my house up for sale.

155
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,700
What are you saying, you have so much time left on your lease.

156
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,800
It should sell soon, right?

157
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,050
Then..

158
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,920
Where will you live?

159
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,480
You know my situation.

160
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,770
Why are you in such a rush?

161
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,020
You have a lot of time left.

162
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,670
You can take it slow.

163
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,130
Boss

164
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,230
Can we keep

165
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,510
it a secret that we're dating.

166
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,270
Why?

167
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,700
I said I wouldn't lie to you, so I'll be honest.

168
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,640
Remember I told you I applied for 
this job to make your store go out of business?

169
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,370
Yes.

170
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,450
I didn't do it by myself, I asked my friends for help.

171
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,160
My friends are really loyal.

172
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,490
That's why they went 
out of their way to help me.

173
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,720
But if they hear that I like you

174
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,460
what will they think?

175
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,170
Thank you Bo Ah.

176
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,510
What?

177
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,290
For what?

178
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,020
It was something difficult to say, but you told me the truth.

179
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:39,190
I think they will want you to do the same for them.

180
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,250
I know, but I don't have the courage.

181
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,420
But I won't wait too long.

182
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,890
I'll tell them when I
feel it's the right time.

183
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,340
Let's keep it a secret until then.

184
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,500
Okay, let's do that.

185
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,790
You can't make it obvious at the restaurant.

186
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,220
Understand?

187
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay.

188
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,880
You mean it right. If you make it obvious I will get mad.

189
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,370
I said I understand.

190
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,670
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

191
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,410
The customer asked for extra sauce.

192
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,980
I put in a lot, should I put some more?

193
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,150
Okay.

194
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,170
What is it?

195
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,260
Did you fight with Bo Ah again?

196
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,260
No, why would we fight?

197
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,440
Try and get along. You guys seemed fine

198
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,450
What are you doing
 in such a small store?

199
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,860
Don't worry. Bo Ah and I get along fine.

200
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,600
Delivery.

201
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,280
Boss, You're not busy right now are you.

202
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,170
No, why?

203
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,850
Come out and talk with me for a second.

204
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,660
Did you forget you're promise.

205
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,600
What promise?

206
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,290
We agreed to keep it a secret.

207
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,500
What am I supposed to do if you keep making it obvious.

208
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,970
Did I do something wrong?

209
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,990
Your eyes. Why are you 
looking at me like that?

210
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,520
What's wrong with my eyes?

211
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,080
Honey is falling from your eyes.

212
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,400
Is that how you should be looking at an employee? It isn't.

213
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,070
Don't worry.

214
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,500
-Nothing..
-What are you doing there?

215
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,520
You're the worst!

216
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,320
What?

217
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,320
Did something happen?

218
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,120
No, nothing happened.

219
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,430
What would happen, nothing happened.

220
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,650
Mom, aren't you overdoing it?

221
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,190
Do you thing you can last if you keep doing this?

222
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,600
Wash up, and change you're clothes.

223
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,900
Take it easy and just let him win.

224
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,870
The line is too long at your chicken joint,

225
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,560
Choi Go's store

226
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,820
has a lot of customers too.
His business won't fail.

227
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,650
You'll ruin your health, trying to tame the kid.

228
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,560
Mom, just a second.

229
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,990
  My Granddaughter

230
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,710
Hello, what is it Grandpa?

231
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,710
Hey

232
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,720
You said you would get a day off tomorrow.

233
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,440
Drop by the house.

234
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,940
I have something to tell you.

235
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,250
What is it? Is it an urgent matter?

236
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,340
You could say it is.

237
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,940
I have plans so I can't go tommorow.

238
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,400
I'll stop by before opening the store.

239
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,460
Sure.

240
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,020
What did he say?

241
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,430
I don't know, he probably wanted to nag. Anyway

242
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,360
Tomorrow we get up at 7 am.

243
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,450
Its 3 am now, do we only get to sleep 4 hours?

244
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,260
Of course, it's our first date.

245
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,960
I waited so long for a day off.

246
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,020
Good, tomorrow morning at 7.

247
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,820
First

248
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,430
We're going to watch a movie at this movie theater.

249
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,540
We'll eat lunch at this restaurant.

250
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,280
Instead of watching a movie there, there is one closer.

251
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,940
We can't go there. Everyone in the neighborhood goes there.

252
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,220
Are you ok with pasta for lunch.

253
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,830
Of course.

254
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,790
Min Ar had a blind date here

255
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,880
and said the pasta here was so good.

256
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,090
I really wanted to go here.

257
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,610
If we're watching a movie here and going all the way here

258
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,370
lunch time will be over.

259
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,200
I already took care of that.

260
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,430
If we walk 150 meters 
from the movie theater,

261
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,590
There will be a bike rental.

262
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,210
We will rent a bike

263
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,380
Ride it, and go.

264
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,270
How far?

265
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,470
Until the subway.

266
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,720
You can ride a bike now.

267
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,890
Of course, you taught me.

268
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,460
If you get off at exit two,

269
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,640
you'll see platform 3-1.

270
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,010
We're going to go further
 and get on platform 6-4.

271
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,300
That way you'll see the 
escalator as soon as you get off.

272
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,500
We will arrive before break time.

273
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,150
Wow, you planned it so detailed.

274
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,950
Of course, look forward to it.

275
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,540
It will be a perfect day.

276
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Your hands started shaking after the accident?

277
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,860
Yeah.

278
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,620
It doesn't usually shake, but when you try to do something it does?

279
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,030
Try writing, your name or anything.

280
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,930
Is there nothing that can be done about it?

281
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,210
It won't be easy.

282
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,310
I'm sure you've
 received treatment elsewhere.

283
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,680
What did they say there?

284
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,520
They don't know the cause. 
They just told me to take it easy and take medication.

285
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,330
Things like that.

286
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,210
That is all I can tell you as well.

287
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,670
Then it's fine, I didn't expect anything in the first place.

288
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,350
When does your hand shake the most?

289
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,450
When I cook.

290
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,630
There are instances where you heal
 by facing the situations that make your hands shake.

291
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,140
Keep cooking, it's fine if your hand shakes.

292
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,440
It's even better if someone is watching.

293
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,700
What is it? Bo Ah

294
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,390
Something bad happened.

295
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,610
What is it?

296
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,970
We over slept.

297
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,260
What should we do?

298
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,010
What? When did the time pass so quickly?

299
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,470
I'm sorry.

300
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,980
I should have woken up first.

301
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,790
The movie is already over by now.

302
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,730
Lunch time at the restaurant will be over

303
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,330
We should change plans.

304
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,730
No! Hurry and get changed.

305
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,200
Yes.

306
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,910
Should we just take a taxi?

307
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,040
We have to ride bikes.

308
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,010
I planned the most scenic route.

309
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,690
What should we do then?

310
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,340
Hurry, and catch a taxi.

311
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,300
Taxi, Taxi!

312
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,040
When I think about it now.

313
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,690
The moments that change our lives

314
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,540
are the little things.

315
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,020
What are you talking about?

316
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,570
When I was working for the social report show,

317
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,710
the reason I applied for the restaurant program,

318
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,840
It was because of blood sausage soup.

319
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,910
Blood sausage soup?

320
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,000
Yeah.

321
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,160
I tailed someone in order to expose their corruption

322
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,840
and they were a regular at a blood sausage soup place.

323
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,400
But, I ate that restaurants blood sausage soup

324
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,250
and forgot about the corruption
 case because it was so good.

325
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,870
What?

326
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,790
It was the first time I felt happy since I started to work at the broadcasting station.

327
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,340
After eating good food.

328
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,440
So you were reunited with Choi Go because of the blood sausage soup.

329
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,580
Exactly, if only I didn't eat that soup.

330
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,790
Even the oriental medicine 
school has the "Heo Jun" class.

331
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,810
What is that?

332
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,820
It applies to students who majored in 
oriental medicine after watching the drama "Heo Jun".

333
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,380
Passing on dentistry and medical school.

334
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,020
Isn't it peculiar?

335
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,170
Exactly.

336
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:33,610
A person's life can be changed with the little things.

337
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,150
We don't know how this glass of wine will change our lives.

338
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,160
Well, not to that extent.

339
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,930
It's empty, Should we get one more?

340
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,940
Sounds good.

341
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,810
Excuse me.

342
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,220
What is this?

343
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,790
Nothing went as planned, we suffered all day.

344
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,250
Today wasn't fun was it?

345
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,890
No, I liked it.

346
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,560
What is there to like?

347
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,760
We didn't get to see the movie, ride bikes

348
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,080
We didn't even eat where we wanted,
and where we did eat the food was gross.

349
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,680
It was pretty bad there, spicy and salty

350
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,010
Right?

351
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:42,250
It was all ruined, what is there to like?

352
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,890
What is wrong with a bad date? My restaurant almost went out of business.

353
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,180
You said you would stop talking about that.

354
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,360
You always bring it up.

355
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,850
Are you enjoying this?

356
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,230
You're having fun teasing me.

357
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,590
It is obvious?

358
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,600
Boss

359
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,950
Should

360
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,100
we just go home?

361
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,910
Already? We didn't get to do anything today.

362
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,490
♫   I’m getting a strange energy
Awakening my lurking dream   ♫

363
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,630
♫   I’ve come forth to the world   ♫

364
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,220
Let's not rush it.

365
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,420
♫   I don’t really know myself either   ♫

366
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:33,790
We'll be together the next vacation, and the one after that.

367
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:38,280
We can do everything slowly one by one

368
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,660
Still, it was our first date

369
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,460
I wanted it to be special

370
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,620
This moment is special to me.

371
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,340
Aren't we just strangers if 
only special moments are expected?

372
00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:00,310
I'm happy just being with you

373
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:05,590
What?

374
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,630
Let's take it step by step.

375
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,300
Slowly.

376
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,430
As long as the restaurant doesn't go down

377
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,520
Seriously

378
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,890
♫   Till then, watch over me   ♫

379
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:21,980
Let's go

380
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,590
♫   I’ll be here for dreaming   ♫

381
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,050
We just need to catch this.

382
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,120
Seriously.

383
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,780
He's the problem

384
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,890
The games extended again?

385
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,760
How come this baseball game is taking this long to finish?

386
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,690
Should I bring more squid?

387
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,910
Yes, grill 2 more. This doesn't seem like it's going to finish soon.

388
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,350
Wow!

389
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,250
Excuse me

390
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,300
Yes

391
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,350
You have to let go of my hand now, we're in our neighborhood now.

392
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,090
Then...

393
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,920
Can we go like this for a little longer?

394
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,050
Sure, my friends should be off work already

395
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,240
We won

396
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,340
We won

397
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,060
We won, we won, we won

398
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,180
We won, we won, we won, we won

399
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,700
No, how could he hit that?

400
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,680
Even I can throw better than that.

401
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,760
What a joke. Move, move

402
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,010
move, move, I'm closing the store

403
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,450
I should have went home to sleep

404
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,960
At least root for the
team that has a chance.

405
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,620
Like me.

406
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,260
Should I let go of your hand now?

407
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,970
- We're at the alley now.
- Sure.

408
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,600
Yes.

409
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,730
It's dangerous around the corner.

410
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:14,270
If you don't want to, should we go around the neighborhood one more time

411
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,110
Should we?

412
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,450
So, are you treating me?

413
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,900
They should've caught the
 ball so it'd be a third strike.

414
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,860
Can I get something expensive?

415
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,120
-Can you?
-Hey

416
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,820
What?

417
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,580
Look at that

418
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,940
Why, are you jealous?

419
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,980
No, not that

420
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,420
Doesn't that girl seem familiar

421
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,960
You're right

422
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,300
Bo Ah has that same outfit

423
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,540
You're right

424
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,270
It's not only the clothes...

425
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:04,340
Her hair, and height are the same

426
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,610
It can't be

427
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,390
Of course it can't be Bo Ah

428
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,240
Doesn't that guy seem familiar

429
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,820
You're right, the only tall guys in this neighborhood

430
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,530
work at the chicken restaurant

431
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,730
No way!

432
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,000
Should we check?

433
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,720
How?

434
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,690
Just call her, Seo Bo Ah

435
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,810
Why did they stop?

436
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:40,220
What should we do, I think we got caught

437
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,060
They probably didn't see our faces

438
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,140
Should we escape this way?

439
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,810
They called my name, I think we got caught

440
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:49,050
That's Oh Yeong Ho's voice.

441
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,490
Bo Ah!

442
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,630
You're Bo Ah right.

443
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,440
You are Bo Ah, Seo Bo Ah!

444
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,030
Stop there!

445
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,430
Bo Ah!

446
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,460
We got away, right?

447
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,360
I don't know, they didn't see your face right?

448
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,450
Of course. 
I covered my face.

449
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,380
Should we go in?

450
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,240
Yeah.
We can just deny it, right?

451
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,350
Deny what?

452
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:38,220
While I was chasing you, I realized I didn't need to.

453
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:46,110
If it's Bo Ah, this is 
the only place she'd come.

454
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,600
What is this?

455
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,690
Guys

456
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,720
Hi

457
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,630
I said I'll just go

458
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,580
The substitute driver will be here soon, so just get a ride.

459
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,680
I'll drop you off.

460
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,080
It'll drag on the floor.

461
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,370
Who called for a sub driver?

462
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,270
What are you doing here?

463
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,180
The thing is

464
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,880
Hold on. Should we stay here?

465
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,620
Why?

466
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,680
Say that again.

467
00:41:53,690 --> 00:42:01,180
What did you say Bo Ah and this chicken shop's owner is doing?

468
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,200
They're d-dating.

469
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,780
Seo Bo Ah, what nonsense are they talking about?

470
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,980
I'm sorry, Min Ah.

471
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,940
Why are you sorry? For what?

472
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,980
They must be mistaken so just tell us.

473
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,760
What the situation is.

474
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,260
I like the owner.

475
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,130
I wanted to tell you guys.

476
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,550
I couldn't find the courage.

477
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:55,060
Really? I guess that's possible.

478
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:04,170
Men and women don't really choose who to fall in love with.

479
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,170
Love even surpasses race and nations.

480
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,220
Min Ah.

481
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,940
But friendship doesn't.

482
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,830
- I can't be your friend anymore. 
 - Hey!

483
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,370
Why are you doing this?

484
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,950
You guys should think hard, too.

485
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,430
Stay friends with Bo Ah if you can understand this.

486
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,470
Then I will be done with you guys, too.

487
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,690
Because I cannot understand you staying friends with her.

488
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,840
Min Ah, I'm really sorry.

489
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,950
But...

490
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,170
But what?

491
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:13,820
What will you say? What could you say?

492
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,160
Since when did you start liking him?

493
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,760
It couldn't be yesterday. Or the day before that.

494
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,220
A week ago? It's not, right?

495
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:44,550
If you felt that way, you should have told us!

496
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:50,170
We look so stupid because of you! And we all suffered!

497
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,760
We even did bad things!

498
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,430
You...

499
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,920
You watched us do all that.

500
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,880
What were your thoughts while watching us?

501
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,880
What friend?

502
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,410
What a joke.

503
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,120
Min Ah!

504
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,360
Manager Hwang!

505
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,750
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

506
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,690
You two be happy.

507
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,650
Hwang Min Ah!

508
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,190
Bo Ah.

509
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,900
Bo Ah.

510
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,390
Yes?

511
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,140
Why don't you just go and get some rest for today?

512
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,980
No, I'm alright.

513
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,560
Go upstairs.

514
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:22,360
I'm ordering you as your
 boss, not your boyfriend.

515
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,760
Isn't it upsetting for you guys?

516
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,670
It is.

517
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:46,380
But, I feel like it
 must've been hard on Bo Ah.

518
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,100
Sure, I'm the b**** here.

519
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,790
That's not what I'm saying.

520
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,840
We have a long history,

521
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,790
I'm saying we can't 
not see each other forever.

522
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,720
Yes, this is the real estate office.

523
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,130
Yes.

524
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,610
Apartment deposit rental?

525
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,030
 Missed call- Evil landlord

526
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:48,270
Grandpa, I said I'd drop by today,

527
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,220
but I completely forgot.

528
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,290
I'll drop by tomorrow.
Sorry.

529
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,550
This way, this way.

530
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,880
Myeong Dong?

531
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,260
Where did he go and why
 isn't he answering his phone?

532
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,990
What's going on?

533
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,860
Oh, well.

534
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,390
No, no. 
Give me a minute.

535
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,090
I know the tenant well.

536
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,030
It's okay.

537
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,560
Come inside.

538
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,540
Myeong Dong, are you home?

539
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,190
I'm coming in.

540
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,700
Come inside.

541
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,290
Take your time and look around.

542
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,560
The flooring and 
wallpaper are all new.

543
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,440
Look around.

544
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,170
Myeong Dong.
Oh, no!

545
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,850
What happened?

546
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,610
Myeong Dong, wake up!

547
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,650
Call 911!

548
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,460
Myeong Dong!

549
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,550
 Old Real Estate Agent

550
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:51,760
 Old Real Estate Agent

551
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,990
Bo Ah!

552
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,220
Boss.

553
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,610
Grandpa.

554
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:55,050
Why were you ignoring your calls?

555
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,280
Grandpa? Grandpa?

556
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,760
Grandpa, are you okay?
Wake up.

557
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,930
What happened?

558
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,380
What happened?

559
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,690
He's been sick for a while.

560
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:28,810
He said he was going to tell Bo Ah, 
but he kept pushing it back.

561
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:34,940
He said you'd worry 
because his illness isn't curable.

562
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,660
Enough with your nonsense.

563
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,540
Grandpa!

564
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,580
Don't raise your voice.

565
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,500
My ears hurt.

566
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:08,890
 Hospital

567
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,870
Did you eat?

568
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,320
Granpa, are you okay?

569
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,420
I feel better after getting good sleep.

570
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:43,450
Grandpa, why didn't you tell me?

571
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,760
You should've told me you were ill.

572
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,020
It's not like I'll 
be cured if I tell you.

573
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,270
Regardless, you should've 
tried everything you could.

574
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:59,710
It's not even curable with treatment.

575
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:02,130
Why should I spend my money?

576
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:04,820
Are you kidding me?

577
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:09,740
What about me? 
You should try to live.

578
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:14,030
I didn't even know and worried you.

579
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,680
That's how children are.

580
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:26,040
You weren't a bad child.

581
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,350
Grandpa...

582
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:35,810
The real estate agent 
said he'd take care of the house.

583
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,500
Use the funds to
 pay the inheritance tax.

584
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,910
Use the remaining
 funds for your wedding.

585
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:48,020
What are you saying?
Are you planning to die?

586
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,840
Are you trying to die,
 leaving me all alone?

587
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,870
After you pay the taxes, 
the chicken store building is yours.

588
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:00,750
You'll be able to live off it.

589
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:09,150
That's not what's important.

590
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,110
You have to take
 care of your health...

591
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:14,030
Everyone dies,

592
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:18,090
why are you
 making such a big deal?

593
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,930
After all these years,

594
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:27,180
I've realized money
 is better than bad parents.

595
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,930
The building will be your parent,

596
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:36,460
in place of me.

597
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:46,500
I told you I'd
 make you dried persimmons.

598
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,250
You said you like persimmons.

599
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,590
Thanks for everything.

600
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:21,900
My son suffered too much,
 because of my cursed life.

601
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,590
I don't even know if he's alive.

602
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,030
He lost his wife at a young age.

603
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:40,790
I was able to have a
 happy life thanks to you,

604
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:45,310
living like a human being.

605
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:49,210
Grandpa...

606
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:57,010
You're going to
 keep your promise, right?

607
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,240
What promise?

608
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,240
That you'll live as a good person.

609
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,490
I will.

610
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:18,700
I'll be sure 
not to be an embarrassment.

611
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,740
I'll live a good life.

612
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,420
I brought some clothes for him.

613
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,930
Sure.

614
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,290
Would you like something to drink?

615
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,600
No, I'm okay.

616
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,190
Grandpa, do you want something?

617
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,850
How about some citron tea?

618
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,010
Grandpa?

619
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,060
Grandpa...

620
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,350
Grandpa!

621
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,590
Grandpa! Grandpa!

622
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,500
Grandpa!

623
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,750
Grandpa!

624
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,190
Grandpa!

625
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,820
Grandpa...

626
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:41,150

627
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:50,040
♫   Will you be my
one and only universe?  ♫

628
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,390
♫   So a pretty flower that resembles you   ♫

629
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:59,170
♫   Can bloom the cracks of my heart   ♫

630
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,100
 Poor Bo Ah.

631
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,590
 She's all alone in this word.

632
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,030
 What's okay?

633
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,390
 Just cry if you want to.

634
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:10,830
 I thought my dad
 would be a horned monster.

635
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:11,970
 Do you know me?

636
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,920
Long time no see, my daughter.

637
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,220
 Bo Ah's drawing webtoons again?

638
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,790
 I'll continue to be by your side.

639
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,850
 Thanks, Boss.

640
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:23,110
A building owner has to make a living, too.
This is unfair.

641
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:25,760
Get out of my building.

642
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,050
♫   The darkness leaves as I dream
 of your eyes more blinding than jewels   ♫
