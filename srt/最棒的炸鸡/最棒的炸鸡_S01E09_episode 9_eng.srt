 Park Sun Ho

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,540
 Kim So Hye

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,630
 Joo Woo Jae

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,910

6
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,750
You thief!

7
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,210
Grandpa.

8
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,950
Did I wake you up?

9
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,590
What are you doing at this time of the night, like a freaking thief?

10
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,090
I'm unpacking.

11
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,470
You told me to come back.

12
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Grandpa.

13
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,260
I quit working at the chicken restaurant.

14
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,040
 Episode 9 
Moving Day

15
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,700
 Boss, I'm sorry.

16
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,900
 I was thinking about it all night

17
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,550
 and I think it will be best for me to quit.

18
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,290
Bo Ah.

19
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,530
 Since I can't take the furniture anyway,

20
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,030
 just use it yourself.

21
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,070
 I will take the rest of my things bit by bit.

22
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,170
 I should've left sooner.

23
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,510
 I'm sorry about that too.

24
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,740
 Goodbye.

25
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,830
Sir! Sorry but we're on suspension.

26
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,410
I'm not a customer.

27
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,020
I came to meet the owner.

28
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,290
He isn't here right now.

29
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,220
Could you tell me what the issue is?

30
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,110
Well.

31
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,280
Where did he go?

32
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,440
- Who is it? 
 - Elder.

33
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,210
It's me, the chicken restaurant owner.

34
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,490
Elder, are you inside?

35
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,000
Bo Ah?

36
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,070
Bo Ah, you're inside right?

37
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,940
Bo Ah!

38
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,260
Who the heck put this here?

39
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,070
Bo Ah!

40
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,540
Bo Ah.

41
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,410
Boss, why did you come here again?

42
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,320
Can you open the door? Let's talk face to face.

43
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,230
I didn't have the guts to see your face, so I left a note and left quietly.

44
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,240
What am I supposed to do if you come here without any notice?

45
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,220
Bo Ah, you know it wasn't your fault.

46
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,290
It's all my mom's doing. Why must you be like this?

47
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,760
You don't know what I did.

48
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,930
Just go, Boss.

49
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,930
Bo Ah.

50
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,810
I feel uncomfortable, so I can't do this anymore.

51
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,030
I'm closing the door. Watch your fingers.

52
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,860
Why did you leave the store and come here?

53
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,820
Elder.

54
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,510
Let's go inside. I wanted to see you anyway.

55
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,210
The thing is...

56
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,370
What is this?

57
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,820
I said to move back in, not to take over!

58
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,760
Open the door!

59
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,490
What on earth? Geez!

60
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,810
I don't even care what my parents think of me.

61
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,350
What is it?

62
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,480
We're totally slaves now.

63
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,010
What are you saying?

64
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,790
What? There was that chef.

65
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,350
Whether he's Andus Kangâ€”

66
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,190
Or Andre Kang.

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,910
What about him?

68
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,910
There, there, there. Bang, bang, bang.

69
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,990
Okay. Let's go, more more, more!

70
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,500
Oh, you're here, Chef.

71
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,390
Flour and milk and...

72
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,630
Flour and...

73
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,890
I see you need milk, too.

74
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,950
One large bunch of chives.

75
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,080
Yes, and some onions.

76
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,940
Our store's onions are

77
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,950
quite excellent.

78
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,370
Well,

79
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,850
do you need anything else?

80
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,260
Well, I...

81
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,160
There's not much to buy here.

82
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,520
Try to have more of a variety of things.

83
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,760
Yes, yes. If you need anything else,

84
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,260
I'll order it right away.

85
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,470
Excuse me, hey!

86
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,550
How will you pay?

87
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,090
Put it on the store's tab.

88
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,900
Deliver them by two o'clock.

89
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,460
Oh, delivery.

90
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,820
Yes, get back safely.

91
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,220
How humiliating.

92
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,470
Hey!

93
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,980
You'll just take it like that?

94
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,730
Then what should we do?

95
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,690
He's got our weakness.

96
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,780
If we make a wrong move,

97
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,970
Bo Ah could suffer in the middle.

98
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,460
What did he do to you?

99
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,150
I...

100
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,580
was sweeping in front of our store.

101
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,690
By any chance, did he force you to sweep in front of their shop, too?

102
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,110
No, it's not that.

103
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,890
While he was passing by

104
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,300
he said, "We should sweep in front of our shop, too."

105
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,660
Then he left.

106
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,250
It's getting clean.

107
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,720
It looks great.

108
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,060
I said I could tell Baek Ki Beom to do it.

109
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,600
No way.

110
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,780
We're already cleaning anyway, so we're just doing it.

111
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,440
Of course.

112
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,400
Even when Bo Ah was running a bathhouse,

113
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,600
we swept up to here every day.

114
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,280
Is that right?

115
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,900
Wait a minute.

116
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,350
Are those leaves, too?

117
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,240
I think over there needs sweeping as well.

118
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,210
Yes.

119
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,140
We're going there now.

120
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,490
Aigoo, this is productive.

121
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,360
Hey, what is wrong with you guys?

122
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,810
Are you stupid? A pushover?

123
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,760
If you start to give in like that, he'll climb on top of you.

124
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,150
What will you do then?

125
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,750
Will you continue to cater to that...

126
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,270
Oh my, Chef?

127
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,500
Hello.

128
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,530
The weather today is great, right?

129
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,930
It really feels like fall now.

130
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,810
Whats wrong with her?

131
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,940
Is she two-faced or what?

132
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,600
But what brings you by all of a sudden?

133
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,410
I was on my way to the real estate office.

134
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,700
I wanted to see some rooms.

135
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,440
A room?

136
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,200
I thought that a thief broke in to steal something in the early morning, but she stole the house.

137
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,110
Oh, right.

138
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,440
What?

139
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,510
What is this?

140
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,390
It's for a free exam coupon with the herb doctor.

141
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,510
I was thankful for you giving me more time on the rent.

142
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,020
Okay.

143
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,710
But, what happened?

144
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,120
Did she quit or get fired?

145
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
The thing is...

146
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,130
Just tell it like it is. I won't nitpick at silly things.

147
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,830
Did she cause a problem?

148
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,250
Honestly, my mom opened a chicken restaurant in front of our store.

149
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,430
What nonsense is that?

150
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,630
Come in, take off your shoes.

151
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,740
The bathroom.

152
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,160
The living room, and the bedroom

153
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,310
What do you think?

154
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,500
You cannot find a room like this in this neighborhood at this price.

155
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,040
I requested it especially for you.

156
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,650
I don't like it here.

157
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,150
What?

158
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,230
No, it's not newly constructed. But the conditionâ€”

159
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,970
Next.

160
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,640
That punk.

161
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,410
Is he lying about renting and just taunting me?

162
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,770
I should just...

163
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,520
What are you doing?

164
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,340
I'm coming now, Chef

165
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,760
So that's what happened.

166
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,630
I will do all I can to make her come back.

167
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,650
Don't worry.

168
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,680
What are you going to do?

169
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,450
Pardon?

170
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,920
It seems like she doesn't even want to see your face. How can you calm her?

171
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,440
How can you convince her to go to work?

172
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,400
Can I have two boxes of persimmons?

173
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,020
Yes.

174
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,830
Hyung.

175
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,160
What are you doing today?

176
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,810
I'm just on my way to my store. Why?

177
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,750
Did you eat lunch?

178
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,510
Not yet.

179
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,610
Mom, said to come over and eat.

180
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,170
What? Why would I eat lunch with Mom in this situation?

181
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,890
Right.

182
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,770
 Alright, it's okay. I was just mentioning it.

183
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,390
I'll tell Mom.

184
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,130
Hold on.

185
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,270
No, I'm coming now.

186
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,150
Thank you for the food.

187
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,360
Thank you for the food.

188
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,280
The restaurant business makes it hard to have a meal on time together.

189
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,740
This is no way for a person to live.

190
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,230
It was the same when I worked at an office job, Mom, because there was so much work.

191
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,590
Business is going great because my son groomed it so well.

192
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,980
But what's the point?

193
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,240
You work all day and night, without weekends.

194
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,930
I did some rough calculations, and

195
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,960
after deducting wages, supply costs, and the considerable rent,

196
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,340
isn't this like working to benefit others?

197
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,550
Only the building owner gets to benefit.

198
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,120
Working at an office is also to benefit others.

199
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,500
Only the CEO benefits from it and you could get fired.

200
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,730
What is wrong with you guys?

201
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,210
Can I eat?

202
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,460
Alright, let's be frank.

203
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,820
This opportunity.

204
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,870
What do you think will happen if you open the store at the end of your leave?

205
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,910
Do you think your business will go well?

206
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,940
Thanks to you, it won't do as well as before.

207
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,890
At least you're not completely out of touch with reality.

208
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,760
Even now, you should pass the restaurant to me and start looking for a job.

209
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,810
I'll operate it with intent to expand, get a lot of premium on it, and then pull out.

210
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:14,000
I think you're mistaken. I didn't open up the restaurant to make money.

211
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,650
What?

212
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,330
Making money is definitely important. We need it to live and eat.

213
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,720
But I didn't leave my job just because I wanted more money.

214
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,590
That's not why I started my own business.

215
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,920
If it's not for money, is it for

216
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,900
fulfillment? The customer's happiness?

217
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,330
Are you trying to use such ridiculous nonsense?

218
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,470
Can I not do that?

219
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,330
Are you a kid?

220
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,060
I really like chicken.

221
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,440
I like people enjoying the chicken I make

222
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,650
so I will last longer than you will since it's something I like.

223
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,820
I came here today to tell you that.

224
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,990
Right, it's like that at first

225
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,650
because you're young. Because it's your first time.

226
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,330
But, why would an initial intention be called that?

227
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,200
Because it's the first time.

228
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,020
Do you think it would be the same after a year or two?

229
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,900
The work is hard, sales are down, and the bird flu shakes the store.

230
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,010
That's what business is like.

231
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,310
Never being able to eat at set meal times. Catering to customers' need.

232
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,660
There's nothing good about that for you to join in.

233
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,810
- Mom. 
 - Oh, right.

234
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,090
If you had listened to words, I wouldn't have started this mess.

235
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,050
I have to go tend to the store.

236
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,960
Can I eat now?

237
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,750
Yeah, let's eat.

238
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,820
Be understanding with Mom.

239
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,710
How can I understand this?

240
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,430
She stole my recipe and opened up a store next to mine.

241
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:15,430
It's true that Mom is being extreme, but she wouldn't be if you had started any other kind of business.

242
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,910
Mom was restaurant staff for a long time

243
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,750
because Dad wasn't making money while trying to become a professor.

244
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,730
Don't you remember?

245
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,890
I remember. Why wouldn't I?

246
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,490
Hello, yes?

247
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,000
 - Ahjumma?  
- Yes?

248
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,690
Two orders of spicy pork.

249
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,960
Two spicy pork?

250
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,750
Anything else you need?

251
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,670
More anchovies.

252
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,050
- Anchovies?
 - And another soju.

253
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,630
Soju.

254
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,400
 - You don't need beer?
 - No.

255
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,160
 Okay. I'll put make the spicy pork yummy.

256
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,260
Thank you.

257
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:17,680
As a mother, it's not acceptable because she knows how difficult it is.

258
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,740
Don't try to win with Mom.

259
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,240
I tried, but her motherly love is too strong.

260
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,050
Take your shoes off.

261
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,630
The bathroom.

262
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,380
The lights.

263
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,780
What do you think?

264
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,470
There's no way you don't like this place.

265
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,860
The security deposit normally starts at  ten-million won,

266
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,310
but I got it lowered because I'm close with the owner.

267
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,490
They'll lower the security deposit to three-million won.

268
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,280
This isn't impressive.

269
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,000
What did you say?

270
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,810
I say it isn't impressive. Any other options?

271
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,990
Excuse me. Do I look easy to you?

272
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,690
What?

273
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,560
Why isn't this place impressive?

274
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,420
Tell me. This is a new building and a high floor.

275
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,650
There's a viewand it's facing north.

276
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,420
There's an AC, heating, and a washer!

277
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,160
Plus, there's an elevator!

278
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,530
Are you trying to screw me over?

279
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,920
No, Iâ€”

280
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,020
Right, I know I did wrong.

281
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,490
I know I did wrong, but is it okay to play with a person?

282
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,260
Because of you,

283
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,780
I'm selling parts and making calls...

284
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,970
Electric range.

285
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,060
What?

286
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:20,730
You asked me why I don't like it. It's because of the electric range.

287
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,600
What?

288
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,360
- Grandpa, what are those? 
- What do you mean, what are those? They're persimmons

289
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,560
Geezer Oh sent this. It's his new crop.

290
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,990
He sent too much.

291
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,460
Take this to the restaurant owner.

292
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,010
What?

293
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,730
No, I can't go there.

294
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,200
Why can't you go? Go now. The balcony is too messy (to store these).

295
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,000
It's hard for me to face my boss right now.

296
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,460
When did you start caring for your neighbors so much?

297
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,110
This is too much persimmon.

298
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,790
Just leave it. I'll eat it all.

299
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,690
I'll eat two a day.

300
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,720
I'm collecting rent two months later because you told me to,

301
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,340
yet you can't do one chore for me?

302
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,970
What, what?

303
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,430
I'm going to tell him to pay rent this month.

304
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,030
Okay, okay.

305
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,600
I can just go,

306
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,380
but how will I carry this? It's heavy.

307
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,490
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

308
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,650
 - Hello? 
 - Ki Beom.

309
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,350
- Come out for a second.
 - Come out where?

310
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,610
I'm in front of the store so come out for a second.

311
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,520
I already left work.

312
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,760
Already?

313
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,730
There wasn't much to do,

314
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,920
so they told us to leave earlier.

315
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,190
Our boss should be there. Is he not there?

316
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,990
Forget it.

317
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,310
He'll probably see it when he comes down.

318
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,790
Bo Ah.

319
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,130
Grandpa told me to give this to you.

320
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,150
What is it?

321
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,040
It's persimmons. We had a lot so I brought you some.

322
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,200
I'll be leaving now.

323
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,050
Bo Ah, hold on.

324
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,070
I need to talk with you.

325
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,660
I already said everything. What is there to talk about?

326
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,730
Then forget about talking.

327
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,160
Help me with something.

328
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,770
What?

329
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,250
With what?

330
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,740
This place is too run down, right?

331
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,670
Its nice, I'll take it.

332
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,480
What?

333
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,750
It has a gas stove, and the sink is wide.

334
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,770
This is good.

335
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,180
You saw that one room, the one before,

336
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,960
and the one before that,

337
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,290
yet you want to lease this place?

338
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,180
I just said so.

339
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,900
Don't you see the mold?

340
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,980
This is semi-basement floor, so you don't get much sun.

341
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,200
Are you really going with this place?

342
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,110
There isn't much of a difference in rent.

343
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,020
The fire is strong and controls look easy.

344
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,160
I've already decided, I'll take it

345
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,790
When I was young,

346
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,890
my mom didn't allow me to have snacks.

347
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,720
As you know, my mom's a bit extreme.

348
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,940
Yes.

349
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,570
But whenever fall came,

350
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,940
she would make me dried persimmons.

351
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,490
My brother and I would eat them all

352
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,020
before they even finished drying.

353
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,770
Boss.

354
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,360
You don't have to try so hard.

355
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,520
I should've told you from the start.

356
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,130
I didn't have the strength and couldn't do so.

357
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,770
I will actually quit,

358
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,740
so don't do this anymore.

359
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,100
Honestly, I can't understand why you're going this far.

360
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,060
You know that it wasn't your fault.

361
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,980
I'm leaving.

362
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,850
Bo Ah.

363
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,590
Don't try to understand.

364
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,640
Can't you just let me go?

365
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,530
If you keep being like this, it makes it harder for me.

366
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,580
What is bothering you so much?

367
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,020
You have to tell me for me to be able to understand

368
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,560
I did it.

369
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,000
What?

370
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,640
I did all of it.

371
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,360
It's all my fault.

372
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,910
Your business suspension

373
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,490
and giving out those awful flyers.

374
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,090
Entering the chicken competition,

375
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,290
- and ruining the soapâ€”
 - That...

376
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,230
I tried to close down the restaurant.

377
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,370
I started working here for that very reason.

378
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,910
Don't you know?

379
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,860
 I told you before,

380
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,290
 someon's trying to ruin your business.

381
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,570
I think

382
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,260
that it was Bo Ah.

383
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,350
Bo Ah, enough now.

384
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,570
 I have to win in order to market the store.

385
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,230
 Boss, I didn't see you that way,

386
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,720
 but are you trying to rig the competition?

387
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,910
 You have to win fair and square.

388
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,600
Bo Ah, what is this?

389
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,060
What do you think? Isn't it much better?

390
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,520
â™«   You warmly hug me   â™«

391
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,450
 You must think poorly of me.

392
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,900
 Why am I acting this way over this bathhouse,

393
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,000
 you can't understand, right?

394
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,010
 But this bathhouse that you're trying to take from me

395
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,410
 is all I have left.

396
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,000
 I gave up everything

397
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,990
 I wanted to do and become.

398
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,450
 It's all I have left.

399
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,210
 Am I not allowed to live like this?

400
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,780
 Why are people so cruel?

401
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:23,410
â™«   You look apalling in my dream   â™«

402
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,000
â™«   When I'm down   â™«

403
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,490
â™«   When I get sad, Lucky in my world   â™«

404
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,130
â™«   You hold me tight   â™«

405
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,280
â™«    like a dream   â™«

406
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,490
Open the door!

407
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,750
â™«   I'm so happy   â™«

408
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,460
You should come out and eat.

409
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,910
Are you still sleeping?

410
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,910
Punk.

411
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,670
â™«   I make another wish   â™«

412
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,860
Her old habits are coming out again.

413
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,810
Why is she acting like this?

414
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,500
I don't understand.

415
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,800
â™«   I always smile like this   â™«

416
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:13,100
â™«   No matter what the world puts me through   â™«

417
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:18,350
â™«   I never want to show my tears   â™«

418
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:24,290
â™«   Even to you, who don't know my feelings   â™«

419
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:31,090
â™«   I'm relieved that I can watch  â™«

420
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,550
â™«   you smile from afar   â™«

421
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:45,260
â™«   Come one step closer   â™«

422
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,780
I knew this would happen.

423
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,600
Are you going to live here like this?

424
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,610
Open the door. I'm in front of the restaurant.

425
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,760
You look funny right now.

426
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,020
Did you know?

427
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,040
What is it?

428
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,890
Hurry and wash up then come.

429
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,890
What?

430
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,170
Come eat with me.

431
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,710
This episode is about quite a famous restaurant.

432
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,430
I have to taste the food before filming.

433
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,680
I don't feel like going by myself.

434
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,060
I'm not in the mood right now.

435
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,980
I'm sorry but go with someone else.

436
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,970
Is there a different mood for eating?

437
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,240
Shut up and come with me. It's an expensive restaurant.

438
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,550
What? Did something really happen?

439
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,150
It's my problem. I'll take care of it.

440
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,220
It's because of Bo Ah, right? I told you to be careful of her.

441
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,820
Why don't you listen?

442
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,670
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

443
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,790
- So Dam.
 - Okay.

444
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,070
If you don't want to listen to it, I won't say anything.

445
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:19,380
Just eat with me. Just consider it a change of scenery.

446
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,350
Stop.

447
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,230
What?

448
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,300
Stop being good to me.

449
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,750
I''m not going to date you again. I don't feel the same.

450
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,260
You seem to be mistaken.

451
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,870
Having feelings for you is up to me.

452
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,750
So it's up to me whether I want to treat you well.

453
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,490
Ignore it if you don't like it. Turn me down as you did now.

454
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,950
It's up to you.

455
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,790
I won't chase after you forever.

456
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,770
I'm doing this now because I like you.

457
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,560
I'm being an idiot because I can't control how I feel.

458
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,330
I'm going to leave you if I find someone else.

459
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,810
So when I look at you,

460
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,440
look back at me.

461
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,040
Don't regret it later...

462
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,450
Like I am now.

463
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,660
It won't come off.

464
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,360
What are you doing right now?

465
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,090
No, I wanted to help too.

466
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,830
You have to apply masking tape before you paint.

467
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,730
Exactly, what will you do about this?

468
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,190
It's all ruined.

469
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,680
You can erase it later.

470
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,490
Right?

471
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,870
Chef, just stay still.

472
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,390
That's your way of helping.

473
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,570
Thank you.

474
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,820
Enjoy.

475
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,400
Thanks. I'll enjoy the meal.

476
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,290
I called you in place of him. Nothing to be grateful for.

477
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,730
Who cares if I'm a substitute.

478
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,430
I favor eating out these days. I get indigestion eating at home.

479
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,350
Why?

480
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,680
My mom stays at my house nowadays.

481
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,250
She's not here temporarily. She settled in for good.

482
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,800
Thank you.

483
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,500
I'm ready.

484
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,560
For what?

485
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,150
I have to repay you for the food.

486
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,820
Criticism, gossip, resentment. Let it all out.

487
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,790
All the women who resent Choi Go come looking for me.

488
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,610
What?

489
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,550
What girls?

490
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,030
My mom and you.

491
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,760
Eat.

492
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,230
I said I'm fine.

493
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,480
Everyone picks on me these days.

494
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,460
Come at me.

495
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,630
In the past, he used to say he liked me and followed me around.

496
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,050
You know, right?

497
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:13,880
I do.

498
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,190
The tables have turned for the worst.

499
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,790
Do you know how high in the air his head is?

500
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,990
People need to learn how to be humble.

501
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,430
Exactly.

502
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,500
You're his older brother. Shoudln't you scold him?

503
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,450
I'm pitiful, right?

504
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,600
You pay.

505
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,590
Is it not working.

506
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,470
Shine the light closer.

507
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,630
It's not going in.

508
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,100
- It worked.
 - I'm turning the lights on.

509
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,760
One, two, three.

510
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,440
How is it?

511
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,730
Well, it's not bad

512
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,520
What? I went out of my way to help.

513
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,090
Enough. Order four bowls of black bean noodles.

514
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,920
My treat.

515
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,780
What about a big serving of sweet and sour pork?

516
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,980
Call!

517
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,560
Jackpot!

518
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,480
Go away.

519
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,700
What about American food instead of Chinese?

520
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,230
Do you need help with something?

521
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,250
No, it's fine.

522
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,790
You worked hard. Rest.

523
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,550
Eat.

524
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:11,440
It might look like this, but you can eat it.

525
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,380
Thanks for the food.

526
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,180
Thanks.

527
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,560
Thank you.

528
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,060
Seems to be alright?

529
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,260
It's tasty.

530
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,620
It really is.

531
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,900
He must really be a chef.

532
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,010
It's really tasty.

533
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,120
Yummy.

534
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,180
Very.

535
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,550
Really.

536
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,060
Proper Chicken is here! You must start with the legs. "It's so delicious," I said as I was eating.

537
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,170
 The food was amazing.

538
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,910
  Good day, this is Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken.

539
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,650
Did Bo Ah really quit?

540
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,110
Yeah.

541
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,820
So he's her replacement?

542
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:06,240
He's in charge of deliveries. I asked Hwang from the real estate office.

543
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:13,020
I asked for someone to do deliveries and not someone useless like you.

544
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,410
And they said it had to be him.

545
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,130
What is that?

546
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,500
Flyers.

547
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,870
Since we were closed for two months, we need to let the customers know we are open again.

548
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,050
It's a good idea.

549
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,720
  Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

550
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,390
I'll go distribute the flyers now.

551
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,500
In the meanwhile, Kim Ki Beomâ€”

552
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,450
What is this?

553
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,970
I told you, a flyer for the reopening.

554
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,010
I'm asking about the price.

555
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,370
What event is this?

556
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,500
How long will it last?

557
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,660
For now, I plan to keep selling at that price.

558
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,680
Really?!

559
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,910
If we use this price, what is left?

560
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,300
Nothing, of course.

561
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,850
What are you thinking?

562
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,560
This is Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken.

563
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,710
It's just down the street.

564
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,190
Ah, yes.

565
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,060
Is this price correct?

566
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,130
Of course.

567
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,480
Let's just eat here.

568
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,360
I heard online that it is really tasty here.

569
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,040
The taste is the same.

570
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,200
To be honest, this restaurant stole our recipe and then opened.

571
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,830
If you don't find our chicken tasty, you don't have to pay.

572
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,310
Seriously? Let's go there.

573
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,880
What are you doing in front of my restaurant?

574
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,110
I'm handing out flyers, as you can see.

575
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,340
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken 
Big Sale

576
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,840
You! Have you lost it?

577
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,190
Do you want to go bankrupt?!

578
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,250
Why are you doing business without any profit? Why?

579
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,690
One of our restaurants has to go out of business in the end.

580
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:07,300
What's the point in dragging it on? I want to end this quickly.

581
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,850
Fine. You do it your way.

582
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,400
See who wins in the end.

583
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,810
We are Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken. It's straight down this road.

584
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,250
Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken.

585
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,710
What are you, the living dead?

586
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,790
Why are you hiding in your room all day?

587
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,320
Come out of there!

588
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,030
It's time to eat. You must be hungry.

589
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,450
I thought you finally came to your senses.

590
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,760
What happened?

591
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:37,450
You even quit your job. Are you going to live like that?

592
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,420
Wh-What's wrong?

593
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,410
Grandfather.

594
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,690
I'm sorry.

595
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,760
For what?

596
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,270
I've been immature.

597
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,070
I think I made everyone around me suffer.

598
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,450
I'll live like a decent human from now on.

599
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,170
I won't worry you.

600
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,720
I won't make you worry.

601
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,410
Here's the chicken.

602
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:37,920
Hello?

603
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,610
Yes.

604
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,450
What's the address?

605
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:46,490
Is it the same price for delivery?

606
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,270
Of course.

607
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,550
Welcome to Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken.

608
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,330
Please follow me, this way.

609
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,570
Is this seat alright?

610
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,520
How many should I fry?

611
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,310
I'll fry them from here. Take care of the dining hall.

612
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,400
And be especially mindful of table three.

613
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,090
They are important guests.

614
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,290
Who?

615
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,150
They're food bloggers.

616
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,850
- I invited them to visit our store.
 - What?

617
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,380
What?!

618
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,370
Bo Ah, what happened to you?

619
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,560
We couldn't contact you for days. I heard you quit?

620
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,120
I'm sorry for worrying you.

621
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,750
I was just hurting a bit.

622
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,630
Hurt? Where?

623
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,640
Now I'm fine.

624
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,210
After resting for a few days, I'm fine now.

625
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,450
That's a relief.

626
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,210
I'm hungry.

627
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,510
We should go to the restaurant out front and...

628
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:42,700
"Ajumma, two pork stir-fry, one tofu stew, extra rice!" What do you think?

629
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,300
Deal!

630
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,440
Without the extra rice.

631
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,330
Why? Do you not want to eat fried rice?

632
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,320
No, I have to go.

633
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,930
I was just stopping by to say hello.

634
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,410
Where are you going?

635
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,930
An interview for a part-time job.

636
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,340
I can't live like this forever. I should live diligently.

637
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,510
What?!

638
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,700
I'll call you later. See you.

639
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,400
You're going?

640
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,110
Already?

641
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,130
What was she saying?

642
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,160
I think she said she wanted to live diligently.

643
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,060
Was that just me?

644
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,640
Is she still sick?

645
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,040
How was it? Did you like it?

646
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,080
It was good.

647
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,460
Please take care of us.

648
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,050
Yes.

649
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,980
Take care.

650
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,590
You're not taking money?

651
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,210
What's the difference between this and buying reviews?

652
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,820
I have no choice. Everyone else does this, too.

653
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:12,700
On top of that, I have competition next door. I need to survive.

654
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,410
Let's talk outside for a minute.

655
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,050
Why are you like this?

656
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,860
What do you mean?

657
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:47,720
I know things are worse than before. But lowering prices

658
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,320
and buying reviews? How long can this last?

659
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,570
Are you really going to go under?

660
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,030
I told you.

661
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:56,900
I had no other choiceâ€”

662
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,760
What did you say when the other chicken place opened up?

663
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,680
Let us just do our business. There's no reason to feel swayed. Did you or did you not say that?

664
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,690
This is the kind of competition that bankrupts businesses. You know this.

665
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,660
Similar shops open around successful ones.

666
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,540
It's common.

667
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,260
This is different.

668
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,090
They stole our store's recipe andâ€”

669
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,740
How is it different?

670
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,000
Look on the internet. Employees taking recipes to open their own restaurants

671
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,540
happen all the time.

672
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,900
At times like this, instead of trying new tricks,

673
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,840
- we need to stay solid and constant. 
 - Why can't I try new tricks?

674
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,340
Both my mother and Bo Ah, the people closest to me, were trying to ruin me!

675
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,050
So what do you want me to do?!

676
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:44,490
Just let it go to ruin? I need to do something about it!

677
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Then be angry. But don't do something strange about the restaurant.

678
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,230
If you're honest, you are just angry

679
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:59,990
at your mother and at Bo Ah.

680
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,230
Go get mad at  them.  Conduct business with a clear head.

681
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:12,600
â™«   What is this? It doesnâ€™t make sense   â™«

682
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:17,130
â™«   What is this? It doesnâ€™t make sense   â™«

683
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:25,680
â™«   All day, you shine like the sun   â™« 
â™«   And stars that resemble you rise  â™«

684
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:31,380
â™«   You donâ€™t even know that the reason I smile is you   â™«

685
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,130
â™«   You donâ€™t even know that the reason I smile is you   â™«

686
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,970
Fried chicken for table seven. 
 â™«   You donâ€™t even know that the reason I smile is you   â™«

687
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:41,720
â™«   Without a word, like magic, you colored my heart  â™«

688
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,130
Didn't you hear me? 
 â™«   Without a word, like magic, you colored my heart   â™«

689
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:49,260
Fried chicken for table seven. 
 â™«   In my remaining time, if thereâ€™s such a thing as fate  â™«

690
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,700
Ah... Yes. 
 â™«   In my remaining time, if thereâ€™s such a thing as fate  â™«

691
00:55:53,520 --> 00:56:01,960
â™«   IIf itâ€™s alright with you, I hope itâ€™ll be you  â™«

692
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,720
â™«   Baby I have a crush on you   â™«

693
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,260
â™«   Will you be my one and only universe?  â™«

694
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,300
â™«   Will you be my one and only universe?  â™«

695
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,670
Yes, this is Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken. 
 â™«   Will you be my one and only universe?  â™«

696
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:19,890
â™«   So a pretty flower that resembles you  â™«

697
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,990
Yes, delivery. 
â™«   Can bloom the cracks of my heart   â™«

698
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,370
One fried chicken 
 â™«   Into this picturesque scene where your breath touches  â™«

699
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:30,450
for delivery. 
 â™«   Into our own time  â™«

700
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:33,610
What are you doing? A delivery order came in.

701
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:40,760
â™«   Into our own time   â™«

702
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,000
What the hell are you doing?!

703
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,730
I'll be back in a minute.

704
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,350
What?

705
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,180
â™«  Will you be my one and only universe?   â™«

706
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:01,060
Boss, a fried chicken for table two. 
 â™«  Will you be my one and only universe?   â™«

707
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,380
â™«  So a pretty flower that resembles you   â™«

708
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,930
She said she is going to a job interview. 
â™«  Can bloom the cracks of my heart   â™«

709
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,430
Why do you ask? 
â™«  Can bloom the cracks of my heart   â™«

710
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,530
 Resume

711
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,620
Would a night shift be alright for you?

712
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,830
Of course.

713
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:38,680
I'm a night owl, so I sleep during the day and am awake at night.

714
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:43,090
I worked with her, so I can tell you she's no good.

715
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:43,860
What?

716
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,270
Boss...

717
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,760
She was only thinking of ruining the store.

718
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,810
The point is, don't hire her.

719
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,760
We need to talk.

720
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:08,260
Boss. Are you being serious?

721
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,370
I mean, I get that I was wrong

722
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,310
and I am sorry.

723
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:25,680
So I thought about not harming another person and living diligently.

724
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,520
But then youâ€” Why did you come here?!

725
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,430
To get mad at you.

726
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,280
What?

727
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,760
If my mom wanted to talk to you, you should have told me first,

728
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,770
and you shouldn't have revealed the recipe so carelessly.

729
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:42,750
Boss...

730
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:48,860
I couldn't believe that you would send a bomb to work.

731
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,400
Do you know that it was a crime?

732
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,350
And even with the Chicken Taste Competition,

733
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,590
I kept quiet because I didn't want to seem narrow-minded,

734
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,660
but you watched me preparing hard for that

735
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,400
and yet you still entered and won.

736
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,470
How could you? Tell me.

737
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:14,130
That's why I told you I am sorry.

738
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,850
And even the flyer.

739
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,950
I told you not to hand them out.

740
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:22,370
Is it enough if the result was good? You had bad intentions.

741
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:31,820
And... Why did you quit?

742
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,340
I told you not to.

743
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,320
Boss...

744
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,790
I need you.

745
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:43,460
Don't go somewhere else! Stay by my side!

746
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:53,530
Because... I like you.

747
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,340
What?

748
00:59:59,310 --> 00:59:59,860
â™«   Yeah   â™«

749
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:04,440
â™«   Love love Iâ€™m falling in love   â™«

750
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:11,600
â™«   Iâ€™m only getting filled with reasons I like you that are becoming countless   â™«

751
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,390
â™«   Love love love is shining light   â™«

752
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:23,460
â™«   When Iâ€™m with you, wherever we are, itâ€™ll be filled with light   â™«

753
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,320
â™«   If itâ€™s you, even the faraway dreams become close enough to reach   â™«

754
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,390
â™«   The world that was only difficult becomes my side too   â™«

755
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,220
â™«   Someone once said, life is quite good   â™«

756
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,320
â™«   If it wasnâ€™t for you, I wouldâ€™ve never known   â™«

757
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:41,120
â™«   What words are needed when youâ€™re so dazzling by my side?   â™«

758
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,950
â™«   I have you, who makes me happy, just by looking at you   â™«

759
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:52,950
â™«   Whatever happens, Iâ€™ll promise you this   â™«

760
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,520
â™«   Iâ€™ll never become the source of your tears   â™«

761
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,120

â™«   Iâ€™ll never become the source of your tears   â™«

762
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,460
You did well Bo Ah.

763
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,300
 Let's keep it a secret that we are dating for now.

764
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,830
 Honey is dripping from your eyes!

765
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,760
 What are you doing there?

766
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,540
 You're the worst!

767
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,900
 Just being with you makes me happy.

768
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,640
 So cheesy.

769
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,250
 What is this?!

770
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,890
 You should have told us!

771
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,870
 Dukdam and our families are being taken for idiots.

772
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,420
 I even did something terrible!

773
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,730
 Come back to your senses!

774
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,180
â™«  Love love   â™«

775
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,430
 Grandfather.

776
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:30,580
â™«  reasons I like you that are becoming countless.  â™«
