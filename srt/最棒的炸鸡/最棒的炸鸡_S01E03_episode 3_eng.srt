 Joo Woo Jae

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:28,980

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,050
 Last Time  
I don't think I can pay the rent, Grandfather.

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,560
 I'll do it there. The pearl In the mud.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,150
 The bathhouse has been leased. Get out.

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,490
 Do you want to work with me here?

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,170
 The lease term is 30 years!

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,790
 There is no other way.

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,670
 The only way is to make him fail and leave at his will.

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,910
 Welcome.

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,470
 Hourly pay of ₩10,000 with no training period.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,870
 Fine. I'll believe in you and give you ₩10,000.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,570
 The flyer makes you crave chicken, doesn't it?

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,190
 I need to take special measures.

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,020
 Cruel girl.

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,680
 Seo Bo Ah, what is this?

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,430
 How is this chicken?

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,490
 You don't have a good understanding of ingredients yet.

22
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,670
 Done!

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,390
 I made it!

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,420
 When I was working at the company, people asked me every day why I looked so lifeless.

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,480
 - One, two, three! 
 - These days, life is fun.

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,970
 The Food Safety inspection is coming tomorrow?

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,300
 If he is penalized enough, he has to close the business.

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,840
 Just dirty the place!

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,680
 Who are you

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,270
 Bo Ah, what are you doing here?

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,050
 Food Safety Inspection Team

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,000
 2019.03.15

33
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,870
 Sanitary Inspection Evaluation

34
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,370
 In August of 1973,

35
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:11,180
 at Kreditbanken in Sweden, a six day hostage stand-off occurred.

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:23,200
 Surprisingly, the hostages bonded with the robbers.

37
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,190
 After the robbers were arrested,

38
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,940
 the hostages testified in the robbers' favor.

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,940
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

40
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,260
 To summarize, it is a phenomenon of the victims helping the perpetrators.

41
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,950
The inspectors are really brutal.

42
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,810
But why did you come to clean the kitchen so early in the morning?

43
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,780
Did you know about the inspection?

44
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,610
How could I?

45
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,430
I told you I couldn't sleep.

46
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,820
When I can't fall asleep, I usually need to clean.

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,550
If it weren't for you, I'd be in deep trouble. Thank you.

48
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,690
 We call it the Stockholm syndrome.

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,490
 Episode 3: Stockholm Syndrome

50
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,320
Didn't your shop also get inspected?

51
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,610
There was no penalty.

52
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,550
Nothing was wrong?

53
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,820
Ingredients have to be put in a proper storage.

54
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,440
They have to be ten centimeters above the floor.

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,690
They just gave us a verbal warning.

56
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,800
How could this be for the first inspection?

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,100
I told you that it was terribly clean.

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,490
That's why I told you to mess things up.

59
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,060
Who knows if such an opportunity will come again?

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
Perhaps, did the word spread?

61
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,650
By any chance...

62
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,190
You need to get to work.

63
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,740
Let's go. Hurry. Get up.

64
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,920
I need to go the store.

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,260
Raise the price, then sell it.

66
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,690
Raise it just a bit higher.

67
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,050
A bit more. Okay. A little bit more.

68
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,860
Just a bit higher.

69
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,610
More.

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,250
- Grandfather?
 - What are you doing there, not working?

71
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,290
Elder, what brings you... What is this?

72
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,740
You said you were opening a chicken restaurant.

73
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,560
Thinking of it as your opening gift. That's good. Done.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,200
It's special. You didn't retouch much, but the atmosphere is quite different!

75
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,330
You didn't spend much, right?

76
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,650
Yes. We call it an upcycling.

77
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,420
You renovate as little as possible and try to keep the interior as much as it is.

78
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,510
Grandfather, why did you return?

79
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,690
Is she still living here?

80
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,810
Well...

81
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,970
Right, it wouldn't be easy. Since I've come, do you want me to kick her out?

82
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,790
No!

83
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,620
She promised to leave after just a week.

84
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,310
And you believe her?

85
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,520
Is that true?

86
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,610
What do you think?

87
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,370
Stop bothering an innocent man. Take your stuff and come home. I emptied a room for you.

88
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,670
I can't live a single day with you, Grandpa.

89
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,190
I moved out because I didn't want to hear your nagging. Why would I go back?

90
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,790
Would you look at that? I wonder whom she took after.

91
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,530
What are you looking at?!

92
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,590
Does she at least work properly?

93
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,430
Of course. If it weren't for Bo Ah today, we'd be in big—

94
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,260
Aren't you all busy? What's wrong with you?!

95
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,780
Go out. Leave.

96
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,640
Goodbye.

97
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,290
Don't come here again, Grandfather. Whether I live here or not, it's now a problem between my boss and me.

98
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,880
That little—

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,780
Look at the way you talk. I should just—

100
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,720
Calm down, Elder.

101
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,920
Scary.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,810
 You can't break anything this time.

103
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,460
Should we go back in?

104
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,960
Let's go.

105
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,030
 Stop right there!

106
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,000
 If it was you, would you stop there?

107
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,920
Bo Ah, since the matter came up,

108
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,750
you will leave, right?

109
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,970
What?

110
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,780
Are you looking for a room?

111
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,280
Not much time is left from the promised one week.

112
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,380
Would you like another week?

113
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,440
Whoa, how ungrateful!

114
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,090
We passed the food safety inspection because of me!

115
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,420
I know that, but as you may know, I also don't have a place to go.

116
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,230
And I can't sleep in the store forever.

117
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,140
I'm not leaving. Got it?

118
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,690
If you go to the second floor, that's trespassing.

119
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,980
It's not a day or two,

120
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,980
my back really hurts.

121
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,720
You really should leave.

122
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,370
I was really crazy. I should've rubbed something dirty.

123
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,830
Chicken's here.

124
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,340
Coming!

125
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,290
Thank you.

126
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,800
I ordered this one last and it came the fastest.

127
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,990
Is there something happening?

128
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,240
Thank you.

129
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,070
Thank you.

130
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,560
Thank you.

131
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,880
Thank you. Ah, thank you.

132
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,190
- Thank you.
 - Enjoy.

133
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,030
Boss, what is all of this?

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,890
Chicken.

135
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,400
I mean, this is a chicken restaurant. Why are you ordering chicken from others?

136
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,370
We gave out flyers and menus.

137
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,320
However, we get one or two tables a day.

138
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,500
I thought that we had a problem with our promotional methods.

139
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,490
And how is that related to this?

140
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,310
I plan to appear on TV.

141
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,590
Do you think just anyone can appear on TV?

142
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,150
Only famous restaurants appear there.

143
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,120
Bo Ah, do you know the fried chicken guessing competition?

144
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,070
What is that?

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,360
 Every year, downtown, several special events are taking place for the citizens.

146
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,370
 Today, in the chicken theme section, the fried chicken guessing game is held.

147
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,130
I'll be interviewing today's winner.

148
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,430
- Hello. 
- Hi.

149
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,080
What is your name?

150
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,760
I got to participate in this event by chance.

151
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,550
Since I was able to taste various fried chickens, I am very happy.

152
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,820
Yes, thank you.

153
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,790
Please come and have fun at the many events happening downtown.

154
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,800
This is what you call appearing on TV? An interview of three seconds if you win?

155
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,850
It can be different depending on how you use those three seconds.

156
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,290
The chicken place that won the fried chicken guessing contest.

157
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,280
What do you think? Doesn't it make you want to eat?

158
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,120
No, not really.

159
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,990
I'll screenshoot the interview,

160
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,640
and I'll put it in the flyers and hang it on the wall.

161
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,660
If we do that, there will be an effect.

162
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,390
Boss, do you think you can win?

163
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,890
The camera doesn't even shoot the second and third place winners.

164
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,560
We have to practice.

165
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,660
What?

166
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,820
I need your help.

167
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,370
Or rather, you do it too.

168
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,450
I want to compare my skill with normal people.

169
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,360
If I'm a normal person, then are you a chicken maniac?

170
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,080
 Seo Bo Ah: 60%  |  Park Choi Go: 50%

171
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,950
 60%

172
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,330
 50%

173
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,810
This... can't be possible.

174
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,220
Chicken man, cheer up.

175
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,580
You can do it. Fighting!

176
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,390
It's totally doable.

177
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,820
I tried it and I seem to have a talent for it.

178
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,750
So, you're going to enter in that fried chicken guessing something?

179
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,170
Of course.

180
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,370
If boss wins, he'll appear on TV.

181
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,260
And the store does well, what would I do?

182
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,040
Should I really wait 30 years then?

183
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,000
But, you can't win with 60%.

184
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,120
Is he the only one practicing? I am, too.

185
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,810
You need money to study.

186
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,120
One chicken costs ₩15,000 ($15).

187
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Ten chickens are ₩150,000. Twenty chickens are ₩300,000. Do you have money?

188
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,130
You didn't even get your paycheck yet.

189
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,270
Why would I use my blood-like money?

190
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,980
Where there is a will, there is a way.

191
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,730
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

192

 Features of each brand

242
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,590
Bo Ah. Were you cleaning again?

243
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,670
Eh? No.

244
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,630
You look tired.

245
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,840
I have been doing things I've never done before, so it's hard.

246
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,240
It used to be so peaceful.

247
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,230
Are your preparations going well, Boss?

248
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,530
Yes, I seem to be improving.

249
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:07,000
I tested myself last night and got a whopping 90%.

250
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,770
Tomorrow is the contest, so if I study a lot tonight I'm confident I'll get 100%.

251
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,650
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

252
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,060
 Hurry! Hurry up!

253
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,120
How many points did I get?

254
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,810
  40.

255
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,800
What the? Only 40 points?

256
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,600
Before I started studying, it was 60%!

257
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,940
How can I lose 20%? It doesn't make sense!

258
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,580
What's the difference between guessing and getting half of them right?

259
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,890
It's not even half. Half is 50%.

260
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,290
What do I do?

261
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,260
Tomorrow is the contest and that guy says he has 90%!

262
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,770
When is he going to fail, so that I become a cafe owner?

263
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,430
Bo Ah.

264
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,580
How about doing this?

265
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,200
 Fried Chicken Guessing Contest

266
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,660
Hyung, today I will definitely win and appear on TV.

267
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,850
Sure, as if.

268
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,250
So there is something I need you to do for me.

269
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,500
Make sure Mom doesn't watch TV today.

270
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,040
Especially the news! You know what I'm saying, right?

271
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,020
It's just a few seconds on air.

272
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,460
Don't worry about that and go.

273
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,760
Don't you know her?

274
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,700
If I get caught, you're an accomplice!

275
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,380
Why am I an accomplice?

276
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,570
I'm saying it will be like that in her perspective.

277
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,130
"Why didn't you stop him? What did you do as his brother?"

278
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,150
There will be no end to it.

279
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,980
So, please.

280
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,980
Nothing was wrong with your company. Why did you quit?

281
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,570
Just get lost already. I don't want to see you.

282
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,500
Thanks, Hyung.

283

00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,740
By any chance is that...?

298
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,870
You're late, Boss.

299
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,380
You're going to enter the contest as well?

300
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,980
Yes. It looks fun.

301
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,290
I'm participating as an upright normal person.

302
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,460
Director Park, where did you go on your day off?

303
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,890
Just, well...

304
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,330
Mom, do you want to go watch a movie with me?

305
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,620
I'm almost done with the meal.

306
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,700
Let's eat while watching TV.

307
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,600
Then want to watch a movie on TV?

308
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,010
Mom, did you see it?

309
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,930
That... The new one.

310
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,200
The really fun one.

311
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,640
Director Park, you need to start dating.

312
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,670
I'm going to watch a drama.

313
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,260
You watch a movie with your lover and just taste this.

314
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,570
How is it? Pretty good, right?

315
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,640
A bit salty?

316
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,460
 Prove your ultimate taste-buds.

317
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,660
 Who will be the final  winner?

318

Many participants are sitting in front of me with solid determination.

We will start the fried chicken guessing soon.

322
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,010

323
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,970
Everyone, please put on your eye mask.

324
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,170
We ask that you wear your eye mask.

325
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,240
You won't be able to see the chicken with the eye mask.

326
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,130
Then, to our staff,

327
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,990
please put a piece of chicken in front of each contestant.

328
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,590
Well, right now

329
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,060
our contestants don't see the outline of the chicken.

330
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,590
You can smell the chicken, right?

331
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,650
Now, what will be the first chicken? Bring it out please.

332
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,320
The first chicken to be guessed is here.

333
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,140
None of you see, right? Please show

334
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,430
to our audience

335
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,780
and our viewers

336
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,040
what kind of chicken it is. Wow, it's this one! 
  Sambok Chicken / Ginseng fried

337
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,980
Audience, please do not tell.

338
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,630
If you tell, then they will be disqualified.

339
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,990
Then,

340
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,470
please start guessing

341
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,640
what kind of chicken it is.

342
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,330
Yes. Now.

343
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,060
She seems to be very professional. She is smelling the chicken.

344
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,530
Sniff. Sniff. That's good. Some are tasting it! That's good!

345
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,870
You need to feel it. What kind of chicken is it?

346
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,440
They are meticulous.

347
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,840
Wow! Without eating it up,

348
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,570
some are even measuring it.

349
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,250
Can you tell by the size?

350
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,660
Very well. Are you all done?

351
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,230
Seems like everyone has decided.

352
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,470
Everyone.

353
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,380
Please write your answer on the whiteboard.

354
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,170
Right now, the chicken in front of you,

355
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,270
what chicken it is, please write it down.

356
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,610
We have a few fast ones here.

357
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,700
Some are still contemplating apparently.

358
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Seems like everyone is done writing it down.

359
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,010
Please lift up your answers!

360
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,650
Wow, there are many different answers.

361
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,690
Some answers are right and some answers are wrong.

362
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,680
Then, the right answer is

363
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,540
Sambok Chicken / Ginseng fried

364
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,530
Oh, yes. Half of them had answered right and half of them failed.

365
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,350
Nice. The people who had the right answer can proceed to the next round.

366
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,440
But when is your brother coming home from abroad?

367
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,170
You said he was going on a business trip, but it seems more like he emigrated.

368
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,740
Mom, after finishing this, would you like to take a walk?

369
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,350
What's wrong with you? You're acting like a kid.

370
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,800
Fine then. Shall we take a short stroll?

371
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,000
Really?

372
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,560
On the way back, should we get shaved ice?

373
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,860
You really like it, right?

374
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,410
It's not summer anymore, why shaved ice?

375
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,470
- At this time, we should eat red bean porridge. 
 - Okay.

376
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,060
Hurry and eat. Eat that first.

377
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,130
Bring out the next chicken.

378
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,850
Give us the next chicken now! Next!

379
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,040
Next. And next.

380
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,400
Next. And the next one.

381
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,570
That's right. Correct!
  Letter's chicken, soy-flavored chicken.

382
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,710
Again right answer!  BNB Chicken, fried chicken with pepper

383
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,330
Right! Correct!

384
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,730
1,500 people participated in this chicken guessing contest.

385
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,430
Now we only have two best contestants remaining.

386
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,720
Great. Who will be the winner?

387
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,490
Please give them the chicken.

388
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,380
What kind of chicken is it this time?

389
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,660
We will show it to our audience. 
  Woori Chicken - Fried

390
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,650
The last two participants

391
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,910
will guess the chicken.

392
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,060
Please start now!

393
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,410
These two have the aura of professionals.

394
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,850
They are becoming one with the chicken.

395
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,840
The lady put the chicken down already.

396
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,490
Please write down the correct answer.

397
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,570
Then the last two.

398
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,980
Please show us

399
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,680
the right answer!

400
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,450
Oh?

401
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,560
Woori fried chicken. Both have the same answer

402
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,250
on the board.

403
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,220
Woori fried chicken

404
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,160
is the correct answer!

405
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,450
Congratulations!

406
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,670
What is that guy! Twenty correct guesses in a row?

407
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,520
Then we will move on to the next chicken.

408
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,410
They must have studied a lot.

409
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,740
The next, please.

410
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,430
What happened?

411
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,990
How can this happen?

412
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,170
Apparently, we ran out of chicken.

413
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:21,250
So we will take a break and resume after ten minutes.

414
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,730
We will have a ten-minute break.

415
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,440
Bo Ah, what happened?

416
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,770
Did you study as well?

417
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,440
No way.

418
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,330
But you must have studied very hard.

419
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,460
Stop it now.

420
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,620
I need to win to promote the restaurant.

421
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,810
Boss, I didn't think of you like this, but are you trying to manipulate who the winner is?

422
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,830
You should be doing this fair and square. Fair and square.

423
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,500
Guys, I can't eat any more.

424
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,930
My belly's about to burst.

425
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,670
Endure a little more. We are extremely hungry.

426
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,820
If I had known, I should have entered the contest as well.

427
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,930
Why are there so many new chickens?

428
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,280
Pronounce the words better. I get confused.

429
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,820
Do you think that ventriloquism is easy?

430
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,570
Whatever I say or however I say, you should catch it correctly.

431
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,730
But who the hell is your boss?

432
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,450
How can he get everything right? You studied as well but only got 40% right!

433
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,110
That's what I am wondering about as well.

434
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,130
Guys, will this never end?

435
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,530
Hold on.

436
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,660
If he continues to guess right, do I have to continue this as well?

437
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,860
No way. He will make a mistake at some point.

438
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,290
You've waited a long time.

439
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,940
The contest will start again now!

440
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,250
Applause.

441
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,480
There was an unexpected error for a second.

442
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,950
Is everything alright now?

443
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,660
It's alright now. Then,

444
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,440
we will start the contest now!

445
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,570
Please bring the chicken to the last two participants.

446
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,720
Which chicken will they taste?

447
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,540
I will reveal it

448
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,920
to our audience and viewers.

449
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,810
We've prepared this in a hurry.

450
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,640
The chicken they need to guess is this one.

451
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,560
 Baruda Chicken / Soy sauce chicken

452
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,830
Yes, then.

453
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:52,760
Please start guessing the chicken.

454
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,540
 Quick Chicken, soy sauce chicken.

455
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:09,130
 Baruda Chicken, soy sauce chicken!

456
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,630
As expected, both are thinking carefully. They had many chickens.

457
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,580
One contestant is writing down.

458
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,400
These two are the last participants.

459
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,780
Who will be the winner? Seo Bo Ah or Park Choi Go?

460
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,260
Please lift up your answer now!

461
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,780
Finally, finally!

462
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,900
They have different answers.

463
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,620
Seo Bo Ah wrote, "Baruda Chicken. Soy sauce chicken."

464
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,870
Park Chio Go wrote, "Byeolmi Chicken, grain soy chicken."

465
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:45,530
Today's winner is...

466
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,930
Mom, let's go on a walk.

467
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,420
I'm tired. Let's go out later.

468
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,880
There's nothing interesting on TV right now. Let's go, Mom.

469
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,670
Right.

470
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,250
Let's watch the news.

471
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,820
There we go.

472
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,080
 Today, various events were held downtown for citizens.

473
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,480
What's wrong with you?

474
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,420
Mom, hold on!

475
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,840
Wait a moment!

476
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,680
- What's wrong with you?!
 - This can't be.

477
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,100
Can't I watch what I like? I am not staying here for long.

478
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,830
Director Park, I'm upset!

479
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,960
What's the big deal?

480
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,530
 Especially, today's fried chicken guessing contest,

481
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,740
 has extended multiple rounds. It's a historic record.

482
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,200
Somehow...he seems very familiar?

483
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,950
 The final winner was selected after a long one-hour battle.

484
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,010
 Then, we shall interview the winner.

485
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,900
 Hello, please give your winning speech.

486
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,120
Mom, what happened is...

487
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,850
 I don't have any special methods.

488
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,330
 I just figured that the chicken was from that restaurant.

489
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,780
That girl must be eating chicken every day, harming her body.

490
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,240
I'm happy I've won.

491
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,720
Grandpa, I am on TV.

492
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,130
I said I was a part-timer! What's up with the unemployed!

493
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,780
Should I tell the broadcasting station? Should I tell them to correct it?

494
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,990
You've worked hard, Bo Ah. At least you blocked your boss from appearing on TV.

495
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,350
Right? That will do.

496
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,950
How should I face him now that it's awkward?

497
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,710
Geez.

498
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,470
Bo Ah.

499
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,980
You scared me. What is it?

500
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,650
Why did you say that it was Baruda Chicken at the end?

501
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,260
What?

502
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:19,220
What specification made you think it was? I just don't understand.

503
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,860
What do you mean? It tasted like Baruda Chicken, so I said so.

504
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:29,080
If you ask me why it was Baruda chicken, then... Are you questioning my judgement?

505
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,690
That's not it. Baruda chicken uses size 9 chicken.

506
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,620
But the size was like 11. Look at this bone.

507
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,650
What are you doing? So dirty!

508
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,920
Are you bothering me because I've won?

509
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,840
No. That's not it, I was just innocently curious.

510
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,280
Maybe the chicken was fat.

511
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:55,410
I expected you to be a grudge holder like this.

512
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,250
You should accept the result.

513
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,240
Anyway, you worked hard.

514
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,270
It was a nice game. A fair and square one.

515
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,700
Wait a second.

516
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,990
If he continues to guess right, do I have to continue this?

517
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,310
No way. He will make a mistake at some point.

518
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:59,430
No, it's better to be certain.

519
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,390
Let's go.

520
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,590
You've waited a long time.

521
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,290
The contest will start again now!

522
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,630
Please applaud!

523
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,010
 Byeolmi Chicken ? Grain soy chicken

524
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,100
 Baruda Chicken / Soy sauce chicken

525
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,830
There was an unexpected error. Is everything alright now?

526
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,060
It's alright now.

527
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,290
Then, let's resume the contest.

528
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,150
Finally!

529
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,490
Two have different answers.

530
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:20,340
The final winner is Seo Bo Ah!

531
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,530
Seo Bo Ah!

532
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,840
Seo Bo Ah!

533
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,800
Good morning, boss!

534
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,420
Bo Ah, good morning.

535
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,440
Boss, are you alright?

536
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,260
Why do you ask?

537
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,650
Because of yesterday?

538
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:45,900
I expected you to be depressed today, so I decided to be careful around you today.

539
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,630
You don't have to do that.

540
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,030
Like you said, you won fair and square.

541
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:56,300
Right.  But what are you doing now?

542
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,490
Ah, right. About the flyer—

543
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,390
No, I already distributed all of them, so why talk about it now?

544
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,370
Actually, I wanted to ask if you were the one who drew that manga?

545
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,030
Why?

546
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,600
Could you take a look at this?

547
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,810
What is this?

548
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,060
The menu.

549
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,580
I can see your intention.

550
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,360
But what is this outcome?

551
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,150
Our original menu doesn't look nice.

552
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,830
So I made this new menu board.

553
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,920
But I can't draw as well as I imagined.

554
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,800
Just use the previous one.

555
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,980
It's better than this ugly one.

556
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,380
Whoa.

557
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,150
This won't do either.

558
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,340
Just hire a person to do a new design for the menu.

559
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,420
How about this?

560
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
- Can you draw one, please?
 - Nope.

561
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,250
- Bo Ah, please. 
- No. I won't.

562
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,540
For the rooftop room,

563
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,000
you promised to evacuate it by today.

564
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,100
Seriously.

565
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,990
If you draw the menu board,

566
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,080
I will let you stay there one more month.

567
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,020
How is it?

568
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,790
Should I just hire a person to do it?

569
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,360
Give it to me. Hurry.

570
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,520
Why are you looking around my room?

571
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,290
Whoa. This place is very nice.

572
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,020
It has a nice view and the layout is excellent, too.

573
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,600
Don't even think about it.

574
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,820
I let you have the first floor powerlessly, but I won't for the second floor.

575
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,150
What is wrong with this?

576
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,990
What? What happened?

577
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,060
Is it out of order? What's happening?

578
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,130
Is it because I dropped it last time?

579
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,240
I can go by myself.

580
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,930
Let's go together. I will be ready soon.

581
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,730
What is it?

582
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,850
Bo Ah, that's...

583
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,440
 The winner of Chicken Guessing Contest

584
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,690
What is this?

585
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,090
Well, we need to promote the shop, right?

586
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,160
Are you crazy?

587
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,800
You know better than anyone that I am not unemployed.

588
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,720
No, that's not the problem here.

589
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,660
I have a right to my portrait.

590
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,000
I know, I know.

591
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,510
But this shop has to survive first.

592
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,800
So, I can pay you as well.

593
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,430
That's not my problem.

594
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,690
This is not allowed.

595
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,330
I am telling you that this is not allowed.

596
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,830
Okay. Got it.

597
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,860
Let's go get your tablet fixed first.

598
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,610
That's not okay.

599
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,090
I understand. Let's go.

600
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,980
 Seo Bo Ah: Unemployed

601
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,660
Okay.

602
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,600
This is a discontinued model, so it's going to cost a bit for the replacement part.

603
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,830
How about buying a new one instead?

604
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,140
Really?

605
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,670
What's your main purpose for using this?

606
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,470
To be honest, I draw a webtoon.

607
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,770
Ah, you're a webtoonist.

608
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,750
Then, we have the right model for your purpose.

609
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,410
This is a new model which just came out.

610
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,840
Do you know the new trend is LCD, right?

611
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,790
"A craftsman won't blame his tool."

612
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,070
That's made-up because a craftsman wants to use all the good ones for himself.

613
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,650
Well,

614
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,190
With a 25-inch high quality resolution display and 28 levels of pen pressure sensitivities to choose from.

615
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,340
The picture you drew with your old tablet can't compete with the one you can draw with this new one

616
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,950
from the beginning.

617
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,230
Why was the whole body swimsuit prohibited in the Olympic game?

618
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,310
Don't you think so?

619
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,710
I am okay with this one.

620
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,460
I am just drawing it at home as a hobby.

621
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,190
Ah, a wanna-be?

622
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,750
I thought you made it to webtoonist already.

623
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,160
Then, this expensive equipment can be a burden to you.

624
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,200
Oh, well, I am not a wanna-be to be exact.

625
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,320
But you need to think of this as an investment.

626
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,760
How long are you going to draw a webtoon that nobody would read in your room

627
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,470
as practice?

628
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:36,800
Do you know the superstition that you will pass the exam if you practice while wearing the clothing of someone who already passed the exam?

629
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,580
Lee Jin Sang Edition. Furthermore, this one is a limited edition.

630
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,820
If you buy it now, it comes with the autograph of the best webtoonist, Lee Jin Sang

631
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,890
and the engraved serial number of a limited edition.

632
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,410
This won't be erased.

633
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,610
Never mind.

634
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,180
Just fix mine.

635
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,470
Okay.

636
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,880
Did you argue with the repairman?

637
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,810
Why would I argue with him?

638
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,610
He tried to sell an outrageous thing to me.

639
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:20,250
So, I had to scold him.

640
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,550
How long did he say it would take to fix it?

641
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,120
I don't know. He said it wouldn't take long.

642
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,890
Then, I will use a restroom for a sec.

643
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,660
Lee Jin Sang, my butt.

644
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,740
Mister.

645
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,110
Who's your mister?

646
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,460
I wanted to thank you

647
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,190
if I ever saw you again.

648
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,240
Whatever.

649
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,590
I have to fry legs

650
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,440
and then breast, right?

651
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,640
You finally got it?

652
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,450
I never learned how to cook properly.

653
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,420
Then, run a franchise shop

654
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,080
instead of selling weird food to the customers.

655
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,430
Please re-visit my shop.

656
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,520
Please try eating this time and judge it again.

657
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,980
Forget it.

658
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,740
Please reconsider.

659
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,350
I will treat you for your lesson.

660
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,440
Why did he tag along when he doesn't stay with me?

661
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:12,980
 Assemble your computer

662
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,000
The world is doomed.

663
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,740
How come Jin Sang became a model for a commercial?

664
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,030
 Fansigning Event with Webtonist Lee Jin Sang

665
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,590
Seo Bo Ah?

666
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,430
Are you okay?

667
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,290
I am sorry. I apologize in her place.

668
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:22,740
And this is for your coffee.

669
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,520
I apologize.

670
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,520
Seo Bo Ah.

671
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,070
This is me.

672
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,500
Are you okay?

673
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,130
I apologized to him for you

674
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,290
since you were looking at the tablet only.

675
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,870
Do you still hate me?

676
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:58,310
People already concluded that I didn't commit plagiarism.

677
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,750
But why are you still holding a grudge against me?

678
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,570
People wouldn't know it, but you and I know it.

679
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,920
Team Leader, can you bring that one that I received before?

680
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,790
Okay, Writer.

681
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,320
You're still talking to me like that.

682
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,530
You were blamed because you argued for nothing.

683
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,790
I couldn't stop anything in the middle. What kind of situation did you create?

684
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,760
You don't feel guilty at all?

685
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,360
I can sleep without worrying at least even though I am blamed.

686
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,020
I couldn't sleep well.

687
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,570
I had deadlines to meet for the last five years.

688
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,340
Bo Ah,

689
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,800
you can't write a series with a few ideas.

690
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,030
Don't focus on a trivial thing.

691
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,980
That's why you haven't improved for the last five years.

692
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,800
In the world of professionals, this kind of thing happens often.

693
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,340
If someone else created something I was about to do, then I look for something else to work on.

694
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,000
That's the way it is.

695
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,750
How long are you going to blame me for what happened a long time ago?

696
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,120
It was you who ruined yourself, not me.

697
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,680
Think about it carefully.

698
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,430
Writer.

699
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,780
Thank you.

700
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,220
Take this with you.

701
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,580
I got this just before, but I can ask for one more.

702
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,360
Why do I take this from you? Am I a beggar?

703
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,590
It's all broken. I don't think you can get it fixed.

704
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,020
I have no interest in other's unlike you.

705
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,600
Bo Ah, just take it.

706
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,060
It's for free.

707
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,810
What?

708
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,910
Then, this belongs to Bo Ah, right?

709
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,450
Who are you?

710
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,760
♫  The one and only you  ♫

711
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,630
You can try it once. It helps you release your stress.

712
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:15,330
♫  So a pretty flower that resembles you ♫
  ♫ Can bloom the cracks of my heart  ♫

713
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,240
Let's go now.

714
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,590
Boss.

715
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:54,810
Yes?

716
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:57,810
Not that way. The one over there.

717
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,890
♫  A star has fallen into my restless heart  ♫

718
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,190
What are all of these?

719
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,300
Pay for them.

720
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,310
♫  It keeps digging in and twinkling  ♫

721
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:32,000
♫  I’m getting a strange feeling, awakening my lurking dream  ♫

722
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,220
♫  I’ve come forth to the world  ♫

723
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:40,650
♫  I don’t really know either. No one knows what will happen  ♫

724
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,940
♫  There’s no rule against success. So I’m not afraid  ♫

725
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,790
Whoa.

726
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:49,900
It's really pretty.

727
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,400
If I had a tablet, I could put a picture of chickens on this, too.

728
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,890
But still, I did my best.

729
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:58,530
This is better. Unique and cute.

730
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:02,670
Of course. I put in a lot of effort.

731
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:09,910
♫  I’ll be here for dreaming, put away the maps  ♫

732
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,750
♫  Every step I take, it’ll turn into a road  ♫

733
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,250
Are you making another one?

734
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,290
Of course. We need to have at least two since these are menus to place an order.

735
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,980
Should I carry one around in a hall?

736
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,080
Two will be even better. Go ahead, please.

737
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,230
♫  Till then  ♫

738
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,570
♫  watch over me  ♫

739
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,620
♫  I’ll be here for dreaming  ♫

740
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:54,530
♫  Not everything can work my way  ♫

741
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:58,720
♫  That’s why it’s more fun  ♫

742
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:03,800
♫  Hardships pass just like the common cold  ♫

743
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,630
Why is he nailing this late?

744
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,230
I can't sleep because of it.

745
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,850
♫  I’m surprised at myself too, my strong heart  ♫

746
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:19,150
♫  My rising dreams have given me strength  ♫

747
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:24,600
♫  Even though I sweat, even though I sigh  ♫

748
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:31,210
♫  I need to have today in order for tomorrow  ♫

749
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:34,650
♫  So I will believe in myself  ♫

750
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:38,530
 December 1996

751
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:43,260
 In Peru, the rebels occupied the Japanese Embassy.

752
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,530
♫  Every step I take, it’ll turn into a road  ♫

753
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:53,860
♫  I’ll don’t cry for my life  ♫ 
  ♫ The world couldn't recognize my talent
  ♫

754
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:59,300
♫  The day to show the world how great I’ve become  ♫ 
 ♫ How thrilling would it be  ♫

755
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,380
♫  Till then  ♫

756
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:07,240
 But as it passed, the rebels got close to their hostages.

757
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:12,590
♫  I’ll be here for dreaming, each day I’m born again  ♫

758
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:17,830
♫  The day that I’ll shine is getting closer  ♫

759
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,350
♫  I’ll don’t cry for my life  ♫

760
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:23,200
 The rebels let the hostages send letters to their families

761
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,840
♫  The day I become the me I wanted to be  ♫ 
  ♫ I’ll laugh out loud  ♫

762
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,220
 and allowed them to receive their medicines and clothing.

763
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:40,300
 And from time to time, they revealed their identities.

764
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:48,270
 In other words, the phenomenon that perpetrators sympathize with their victims.

765
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:51,420
 It's the opposite to Stockholm Syndrome.

766
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:03,890
 We call it the Lima Syndrome.

767
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,910
Excuse me, Boss.

768
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:14,060
I told you that you couldn't use it.

769
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,490
I am so proud of you.

770
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:20,760
You made it when I failed even with my best efforts.

771
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,390
I don't care. That's embarrassing.

772
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,350
Until this shop settles down, please bear with me.

773
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,760
Only for a short period of time.

774
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,200
You should get rid of it as soon as I ask you to do so.

775
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,340
Of course!

776
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,250
Right.

777
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:51,890
Bo Ah.

778
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,180
What is it this time?

779
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,520
This one.

780
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:05,890
 I am a hostage and my boss is the captor.

781
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,750
♫  What is this?  ♫

782
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,210
♫  It doesn’t make sense  ♫

783
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,400
 The thing is my boss is not in love with me.

784
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,430
What is this?

785
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,160
It's for drawing the menus.

786
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,660

 Mister

801
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,440
 - What is wrong with it this time? 
- Follow me.

802
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,890
 You, peel the onion and grind the ginger.

803
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:33,320
 See how different it can be when you fry chickens with oil.

804
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,270
 I will have to recruit him.

805
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,900
 She will find him before her boss and sneak him away.

806
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,050
 Come with me.

807
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:42,060
 I won't do it. I have no interest in rehabilitation or whatnot.

808
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,030
 Don't you want to live a proper life again?

 Don't be sick since you're the only one on my side.

810
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,720
 Pit-a-pat, the drum, Jamyeonggo (a mythical drum that sounds an alarm when the enemy invades your territory), made a sound.

811
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,400
♫  The darkness leaves as I dream of your eyes more blinding than jewels  ♫

812
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,860
♫  I’ll hang you   ♫

813
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,420
♫  like a star in the sky of my heart  ♫

814
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:13,440
♫  Sweet days and nights, I only want to look at the heavenly you  ♫

815
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,210
♫  Baby I have a crush on you  ♫

816
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,560
♫  Will you be   ♫

817
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,390
♫  my one and only universe?  ♫

818
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:33,810
♫  So a pretty flower that resembles you ♫
♫ Can bloom the cracks of my heart  ♫

819
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:38,220
♫  You probably don’t know   ♫

820
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:42,320
♫  but you’ve become the world to someone  ♫

821
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,050
♫  Even my smallest wish   ♫

822
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:51,190
♫  has become you  ♫

823
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,310
♫  Baby I need your love  ♫

824
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,560
♫  Will you follow  ♫

825
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,320
♫   the clock hands and come here?  ♫

826
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:13,570
♫  Into this picturesque scene where your breath touches ♫
  ♫ Into our own time  ♫

827
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:23,830
♫  Into this picturesque scene where your breath touches ♫
 ♫ Into our own time  ♫

828
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:28,310
