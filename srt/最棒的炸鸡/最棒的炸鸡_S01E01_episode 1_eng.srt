6
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,220
Yes. Yes. Here we are. Please make yourself at home and enjoy looking around.

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,480
This is in a great location.

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,440
It has a wonderful view as well. And from outside, your signage for your office

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,300
will be showing well.

10
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,120
This kind of place

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,280
is not on the market often.

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,800
You don't need to look around more.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,140
I like it, but

14
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,690
- it's a little expensive. 
- What?

15
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,580
What do you think?

16
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,160
I really like it.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,130
Let's get this. We don't need to look for more.

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,300
You told me you liked the previous place and we didn't need to look for any other places.

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,560
Well, I liked that place, too, but—

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,600
You told me you liked the one before that as well. And the one before that one as well and so on.

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,780
Forget it.

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,740
No, it really is nice here though.

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,390
Do you have anything cheaper?

24
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,980
What?

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,590
It will be nice if we can find someplace as big as this.

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,990
There is one, right behind this street.

27
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,180
It's cheaper and spacious and you can use the whole building.

28
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,670
It's a pearl-in-mud (hidden gem) kind of place, but no.

29
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,590
No, no, no. Because it's located on the deep inside of the street.

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Don't even think of that place.

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,290
But you mentioned that it's so called "a pearl in mud."

32
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,970
What?

33
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,640
Show it to us. Let us decide after looking around.

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,090
I can already predict

35
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,780
what you will decide.

36
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,340
Pardon?

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,560
Then, let's go. I will show it to you

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,930
but you need to know one thing before you look at the place.

39
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,240
Don't be tempted.

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,890
- Be tempted?
 - Yes.

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,970
In that place, everything is not as it seems.

42
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,070
Don't believe your eyes. Believe me, okay!

43
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,880
Excuse me?

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,180
To be honest, that location is not totally bad.

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,120
Why those rascals there—

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,180
Those bad guys!

47
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,670
Don't ever be deceived, okay?

48
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,260
Okay? Okay? Okay.

 Again this month, there were not enough customers, so we are short on rent.

59
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,500
 I will send it to you next month

60
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,290

There are no customers coming.  It's just a false alarm.

66
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,110
Friends,

67
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,020
consider this as your jobs

68
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,550
and work diligently today.

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,540
Take it! Take it!  Take it!

72
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,520
What?

73
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,450
Agh!

74
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,500
 Under construction

75
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,770
What are you doing?  Spread it quickly!

76
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,580
Spread out more!  More! More!

77
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,050
Hey!  It's all clumped together. Geez!

78
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,730
Practice smiling 100 times.

79
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,150

80
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,540
From the main street, you just turn once to get to this street.

81
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,580
That way leads to the 4-way intersection.

82
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,740
And this is a stationery store. There is a grain shop there too.

83
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,350
Ugh! Aigoo.  There is a boutique. Okay.

84
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,490
This used to be very clean, but...

85
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,550
Look at this darn trash.  Aigoo!  Hey.  Hey.

86
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,660
This street gets lots of foot traffic.

87
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,320
This street feels cozy.

88
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,950
You even like this one? I shouldn't ask your opinion.

89
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:42,470
I mean this feels different from the crowded and cold-hearted Seoul.

90
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,670
What are you doing?

91
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,790
Since this is bothering me.  Go ahead.

92
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,330
Hey, don't do that. Don't.

93
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,730
Wow. Even a drunken person has manners in this neighborhood.

94
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,360
Wow, how could he vomit in a bag when he's so drunk?

95
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,670
No wonder.

96
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:28,190
These guys. This place is like that.

97
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,590
Liquidation?
  Liquidation with huge discount

98
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,790
Available for lease?
  Inquire for lease: No premium

99
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,560
Don't ever fall for these things, okay?

100
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,630
Yeah, those stores have been in business for

101
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,660
30, 40 years. Now the second generations are running the businesses.

102
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,140
- Really? 
- Yes.

103
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,880
The stores also get along great!

104
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,300
Is this what you call a business?

105
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,250
Sir, I'm sorry.

106
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,070
How dare you try running a business without paying me a fee for your spot, Mr. Supermarket?

107
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,030
How could I?

108
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:17,210
Business is SO bad, so—

109
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,360
Accept this.

110
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,540
My boss is not a child! This is pocket money, not enough for a fee for a spot.

111
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,720
Is this enough for it?

112
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,160
A fee for a spot? (Gangs force shop owners to pay for it. Totally illegal.)

113
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,710
How could that exist in this era?

114
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,610
What do you mean, a fee for a spot? Are you a Gumajeok (famous gangster)?

115
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,170
I've got it! I've got it. Hey! Kim Gyoo Man! Hey!

116
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,750
How could you do this? I'm so frustrated.

117
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,840
Aigoo! Aigoo!

118
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,320
- Who is Kim Gyoo Man? 
- This rascal!

119
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,260
If only my boss didn't tell us to respect old men.

120
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,890
Aigoo, this rascal! You should watch out what to say.

121
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:03,250
I'm the type of guy who doesn't just take a beating.

122
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,500
I shouldn't bother speaking! Aigoo.

123
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,230
Let's go, go.

124
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,420
That grandpa must have mistaken you for the neighborhood fool!

125
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,620
If you're talking about this guy, he's not Kim Gyoo Man, but a total gangster!

126
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,860
The neighborhood fool?

127
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,070
Are you going to do it or not? Hurry up!

128
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,880
Surely you're not doing this because you don't want to pay the fee?

129
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:38,110
If someone saw us they might mistake us for gangsters! If we weren't here, this neighborhood would have so much junk!

130
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,130
I told you to kick this one.

131
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,720
We have to sell that, bastard!

132
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,230
I got confused between this and that, I'm sorry!

133
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,670
How could you get confused between a red basket and a blue basket?!

134
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,810
Why did you do that to me?

135
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,280
What, why?

136
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,270
Over There.

137
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,260
Excuse me. Goomajeok.

138
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,000
- Yes? 
- Be grateful for that 'boss'.

139
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,300
Because at least he taught you to respect your elders.

140
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,780
If it weren't for that, I would have just—

141
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,130
What are you doing?

142
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,370
Go.

143
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,730
- Did we get caught? 
 - I don't know.

144
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,880
 Seonhwa Bathhouse

145
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Here!, Here!
  Public Bathhouse available

146
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,340
Places like these still exist today.

147
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,250
You can use this entire building,

148
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,790
but the lease conditions are very shocking! The monthly rent is very low.

149
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:05,260
After the contract, the landlord will pay for the demolition

150
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,920
so that the exterior of the bathhouse will remain after demolition.

151
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,090
That's unfortunate.

152
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,890
What? What's going on? Why is it like this?

153
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,620
We just have to change the lights!

154
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,950
Since this area will be demolished.

155
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,870
You just have a look when the light is on.

156
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,100
You're the first guests in a long time.

157
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,120
You scared me.

158
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,070
I'll say it again, don't be deluded by this!

159
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,790
I'll go with the one we saw earlier. That one on the main street, although it's expensive.

160
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,460
No, we can't make a decision that rashly.

161
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,810
It'll be considerate to her if we look at this place properly in bright lighting.

162
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,800
No, I'm perfectly fine.

163
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,980
- Do you have a ladder? 
- In the storage—

164
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,320
No, I don't have one.

165
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,470
Hyung, get down.

166
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,570
What?

167
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,540
You have to take a look too. The light is off for longer than it is on.

168
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,450
I'm really okay. I already made up my mind.

169
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,760
I'm also fine with it.

170
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:38,130
The flickering is like a club. It's nice, right?

171
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,140
You're right.

172
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,480
It's exciting?

173
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,200
Is that it?

174
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,150
We should at least catch the rats.

175
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,690
I will go with the one that was expensive on the main street.

176
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,390
Let's see. These...

177
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:27,620
you can put your stamps on after looking at the contracts separately.

178
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,090
That bathhouse is such a pain in the neck.

179
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,750
The building owner complains over the phone,

180
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,010
but I can't find a tenant for that bathhouse. What a hell of a job.

181
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,850
Where did he just go?

182
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,960
It was nice there though.

183
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,020
What? That bathhouse building?

184
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,590
Yes.

185
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:02,430
Yeah, it's just because it's on the back of a road. But it's near the subway, and the foot traffic isn't bad.

186
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:10,250
But more than anything, it comes with great lease terms.

187
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,650
By any chance, are you not thinking of the place?

188
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,840
He's an office worker. Myeongseong Group.

189
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,160
Oh, what a great place to work! Your parents must be so proud.

190
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,540
The hyung is a doctor, the younger works for a conglomerate.

191
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,500
Mr.Park, what is this?

192
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,780
 It's a resignation.

193
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,680
Why? Is it hard being at the company?

194
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,610
It's not that.

195
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:50,200
I wasn't supposed to say this, but you're the candidate for the next promotion for Asst. Manager.

196
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,900
Even if it's hard, endure a bit more. The higher ups are all supporting you.

197
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,470
I'm thankful, but I have something that I want to do

198
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,910
What is that?

199
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,690
 -Running a shop.
- Running a shop?!

200
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,550
What? Running a shop? Not a business? What are you going to sell?

201
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,260
Thanks.

202
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,410
You must be happy? Yes, have a nice day.

203
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,810
Let's go.

204
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,760
I said let's go, you waited for a while

205
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,770
Let's go eat.

206
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,200
This time, you wait.

207
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,780
For what?

208
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,520
I'll go with that place.

209
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,680
The pearl in the mud. I want that place.

210
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,610
What?

211
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,310
The pearl in the mud?

212
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,560

213
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,120
 Seonhwa Bathhouse

214
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,620

215
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:13,000
 Cashier

216
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,380
 Seonhwa Bathhouse

217
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,990
Is it going to take long?

218
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,060
No, it won't be long.

219
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,160
I'm hungry. I worked too diligently today.

220
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,120
Let's go!

221
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,740
Cheers.

222
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,720
Its good.

223
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,610
You guys went through a lot because of me.

224
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,480
There was nothing difficult,

225
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,720
but today we almost got caught, right?

226
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,970
Right? Most people turn around before even entering the bathhouse.

227
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,550
However, I think your grandpa figured it out.

228
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:38,320
I don't think your grandpa wants to take this bathhouse off of the lease listings.

229
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,270
Bo Ah, how about you start drawing webtoons again?

230
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,430
Draw webtoons? Forget it.

231
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,620
Why? Your comics were the most entertaining.

232
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,480
Bo Ah, aren't you still drawing right now?

233
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,960
- Hey! 
 - You guys didn't see when you came up?

234
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,030
There's a tablet on the counter.

235
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,190
You probably didn't want anyone to see you draw.

236
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,100
You're still drawing, right? 
 - You, just eat meat!

237
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,790
I'm not drawing.

238
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,920
I told you I wasn't going to draw again.

239
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,830
It's nice now.

240
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,820
My job is comfortable, money is coming in nicely, and I have you guys.

241
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,810
I finally feel comfortable. But what's up with my grandpa disturbing me?

242
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,230
He should've just left me alone.

243
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,990
Right, drink.

244
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,590
Let's drink.

245
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,160
You worked hard.

246
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,510
You worked hard.

247
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,650
You've worked hard.

248
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,510
What's with you?

249
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,630
This is for business, not for apartment leasing.

250
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,910
Hyung, I'll explain it to you slowly.

251
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,110
Whether it's an explanation or whatever, why would a company employee lease here?

252
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,190
First off, I'm not an employee at the company.

253
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,590
What are you doing?

254
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,240
- Did you quit the company?
 - Yes

255
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,880
Are you crazy? Do you want to see your mom faint?

256
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,460
Exactly, so keep it a secret from her. I have a plan.

257
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,160
Once my business does well, I'll tell her.

258
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,540
You can't suddenly come here and tell me you'll sign a contract. Who's plan was this?

259
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,560
Hey, you can't impulsively make a decision like that.

260
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,060
First, go home—

261
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,920
I think it's that elder. I'll talk to you at home.

262
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,370
Hey!

263
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,260
 Lease Contract

264
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,670
You have to wait a little.

265
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,120
Yes, take your time.

266
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,490
I heard you quit your job at a normal company.

267
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,190
You don't seem to have much determination.

268
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,410
Hey, don't start with that nonsense.

269
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,230
Don't get offended.

270
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,320
He's normally rash.

271
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,200
I'm okay.

272
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,190
If you're trying to run a shop to avoid working at a company, give up now.

273
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,570
I'm not running away. I quit the company a short while ago, however, I've been preparing this for a really long time.

274
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,360
What? When did you?

275
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,610
Getting my heart ready.

276
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,470
Geez, take it easy on him.

277
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,390
It was really hard to find a renter.

278
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,400
I've verified everything. Do I just stamp here?

279
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,420
Oh, yes, go ahead.

280
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,420
Wait.

281
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,970
If you are okay with it, I want to add a condition.

282
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,130
A condition?

283
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,690
It probably won't be bad for you either.

284
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,050
It's nice.

285
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,080
Aspirations or whatnot.

286
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,710
Having a sweet dream at night is enough for me.

287
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,520
That's right. As long as you like it, it's fine.

288
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,880
Hey, there's no right answer in life.

289
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,090
That's right.

290
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,660
We will help you no matter what.

291
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:43,320
If you keep doing it for a year, two years, your grandpa will change his mind.

292
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,090
 Landlord

293
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,450
Hey, speak of the devil.

294
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,030
Hey!

295
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,130
Hello?

296
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,010
Our beautiful granddaughter.

297
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,200
Grandpa, did something happen? Are you okay, did you get hurt?

298
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,520
You hurt your head, didn't you!

299
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,020
No, I'm healthy.

300
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,640
All my worries went away.

301
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,120
What?

302
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,410
The bathhouse has been leased. Even the deposit was made, that's why.

303
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,410
Aren't you mistaken?

304
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,710
Oriental medicine works—

305
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,860
Get out of my building right now!

306
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,770
Grandpa? Hello? Grandpa?

307
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,180
Grandpa? Hello? Grandpa!

308
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,550
 What is this?

309
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,310
 How is it?

310
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,750
 It's not entertaining?

311
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,010
 Well, I think I have seen this plot somewhere.

312
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,140
 Perhaps, is it because of Writer Lee Jin Sang?

313
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,240
 Yes, I'll be honest with you.

314
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,980
 Our platform has no intention of working with you, Writer Seo Bo Ah.

315
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,850
 What on Earth is this!

316
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,550
 Why are you so noisy!

317
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,940
 I said why are you so noisy!

318
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,880
What is that sound?

319
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,810
What are you doing right now?

320
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,340
Oh, hello.

321
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,350
Here are the stairs to the second floor.

322
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,730
Get out! Get out!

323
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,010
- No, no, wait a minute. 
 - Get out now!

324
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,720
Excuse me. Ouch.

325
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,620
Excuse me! Oh!

326
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,460
W-Wait!

327
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:23,170
Excuse me. I think you didn't hear me, but I'm the new tenant.

328
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,000
 Excuse me!

329
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,690
 Excuse me!

330
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,420
Oh, Min Ah! What happened? You told me I still had time left.

331
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,940
How can he barge in as soon as he signed the contract? What kind of situation is this?

332
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,870
The thing is...

333
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,440
I just heard of it right now. It's been settled like this.

334
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,850
The new tenant said that he wanted to start as soon as possible, that's why your...

335
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,250
Does that make any sense? What am I suppose to do?

336
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,030
Should I get kicked out when I'm not even ready?

337
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,310
Try dragging out some time. I'll...

338
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,750
I get it, Min Ah. Please be quick.

339
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,180
What is this?

340
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:42,060
We are getting paid today no matter what. There are no pay cuts.

341
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,360
Yes, I'm sorry.

342
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,160
Landlord, what happened—

343
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,380
Wait, don't make a fuss over something this minor.

344
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,740
Landlord.

345
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,050
What is this? Are you crazy?

346
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,440
This is still our bathhouse!

347
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,430
I'm going to call the police on you!

348
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,540
Hello? This is 112 (police station), right?

349
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,430
There's a strange person breaking down our door right now.

350
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,150
I don't know! I don't know the person!

351
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,020
Please come quickly.

352
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,070
Grandpa!

353
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,800
Grandpa, let's discuss first.

354
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,930
I have money. I didn't waste my rent money.

355
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,280
Come in. I'll get a new door, so don't worry.

356
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,890
Yes.

357
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,010
Seriously! Why are you doing this to me?

358
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,440
Landlord, please calm down.

359
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,480
You need to finish what you started.

360
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,490
You signed for the whole building, so you'll also use the second floor and the rooftop.

361
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,500
It is true, but your granddaughter seems shocked and you can slowly empty the second floor—

362
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,480
Stay out of this.

363
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:56,530
Open the door while I'm still using words.

364
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,380
This is my house! Why are you doing this?

365
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,650
How is this your house when you don't even pay rent!

366
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,780
Grandpa, you're trying to get money out of me? You normally don't seek rent for the second floor.

367
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,860
I'm going to start seeking it now. The second floor will be used by this male boss.

368
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,950
While I'm being nice, open the door.

369
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,310
I won't open it! Then, where will I live? Are you telling me to sleep on the streets?

370
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,770
Grandpa, did you pick me up from the streets (am I not your family)?

371
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,240
Either go back to live with your parents or go find your own place!

372
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,970
I won't do it! I said I won't! Just let me live like this.

373
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,870
Grandpa, why are you doing this to me? What has suddenly gotten into you?

374
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,580
Do you want to see me die?

375
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,970
You should start living like a human!

376
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,810
Until when are you going to linger in the bathhouse like a corpse and keep killing time?

377
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,560
Grandpa, what do you know to be saying this?

378
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,720
I... I also worked hard! What more do you want from me?

379
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,830
Move back. You'll get hurt.

380
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,050
Wait!

381
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,290
What's wrong with you?

382
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,780
I, well, I rented this whole building, right?

383
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,720
That's right.

384
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,100
So, you can't break down doors without my permission.

385
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,780
I told you that I was going to get you new doors. Step aside.

386
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:31,120
I like this door. It matches totally with my restaurant's concept.

387
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,320
What?

388
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:38,290
And you should remember our contract's special clause.

389
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,230
I'll try talking with your granddaughter.

390
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,860
If she understands with words, would I be making this fuss?

391
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,500
You'll regret it if you meddle in this. Just move away.

392
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,870
Elder, this is my place now.

393
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:09,220
Stop blabbering and empty out the second floor. I'll give you exactly one week.

394
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,350
You. Don't be late on rent.

395
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Of course, I won't be late at all, Elder.

396
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,240
Excuse me, you dropped your cellphone.

397
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,020
Excuse me!

398
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,720
Excuse me!

399
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:40,420

400
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,090
You're inside, right? I heard some noises just now.

401
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,560
Ah, what?

402
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,810
Come out. Grandpa left, so let's talk between us.

403
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,440
Come out? Come out where?

404
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,280
I'm going to starve to death here. So, whether you want to destroy the bathhouse or seal it here by pouring cement,

405
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
do whatever you want.

406
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm sorry. I didn't know things would turn out like this.

407
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,410
I just really like this place.

408
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:03,200
What's the point of apologizing now? I don't have anything left.

409
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,490
I'm going to get kicked out with nothing left.

410
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,130
You must think I'm pathetic, right?

411
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:24,060
Why am I making such a fuss over this bathhouse?

412
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,360
  You don't understand, right?

413
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:36,050
This bathhouse that you took from me, it's the only thing that's left for me.

414
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:41,150
Everything I wanted to do, everything I wanted to be,

415
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,890
I gave up all of those and I am left with this as my everything.

416
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,950
  Can't I just live like this?

417
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,740
  Why are people so cruel?

418
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,730
  A special clause?

419
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:04,510
  That's right. My granddaughter is hiding in the bathhouse that's even older than she is.

420
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,950
 She's not doing anything.

421
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,210
 She was a child who had lots of dreams and lots of ambitions.

422
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:14,720
 But after she started drawing manhwa or whatnot and got rejected...

423
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,220
 Yes, you must've been really worried.

424
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,520
 Rather than her close friends,

425
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,690
 once she starts to encounter other people, she may feel like living as a person again.

426
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,190
 Yes.

427
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,950
 So, since you're going to open a store and will need employees,

428
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,880
 if you use my granddaughter as a part-timer,

429
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,100
 I'll cut 500,000 won off your rent.

430
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,570
 And I'll let you add another condition.

431
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,880
 My condition?

432
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,900
 Yes, what do you want?

433
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:56,260
 Landlord, I want to do business here for a really long time.

434
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:03,540
Your grandpa gave you one week to empty out.

435
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,450
Do you have anywhere to go after a week?

436
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,010
Are you teasing me?

437
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,780
No, I need to find a place to live in too.

438
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,000
I'm living at my brother's house while walking on eggshells and troubling him.

439
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,420
That's your problem.

440
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,640
Now that you've destroyed someone else's business,

441
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,920
you want to take my place too?

442
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,780
If you need a job, I can give you one.

443
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,980
What?

444
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,500
Once my restaurant opens, I'll need part-timers.

445
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,320
Since you've lived in this neighbourhood a long time,

446
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,940
you seem like the perfect fit.

447
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,390
Perhaps, you don't want to work with me here?

448
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,080
What is he saying?

449
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,660
Forget it.

450
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,260
Excuse me! Wait a second!

451
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,910
I have your cellphone.

452
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,670
Please open up.

453
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,480
I said forget it!

454
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,700
I'm going to starve to death anyway. What's the use of a cellphone?

455
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,620
I said that your grandpa is not here.

456
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,980
I'll leave the cellphone in front of the door, so come and get it after five minutes.

457
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,630
I'm going to go home now.

458
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,190
To be honest, I can't open the door.

459
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,930
Pardon?

460
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,600
I said that I can't open the door.

461
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,270
I was afraid Grandpa was going to break it down, so I stacked some stuff up.

462
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,550
You need to reach it from the bottom.

463
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,280
You're reaching it.

464
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,720
Stretch a little more.

465
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,630
A-Almost.

466
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,150
Wait a second.

467
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,080
Your arms are too short.

468
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,250
Throw it.

469
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,050
What?

470
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,420
I said to throw it.

471
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,860
You're telling me to throw the cellphone?

472
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,510
Yes, throw it.

473
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,030
What happens if it falls?

474
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,540
It's okay. Throw it.

475
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,660
I'm really going to throw it.

476
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,260
Yes.

477
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,060
Catch it well.

478
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,380
Yes.

479
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,350
One, two, three.

480
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,490
What? You can't even throw it properly.

481
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,360
It's not that I can't throw properly, but rather I'm afraid the cellphone will fall.

482
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,710
It's fine if it falls.

483
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,850
Hurry up and throw it.

484
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,120
- I'm really going to throw it hard this time. 
 - Yes.

485
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,960
One, two, three.

486
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,300
Wait.

487
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,430
Tie it at your end.

488
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,160
Yes.

489
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,540
- Wait. 
 - What?

490
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,860
Wait a bit, I'll be back.

491
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,020
A little more.

492
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,300
Hello.

493
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,140
Cooking oil.

494
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,490
Welcome.

495
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,600
Give me one chicken.

496
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,090
How much is it?

497
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,530
It's 5,000 won.

498
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,440
Here you go.

499
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:27,370
Thank you.

500
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,120
 Mr. Journalist!

501
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,380
 Please stop it now, you must be tired from today's shoot.

502
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,450
What is this?

503
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,010
I'll talk to you later. I'm busy.

504
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:02,980
 If you give me a few names, I'll sent you their information first thing tomorrow morning.

505
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,240
 Please erase what you just recorded right now. Okay?

506
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,490
 Park Choi Go

507
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,090
♫  I like chicken, I like chicken  ♫

508
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,780
♫  I really like chicken  ♫

509
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,140
♫  A little more fry coating, a little more seasoning  ♫

510
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,850
♫  And more of soy-sauce flavor chicken  ♫

511
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,080
♫  Crispy chicken fills my mouth  ♫

512
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,730
♫  It makes me smile broadly  ♫

513
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:34,030
♫  A chubby leg, a  meaty breast  ♫

514
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,880
♫  They are the best and tastiest gift  ♫

♫  I like it, I like it, I like chicken (Yeah)  ♫

519
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,620
♫  Our ever-lasting friend  ♫

520
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,220
You're seriously amazing.

521
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,660
Okay, give it to me.

522
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,280
Let's see what kind of amazing chicken you came up with to sell.

523
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:13,420
Where are you going? You didn't fry it for me?

524
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,300
No.

525
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:19,290
Then, why did you fry it in my kitchen at this time?

526
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,020
I'm going to hire a part-timer.

527
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,590
What?

528
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,850
Pull it up.

529
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:05,650
What?

530
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,580
I said to pull it up.

531
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,980
Oh, yes.

532
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,990
What is this?

533
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,530
This is the first chicken I've fried for somebody else.

534
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,450
I'm going to open a chicken restaurant on the first floor.

535
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:29,570
Try it.

536
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,560
Once you eat it, you'll want to work with me.

537
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,790
Its not too bad.

538
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,880
What is this?

539
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:40,710
If Park Choi Go hires Seo Bo Ah as a part-time worker,

540
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:44,110
he will get ₩500,000 off his monthly rent?

541
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,460
When I open we'll need a part-time worker.

542
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:52,620
Would you by any chance want to work here?

543
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:04,620
No wonder why he yapped such nonsense.

544
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,080
What? Are you toying with a person right now?

545
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:20,380
 Wonil Real Estate Office

546
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,530
She doesn't pick up my calls and he hasn't contacted me all day.

547
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,430
Is she really alright?

548
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,310
 Bo Ah

549
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,920
Why couldn't we reach you? Do you know how worried we were?

550
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,150
 It's Bo Ah.

551
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,700
I had a situation, that's why.

552
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,210
But what was that? If I become a part-time worker, ₩500,000?

553
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,650
Is that important right now?

554
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:45,310
What?

555
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,640
Didn't you read the whole message I sent?

556
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,200
Did you not check the length of the lease on the contract?

557
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,010
Wait a minute.

558
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,990
 Lease for 30 years

559
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,810
The lease term is 30 years?

560
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:07,050
Yeah! I thought about ways that you could get the bathhouse back.

561
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,590
There's no other method.

562
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:11,220
Unless his business fails and he leaves on his own two feet,

563
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:16,340
we won't be able to push him out. That's how the contract was made. The landlord can't kick him out arbitrarily.

564
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,580
Hello? Hey.

565
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,170
Seo Bo Ah, hey.

566
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,790
Are you listening, Seo Bo Ah?

567
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,360
Hello?

568
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,970
So what it means is this is the only way, right?

569
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,680
No. There's no way at all.

570
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,680
You just said it right now.

571
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,170
He just has to fail and he needs to leave on his own two feet.

572
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:45,030
That's what I'm saying. So it's not too late to get some purified water and pray.

573
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:48,580
Hope that his chicken tastes bad and that his business fails!

574
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,280
Well, his chicken is okay.

575
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,340
What are you saying? How would you know that?

576
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,090
It's not a problem that will be solved if I just get some pure water and pray.

577
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,350
 Barun Chicken

578
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,850
 Refreshing Bath/ Barun Chicken

579
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,650
Let's wash up.

580
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,270
What?

581
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,220
- Hey, I'll— 
 - Oh?

582
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,290
What?

583
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,450
It's changed a lot.

584
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,010
It seems totally new

585
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,790
I think it did change.

586
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,670
Welcome. It's just you too, right

587
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,140
Yes, but

588
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,780
Come this way.

589
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,600
Go, go.

590
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,950
Isn't this a bathhouse?

591
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,030
Would you like to order?

592
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,050
Order?

 The Best Chicken

599
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,240
 Ten thousand won an hour, with no probation period.

600
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,130
 Good. Can't you do it one more time?

601
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,620
 Boss, Boss, Boss.

602
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,950
Just by looking at it, the feeling came!

603
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,300
How is this chicken?

604
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,980
You still don't have the basic understanding of the ingredients.

605

 What were you doing so excitedly?  
One, two, three!

 No, how could that be?!

607

 Running a business must be interesting to you.

608

 Let's go!

609
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,660
 This won't do.

610
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,380
 We need something special.

611
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,610
 Fail it. Fail it.

612
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:20,470
