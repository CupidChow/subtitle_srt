00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
 The Best Chicken

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,610
 Park Sun Ho

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,570
 Kim So Hye

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,560
 Joo Woo Jae

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,970

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,540
 The public bath house has gone under contract. Get out.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,490
 Grandpa!

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,500
 I'm going to open a chicken place on the first floor here.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,670
 How about you work here with me?

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,440
 - There needs to be some special action taken. 
 - Vicious girl.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,700
 Ms. Seo Bo Ah! What is this!

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,950
 Go out of business! Become destroyed!

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
 I always heard from others asking me why I looked so terrible when I used to work at the office.

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,810
 - One, two, three. 
- But now, just being alive is fun.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,410
 How the hell is this chicken!

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,400
 You have no understanding of ingredients yet.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,010
 Do you know about the chicken quality test competition?

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,110
 There needs to be a surefire method.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,820
 The final winner is Seo Bo Ah!

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,200
 It's the end of the world for sure. Lee Jin Sang is working as a model.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,240
 People already decided for themselves it wasn't plagiarism.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,760
 I have no interest in the things of others unlike you, Sunbae.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,700
 My heart skips a beat for just any man.

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,250
 How frying chicken in oil can be so different.

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,080
 Wow.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,840
 I couldn't find him, even though I combed the entire neighborhood.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,200
 Don't be sick because you, Bo Ah, are the only one on my side.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,620
 Thump. Thump. My self-beating drum has been beaten.

29
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,440
 I, Andrew Kang, am offering to work here, starting today. b

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,340
 I want to cook again.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,370
Thanks to you.

32
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,550
Because of me?

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,690
I want to live properly once more.

34
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,090
For the past month, nothing has gone my way.

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,260
Dang it! Why is this happening?!

36
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,970
I've already used up all my energy for the day.

37
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,560
I guess I should go to work to rest.

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,480
No way!

39
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,250
 Episode 5 
 The Young Prince and Star of Capitalism

40
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,150
Bo Ah?

41
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,630
 Butcher Shop

42
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,880
Min Ah!

43
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,150
What are you doing at this hour?

44
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,750
- Are you busy right now?
 - What?

45
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,970
Come with me.

46
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,400
Wait. Hold on!

47
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,400
What is it?

48
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,660
I thought it was Bo Ah. I guess I heard wrong.

49
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,220
- Wash your hands. 
- Excuse me?

50
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,010
You touched your hair; go wash your hands.

51
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,280
Ah.

52
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,300
Make long knife strokes and pull out the bones.

53
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,200
How?

54
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,300
Like this?

55
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,360
Are we making boneless chicken or a rag here?

56
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,460
Take a knife and shatter the chicken bone.

57
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,570
So the bone breaks. Use your strength!

58
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,150
Unlike usual, you're spending an awful lot of money.

59
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,560
Which one's better?

60
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,070
I like this one. But what will you do?

61
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,210
You're committing a big sin against the Seo Bo Ah of next month,

62
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,540
Seo Bo Ah of this month.

63
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,550
No, that's not it. The hard work is done by the Seo Bo Ah of last month,

64
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,010
and the Seo Bo Ah of this month is having a fun.

65
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,300
I got my paycheck. So much money, I'm rich.

66
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,750
Not a boss, but a beggar, I see?

67
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,330
Teacher!

68
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,700
Andrew Kang.

69
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,830
Oh, Andrew.

70
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,920
If you subtract rent, paycheck for the part-timer, and the costs for the ingredients,

71
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,150
that leaves you at around minus ₩2,000,000. How long can you last?

72
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,300
Maybe around three months? Before then we need to start making profit.

73
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,560
Only three months?

74
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,790
You think it won't work?

75
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,630
If people only try your chicken, the word of mouth will—

76
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,820
In the foodservice industry, we have this saying.

77
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,110
No matter how good the food you're selling is, it takes at least six months until the customers recognize it as such.

78
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,180
It takes that long?

79
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,010
It could be longer or shorter than that. People just say that.

80
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,840
Then, what should we do?

81
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,020
Well, we'll hope for good fortune

82
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,490
so our chicken can be quickly recognized by customers.

83
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,180
Or try what you can to get that recognition.

84
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,520
 It's a tradition to buy red underwear for your parents when you get the first paycheck.

85
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,760
It's not even cold yet, but that little one...

86
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,650
I guess I can use it as a towel for my feet.

87
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,550
Just meet him directly.

88
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,370
No!

89
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,610
You know the saying, right? Killing your enemy with kindness.

90
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,740
That's what I'm doing.

91
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,890
How can you call your grandfather an enemy?

92
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,820
It's just how the saying goes.

93
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,430
You know, that's why I decided to use a bit of my consideration. I call him a hateful person.

94
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,430
I've bought too much corn for an old man living alone.

95
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,820
May the neighbors take it.

96
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,230
Wonder whose grandfather it is?

97
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,300
He's exactly like someone I know.

98
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,260
Is that what you tell a friend?

99
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,390
Yes.

100
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,390
What? What a great sense you have!

101
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,070
Wow!

102
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,590
I really wanted this! Thanks, Bo Ah.

103
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,010
Yeah, Bo Ah thank you so much.

104
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,560
I feel satisfied with all the evil deeds I did in your stead all these years.

105
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,450
What about you, Min Ah?

106
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,760
- Whoa, is that real gold? 
- Of course.

107
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,660
Oh, 18K!

108
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,250
Ah, 14K?

109
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,230
- 10K.
 - It's 10K gold?

110
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,400
Hey! It is gold.

111
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,950
But should you really be spending this much money?

112
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,870
Of course!

113
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,610
I get ₩10,000 an hour.

114
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,320
Have you ever earned more than ₩1,500,000 in a month?

115
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
The quality of life changes completely!

116
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,500
My grandfather does things like owning a public bathhouse. Such an anachronism. That's why he sucks at making money!

117
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,420
I want to open up a coffee shop quickly, and in a month...

118
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,090
I will earn more than ₩2,000,000 a month. You have never earned that much, have you?

119
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
You have?!

120
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,110
- Even you?!
 - What about me?

121
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,920
Hey, out of all of you guys, can't you see I am the most fashionable?

122
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,940
Can't you see?

123
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,040
Hold on.

124
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,120
Bo Ah, you have money.

125
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,630
Can't you make time for three days and two nights?
 - Three days and two nights?

126
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,300
Yeah. Let's all go on vacation with this opportunity.

127
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,490
You've never ridden on an airplane, right?

128
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,420
Hey, why would Bo Ah go on a trip?

129
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,000
Right. Remember when we dragged her along five years ago to Busan?

130
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,220
She's the one who will have the most fun,

131
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,110
and yet she'll keep saying that she likes home best. Again and again.

132
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,860
Her week is just going

133
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,310
from the first floor, second floor, first, second,

134
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,590
the realtor, second floor, first floor.

135
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,300
Should I go?

136
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,810
What?

137
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,960
Let's go.

138
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,260
Why not? Vacation. That's not a big deal.

139
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,960
Wow, no way!

140
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,880
Are we really going to Jeju-do together?

141
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,650
But do you have enough money for an airplane ticket?

142
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,590
If we add the accommodations and other expenses, it'll be kinda significant.

143
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,710
You've already spent too much this month.

144
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,320
Then I will just make do for three months.

145
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,710
What if the restaurant goes bankrupt within three months?

146
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:32,800
Then according to the way things are going at the restaurant, it doesn't look like it'll go bankrupt immediately.

147
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,920
Even if it goes under slowly, as long as it goes under. It will work.

148
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,520
You're confused. And it started already.

149
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,060
What?

150
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,120
Do you know the story about the little prince?

151
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,000
Of course, that's where the boa constrictor appears, right?

152
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,160
But why?

153
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,660
In that story, a little prince tames a fox.

154
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,100
"Taming" can be explained this way.

155
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,840
Every month, the fox gets paid.

156
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,060
Then you'd be happy from the 25th.

157
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,760
Getting happier as the last day of the month approaches.

158
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:53,540
When the last day finally comes, your heart would be beating and you wouldn't be able to sit still.

159
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:09,340
The fox who has a taste of money can never return to being a wild fox.

160
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,350
She will have surrendered completely to capitalism.

161
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,090
What happens to the tamed fox?

162
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,540
What do you think?

163
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,890
After being tamed...

164
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,880
She gets abandoned.

165
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,180
What?

166
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,300
The little prince found his first love, arose, and returned to his own star.

167
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,100
That bastard.

168
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,620
Anyway, you should be careful. Being a slave to capitalism isn't anything hard, you know.

169
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:52,390
Getting paid. Paying installments. That's being tamed into capitalism.

170
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,720
I heard the little prince was a classic. So that was what it was about?

171
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,910
How profound.

172
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:08,570
I only read the beginning. So I thought it was about how the boa constrictor ate the elephant.

173
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:14,780
What's for sure is that once you get tamed, you'll be someone in a super weak position.

174
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,870
When will I be abandoned? Walking on ice. Trying to scope out the good side of your boss.

175
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,340
No way. Would my boss really fire me?

176
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,420
That I don't know. But you get ₩10,000 an hour.

177
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,800
Setting up a cafe is over since the chicken place will do great.

178
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,750
Then if you get fired from the chicken place,

179
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,760
you'll be a part-timer earning ₩7530 per hour (minimum wage in Korea).

180
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,150
Are you confident that you'll be able to work just as well as you are now without sucking up your boss?

181
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,800
Why don't you instead get the three-month installment plan from us?

182
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,840
This month, me. Next month, Young Ho. Then the next month, Gyu Man. With no interest.

183
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,800
Alright.

184
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,740
I came back to my senses now.

185
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,110
Yeah! He can't kick out the goose laying golden eggs.

186
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,210
Of course not.

187
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,630
Bo Ah, what is all of this?

188
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,190
I found them on the way here.

189
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,340
I'm going to eat all by myself, so don't ask.

190
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,130
- I'm not... 
- Bastard.

191
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,530
Excuse me?

192
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,740
- Oh, right. Good thing I met you because I have something to say.
 - What is it?

193
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm going to take a vacation. Two nights and three days.

194
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,150
It doesn't matter if you don't let me.

195
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,140
I don't care what you think and I will not be tamed!

196
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,260
What do you mean?

197
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,930
Anyway, two nights and three days. Yes or no?

198
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,730
Sure, go ahead.

199
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,510
Are you busy right now?

200
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,990
Why?

201
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,690
I want to change the recipe starting today. Want a taste?

202
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,580
What is this?

203
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,550
How is it?

204
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,370
Well it's...

205
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,820
How do you make this? It's even better than Edward's—

206
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,120
It tastes much better, right?

207
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,020
It's not Edward, it's Andrew.

208
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,750
How did you make this?

209
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,120
From beginning to end, just like Anthony said.

210
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,330
So from cutting the raw chicken, seasoning the chicken, to making the batter,

211
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,220
I did it all myself.

212
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,430
It's not Anthony, it's Andrew.

213
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,740
Even if it takes more work, it tastes much better.

214
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,000
What can I say compared to what we did before? Umm, that the level of quality is totally different?

215
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,910
Alexander, what kind of person were you?

216
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,390
That Michelin something. Was that for real?

217
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,770
Alex...

218
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,140
Who do you think is Alexander?

219
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,750
He was a great king.

220
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,060
It's Andrew, Andrew. Andrew!

221
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,160
 Barun Chicken

222
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,860
How can there be no customers even when I've changed the recipe?

223
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,060
I just keep getting calls that I can't answer.

224
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,680
 Why are you leaving this perfectly fine company?

225
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,360
 Are you out of your mind?

226
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,280
 I started a business.

227
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,930
 You started it?

228
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,790
 Son, just come back to the company.

229
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,070
 Go find your boss or CEO and—

230
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,020
 - Just wait for three months.
 - What?

231
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,220
 In three months, I'll make it into a restaurant good enough to persuade you.

232
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,650
 I'll explain everything later.

233
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,020
 There's a saying in the foodservice industry.

234
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,890
 No matter how good the product, the customers will recognize it only after

235
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,980
 at least six months.

236
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,520
 It takes that long?

237
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,420
 It could be longer or shorter than that.

238
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,200
 Everyone just says that.

239
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,530
 Then, what should we do?

240
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,210
 We'll have to hope for good fortune

241
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,630
 so that our chicken gets recognized by customers quickly.

242
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,100
 Or you can go at least throw yourself at it as best you can.

243
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,570
 Throw myself?

244
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,540
 Right. For example, making deliveries.

245
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,430
What is this?

246
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,500
The fox goes out of her way first, to be tamed!

247
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,430
What's with her?

248
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,730
The ones who suck at looking at men are the problem.

249
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,130
Well, she's the one who is screwing up her own life. Who's to stop her?

250
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,110
Boss!

251
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,500
What are you doing down there?

252
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,680
Sorry about that. It was loud, wasn't it?

253
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,580
You didn't wake up because of me, right?

254
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,850
Why would I not?

255
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,090
♫  What is happening?  ♫

256
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,640
♫  It doesn't make any sense  ♫

257
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,480
Ah, really. Why can't you just properly ride a bike?!

258
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,790
♫  You don’t even know that the reason I smile is you  ♫

259
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,890
Move.

260
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,160
Yes.

261
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,310
Get on.

262
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,760
♫  Without a word, like magic,   ♫

263
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,960
♫  you colored my heart  ♫

264
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
What are you doing?

265
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,990
Oh, right.

266
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,200
Watch carefully.

267
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,520
This is how you ride a bicycle.

268
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,830
Alright.

269
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,400
♫  If it’s alright with you, I hope it’ll be you  ♫

270
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,190
♫  Baby I have a crush on you  ♫

271
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,610
♫  Will you be   ♫

272
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,150
♫  my one and only universe?  ♫

273
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,490
♫  So a pretty flower that resembles you  ♫

274
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,440
♫  Can bloom the cracks of my heart  ♫

275
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,460
See that? That's how you ride a bike.

276
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,090
Okay.

277
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,700
Here, get on.

278
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,100
You're supposed to fall down and get up over and over.

279
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,970
Here.

280
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,400
Alright, let's go.

281
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,600
Go!

282
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,940
No, you can do this.

283
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,130
- Slow down, slow down.
 - Okay, okay.

284
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,230
Keep holding on.

285
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,210
I am.

286
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,640
You're doing it.

287
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,600
- Are you holding on?
 - Yes!

288
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
- You can't let go.
 - I won't let go.

289
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,780
I'm holding on.

290
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,830
- Are you holding on?
 - Yes, I'm holding on.

291
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,310
- You're holding on, right? 
 - Yes, I am.

292
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,920
I didn't let go.

293
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,670
What?

294
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,530
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

295
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm holding on to it.

296
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,800
Keep holding on.

297
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,430
You're doing it! You got it!

298
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,020
- I don't think so. 
 - I think you're doing great.

299
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,400
If you can just just get over this hurdle, you'll be great.

300
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,430
It's working.

301
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,970
Bo Ah, I think I'm doing it.

302
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,780
You're doing well.

303
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,310
- Am I doing it right? 
 - Yes, you're doing great.

304
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,440
How am I?

305
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,110
Wow, you're really good.

306
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,710
This is all thanks to you, Bo Ah.

307
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,470
Excuse me.

308
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,340
Would you like some corn?

309
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,810
♫  Into this picturesque scene where your breath touches  ♫

310
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:37,980
♫  Into our own time  ♫

311
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,430
Why did you ride a bike all of a sudden

312
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,210
so early in the morning?

313
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,460
To be honest, I was thinking about doing deliveries from now on.

314
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,360
Deliveries? By bike?

315
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Are you Um Bok Dong, Korean cyclist, or something?

316
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,540
A what?

317
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,740
There's something like that, the king of bicycling.

318
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,170
That's not it.

319
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,250
I thought about learning to ride a scooter.

320
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,910
They say it's easy to learn when you know how to ride a bike.

321
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,680
How do you not know how to ride a bike at your age?

322
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,620
Right.

323
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,230
If it was part of my performance exams, I would've ridden like an athlete.

324
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,350
What?

325
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,870
My mom is something you might call a helicopter mom.

326
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,560
Anyway, she's something.

327
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,360
If it had been part of my school grades, whether it be sending me to a bicycling institution,

328
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,800
or teach me herself,

329
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,820
she's someone who would've done that.

330
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,270
Someone like that

331
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:52,080
stayed calm even though you were quitting your corporate job to set up a chicken joint?

332
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,350
It was a secret at first,

333
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,620
but I got caught a few days ago.

334
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,250
The day that I was running away by going into the mountains.

335
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,900
I promised her on that day

336
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,400
that I will have it get on track in three months

337
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,590
and get recognition from her.

338
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,620
But I should've said it would take six.

339
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,090
You ride the bike really well.

340
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,770
Who taught you?

341
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,820
Your grandfather?

342
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,210
My mother.

343
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,770
If I also sucked at riding a bike,

344
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,350
she said people would be able to tell I grew up without a dad.

345
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,600
Did your father pass away when you were young?

346
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,750
I don't know if he's alive or not.

347
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,940
I wish we'd have some customers tomorrow.

348
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,470
I'm really desperate.

349
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,940
I'm also desperate.

350
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,360
 Barun Chicken

351
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,690
Welcome.

352
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,730
Would you follow me this way?

353
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,540
Are you ready to order?

354
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,870
Fried chicken, please.

355
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,160
Right away.

356
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,960
- Here's your order. 
 - Thank you.

357
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,360
Please enjoy.

358
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,400
No. I can't be happy.

359
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,330
Welcome.

360
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,950
Please come this way.

388
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,080
Yes!

389
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,390
  Today we have closed because we ran out of stock.

390
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,120
This is a first.

391
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,720
That we close because we are sold out.

392
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,360
Boss.

393
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,890
Did you do something without my knowledge?

394
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,320
What?

395
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,770
Like paying someone to display ads on their blogs.

396
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,720
Where would this beggar boss have money to do so?

397
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,200
Who is calling whom a beggar?

398
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,300
- What? 
 - Nothing.

399
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,940
I don't know what happened,

400
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,220
but I wish every day was like today.

401
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,560
Right.

402
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,690
If it was, then our business will settle down in no time

403
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,610
since my recipe is perfect.

404
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,800
No matter what, I think it was because you promoted us so much

405
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,160
that now the effects are finally showing.

406
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,260
Thank you. Bo Ah.

407
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,650
Well...

408
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,450
Then tomorrow

409
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,080
we'd better prepare twice as much.

410
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,990
Yes.

411
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,830
Then, shall we get started?

412
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,410
Twice as much?

413
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,710
How will you sell all that?

414
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,000
I don't know where the water came from,

415
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,830
but it's time to get paddling while the water is coming in.

416
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,120
You come along as well. Even three are not enough.

417
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,600
If we are to prepare twice as much, we'll stay up all night.

418
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,750
Why would I?!

419
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,610
It's past the time I should get off work.

420
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,790
Boss, you know I'm going on vacation starting tomorrow, right?

421
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,220
Vacation?

422
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,060
Customers are just starting to come to our store and you want to go on vacation?

423
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,720
The boss already gave his permission, so what's it to you, Andy?

424
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,770
It's not Andy!

425
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,200
Eric is right. Could you postpone your vacation for a few days?

426
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,880
You like mythology?

427
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,050
I told you my name's Andrew! Andrew!

428
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,190
Boss.

429
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,520
I mean just in case that customers come again like today.

430
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,950
If you aren't here, it will be hard to handle.

431
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,990
Can't you postpone it?

432
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,600
No, I can't.

433
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,720
Then I'm off.

434
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,000
What was with today?

435
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,920
Was it the nine nine day (consuming chicken or eggs)?

436
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,650
 Nine nine day?

437
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,810
I mean like a day to eat chicken.

438
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,910
 That's on the 9th of September.

439
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,730
-  But were there really a lot of people?  
 - Yes.

440
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,620
We changed the recipe and they were so excited and

441
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,510
they were crazily preparing chicken you know?

442
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,930
I warned them not to overreact but they wouldn't listen.

443
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,250
One table a day? Two tables?

444
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,940
Then they would never come again.

445
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,990
 So how much did you sell today?

446
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,730
We sold everything.

447
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,900
 Really? So suddenly?

448
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,410
But this could be turning their misfortune into a blessing.

449
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,130
 Why?

450
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,800
Now the two of them will try to sell twice as much.

451
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,150
They cut the raw chicken, then salt them until dawn.

452
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,650
But will those sell?

453
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,560
We were just lucky for a day.

454
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,190
I know, right?

455
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,030
What kills a human is

456
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,860
not desperation, but false hope.

457
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,700
That's what I'm saying.

458
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,450
I did everything like you told me.

459
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,170
 Easy, right? Absolutely comfortable?

460
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,390
Yes, awesome.

461
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,600
What should I do? I'm so excited.

462
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,920
Goodness, you wench.

463
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,490
You were the one to be the most excited when we do go. Why'd you act like that before?

464
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,610
What should we eat when we get there?

465
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,990
When we go to Jeju Island.

466
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,050
I saw on the internet the millet rice cakes and, oh yeah, and black pig!

467
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,520
 What else was there?

468
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,100
Don't worry.

469
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,430
I told Gyoo Man to do his best with plans for the meals.

470
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,980
So smart.

471
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,240
It's the first time I'm taking a plane.

472
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,020
I'm so excited.

473
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,270
Again?!

474
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,060
Please enjoy.

475
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,560
It's barely lunchtime and already...

476
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,290
The store's in this situation.

477
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,040
Must you go on vacation?

478
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,000
I mean, I already got the plane ticket.

479
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,380
Bo Ah.

480
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,330
Don't worry and have fun.

481
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,750
What?

482
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,140
Thankfully it's Sunday, so I can ask my brother to come and help out.

483
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,500
Will you really be alright?

484
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,930
You have worked hard for the last month

485
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,960
and now just take two days off.

486
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,030
I thought about it last night.

487
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,440
I feel like I've said too much last night and just made you uncomfortable.

488
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,810
No, it wasn't quite that bad.

489
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,890
Alex and I can do it.

490
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,960
As non-sense as non-existent Alex is watering a pot.

491
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,750
Bo Ah,

492
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,690
just have a good time.

493
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,290
Welcome!

494
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,260
Why isn't she coming?

495
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,040
She wouldn't have overslept, right?

496
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,530
The bus! Call her quickly!

497
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,040
She's not picking up.

498
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,140
Dear driver!

499
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,850
One person is still missing.

500
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,650
Then take the next one.

501
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,670
Guys!

502
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,780
Come quickly!

503
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,110
Run! Hurry!

504
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,980
Hurry! 
  Airport Limousine

505
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,770
What's wrong?

506
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,800
I mean.

507
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,240
Yesterday you sounded so excited that you could even fly without an airplane.

508
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,210
Why are you so listless today?

509
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,320
Why?

510
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,190
Are you scared of getting on an airplane?

511
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,020
No. I'm super excited.

512
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,230
Once you are inside the plane, you will know it's no big deal.

513
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,630
To Jeju Island,

514
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,320
you go up

515
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,300
and then as soon as you sit down, you get off.

516
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,280
But if we go to Europe,

517
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,080
it easily takes up to 13 hours—

518
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,900
Hey!

519
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,800
Okay.

520
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,100
Let's all go to sleep.

521
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,720
We have to recharge in order to play all night.

522
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,010
When we get off as soon as our butts hit the seats after we take off,

523
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,090
how can you bring so many things?

524
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,510
If we go to Europe,

525
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,630
then the preparations you don't normally make in daily life—

526
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,270
Wanna die or shut up?

527
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,180
I will shut up.

528
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,880
♫  On an especially dark night, the lone moon was so pretty  ♫

529
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,730
♫  You were the one who knocked on my shriveled heart  ♫

530
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,670
♫  You shook me up like the blowing wind  ♫

♫  My once blank face is now filled with smiles  ♫

535
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,250
♫  You throw these emotions that will never come again into my heart  ♫

536
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:24,240
♫  The warm season that I thought would never come into my heart again  ♫

537
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,600
♫  with you who flew like a butterfly  ♫

538
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,080
Serving for the first time is not easy.

539
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,880
What if a lot of customers flood into the store?

540

♫  Because you and I  ♫

548
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,770

What's with the heavy sigh when we are going on a trip?

554
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,380
♫  When I’m with you  ♫

555
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,400
Why? Is it because of the chicken restaurant?

556
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,560
Were there a lot of people today as well?

557
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,340
Yes. At least when I left.

558
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,800
Don't worry. By now, there won't be many left.

559
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,150
Probably.

560
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,330
Want to find out? How it is now?

561
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,990
How?

562
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,680
What the? Why are there so many people?

563
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,000
Is this really the right restaurant?

564
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,180
Why are there so many even at this time?

565
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,530
Look around.

566
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,920
What is this?

567
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,720
Amazing.

568
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,580
Can you take a look outside?

569
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,660
We're a party for four.

570
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,260
Look at the SNS.

571
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,990
Take a picture.

572
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,680
Shall we go play pool?

573
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,340
I'm sorry.

574
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,800
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

575
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,360
Sorry.

576
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,080
How can you place that dirty stuff on the plate?!

577
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,380
I'm sorry, customer.

578
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,880
You can't tell the difference between heaven and earth.

579
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,150
You send the dork on vacation and bring in an imbecile instead?

580
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,890
What did he do now?

581
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,700
Redo the fried chicken for table four.

582
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,560
Ah, he dropped it.

583
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,390
Excuse me. We ordered beer earlier.

584
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,540
Ah, yes. I'll bring it.

585
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,580
At least one person is on our side.

586
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,310
What?

587
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,280
This one. The Chinese medicine doctor.

588
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,430
I'm sorry.

589
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,640
I guess being good at studying is one thing and being an efficient worker is another thing.

590
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,430
Right?

591
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,250
Bo Ah.

592
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,330
Don't be sick.

593
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,290
You are the only one by my side.

I wish that customers will come tomorrow.

596
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,400
I'm really desperate.

597
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,690
♫  I’m getting a strange energy
 Awakening my lurking dream  ♫

598
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,720
Was I tamed?

599
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,090
What?

600
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,470
Nothing.

601
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,350
Someone definitely spent money for this.

602
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,790
Otherwise, it doesn't make sense. How can the store which barely had customers for a month

603
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,000
attract this many customers in two days?

604
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,920
But, don't worry.

605
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,070
It doesn't matter if it was an ad on a blog or SNS, the effect will disappear quickly.

606
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:27,990
You'll get recharged in Jeju-do. Then, destroy that place after you come back.

607
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,980
That damn chicken restaurant.

Don't mind it and just go to sleep.

We can't do anything about it now.

611
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,630

Pardon?

622
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:28,190
You only partially covered the chicken with batter. The chicken meat is all ruined. Would you pay your own money for this?

623

Here's the chicken.

628

We ordered garlic chicken, though?

00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,050
Yes!

647
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,580
What happened to your vacation?

648
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:39,950
I don't know! The flight was canceled!

649
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,960
What are you talking about, when the weather is this nice?

650
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,950
Why ask me?! Ask the plane!

651
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,800
You turned the restaurant into a mess. What did you do right?

652
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,560
♫  Will you be my one and only universe?  ♫

653
00:50:55,330 --> 00:51:01,090
♫  So a pretty flower that resembles you
 Can bloom the cracks of my heart  ♫

654
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,210
What? Bo Ah got off?

655
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,130
Yes.

656
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,860
So we are going by ourselves to Jeju? Why?

657
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,890
I sent someone to go look, but the chicken place is overrun with customers.

658
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,780
The restaurant is packed. And the line in front of the store—

659
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,690
At this rate, the restaurant is going to be a huge success.

660
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,890
So? She was on vacation.

661
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:26,590
That's what I'm saying. It's good that there are too few to help out.

662
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:29,090
Why would she go back to help them?

663
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,360
Do you think she would go back to help?

664
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,720
If the chicken is tasty, the service has to be terrible to earn malicious comments.

665
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,930
It was a mess already,

666
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,820
but it seems that she really needed to be directly involved, for her to feel relief.

667
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,230
If she didn't know, that would be different, I guess.

668
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:53,040
Figures. If the store is doing well, she wouldn't be comfortable playing around even she goes on a trip.

669
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,280
Our pitiful Bo Ah.

670
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,430
She wasn't able to take the plane this time either.

671
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:04,960
But going by ourselves...

672
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,800
Is a bit...

673
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,380
- Shall we get off?
 - Shall we?

674
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,120
Let's go.

675
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,220
It was really delicious.

676
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,300
Ah, I see.

677
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,650
To be honest I came all the way from Gyeonggi-do.

678
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,000
But the line was so long, so I thought about leaving.

679
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,610
You're from Gyeonggi-do? How did you know about us and come all the way here?

680
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,050
I saw the comic.

681
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,380
The comic?

682
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,260
Didn't you know?

683
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,780
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

684
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,450
It's going crazy on the internet right now.

685
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,200
What are they thinking.

686
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,330
Crazy. Who would eat after seeing this? Way to kill an appetite.

687
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,750
The pamphlets are terrible. The CEO is a complete idiot.

688
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,980
The poor chicken mom. ㅠㅠ

689
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,010
The pamphlets are quite creative.

690
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,790
 At least I agree on that. Still, the chicken on the pamphlet is pitiful.

691
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,200
Son, that doesn't mean you won't eat it, right? It's chi-lellujah. (It's an absolute yummy thing).

692
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,140
 That's true, but I wish to buy the eyes which didn't see this Manhaw.

693
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,410
I am kind of curious about this restaurant.

694
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,210
But where is this?

695
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,000
Did someone try going there?

696
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,500
I'm curious as well. Is it tasty?

697
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,670
I bet it's 100% tasteless.

698
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,980
It should be revealed by now.

699
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,940
Didn't anyone try it yet?

700
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,270
Woah, it really doesn't exist.

701
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,190
If more than 50 people like my comment, I'll try it.

702
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,330
You must take a photo to prove you were there.

703
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:18,020
- Yoojin let's go there. 
 - You good?

704
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,710
Thank you.

705
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,160
Yes, this is the Refreshing Bath Chicken restaurant.

706
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,250
Hello, this is a show about delicious restaurants, "Yum Yum Slurp Slurp."

707
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,830
I am contacting you after seeing the famous internet pamphlet.

708
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,780
What?!

709
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,510
Are you the owner by any chance?

710
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,190
We don't do those things.

711
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:00,620
Still, if you come to our program just once,

712
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,170
it will garner more publicity than you anticipate, Ms. Owner.

713
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,350
We only win (customers) through taste!

714
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,460
So forget it! Don't call us again!

715
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,590
That's why I can't trust such programs.

716
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,300
Bo Ah. What was the call about?

717
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,100
It was voice phishing.

718
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,120
What did I do to deserve this?

719
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:35,660
Hello? Hello?

720
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,210
Darling, did they just hang up? They don't want to appear on TV?

721
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,430
Yes. They said they only win through taste

722
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,270
and not to call them again.

723
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,510
Oh my, then they really are a tasty place.

724
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,330
Really?

725
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,680
You've really caught a big fish.

726
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,790
It's really hard to find a tasty place that hasn't been on television, you know.

727
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:01,770
In truth, there are no reviews. So I was thinking of just giving up.

728
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:08,550
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

729
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,950
Then I'll go there, instead of the army stew place (stew with spicy sauce, sausage, meat and beans)&gt;

730
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,570
Refreshing Bath Chicken.

731
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:20,140
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

732
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,260
Table five wants half spicy, half fried chicken.

733
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,690
Boss Park, two fried chicken for table two.

734
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,780
Seven. Soy sauce chicken. Lots of sauce.

735
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,820
What do I do?

736
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,630
Why? What's the problem?

737
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,430
We are sold out?!

738
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,220
We prepared twice as much though!

739
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,360
I'm sorry, we ran out of ingredients we prepared for today.

740
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,670
I'm truly sorry.

741
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,260
How could it be?

742
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,630
We waited for an hour.

743
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:58,500
If you come again tomorrow, we will make sure to make delicious chicken for you.

744
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,180
I'm truly sorry.

745
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,820
I apologize.

746
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,900
I'm truly sorry. I'm sorry.

747
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,050
At this early hour?

748
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,220
I'll make delicious chicken if you come again.

749
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,850
Take care. I'm sorry.

750
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,710
I will come back.

751
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,250
Goodbye.

752
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,650
I feel like I could die.

753
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,500
You worked hard.

754
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,450
You must be kidding. Because of this guy, our plates and cups had quite a hard time.

755
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:38,270
Not quite. They were just shattered into bits and pieces.

756
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:42,800
Today, well, you worked hard, part-timer.

757
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,870
Bo Ah, thank you.

758
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:53,560
Why do you keep saying thank you? I told you the flight was canceled.

759
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,460
Even so.

760
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,700
It was hard, but I am happy.

761
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:07,000
What do you mean, 'happy'. I'm so worried.

762
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:12,530
When I worked for the company, I was tired and work was just hard.

763
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,790
That's what I'm feeling like right now, you know?

764
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,580
Do you like it that much?

765
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,320
Yes.

766
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:32,400
Oh well, I'm glad at least you're happy about it.

767
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:37,920
But Bo Ah, where were you going, dressed so prettily?

768
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,530
What?

769
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,920
To Jeju island with friends.

770
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,820
What? Are you hitting on her now?

771
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,030
No, that's not it!

772
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:54,080
I'm sorry, but today we're...

773
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,990
No way. This is your store?

774
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,640
Let's go out to talk.

775
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,540
Who is that?

776
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,690
His first love.

777
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,030
Why did she come here?

778
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,490
The little prince who had found his rose

779
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:51,140
left the fox and said:

780
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:58,390
What is this? Why did you come here?

781
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,860
It's been a long time.

782
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:07,790
But is this really your store?

783
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:15,160
  "It's your fault. I didn't want to hurt you,

784
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,610
 but you wanted to be tamed."

785
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,790
You look like your having fun.

786
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,380
What?

787
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,270
I didn't know,

788
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:34,690
but I think I've missed you.

789
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:13,350
When you get tamed by someone, you're bound to get into a tear-jerking situation.

790
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,150
♫  Will you be   ♫

791
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:34,490
♫  my one and only universe?  ♫

792
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:39,070
♫  So a pretty flower that resembles you 
Can bloom the cracks of my heart  ♫

793
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:42,620
 The Best Chicken

794
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,370
Let's all give welcoming applause.

795
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:46,560
Alcohol (sul) is being poured into us real smooth. That's why it's called sul (a mimetic, for smooth).

796
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,510
I'm okay, but are you okay, Bo Ah?

797
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:52,340
Do you want to go out with him now that you've hugged him?

798
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,510
I learned from that girl you know. Chicken and a mug of beer.

799
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:56,950
I'm going to kill this chicken place.

800
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,650
You saw on TV, right, the most well-known tasty food program.

801
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,130
I said we're not going.

802
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,040
CEO!

803
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,210
Bo Ah?

804
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:05,790
What are you doing not coming upstairs?

805
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:10,140
♫  Has a hidden happiness come into my arms?  ♫

01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,080
♫  The darkness  ♫
