1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,190
 The Best Chicken

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,670
 Park Sun Ho

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,610
  Kim So Hye

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,650
 Joo Woo Jae

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,010

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,500
 The bathhouse contract was signed. Leave.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,720
 Grandpa!

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,860
 Do you have any intention of working with me here?

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,090
 What is this Bo Ah?

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,560
 How is this chicken?

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,020
 How different frying a chicken in oil can be.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,960
 Wow.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,950
 I'm not interested in other people's stuff like you, Sunbae.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,260
 Don't get sick, since you're the only one on my side.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,810
I, Andrew Kang will be working here from today.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,860
 It would be nice if we have customers tomorrow.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,020
 What? Is this really our restaurant?

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,920
 Bo Ah.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,890
 What about your vacation?

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,330
 The flight got canceled.

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,550
 That's his first love.

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,270
 I guess I must have missed you.

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,880
 Do you like want to go out with her because you've hugged her again for the first time in a while?

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,310
 So annoying!

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,410
 All of a sudden we got a lot of customers, so I wondered what was going on.

26
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,730
 It turns out it was because of your pamphlets.

27
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,810
 I'm looking for another part-timer.

28
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,120
 Is there any trustworthy person in this neighborhood that you would recommend?

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,740
 The restaurant we will feature today is a chicken place.

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,890
 How can the beer monster not have drunk even a mouthful of beer?

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,790
 The cousin of Kim Gyu Man, Kim Yong Man?

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,140
 We got a report that you were selling alcohol to a minor.

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,220
 From now on, I'm Snow White.

34
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,600
  Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

35
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,670
 Refreshing Bath, Barun Chicken.

36
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,330
 Notice

37
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,330
 For violating a regulation of the Food and Hygiene article 86,

38
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,410
 this place is closed for two months.

39
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,250
  Long vacation

40
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,390
This is the best.

41
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,780
It's great. But can you react more forcefully this time?

42
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,420
This is the best!

43
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,500
I came from the local police precinct.

44
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,850
What is it about?

45
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,920
We got a report that you were selling alcohol to a minor here.

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,520
Please cooperate with our investigation.

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,910
Pardon?

48
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,200
Honey, what are you doing?

49
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,420
I told you, you can't let it air.

50
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,960
I know. I'm just watching it because it's unfortunate.

51
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,250
It can't be helped. It was on air.

52
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,790
But the customers tried to go. Now it's closed?

53
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,180
Then what's the point?

54
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,980
Right.

55
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,420
But, they really picked well. Who the hell would think he's in high school.

56
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,260
Pick? What do you mean?

57
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,780
Oh, didn't you know?

58
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,210
This is a bomb that they sent.

59
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,010
Who sent what?

60
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,390
Geez.

61
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,200
Did you not sleep either?

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,680
No, not at all recently.

63
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,670
You too?

64
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,500
No, I sleep well.

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,590
I eat well, and work well

66
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,280
I'm living happily and healthily.

67
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,710
I'm fine.

68
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,430
The bomb did go off properly, right?

69
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,560
Yeah. They got a cease and desist.

70
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Noona, what if they keep on and stay in business?

71
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,760
Then we have to send another. If they get two, then it's three months mandatory cease of business.

72
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,280
If it's three, then they get their commercial license canceled and then seized.

73
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,450
Hey! Then they really go out of business.

74
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,150
Yeah.

75
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,220
Then, we have to do this two more times?

76
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,520
Yeah, why?

77
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,810
Are you guys scared?

78
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,590
And we came this far.

79
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,560
Hey, this is for a friend and you can't even do that.

80
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,690
Then you shouldn't have started.

81
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,280
What, what is it?

82
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,190
The police, what do I do? They probably came to arrest us.

83
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,820
What do we do?

84
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,360
What should I tell them?

85
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,410
What are you doing?

86
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,990
Mina, that was a fire truck.

87
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,390
A fire truck

88
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,180
has a long sound. The police is like...

89
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,620
Hey, don't, don't!

90
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,570
Don't, don't, don't!

91
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,990
It was because I was worried about you.

92
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,360
I told you not to! I told you to stop!

93
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,300
Stop!

94
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,700
Is this something to grab my hair for?

95
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,520
But, how is Bo Ah being treated that

96
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,720
she hasn't been seen for days?

97
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,020
It's so obvious, even if I didn't see it myself.

98
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,820
The chicken place is probably even chillier than Siberia on a cold winter's day.

99
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,050
I feel bad for them.

100
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,830
Why is the mood like this? We're not over yet.

101
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,480
I felt so much pressure that I couldn't even breathe properly.

102
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,610
Enough.

103
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:23,290
In times of crises like these, it is important for us to be in "hurrah, team spirit" mode.

104
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,490
By the way, I still haven't had my welcome party. How's everyone's time toâ€”

105
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,360
Now that things are like this. Let's think we're on break.

106
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,890
Actually, I opened the business without prior preparations and

107
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,180
a tide of customers were coming endlessly, so we faced many problems anyway.

108
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,220
For now, think of it as a vacation and finalize the recipe and get accustomed to the system.

109
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,370
Still, if we go out of business in the end, all of those efforts will be useless. You know that?

110
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,490
Running a shop is a reality.

111
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,340
Without opening a shop, you need to pay for two months of rent and our salaries.

112
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,140
On top of those, there are the costs for the ingredients to develop recipes. Can you pay for all of those?

113
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,270
How can I get paid when the shop is closed?

114
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,760
There is a thing called compensation for business suspension.  One has to get paid 70 percent of their regular salary.

115
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,600
Let's say we will be lucky enough to survive for two months.

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,790
If we open the shop after that, is there any guarantee that customers will come like before?

117
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,850
Then, what do you suggest? Why are you talking about this?

118
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,630
I am saying it's best to close the shop if we can't survive through.

119
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,360
Who will take responsibility for Mr. Park if we go out of business after trying so hard with all the resources?

120
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,310
I know just trying and enduring won't do.

121
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,340
But if that's the only thing we can do, I want to endure it.

122
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,470
There are a couple of sauce recipes I have in mind.

123
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,950
I'll make some now. Try it if you want.

124
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,660
Yes.

125
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,830
Come see me for a second.

126
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,100
What is it about? Sit down first.

127
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,290
It isn't something to be said here. Come outside for a moment.

128
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,970
- It's a ticking bomb?
- Yeah.

129
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,070
They said it's a tactic used to lower competitor sales.

130
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,200
They sent a minor on purpose and reported it.

131
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,520
Do you have a hunch (who might have done it)?

132
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,990
I'm thankful for your concern, but that's probably not the case.

133
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,640
There's no chicken joint near us and the closest pub is on the main street.

134
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,780
What about personal grudges? Or did you bicker with a customer?

135
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,700
Nothing really.  We haven't been open for long.

136
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,980
- Are your employees trustworthy?
 - Moon So Dam.

137
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,180
Don't do that and think about it seriously.

138
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,230
Didn't you say the new hire's first day was on the show filming day?

139
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,520
Isn't it odd that it happened that day?

140
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,960
Why would Ki Beom do such a thing?

141
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,640
Then the other part-timer, was her name Bo Ah?

142
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,600
Hey, it definitely isn't Bo Ah.

143
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,150
I don't know how close you two are, but

144
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,870
she's the one who served alcohol without checking an ID.

145
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,930
I heard she knew the high school student before this incident.

146
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,710
I'll go inside first.

147
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:49,000
I wish you wouldn't suspect my workers without evidence.

148
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,180
So frustrating that he's so naive.

149
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,050
Bo Ah, why are you like that?

150
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,840
Let's go inside.

151
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,470
Boss.

152
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,120
Here.

153
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,620
What is this?

154
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,920
My resignation letter. I am going to quit.

155
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,180
Why are you doing this, Bo Ah?

156
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,600
Your business was suspended because of me.

157
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,500
and...

158
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,230
Anyway, I don't think I should stay here any longer.

159
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,700
- Aren't you going too far.
 - What?

160
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,750
Didn't you hear what Ki Beom said?

161
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,050
At times like this, we have to keep our head up.

162
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,090
He said such team spirit is important. But are you discouraging us?

163
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,800
No, it's not that.

164
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,080
No matter what anyone says, Bo Ah, you're one of our founding members.

165
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,020
There were plenty of hard times we overcame thanks to you.

166
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,110
Without you, our store would have been closed down a long ago.

167
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,380
- You know that, right? 
- Pardon?

168
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,240
So, I can't accept this resignation letter.

169
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,770
I can't do it

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,060
without you.

171
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,990
How is it? I did my best to simplify the ingredients and recipe.

172
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,930
They're all okay, but the strength of the first sauce is the cool spiciness.

173
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,350
and the second sauce has a balance of sweet and spice.

174
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:28,410
The third sauce starts off spicy and the fourth sauce ends with a spiciness.

175
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,330
I added fermented soy sauce to the fifth one to add more flavor.

176
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,250
This is difficult.

177
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,050
How does it compare to our original sauce?

178
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,690
Based solely on taste, the original is a bit better.

179
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,550
Is that so?

180
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,530
The fifth sauce tastes most flavorful.

181
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,010
How about adding more sweetness to it?

182
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,780
I feel it'll be comparable to the original sauce.

183
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,330
Then the entire palate will fall apart.

184
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,300
In order to make it sweeter, we have to adjust the sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and spiciness.

185
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,110
Then it becomes a completely different sauce.

186
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,160
Can't they just add sugar to it?

187
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,000
Wouldn't it be better to add corn syrup instead of sugar? Or oligo syrup?

188
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,450
Let's keep your comments out of this.

189
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,860
There's only so much we can do by changing the sauce. Let's try marinating the chicken itself.

190
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,260
Again? When am I getting off?

191
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,530
Let's end here today. I have something to do tonight.

192
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,640
Whatever, sure.

193
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,020
Bo Ah, I'm sorry but can you clean up the store today?

194
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,360
Yes, Boss.

195
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,760
Bo Ah.

196
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,520
Bo Ah.

197
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,450
Oh guys.

198
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,880
You b****, I know you're walking on eggshells right now,

199
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,680
but would your fingers break from shooting me a text?

200
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,250
Sorry. I haven't been in my right mind lately.

201
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,220
Why are your faces like that?

202
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,900
What? What about our faces?

203
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,760
Its because we couldn't sleep.

204
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,290
That isn't important.

205
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,930
Are you really okay?

206
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,360
Is your boss hounding you?

207
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,750
Your faces aren't like that because of me, right?

208
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,420
Do I look awful?

209
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,950
I'm sorry.

210
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,330
Because of me... you guys.

211
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,390
I'm sorry.

212
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,560
Why are you crying?

213
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,330
Don't cry.

214
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,420
Excuse me, guys.

215
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,330
I did some thinking. Don't misunderstand and listen.

216
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,360
You guys are exhausted and I'm miserable.

217
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,420
Can we just stop trying to make the store go out of business?

218
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,930
What did you say?

219
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,490
The thing is...

220
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,570
How about we stop trying to make the store go out of business?

221
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,860
Why?

222
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,670
I mean...

223
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:35,330
Honestly, this is bothering you guys too, and you haven't been able to sleep.

224
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,390
Also, as I got to know my boss,

225
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,330
he doesn't seem like that bad of a person.

226
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,710
It doesn't seem like he started the business for fun.

227
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,100
Hey, stop with your nonsense.

228
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,550
What?

229
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,390
Can you not see it?

230
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,080
Can you not see the blood on my hands?

231
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,930
If up until now we were helping you, that's no longer the case.

232
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:22,360
I already got blood on my hands. I have to see the end of this.

233
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,050
What are you saying? What blood? Your hands are clean.

234
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,830
No. If we stop here, then I became a bad person for no reason.

235
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,000
We'll make you into the cafe's owner no matter what, so

236
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,350
don't worry about anything,

237
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,170
and stay put.

238
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,280
He won't accept my resignation...

239
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,960
and I can't say anything to the kids either.

240
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,210
What am I supposed to do?

241
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,780
Really.

242
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,870
Boss, I'm here.

243
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,860
Where has he been going these days during the day and night?

244
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,830
Boss.

245
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,430
Are you still sleeping at this hour?

246
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,570
Boss.

247
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,580
Boss, get up.

248
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,040
Are you okay, you're burning up.

249
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,510
What time is it?

250
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,870
Twelve o'clock just passed.

251
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,990
I'm fine, Bo Ah.

252
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,270
What do you mean, you're okay?

253
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,690
This rascal. He's making Mommy suffer like this.

254
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,720
Just wait until he gets caught!

255
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,430
Huh?

256
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,140
Seriously. I'm going

257
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,020
to break his legs.

258
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,450
I'm going to make him not want to

259
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,750
work anywhere except at an office job.

260
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,960
That punk.

261
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,560
Just wait until I catch you! You're worrying your mother like this.

262
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,950
I'm going to kill you!

263
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,630
What have you been doing to your body these days?

264
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,720
It's probably just the flu.

265
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,090
What a joke.

266
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,800
Hyung!

267
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,230
Have you been doing hard manual labor?

268
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,090
How did you know?

269
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,390
What a troublemaker.

270
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,310
Boss, you're doing manual labor?

271
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,490
Why? Because you needed money?

272
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,010
Yeah. Will you lend me some?

273
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,420
Next patient.

274
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,660
Are you really going to do this?

275
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,650
I don't have money either.

276
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,200
I got the maximum loan so I could open this office. Sit down.

277
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,550
You're not sleeping, are you?

278
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,630
What do you do at night? Designated driving?

279
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,290
Hyung, are you a shaman?

280
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,120
It's so obvious.

281
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,590
You do designated driving too?!

282
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,770
I'll prescribe some herbs for you, so make sure to drink it.

283
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,800
Get acupuncture and moxa, too.

284
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,650
Are you going to bill your younger brother?

285
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,250
Okay, I can't lend you money, but I will do this for you.

286
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,790
Acupuncture and moxa is good,

287
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,430
but what about gongjindan (herbal mixture to combat fatigue)? Can you give me that?

288
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,950
You're going to sell it, aren't you?

289
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,860
I'm really going to eat it.

290
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,780
I have to eat to get energy to make money.

291
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,790
Okay.

292
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,360
Bo Ah, can you check to see if he sells it or consumes it?

293
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,770
Yes, I will make sure he eats it.

294
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,750
And you rest, even if it's for a day or two.

295
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,510
I will take care of that too.

296
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,630
Bo Ah, I will carry it.

297
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,520
Don't touch it. I'll give you one a day.

298
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,240
No, but because I'm not even that sickâ€”

299
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,340
Go.

300
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,580
Let's go.

301
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,860
Let's go, let's go.

302
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,750
I'm going to kill him.

303
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,410
That punk.

304
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,160
I will catch you.

305
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,590
You're dead now.

306
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,070
Which way did they go? Why can't I see them?

307
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,230
His head is bigger than others!

308
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,210
I see him.

309
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,070
You, hey!

310
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,860
Why did you go that way?

311
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,500
I'll get my hands on you!

312
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,630
You punk! Just wait until I catch you!

313
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,320
This damn uphill.

314
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,860
Alright so you're here somewhere, right?

315
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,150
This way, that way?

316
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,530
That way?

317
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,450
Wait a moment.

318
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,820
Here, okay I got you.

319
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,990
You punk, I caught you.

320
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,800
Get over here!

321
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,460
How can you work manual labor in the morning,

322
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,530
make recipes in the afternoon, and then work as a substitute driver at night?

323
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,520
When exactly do you sleep?

324
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,260
If you overwork your body like that... Boss, why are you so foolish?

325
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,530
Bo Ah, are you mad?

326
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:15,550
Why would I be mad? How could I be mad at you?

327
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,910
Its not that.

328
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,530
I'm fine.

329
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:26,220
Even if it means doing this, I wanted to protect our store and give you your paycheck on time.

330
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,630
That's why I did it.

331
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,260
It's not hard, and it's endurable.

332
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,420
â™«   You come to me like a dream   â™«

333
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,500
â™«   When I am sad   â™«

334
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,930
Boss.

335
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,000
You know, I did some thinking last night.

336
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,230
â™«   You hug me tight   â™«

337
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,310
I won't accept any pay.

338
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,450
- Bo Ah. 
 - Just do that for me.

339
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,780
If not, then I seriously won't come out to work anymore.

340
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,760
I'll just not come anymore.

341
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,740
â™«   I never   â™«

342
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:08,050
â™«   want to show you my tears   â™«

343
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:13,360
â™«   Even to you who doesn't know my feelings  â™«

344
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,290
Why are you so late?

345
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,050
I'm sorry, I had something to do.

346
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,640
Where did we go yesterday?

347
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,660
He's sick today.

348
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,270
What?

349
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,880
Bo Ah, I told you I'm okay.

350
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,900
So let him rest and we'll work on the recipe.

351
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,820
How sick are you?

352
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,500
I'm not sick, seriously.

353
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,370
Here, here, and here.

354
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,660
You're hurt there.

355
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,190
You saw, right.

356
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,420
Hurry and go in.

357
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,980
Ok, let's work now

358
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,050
Next patient.

359
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,360
Mom!

360
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,860
- What are you wearing? 
- Am I even you guys mom?

361
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,660
- What do you mean? 
- If you seriously cared about your younger brother,

362
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,220
you would've told me sooner instead of just watching him do as he pleases!

363
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,300
Mom, I seriously did not mean to deceive you, butâ€”

364
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,250
Call him, right now.

365
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,260
Yeah, Hyung? I just saw you, so why are you calling me?

366
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,810
That is...

367
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,740
- Are you able to come now?
 - Now, why?

368
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,540
Don't come. Mom is here!

369
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,700
And don't answer my calls!

370
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,890
Don't come, mom is here, don't come!

371
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,800
Mom, what is wrong with your clothes?

372
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:32,200
It's nothing. Just know that I'll be staying at your house for a while from today on.

373
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,630
Again? But you just came by.

374
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,940
It won't be for long. Half a day if it's short

375
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,860
and four days at most.

376
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,490
Sir.

377
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,420
- Hello. 
- May I ask you something?

378
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,150
Ah, yes.

379
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:16,910
Ask away. Min Ah, bring two cups of coffee.

380
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:21,400
What's this about? Do you need a room?

381
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,150
- Monthly rental? Deposit lease?
 - No, it's not that.

382
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,780
I was wondering how many chicken joints or pubs there are around here.

383
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,810
- Ah, you want to start a business? 
- That's not it...

384
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:38,620
Min Ah, I asked for coffee. What are you daydreaming about?

385
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,870
Grandpa, did you call for me?

386
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,350
Forget it. Do what you were doing.

387
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:52,670
Aigoo. Why is that girl so out of it?

388
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:59,360
Seeing that you're researching local businesses before starting a business,

389
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,330
you're really quite something. Huh?

390
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:12,260
- Yes.
 - Let's see here. Let me find you a good spot.

391
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,810
A beer business... Beer...

392
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:25,570
Here there's a chicken place that may or may not do well.

393
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:32,760
There's a guy who's on the verge of closing, so this place won't work.

394
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,390
Here's the perfect spot for you.

395
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:40,460
Over there. If you look that way at those buildings there...

396
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,780
- Grandpa, it's the neighborhood across. 
 - What?

397
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,860
- There's a good location besides that place. 
- That isn't that way

398
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,640
but in our neighborhood.

399
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,460
There's a good place out front.

400
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,170
It's right behind the main street and the lease is cheap.

401
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,200
Ah, but...

402
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,730
I heard there was a chicken place already out there.

403
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,310
Ah... That?

404
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,580
Their business was suspended for two months not too long ago.

405
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,440
You have a chance if you open soon and settle in first.

406
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,320
The vacant store location is on the way to the other chicken joint.

407
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,150
Really? I'm interested, can you tell me more?

408
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,160
Unni, you came at the perfect time. There's a lot of competition over there.

409
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,540
But if you sign the lease here, we get first dibs

410
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,870
because I've been doing my job well.

411
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,460
But if you look at it right now, then you'll fall in love with it immediately

412
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,720
because we'll give you  half off the realtor fee.

413
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,050
Okay, Grandpa? So if you look at it now...

414
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,460
What are you doing? Do you think the kitchen is a joke?

415
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:16,260
- But I just did as I was told.
 - You should've squeezed out the water and battered it well.

416
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,580
You punk!

417
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,280
I told you to make the dough. Who told you to make soup?

418
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,290
Why are you getting upset, you can just teach me more.

419
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:33,250
Are you guys serious? Finish up and bring me the radish.

420
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,110
But isn't the store seriously going to fail?

421
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:49,130
- It's going to be closed for two months.
 - Hey employee, just do what you're told.

422
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:54,370
- The owner said it wasn't going to close. 
- Well we have to look at this objectively.

423
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:59,760
What happens if I work my butt off, but don't get paid because the store closes?

424
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,480
Ah. That punk, seriously.

425
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,710
So, what I mean is...

426
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:13,490
- I'm saying we need a plan.
 - What plan? We just have to push through

427
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,350
and lower unnecessary  expenses.

428
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,870
Unnecessary expenses?

429
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,380
What, why are you looking at me?

430
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,240
Are you saying I'm the unnecessary expense?

431
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,790
You guys are mean. You told me I am your family.

432
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,260
- Refreshing Bath family.
 - I never said that.

433
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,180
I didn't either.

434
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,810
It's during times like this that families need to put their strengths together to overcome hardships. Aren't I right?

435
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,450
- What is he saying? 
 - Don't you think so?

436
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,380
- Unnecessary expense! 
 - Noona, why are you acting like this? We're both employees.

437
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,840
I will be out for a second.

438
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,770
Where are you going part-timer? You need to fry chicken.

439
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,530
Aren't you going to do it properly? When do you think you're going to finish at this rate?

440
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:04,020
Hold on, you want me to do all this by myself.

441
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,750
Let's do it together.

442
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,410
See this? Do you want to prepare the ingredients with me?

443
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:32,680
No. How was this place managed before I came along?

444
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,850
Excuse me.

445
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,940
Until you finish this you can't go to the bathroom.

446
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,920
If you run again one more time then... you'll see.

447
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,960
If someone's this bad at something, people usually tell them not to do it.

448
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,300
This is frustrating.

449
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,860
If it's not important it's best to leave him be. It's up to you to wait or leave.

450
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,220
- Isn't it uncomfortable for him to sleep here? 
 - He lives here.

451
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,030
Didn't he live upstairs?

452
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,610
- It's his own personal life. Why are you trying to find that out? 
 - I guess not.

453
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,310
When do you get off?

454
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,180
- What? 
 - I'm asking you when you're getting off.

455
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,300
You speak curtly and your name is weird.

456
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,980
I think you're pursuing American style.

457
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,710
Can you give me some of your time after you get off work?

458
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,600
- What do you want? 
- You'll find out if you come out, I guess.

459
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,670
Right, my pride isn't important.

460
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,030
What are you doing?

461
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,950
- What are you doing not going in? 
 - Hi, Grandpa.

462
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,720
Grandpa, are you sick?

463
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,320
Why the sudden need for a pain patch?

464
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,760
I couldn't sleep well.

465
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,380
I think it's a muscle cramp.

466
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,230
Grandpa, are you having indigestion?

467
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,590
Where did you have such good food?

468
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,000
Just wait until you get old.

469
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,670
You will have many pains and illnesses all over your body.

470
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:18,220
Even if that's the case, why so much medication?

471
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,240
It's concerning.

472
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,150
When are you moving back in?

473
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,160
Why would I move in when I have a home of my own?

474
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,660
Until when do you plan to be a burden on your boss?

475
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,080
Don't talk foolishness

476
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,660
and come back home.

477
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,220
How am I a burden?

478
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,180
How are you not a burden?

479
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,660
You eat, sleep, dress and wash at the store. It must be so uncomfortable.

480
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,150
You care so much about my boss.

481
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,570
I didn't know that.

482
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,410
Grandpa, about that...

483
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,280
Do you think our society is fair?

484
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,790
What?

485
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,210
As a future member of society, I don't think it is.

486
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,480
You know what I mean, right.

487
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,590
Grandpa, don't you feel responsible as a past member of society?

488
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,440
What responsibility?

489
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,320
Grandpa, you still have a chance. No, that's not the right term.

490
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,340
Social responsibility? Or moral obligation?

491
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,990
Grandpa, I'm getting to the point.

492
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:25,150
Grandpa, do you really need the rent?

493
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,620
You punk!

494
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,620
No, listen.

495
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,200
Earning money through labor is more suitable for social justice,

496
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,580
rather than earning from passive income.

497
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,900
I'm right.

498
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,910
Am I wrong?

499
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,830
Leave.

500
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:43,660
Grandpa! If free is too much, you can collect money after two months.

501
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,970
Grandpa!

502
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,930
What a stingy Scrooge! Evil landlord.

503
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,100
I didn't realize, but I fell asleep.

504
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,810
Where did everyone go?

505
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,500
Bae Ki Beom is preparing the radish and Seo Bo Ah ran out all of a sudden.

506
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,620
Excuse me?

507
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,270
I don't know. She said she would be back soon and she hasn't come back yet.

508
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,930
I see.

509
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:33,160
Anthony, you should have rested. You must be tired.

510
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,700
If you can't memorize it,

511
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,570
look at it and read. It says it right here Andrew Kang, Andrew Kang.

512
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,330
So it was there.

513
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,160
If you're awake, go try the new sauce I made.

514
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,820
Okay.

515
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,750
Where did that punk go?

516
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,330
Bae Ki Beom!

517
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,640
I told him not to move before he's finished with the radish.

518
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,760
I gave him a warning...

519
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,210
This, who did it?

520
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,560
Why is it so dark?

521
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,620
People might really think we're out of business.

522
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,260
Boss, are you still sleeping?

523
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,960
I told him not to go out.

524
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,410
 How am I a burden?

525
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,370
 How are you not a burden?

526
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:31,460
 You eat, sleep, dress and wash at the store. It must be so uncomfortable.

527
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,800
Am I really?

528
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,070
â™«   A star has fallen into my restless heart   â™«

529
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,160
â™«   It keeps digging in and twinkling   â™«

530
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,620
â™«  Iâ€™m getting a strange energy   â™«
 â™«   Awakening my lurking dream    â™«

531
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,020
â™«  Iâ€™ve come forth to the world   â™«

532
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:04,360
â™«   I donâ€™t really know myself either   â™« 
â™«   No one knows what will happen    â™«

533
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:09,680
â™«   Thereâ€™s no rule against success   â™« 
â™«   So Iâ€™m not afraid   â™«

534
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,090
â™«   This is the perfect time,  itâ€™s better to make things big  â™«

535
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:19,860
â™«  I want to follow the sound of my burning heartbeat   â™«

536
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,030
If it was uncomfortable, he should have said so.

537
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,190
â™«   and live again   â™«

538
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,390
 It's been a while. My back is aching.

539
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,060
â™«   Iâ€™ll be here for dreaming   â™«

540
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,750
 You need to move out now.

541
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:39,190
â™«   Every step I take, itâ€™ll turn into a road   â™«

542
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:44,760
â™«  I donâ€™t cry for my life   â™«
 â™«   The world couldn't recognize my talent   â™«

543
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,780
He told me.

544
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:56,010
â™«   Till then, watch over me   â™«

545
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,370
â™«   Iâ€™ll be here for dreaming   â™«

546
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:18,450
â™«   Not everything can work my way   â™«

547
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,410
â™«   Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s more fun   â™«

548
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,080
â™«   Hardships pass just like the common cold    â™«

549
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,320
â™«   No need to walk backwards   â™«

550
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,850
â™«   Iâ€™m surprised at myself too   â™«

551
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:37,620
Here you go.

552
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:43,120
â™«   My rising dreams have given me strength   â™«

553
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,060
Thank you.

554
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,960
Go home safely.

555
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,380
Thank you.

556
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,380
â™«   I need to have today   â™«

557
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,150
Yes, hello.

558
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,050
Yes, I will be there soon.

559
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,970
Thank you.

560
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,120
â™«   So I will believe in myself  â™«

561
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:07,090
â™«  Iâ€™ll be here for dreaming, put away the maps   â™«

562
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:12,370
â™«   Every step I take will become a road   â™«

563
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:17,660
â™«   I donâ€™t cry for my life   â™«
 â™«   The day to show the world   â™«

564
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:23,040
â™«  how great Iâ€™ve become   â™« 
â™«   How electric would it be   â™«

565
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,450
â™«   Till then,   â™«

566
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:29,290
â™«   watch over me   â™«

567
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,040
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

568
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,380
â™«   Iâ€™ll be here for dreaming, each day Iâ€™m born again   â™«

569
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:41,730
â™«   The day that Iâ€™ll shine is getting closer   â™«

570
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:47,760
â™«   Iâ€™ll donâ€™t cry for my life   â™«
 â™«   The day I become the me I wanted to be   â™«

571
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,120
 The taste has changed. Cries.

572
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,460
 I was curious about here, but its nothing much.

573
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,190
  When I first went it was very good, but yesterday it was so so.

574
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,160
  I'm disappointed.

575
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,930
This is weird.

576
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,010
We only sold fried chicken then.

577
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,030
Since there's no need to introduce each other,

578
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,150
I'll skip the greeting and get to the point.

579
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:29,360
Have you heard the saying, "send a bomb"?

580
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,720
It's a reasonable doubt.

581
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,540
Everything aside, someone must have reported it for the police to arrive.

582
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,660
That's it.

583
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,500
So I did some investigating

584
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,000
and quite a few things are odd.

585
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,280
First, we must think of everyone as a suspect.

586
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,590
Why do you trust me?

587
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:13,030
Why are you leaving me out if you say everyone's a suspect?

588
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,630
When we were shooting it seemed like you couldn't use your hand.

589
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,030
Is it true?

590
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:26,430
You barely found your own kitchen (to work). Why would you send a bomb?

591
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,190
Why didn't you call the owner? Its about his store.

592
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,530
He doesn't know how to be suspicious of people.

593
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,400
He'll make it obvious.

594
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,200
That's my point. I tried talking to him, but he didn't understand.

595
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,870
It's not too late to talk to him after we narrow down the suspects.

596
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,170
Suspect one, Hwang Min Ah.

597
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,720
Looking at how you're doing, you are so similar to my mom.

598
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,150
What?

599
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,500
Its nothing, continue.

600
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:08,530
She works at a real estate office but openly expressed hostility towards the chicken joint.

601
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,070
That woman, why?

602
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,590
I don't know that.

603
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,050
I will have to find out from now on.

604
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,620
Next is suspect two.

605
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,330
It must be him. Just look at him.

606
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:24,200
Kim Gyoo Man. The butcher shop owner.

607
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,980
He is that minor.

608
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,160
Right, they look alike.

609
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,710
There's an age gap, so they can't be twins.

610
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,280
They're cousins but they look alike. Enough for the worker to get confused.

611
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,880
He was resentful because they bought their chicken elsewhere,

612
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,430
so it's possible that's why he committed the crime.

613
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,310
Who's the next one?

614
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,030
That's Bae Ki Beom.

615
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,170
The part-timer who started work on the day of the incident.

616
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:00,280
I was suspicious of the timing and looked into him. He has a bad reputation.

617
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:06,280
When I asked Choi Go, he said someone recommended him because he's a hard worker.

618
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,780
That he works well?

619
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,190
Who would say such nonsense?

620
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,630
Oh Yeong Ho, the soccer store owner.

621
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,560
He's suspect three.

622
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,970
How did he buy so much resentment?

623
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,430
This is what I've investigated so far.

624
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:31,400
But what irks me is that there's no clear motive.

625
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:37,930
Based on my experience as an assistant PD on the show, "I want to know even that,"

626
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,530
in a situation like this...

627
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,590
A situation like this?

628
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,480
The real suspect can be controlling one of them.

629
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,400
A grand scheme.

630
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,630
Were you substitute driving until now?

631
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,730
Bo Ah, you're not sleeping yet?

632
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,670
Do you know what time it is?

633
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,000
You're going to get shut-eye for a few hours and go work manual labor, huh?

634
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's called manual labor, but it's not as bad as you think.

635
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,690
- I just clean up after.
 - No.

636
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,100
Didn't you hear what the herb doctor said?

637
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,050
He said to rest a few days until you recover.

638
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,770
Okay, I won't go to work tomorrow and will sleep well,

639
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,200
so you should go up and sleep.

640
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,260
I don't want to.

641
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,190
Pardon?

642
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,470
Now I can't trust you.

643
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,440
What are you doing not coming in? This isn't your first time here.

644
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,190
No, it's not, but it's late.

645
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:16,610
Hurry and come in. You followed me all the way up here. What are you saying?

646
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,640
Bo Ah, what are you doing?

647
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,060
We should sleep, do you not know what time it is.

648
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,170
Pardon?

649
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,830
Hurry and go sleep.

650
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,180
If I sleep there, what about you

651
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,260
I will sleep in the living room

652
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,310
since I have to make sure that you don't leave.

653
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,860
â™«   Lucky in my dream   â™«

654
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,060
â™«  You warmly hug me   â™«

655
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,610
Hurry and sleep.

656
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:49,470
I can hear everything in my sleep, so don't get caught trying to sneak out.

657
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:55,710
â™«   I always smile like this   â™«

658
00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:02,100
â™«   Even if the world drags me down   â™«

659
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,520
â™«   I never want to show tears   â™«

660
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,460
I don't know.

661
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:12,790
â™«   Even to you who doesn't know my feelings   â™«

662
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:20,170
â™«   I'm so happy I can cherish memories   â™«

663
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:25,610
â™«   of your smile from afar   â™«

664
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:31,830
â™«   When I feel like crying   â™« 
â™«   Lucky in my dream   â™«

665
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:34,450
Its comfortable here.

666
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:39,550
Why can't I fall sleep?

667
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:45,480
â™«   When I feel down  â™«
 â™«   Lucky in my world   â™«

668
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:52,370
â™«   You hold me tight like a dream   â™«

669
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:00,530
â™«   I always smile like this   â™«

670
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:06,840
â™«   Even if the world drags me down   â™«

671
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:12,220
â™«   I never want to show tears   â™«

672
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,780
Oh, right!

673
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,400
Right!

674
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:22,060
â™«   I'm so happy I can cherish memories   â™«

675
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,330
Boss, are you sleeping?

676
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,980
No, not yet.

677
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,580
Good.

678
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,610
This is your Gongjindan for today.

679
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:44,820
â™«   Everything is beautiful   â™«

680
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:51,210
â™«   I feel so happy  â™«

681
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:58,390
â™«   Because the world is so lonely   â™«

682
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:03,600
â™«   I make another wish   â™«

683
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,390
â™«   I always smile like this   â™«

684
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,700
Bo Ah, are you awake?

685
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,630
Yes.

686
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,460
When did you wake up and do all this?

687
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,210
I just made something simple with the ingredients I had.

688
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,020
I will enjoy it.

689
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,190
Please do.

690
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,300
Who is it at this hour?

691
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,430
Who is it?

692
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,950
Bo Ah, did you order a delivery?

693
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,430
They wouldn't come all the way up here to deliver it.

694
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,390
They would just leave it on the first floor.

695
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:20,290
Did you forget to lock the shop?

696
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,200
I forgot. I wasn't in my right mind.

697
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,330
Who is it?

698
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,420
He's here, right?

699
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,790
Mom.

700
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,390
â™«   Will you be my   â™«

701
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,590
â™«   one and only universe?   â™«

702
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:19,980
â™«   So a pretty flower that resembles you   â™«
 â™«   Can bloom the cracks of my heart   â™«

703
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:26,290

704
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,690
 The Best Chicken

705
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,110
When are you going to close up shop?

706
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:33,130
How much time will it take?

707
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,680
They're Seo Bo Ah's friends.

708
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,600
So Bo Ah?

709
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,490
Why do you trust that woman? She isn't it.

710
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,220
Enough.

711
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,530
Are you going to marry him?

712
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,760
No, no, its not like that.

713
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,530
Bo Ah, I want to protect this store.

714
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:50,150
I will continue to be here.

715
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:55,320
Boss, don't go.

716
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,560
â™«   Iâ€™ll hang you like   â™«

717
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,080
â™«   a star in the sky of my heart   â™«

718
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:13,050
â™«  Sweet days and nights, I   â™«
 â™«   I only want to look at the heavenly you   â™«

â™«   Baby I have a crush on you   â™«

720

721
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,900
