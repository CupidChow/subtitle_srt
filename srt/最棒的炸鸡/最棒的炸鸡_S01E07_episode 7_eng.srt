1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,190
 The Best Chicken

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,670
 Park Sun Ho

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,610
  Kim So Hye

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,650
 Joo Woo Jae

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,010

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,500
 The bathhouse contract was signed. Leave.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,720
 Grandpa!

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,860
 Do you have any intention of working with me here?

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,090
 What is this Bo Ah?

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,560
 How is this chicken?

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,020
 How different frying a chicken in oil can be.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,960
 Wow.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,950
 I'm not interested in other people's stuff like you, Sunbae.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,260
 Don't get sick, since you're the only one on my side.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,810
I, Andrew Kang will be working here from today.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,860
 It would be nice if we have customers tomorrow.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,020
 What? Is this really our restaurant?

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,920
 Bo Ah.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,890
 What about your vacation?

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,330
 The flight got canceled.

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,550
 That's his first love.

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,270
 I guess I must have missed you.

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,880
 Do you like want to go out with her because you've hugged her again for the first time in a while?

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,310
 So annoying!

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,410
 All of a sudden we got a lot of customers, so I wondered what was going on.

26
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,730
 It turns out it was because of your pamphlets.

27
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,810
 I'm looking for another part-timer.

28
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,120
 Is there any trustworthy person in this neighborhood that you would recommend?

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,740
 The restaurant we will feature today is a chicken place.

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,890
 How can the beer monster not have drunk even a mouthful of beer?

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,790
 The cousin of Kim Gyu Man, Kim Yong Man?

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,140
 We got a report that you were selling alcohol to a minor.

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,220
 From now on, I'm Snow White.

34
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,600
  Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

35
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,670
 Refreshing Bath, Barun Chicken.

36
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,330
 Notice

37
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,330
 For violating a regulation of the Food and Hygiene article 86,

38
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,410
 this place is closed for two months.

39
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,250
  Long vacation

40
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,390
This is the best.

41
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,780
It's great. But can you react more forcefully this time?

42
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,420
This is the best!

43
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,500
I came from the local police precinct.

44
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,850
What is it about?

45
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,920
We got a report that you were selling alcohol to a minor here.

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,520
Please cooperate with our investigation.

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,910
Pardon?

48
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,200
Honey, what are you doing?

49
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,420
I told you, you can't let it air.

50
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,960
I know. I'm just watching it because it's unfortunate.

51
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,250
It can't be helped. It was on air.

52
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,790
But the customers tried to go. Now it's closed?

53
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,180
Then what's the point?

54
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,980
Right.

55
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,420
But, they really picked well. Who the hell would think he's in high school.

56
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,260
Pick? What do you mean?

57
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,780
Oh, didn't you know?

58
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,210
This is a bomb that they sent.

59
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,010
Who sent what?

60
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,390
Geez.

61
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,200
Did you not sleep either?

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,680
No, not at all recently.

63
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,670
You too?

64
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,500
No, I sleep well.

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,590
I eat well, and work well

66
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,280
I'm living happily and healthily.

67
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,710
I'm fine.

68
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,430
The bomb did go off properly, right?

69
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,560
Yeah. They got a cease and desist.

70
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Noona, what if they keep on and stay in business?

71
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,760
Then we have to send another. If they get two, then it's three months mandatory cease of business.

72
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,280
If it's three, then they get their commercial license canceled and then seized.

73
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,450
Hey! Then they really go out of business.

74
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,150
Yeah.

75
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,220
Then, we have to do this two more times?

76
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,520
Yeah, why?

77
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,810
Are you guys scared?

78
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,590
And we came this far.

79
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,560
Hey, this is for a friend and you can't even do that.

80
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,690
Then you shouldn't have started.

81
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,280
What, what is it?

82
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,190
The police, what do I do? They probably came to arrest us.

83
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,820
What do we do?

84
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,360
What should I tell them?

85
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,410
What are you doing?

86
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,990
Mina, that was a fire truck.

87
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,390
A fire truck

88
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,180
has a long sound. The police is like...

89
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,620
Hey, don't, don't!

90
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,570
Don't, don't, don't!

91
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,990
It was because I was worried about you.

92
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,360
I told you not to! I told you to stop!

93
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,300
Stop!

94
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,700
Is this something to grab my hair for?

95
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,520
But, how is Bo Ah being treated that

96
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,720
she hasn't been seen for days?

97
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,020
It's so obvious, even if I didn't see it myself.

98
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,820
The chicken place is probably even chillier than Siberia on a cold winter's day.

99
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,050
I feel bad for them.

100
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,830
Why is the mood like this? We're not over yet.

101
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,480
I felt so much pressure that I couldn't even breathe properly.

102
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,610
Enough.

103
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:23,290
In times of crises like these, it is important for us to be in "hurrah, team spirit" mode.

104
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,490
By the way, I still haven't had my welcome party. How's everyone's time to—

105
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,360
Now that things are like this. Let's think we're on break.

106
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,890
Actually, I opened the business without prior preparations and

107
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,180
a tide of customers were coming endlessly, so we faced many problems anyway.

108
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,220
For now, think of it as a vacation and finalize the recipe and get accustomed to the system.

109
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,370
Still, if we go out of business in the end, all of those efforts will be useless. You know that?

110
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,490
Running a shop is a reality.

111
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,340
Without opening a shop, you need to pay for two months of rent and our salaries.

112
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,140
On top of those, there are the costs for the ingredients to develop recipes. Can you pay for all of those?

113
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,270
How can I get paid when the shop is closed?

114
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,760
There is a thing called compensation for business suspension.  One has to get paid 70 percent of their regular salary.

115
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,600
Let's say we will be lucky enough to survive for two months.

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,790
If we open the shop after that, is there any guarantee that customers will come like before?

117
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,850
Then, what do you suggest? Why are you talking about this?

118
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,630
I am saying it's best to close the shop if we can't survive through.

119
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,360
Who will take responsibility for Mr. Park if we go out of business after trying so hard with all the resources?

120
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,310
I know just trying and enduring won't do.

121
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,340
But if that's the only thing we can do, I want to endure it.

122
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,470
There are a couple of sauce recipes I have in mind.

123
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,950
I'll make some now. Try it if you want.

124
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,660
Yes.

125
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,830
Come see me for a second.

126
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,100
What is it about? Sit down first.

127
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,290
It isn't something to be said here. Come outside for a moment.

128
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,970
- It's a ticking bomb?
- Yeah.

129
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,070
They said it's a tactic used to lower competitor sales.

130
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,200
They sent a minor on purpose and reported it.

131
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,520
Do you have a hunch (who might have done it)?

132
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,990
I'm thankful for your concern, but that's probably not the case.

133
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,640
There's no chicken joint near us and the closest pub is on the main street.

134
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,780
What about personal grudges? Or did you bicker with a customer?

135
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,700
Nothing really.  We haven't been open for long.

136
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,980
- Are your employees trustworthy?
 - Moon So Dam.

137
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,180
Don't do that and think about it seriously.

138
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,230
Didn't you say the new hire's first day was on the show filming day?

139
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,520
Isn't it odd that it happened that day?

140
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,960
Why would Ki Beom do such a thing?

141
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,640
Then the other part-timer, was her name Bo Ah?

142
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,600
Hey, it definitely isn't Bo Ah.

143
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,150
I don't know how close you two are, but

144
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,870
she's the one who served alcohol without checking an ID.

145
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,930
I heard she knew the high school student before this incident.

146
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,710
I'll go inside first.

147
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:49,000
I wish you wouldn't suspect my workers without evidence.

148
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,180
So frustrating that he's so naive.

149
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,050
Bo Ah, why are you like that?

150
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,840
Let's go inside.

151
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,470
Boss.

152
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,120
Here.

153
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,620
What is this?

154
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,920
My resignation letter. I am going to quit.

155
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,180
Why are you doing this, Bo Ah?

156
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,600
Your business was suspended because of me.

157
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,500
and...

158
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,230
Anyway, I don't think I should stay here any longer.

159
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,700
- Aren't you going too far.
 - What?

160
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,750
Didn't you hear what Ki Beom said?

161
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,050
At times like this, we have to keep our head up.

162
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,090
He said such team spirit is important. But are you discouraging us?

163
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,800
No, it's not that.

164
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,080
No matter what anyone says, Bo Ah, you're one of our founding members.

165
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,020
There were plenty of hard times we overcame thanks to you.

166
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,110
Without you, our store would have been closed down a long ago.

167
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,380
- You know that, right? 
- Pardon?

168
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,240
So, I can't accept this resignation letter.

169
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,770
I can't do it

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,060
without you.

171
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,990
How is it? I did my best to simplify the ingredients and recipe.

172
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,930
They're all okay, but the strength of the first sauce is the cool spiciness.

173
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,350
and the second sauce has a balance of sweet and spice.

174
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:28,410
The third sauce starts off spicy and the fourth sauce ends with a spiciness.

175
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,330
I added fermented soy sauce to the fifth one to add more flavor.

176
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,250
This is difficult.

177
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,050
How does it compare to our original sauce?

178
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,690
Based solely on taste, the original is a bit better.

179
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,550
Is that so?

180
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,530
The fifth sauce tastes most flavorful.

181
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,010
How about adding more sweetness to it?

182
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,780
I feel it'll be comparable to the original sauce.

183
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,330
Then the entire palate will fall apart.

184
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,300
In order to make it sweeter, we have to adjust the sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and spiciness.

185
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,110
Then it becomes a completely different sauce.

186
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,160
Can't they just add sugar to it?

187
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,000
Wouldn't it be better to add corn syrup instead of sugar? Or oligo syrup?

188
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,450
Let's keep your comments out of this.

189
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,860
There's only so much we can do by changing the sauce. Let's try marinating the chicken itself.

190
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,260
Again? When am I getting off?

191
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,530
Let's end here today. I have something to do tonight.

192
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,640
Whatever, sure.

193
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,020
Bo Ah, I'm sorry but can you clean up the store today?

194
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,360
Yes, Boss.

195
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,760
Bo Ah.

196
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,520
Bo Ah.

197
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,450
Oh guys.

198
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,880
You b****, I know you're walking on eggshells right now,

199
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,680
but would your fingers break from shooting me a text?

200
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,250
Sorry. I haven't been in my right mind lately.

201
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,220
Why are your faces like that?

202
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,900
What? What about our faces?

203
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,760
Its because we couldn't sleep.

204
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,290
That isn't important.

205
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,930
Are you really okay?

206
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,360
Is your boss hounding you?

207
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,750
Your faces aren't like that because of me, right?

208
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,420
Do I look awful?

209
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,950
I'm sorry.

210
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,330
Because of me... you guys.

211
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,390
I'm sorry.

212
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,560
Why are you crying?

213
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,330
Don't cry.

214
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,420
Excuse me, guys.

215
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,330
I did some thinking. Don't misunderstand and listen.

216
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,360
You guys are exhausted and I'm miserable.

217
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,420
Can we just stop trying to make the store go out of business?

218
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,930
What did you say?

219
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,490
The thing is...

220
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,570
How about we stop trying to make the store go out of business?

221
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,860
Why?

222
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,670
I mean...

223
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:35,330
Honestly, this is bothering you guys too, and you haven't been able to sleep.

224
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,390
Also, as I got to know my boss,

225
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,330
he doesn't seem like that bad of a person.

226
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,710
It doesn't seem like he started the business for fun.

227
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,100
Hey, stop with your nonsense.

228
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,550
What?

229
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,390
Can you not see it?

230
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,080
Can you not see the blood on my hands?

231
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,930
If up until now we were helping you, that's no longer the case.

232
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:22,360
I already got blood on my hands. I have to see the end of this.

233
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,050
What are you saying? What blood? Your hands are clean.

234
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,830
No. If we stop here, then I became a bad person for no reason.

235
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,000
We'll make you into the cafe's owner no matter what, so

236
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,350
don't worry about anything,

237
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,170
and stay put.

238
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,280
He won't accept my resignation...

239
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,960
and I can't say anything to the kids either.

240
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,210
What am I supposed to do?

241
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,780
Really.

242
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,870
Boss, I'm here.

243
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,860
Where has he been going these days during the day and night?

244
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,830
Boss.

245
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,430
Are you still sleeping at this hour?

246
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,570
Boss.

247
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,580
Boss, get up.

248
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,040
Are you okay, you're burning up.

249
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,510
What time is it?

250
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,870
Twelve o'clock just passed.

251
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,990
I'm fine, Bo Ah.

252
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,270
What do you mean, you're okay?

253
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,690
This rascal. He's making Mommy suffer like this.

254
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,720
Just wait until he gets caught!

255
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,430
Huh?

256
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,140
Seriously. I'm going

257
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,020
to break his legs.

258
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,450
I'm going to make him not want to

259
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,750
work anywhere except at an office job.

260
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,960
That punk.

261
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,560
Just wait until I catch you! You're worrying your mother like this.

262
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,950
I'm going to kill you!

263
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,630
What have you been doing to your body these days?

264
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,720
It's probably just the flu.

265
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,090
What a joke.

266
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,800
Hyung!

267
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,230
Have you been doing hard manual labor?

268
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,090
How did you know?

269
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,390
What a troublemaker.

270
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,310
Boss, you're doing manual labor?

271
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,490
Why? Because you needed money?

272
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,010
Yeah. Will you lend me some?

273
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,420
Next patient.

274
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,660
Are you really going to do this?

275
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,650
I don't have money either.

276
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,200
I got the maximum loan so I could open this office. Sit down.

277
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,550
You're not sleeping, are you?

278
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,630
What do you do at night? Designated driving?

279
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,290
Hyung, are you a shaman?

280
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,120
It's so obvious.

281
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,590
You do designated driving too?!

282
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,770
I'll prescribe some herbs for you, so make sure to drink it.

283
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,800
Get acupuncture and moxa, too.

284
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,650
Are you going to bill your younger brother?

285
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,250
Okay, I can't lend you money, but I will do this for you.

286
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,790
Acupuncture and moxa is good,

287
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,430
but what about gongjindan (herbal mixture to combat fatigue)? Can you give me that?

288
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,950
You're going to sell it, aren't you?

289
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,860
I'm really going to eat it.

290
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,780
I have to eat to get energy to make money.

291
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,790
Okay.

292
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,360
Bo Ah, can you check to see if he sells it or consumes it?

293
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,770
Yes, I will make sure he eats it.

294
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,750
And you rest, even if it's for a day or two.

295
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,510
I will take care of that too.

296
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,630
Bo Ah, I will carry it.

297
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,520
Don't touch it. I'll give you one a day.

298
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,240
No, but because I'm not even that sick—

299
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,340
Go.

300
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,580
Let's go.

301
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,860
Let's go, let's go.

302
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,750
I'm going to kill him.

303
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,410
That punk.

304
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,160
I will catch you.

305
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,590
You're dead now.

306
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,070
Which way did they go? Why can't I see them?

307
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,230
His head is bigger than others!

308
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,210
I see him.

309
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,070
You, hey!

310
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,860
Why did you go that way?

311
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,500
I'll get my hands on you!

312
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,630
You punk! Just wait until I catch you!

313
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,320
This damn uphill.

314
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,860
Alright so you're here somewhere, right?

315
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,150
This way, that way?

316
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,530
That way?

317
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,450
Wait a moment.

318
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,820
Here, okay I got you.

319
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,990
You punk, I caught you.

320
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,800
Get over here!

321
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,460
How can you work manual labor in the morning,

322
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,530
make recipes in the afternoon, and then work as a substitute driver at night?

323
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,520
When exactly do you sleep?

324
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,260
If you overwork your body like that... Boss, why are you so foolish?

325
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,530
Bo Ah, are you mad?

326
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:15,550
Why would I be mad? How could I be mad at you?

327
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,910
Its not that.

328
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,530
I'm fine.

329
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:26,220
Even if it means doing this, I wanted to protect our store and give you your paycheck on time.

330
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,630
That's why I did it.

331
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,260
It's not hard, and it's endurable.

332
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,420
♫   You come to me like a dream   ♫

333
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,500
♫   When I am sad   ♫

334
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,930
Boss.

335
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,000
You know, I did some thinking last night.

336
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,230
♫   You hug me tight   ♫

337
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,310
I won't accept any pay.

338
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,450
- Bo Ah. 
 - Just do that for me.

339
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,780
If not, then I seriously won't come out to work anymore.

340
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,760
I'll just not come anymore.

341
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,740
♫   I never   ♫

342
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:08,050
♫   want to show you my tears   ♫

343
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:13,360
♫   Even to you who doesn't know my feelings  ♫

344
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,290
Why are you so late?

345
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,050
I'm sorry, I had something to do.

346
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,640
Where did we go yesterday?

347
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,660
He's sick today.

348
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,270
What?

349
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,880
Bo Ah, I told you I'm okay.

350
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,900
So let him rest and we'll work on the recipe.

351
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,820
How sick are you?

352
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,500
I'm not sick, seriously.

353
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,370
Here, here, and here.

354
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,660
You're hurt there.

355
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,190
You saw, right.

356
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,420
Hurry and go in.

357
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,980
Ok, let's work now

358
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,050
Next patient.

359
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,360
Mom!

360
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,860
- What are you wearing? 
- Am I even you guys mom?

361
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,660
- What do you mean? 
- If you seriously cared about your younger brother,

362
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,220
you would've told me sooner instead of just watching him do as he pleases!

363
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,300
Mom, I seriously did not mean to deceive you, but—

364
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,250
Call him, right now.

365
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,260
Yeah, Hyung? I just saw you, so why are you calling me?

366
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,810
That is...

367
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,740
- Are you able to come now?
 - Now, why?

368
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,540
Don't come. Mom is here!

369
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,700
And don't answer my calls!

370
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,890
Don't come, mom is here, don't come!

371
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,800
Mom, what is wrong with your clothes?

372
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:32,200
It's nothing. Just know that I'll be staying at your house for a while from today on.

373
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,630
Again? But you just came by.

374
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,940
It won't be for long. Half a day if it's short

375
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,860
and four days at most.

376
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,490
Sir.

377
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,420
- Hello. 
- May I ask you something?

378
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,150
Ah, yes.

379
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:16,910
Ask away. Min Ah, bring two cups of coffee.

380
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:21,400
What's this about? Do you need a room?

381
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,150
- Monthly rental? Deposit lease?
 - No, it's not that.

382
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,780
I was wondering how many chicken joints or pubs there are around here.

383
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,810
- Ah, you want to start a business? 
- That's not it...

384
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:38,620
Min Ah, I asked for coffee. What are you daydreaming about?

385
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,870
Grandpa, did you call for me?

386
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,350
Forget it. Do what you were doing.

387
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:52,670
Aigoo. Why is that girl so out of it?

388
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:59,360
Seeing that you're researching local businesses before starting a business,

389
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,330
you're really quite something. Huh?

390
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:12,260
- Yes.
 - Let's see here. Let me find you a good spot.

391
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,810
A beer business... Beer...

392
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:25,570
Here there's a chicken place that may or may not do well.

393
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:32,760
There's a guy who's on the verge of closing, so this place won't work.

394
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,390
Here's the perfect spot for you.

395
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:40,460
Over there. If you look that way at those buildings there...

396
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,780
- Grandpa, it's the neighborhood across. 
 - What?

397
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,860
- There's a good location besides that place. 
- That isn't that way

398
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,640
but in our neighborhood.

399
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,460
There's a good place out front.

400
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,170
It's right behind the main street and the lease is cheap.

401
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,200
Ah, but...

402
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,730
I heard there was a chicken place already out there.

403
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,310
Ah... That?

404
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,580
Their business was suspended for two months not too long ago.

405
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,440
You have a chance if you open soon and settle in first.

406
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,320
The vacant store location is on the way to the other chicken joint.

407
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,150
Really? I'm interested, can you tell me more?

408
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,160
Unni, you came at the perfect time. There's a lot of competition over there.

409
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,540
But if you sign the lease here, we get first dibs

410
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,870
because I've been doing my job well.

411
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,460
But if you look at it right now, then you'll fall in love with it immediately

412
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,720
because we'll give you  half off the realtor fee.

413
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,050
Okay, Grandpa? So if you look at it now...

414
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,460
What are you doing? Do you think the kitchen is a joke?

415
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:16,260
- But I just did as I was told.
 - You should've squeezed out the water and battered it well.

416
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,580
You punk!

417
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,280
I told you to make the dough. Who told you to make soup?

418
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,290
Why are you getting upset, you can just teach me more.

419
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:33,250
Are you guys serious? Finish up and bring me the radish.

420
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,110
But isn't the store seriously going to fail?

421
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:49,130
- It's going to be closed for two months.
 - Hey employee, just do what you're told.

422
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:54,370
- The owner said it wasn't going to close. 
- Well we have to look at this objectively.

423
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:59,760
What happens if I work my butt off, but don't get paid because the store closes?

424
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,480
Ah. That punk, seriously.

425
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,710
So, what I mean is...

426
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:13,490
- I'm saying we need a plan.
 - What plan? We just have to push through

427
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,350
and lower unnecessary  expenses.

428
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,870
Unnecessary expenses?

429
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,380
What, why are you looking at me?

430
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,240
Are you saying I'm the unnecessary expense?

431
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,790
You guys are mean. You told me I am your family.

432
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,260
- Refreshing Bath family.
 - I never said that.

433
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,180
I didn't either.

434
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,810
It's during times like this that families need to put their strengths together to overcome hardships. Aren't I right?

435
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,450
- What is he saying? 
 - Don't you think so?

436
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,380
- Unnecessary expense! 
 - Noona, why are you acting like this? We're both employees.

437
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,840
I will be out for a second.

438
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,770
Where are you going part-timer? You need to fry chicken.

439
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,530
Aren't you going to do it properly? When do you think you're going to finish at this rate?

440
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:04,020
Hold on, you want me to do all this by myself.

441
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,750
Let's do it together.

442
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,410
See this? Do you want to prepare the ingredients with me?

443
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:32,680
No. How was this place managed before I came along?

444
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,850
Excuse me.

445
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,940
Until you finish this you can't go to the bathroom.

446
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,920
If you run again one more time then... you'll see.

447
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,960
If someone's this bad at something, people usually tell them not to do it.

448
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,300
This is frustrating.

449
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,860
If it's not important it's best to leave him be. It's up to you to wait or leave.

450
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,220
- Isn't it uncomfortable for him to sleep here? 
 - He lives here.

451
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,030
Didn't he live upstairs?

452
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,610
- It's his own personal life. Why are you trying to find that out? 
 - I guess not.

453
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,310
When do you get off?

454
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,180
- What? 
 - I'm asking you when you're getting off.

455
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,300
You speak curtly and your name is weird.

456
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,980
I think you're pursuing American style.

457
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,710
Can you give me some of your time after you get off work?

458
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,600
- What do you want? 
- You'll find out if you come out, I guess.

459
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,670
Right, my pride isn't important.

460
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,030
What are you doing?

461
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,950
- What are you doing not going in? 
 - Hi, Grandpa.

462
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,720
Grandpa, are you sick?

463
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,320
Why the sudden need for a pain patch?

464
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,760
I couldn't sleep well.

465
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,380
I think it's a muscle cramp.

466
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,230
Grandpa, are you having indigestion?

467
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,590
Where did you have such good food?

468
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,000
Just wait until you get old.

469
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,670
You will have many pains and illnesses all over your body.

470
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:18,220
Even if that's the case, why so much medication?

471
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,240
It's concerning.

472
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,150
When are you moving back in?

473
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,160
Why would I move in when I have a home of my own?

474
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,660
Until when do you plan to be a burden on your boss?

475
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,080
Don't talk foolishness

476
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,660
and come back home.

477
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,220
How am I a burden?

478
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,180
How are you not a burden?

479
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,660
You eat, sleep, dress and wash at the store. It must be so uncomfortable.

480
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,150
You care so much about my boss.

481
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,570
I didn't know that.

482
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,410
Grandpa, about that...

483
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,280
Do you think our society is fair?

484
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,790
What?

485
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,210
As a future member of society, I don't think it is.

486
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,480
You know what I mean, right.

487
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,590
Grandpa, don't you feel responsible as a past member of society?

488
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,440
What responsibility?

489
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,320
Grandpa, you still have a chance. No, that's not the right term.

490
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,340
Social responsibility? Or moral obligation?

491
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,990
Grandpa, I'm getting to the point.

492
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:25,150
Grandpa, do you really need the rent?

493
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,620
You punk!

494
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,620
No, listen.

495
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,200
Earning money through labor is more suitable for social justice,

496
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,580
rather than earning from passive income.

497
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,900
I'm right.

498
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,910
Am I wrong?

499
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,830
Leave.

500
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:43,660
Grandpa! If free is too much, you can collect money after two months.

501
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,970
Grandpa!

502
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,930
What a stingy Scrooge! Evil landlord.

503
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,100
I didn't realize, but I fell asleep.

504
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,810
Where did everyone go?

505
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,500
Bae Ki Beom is preparing the radish and Seo Bo Ah ran out all of a sudden.

506
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,620
Excuse me?

507
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,270
I don't know. She said she would be back soon and she hasn't come back yet.

508
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,930
I see.

509
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:33,160
Anthony, you should have rested. You must be tired.

510
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,700
If you can't memorize it,

511
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,570
look at it and read. It says it right here Andrew Kang, Andrew Kang.

512
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,330
So it was there.

513
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,160
If you're awake, go try the new sauce I made.

514
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,820
Okay.

515
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,750
Where did that punk go?

516
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,330
Bae Ki Beom!

517
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,640
I told him not to move before he's finished with the radish.

518
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,760
I gave him a warning...

519
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,210
This, who did it?

520
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,560
Why is it so dark?

521
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,620
People might really think we're out of business.

522
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,260
Boss, are you still sleeping?

523
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,960
I told him not to go out.

524
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,410
 How am I a burden?

525
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,370
 How are you not a burden?

526
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:31,460
 You eat, sleep, dress and wash at the store. It must be so uncomfortable.

527
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,800
Am I really?

528
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,070

571
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,120
 The taste has changed. Cries.

572
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,460
 I was curious about here, but its nothing much.

573
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,190
  When I first went it was very good, but yesterday it was so so.

574
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,160
  I'm disappointed.

575
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,930
This is weird.

576
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,010
We only sold fried chicken then.

577
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,030
Since there's no need to introduce each other,

578
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,150
I'll skip the greeting and get to the point.

579
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:29,360
Have you heard the saying, "send a bomb"?

580
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,720
It's a reasonable doubt.

581
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,540
Everything aside, someone must have reported it for the police to arrive.

582
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,660
That's it.

583
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,500
So I did some investigating

584
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,000
and quite a few things are odd.

585
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,280
First, we must think of everyone as a suspect.

586
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,590
Why do you trust me?

587
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:13,030
Why are you leaving me out if you say everyone's a suspect?

588
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,630
When we were shooting it seemed like you couldn't use your hand.

589
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,030
Is it true?

590
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:26,430
You barely found your own kitchen (to work). Why would you send a bomb?

591
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,190
Why didn't you call the owner? Its about his store.

592
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,530
He doesn't know how to be suspicious of people.

593
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,400
He'll make it obvious.

594
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,200
That's my point. I tried talking to him, but he didn't understand.

595
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,870
It's not too late to talk to him after we narrow down the suspects.

596
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,170
Suspect one, Hwang Min Ah.

597
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,720
Looking at how you're doing, you are so similar to my mom.

598
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,150
What?

599
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,500
Its nothing, continue.

600
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:08,530
She works at a real estate office but openly expressed hostility towards the chicken joint.

601
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,070
That woman, why?

602
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,590
I don't know that.

603
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,050
I will have to find out from now on.

604
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,620
Next is suspect two.

605
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,330
It must be him. Just look at him.

606
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:24,200
Kim Gyoo Man. The butcher shop owner.

607
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,980
He is that minor.

608
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,160
Right, they look alike.

609
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,710
There's an age gap, so they can't be twins.

610
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,280
They're cousins but they look alike. Enough for the worker to get confused.

611
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,880
He was resentful because they bought their chicken elsewhere,

612
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,430
so it's possible that's why he committed the crime.

613
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,310
Who's the next one?

614
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,030
That's Bae Ki Beom.

615
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,170
The part-timer who started work on the day of the incident.

616
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:00,280
I was suspicious of the timing and looked into him. He has a bad reputation.

617
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:06,280
When I asked Choi Go, he said someone recommended him because he's a hard worker.

618
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,780
That he works well?

619
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,190
Who would say such nonsense?

620
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,630
Oh Yeong Ho, the soccer store owner.

621
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,560
He's suspect three.

622
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,970
How did he buy so much resentment?

623
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,430
This is what I've investigated so far.

624
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:31,400
But what irks me is that there's no clear motive.

625
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:37,930
Based on my experience as an assistant PD on the show, "I want to know even that,"

626
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,530
in a situation like this...

627
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,590
A situation like this?

628
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,480
The real suspect can be controlling one of them.

629
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,400
A grand scheme.

630
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,630
Were you substitute driving until now?

631
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,730
Bo Ah, you're not sleeping yet?

632
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,670
Do you know what time it is?

633
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,000
You're going to get shut-eye for a few hours and go work manual labor, huh?

634
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's called manual labor, but it's not as bad as you think.

635
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,690
- I just clean up after.
 - No.

636
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,100
Didn't you hear what the herb doctor said?

637
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,050
He said to rest a few days until you recover.

638
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,770
Okay, I won't go to work tomorrow and will sleep well,

639
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,200
so you should go up and sleep.

640
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,260
I don't want to.

641
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,190
Pardon?

642
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,470
Now I can't trust you.

643
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,440
What are you doing not coming in? This isn't your first time here.

644
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,190
No, it's not, but it's late.

645
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:16,610
Hurry and come in. You followed me all the way up here. What are you saying?

646
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,640
Bo Ah, what are you doing?

647
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,060
We should sleep, do you not know what time it is.

648
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,170
Pardon?

649
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,830
Hurry and go sleep.

650
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,180
If I sleep there, what about you

651
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,260
I will sleep in the living room

652
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,310
since I have to make sure that you don't leave.

00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,610
Hurry and sleep.

656
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:49,470
I can hear everything in my sleep, so don't get caught trying to sneak out.

No, not yet.

677
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,580
Good.

Bo Ah, are you awake?

685
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,630
Yes.

686
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,460
When did you wake up and do all this?

687
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,210
I just made something simple with the ingredients I had.

688
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,020
I will enjoy it.

689
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,190
Please do.

690
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,300
Who is it at this hour?

691
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,430
Who is it?

692
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,950
Bo Ah, did you order a delivery?

693
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,430
They wouldn't come all the way up here to deliver it.

694
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,390
They would just leave it on the first floor.

695
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:20,290
Did you forget to lock the shop?

696
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,200
I forgot. I wasn't in my right mind.

Who is it?

698

He's here, right?

699
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,790

How much time will it take?

707

They're Seo Bo Ah's friends.

Why do you trust that woman? She isn't it.

Enough.

711

Are you going to marry him?

712
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,760
No, no, its not like that.

713
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,530
Bo Ah, I want to protect this store.
