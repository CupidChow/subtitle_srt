1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
 The Best Chicken

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,550
 Park Sun Ho

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,600
 Kim So Hye

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,690
 Joo Woo Jae

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:28,760

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,130
 Grandpa, there are too few customers, so I don't think I'll be able to pay the rent.

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,550
 I resign because there is something I'd like to do.

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,890
 What is that?

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,780
 Running a shop.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,520
 In that place, everything is not as it seems.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,800
 Oh my god!

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,620
 You all worked hard.

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,760
 Most people turn around before even entering the bathhouse.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,860
 I'll go with that building.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,020
 - Huh? 
- What?

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,030
 "The pearl in the mud," that place.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,620
 The bathhouse is leased. Leave!

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,370
 Aigoo. Aigoo.

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,830
 Grandpa, why are you doing this to me?

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,280
 I have something to propose to you.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,000
 Have you ever thought about working here with me?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,180
 What is this?

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,880
 The contract is 30 years?!

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,520
 There is no other option

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,260
 if he doesn't ruin the business and walk out on his own two feet.

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,220
 This is the only option left, right?

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,700
 Welcome.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,110
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

29
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,760
Let's go!

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,450
 Opening tomorrow

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,230
Welcome, Sir.

32
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,330
Thank you.

33
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,830
Welcome.

34
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,790
Smells like chicken.

35
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,730
Thank you.

36
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,230
Seasoned flavor chicken, please.

37
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,720
Seasoned and pardon?

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,030
Soy sauce flavored chicken, garlic flavored chicken.  Three glasses of beer and two bottles of soju.

39
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,590
Ah, as for the fried chicken, I'll take it when I go. And please prepare it as to-go.
 - Pardon?

40
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,990
May I have one seasoned chicken with lots of sauce,

41
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,290
with three sides of pickled radish, and 500ml of Cola.

42
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,020
1.5 liters, please.

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,350
Chin down.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,770
Strengthen your arms. Smile.

45
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,620
Make sure not to spill the water.

46
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,350
Again!

47
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,750
That makes ₩127,000 for you.

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,270
They will pay for what they ordered and

49
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,990
I will pay for what I ordered.

50
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,570
Ya! Then you pay.

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,570
Okay.

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,580
If I was the owner, a part-timer like you would be fired right away.

53
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,490
When was the last time you visited a restaurant?

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,030
Two years ago?

55
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,050
Or was it three years ago?

56
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,930
You've been hiding in the house.

57
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,470
You need to receive service to give good service.

58
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,390
Anyway, tomorrow is the day so there is no going back.

59
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,670
But Bo Ah...

60
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,610
If this chicken place fails,

61
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,350
what will you do then?

62
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,470
Will you turn it back into a bathhouse?

63
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,870
I haven't thought that far yet.

64
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,850
I don't think I'll turn it back into a bathhouse.

65
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,380
Then?

66
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you have to make things complicated?

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,550
Make the concept here come alive.

68
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,660
These days that's the trend.

69
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
Instagram worthy.

70
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,740
Are you saying that I should run a chicken place?

71
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,560
How am I supposed to cook the chicken?

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,550
You can sell things other than chicken.

73
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,130
For example... coffee?

74
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,680
A bathhouse cafe?

75
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,730
That sounds good.

76
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,300
That seems nice.

77
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,290
So, am I a cafe owner now?

78
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,950
No, that seems nice, but

79
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,460
do you need to go so far as to be a part-timer?

80
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,380
Anyway, didn't you say that the boss picked you?

81
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,860
Hey, I can't get fired before this place fails.

82
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,750
You need to have the feeling of being competent

83
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,300
so that you can have a chance

84
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,910
to cut your enemy's throat.

85
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,200
How can you crawl into the enemy's field without such determination?

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,970
Okay, practice, practice.

87
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,250
Practice.

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,450
Would you like to order?

89
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,470
It became complicated.

90
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,230
We're just two men (for bathhouse admission).

91
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,920
Did it change to a mixed bath (where women and men bath together)?

92
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,200
I'm sorry. Elder.

93
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,410
We're a chicken restaurant now, not a bathhouse.

94
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,720
Really? We came to take a bath though?

95
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,970
No wonder you kept telling us to order.

96
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,630
Let's go. I felt something was strange when I came in.

97
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,590
Aigoo.

98
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,010
Let's go, go.

99
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,380
My regular place is gone now.

100
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,000
This is confusing.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,790
It's a chicken place they say. Where shall we go?

102
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,820
- Next time, come and have chicken. 
- Sure, sure.

103
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,780
Let's go.

104
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,440
Goodbye.

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,420
Let's go that way.

106
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,910
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken Work Contract

107
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,570
Your day-off is every Monday, and you work six days per week.

108
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,660
You will be paid weekly. You have a thirty-minute break.

109
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,690
Your work times can change depending on the situation.

110
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,610
You will be paid the minimum hourly wage, and it is currently at ₩7,530 ($7.50).

111
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,620
However, during the probation, you will be paid only 90% of promised wage—

112
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,160
I want ₩10,000 ($10.00) per hour and no probation.

113
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,150
What did you say?

114
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,160
Didn't you see me with the customers earlier?

115
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Those grandpas recognized me and everything.

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,650
But, to give you ₩10,000 without knowing your skillset fully is...

117
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,580
You must have forgotten already, but

118
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,990
I was the face of this bathhouse

119
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,440
for five years.

120
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,690
It'd be difficult to treat me like I'm just a part-time worker.

121
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,010
 Make sure to get ₩10,000 as an hourly salary.

122
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,700
 The discount of ₩500,000 that your grandpa gave to him, you should get it back.

123
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,460
 Since you're paid  ₩10,000 per hour, you will only get ₩450,000 more

124
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
 than if you get minimum wage!

125
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,430
 For the last ₩50,000, try thinking that you gave to a beggar.

126
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,180
Grandpa used to always nag me about giving me just ₩50,000 as an allowance.

127
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,820
 But what? ₩500,000 ($500) off each month?

128
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,500
 In case you need to bargain, you can't go below ₩9,000.

129
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,180
 If you let him cut ₩1,000 off, you'll lose ₩180,000 per month!

130
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,850
 We need to force him to pay more money for hiring cost.

131
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,050
So he'll fail one day sooner.

132
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,440
 But, will he easily give me  ₩10,000?

133
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,200
I am willing to work for at least ₩9,500.

134
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
Sure.

135
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
What?

136
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,890
I only saw you for a short while, but you seem to be doing well.

137
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,280
Even though I saw your working briefly, I believe in you, so I'll give you ₩10,000.

138
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,220
Ah, yes.

139
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,030
Seriously?

140
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,560
Please take care of me.

141
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,030
Today is the day before the opening, so it will get busy from then.

142
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,670
Yes.

143
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,220
  Episode 2
 The Lord's Hobby

144
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,020
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

145
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,110
  3 days later

146
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,180
Bo Ah, if you're awake can you come here?

147
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,430
Yes.

148
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,910
 Unbelievable Bargain

149
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,320
  Unbelievable Bargain

150
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,880
You call that a flyer?

151
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,200
How is it? Isn't it totally awesome?

152
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,900
As soon as you look at this flyer, doesn't it just make you crave chicken?

153
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,860
Well, since I always crave chicken.

154
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,820
Can I leave this to you?

155
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,730
I will be preparing another promotion.

156
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,020
Yes, Boss.

157
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,240
Hold on.

158
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,880
Can you do that one more time?

159
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,490
Again?

160
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,940
Yes.

161
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,610
Boss, Boss, Boss.

162
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,390
Boss, Boss, Boss.

163
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,840
Boss, Boss, Boss.

164
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,760
Boss, Boss, Boss, Boss, Boss, Boss, Boss.

165
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,530
My Boss, Is that enough?

166
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,810
I will distribute the flyers then.

167
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,340
It's nice to hear you calling me boss every time.

168
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,180
See you later.

169
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,050
Where are you going Bo Ah?

170
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,930
On an errand.

171
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,220
Bo Ah, are things going well?

172
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,030
Sure, absolutely wonderful.

173
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,330
It's been three days since the opening and we have yet to see our first customer.

174
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,220
That's great.

175
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,000
Your boss must be devoured by anxiety around now.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,410
Nope. Even in the midst of this, he is still very easy going.

177
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,420
Business is a joke to him.

178
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,960
There is no way that's true.

179
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,160
Do you know how much money it takes to open a store?

180
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,080
He's probably just hiding his anxiety from you.

181
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,760
You think so?

182
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,310
No, that's not it.

183
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,820
That is definitely not it.

184
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,610
Though it might be.

185
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,360
I wanted to stop talking about it.

186
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,160
But you know, when I was twenty, I went on a trip to Europe.

187
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,520
Stop it.

188
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,090
Please just stop.

189
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,770
I've heard so many times about the airplane menu on the flight going and coming back.

190
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,540
Just listen. You know the Versailles Palace, right?

191
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,590
There is an amazing farm there.

192
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,850
And its name is Marie Antoinette's farm.

193
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,720
Why do you think she made a farm inside the palace?

194
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,570
Just go on.

195
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,640
Back then, between nobles, farming was the trend.

196
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,890
They saw farmers squeeze milk out of cows,

197
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,540
and plow the land.

198
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,490
This looked super fun.

199
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,100
Why? Because life was boring.

200
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,030
So the chicken restaurant's boss is like Marie Antoinette?

201
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,020
Exactly. You said he graduated from a prestigious university and worked at a major company.

202
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,590
But he left all of that to open a chicken restaurant.

203
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,300
He even gave you the wage you requested and is fine with things not going well.

204
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,680
It's clear.

205
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,960
What is?

206
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,970
He's from a rich family.

207
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,940
Think about how excited your rich young lord must be right now?

208
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,400
He must be frying chicken, doing the dishes,

209
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,970
and hearing you call him boss.

210
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,450
Right! He goes nuts for that.

211
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,360
What am I to do?

212
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,050
Yes, what does our Bo Ah do now?

213
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,270
She's in real trouble.

214
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,060
 Unbelievable Bargain

215
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,090
I can't leave things the way they are.

216
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,890
I need special countermeasures.

217
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,140
Min Ah, I need pen and paper. Quickly.

218
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,450
What are you doing?

219
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,600
Min Ah, when do you not want to eat chicken?

220
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,560
When I am full?

221
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,510
No, that's too difficult.

222
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,430
I need something that makes you lose your appetite.

223
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,690
Right. Appetite.

224
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:31,070

225
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,460
Cruel girl.

226
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,530
Honey, don't worry.

227
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,570
I will save you.

228
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,200
I'm fine with being fried.

229
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,150
But our children...

230
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,920
Honey, don't say something so weak.

231
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,630
Hello. You'd like fried chicken?

232
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,240
Honey, you need to live happily without me.

233
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,790
And take care of our kids.

234
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,170
Honey, take my hand!

235
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,140
Honey, it's too hot.

236
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,420
Kya!

237
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,060
How can you leave me like this? How am I going to live?

238
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,400
- Honey!
 - Mom! I miss you!

239
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Honey...

240
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,740
Farewell, my babies.

241
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,210
We fry chicken like a mother would.

242
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,220
It's tasty, Refreshing Bath Chicken.

243
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,980
You really want us to print this?

244
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,910
Yes, 2000, please.

245
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,290
No, wait, let's go for 4000 pages.

246
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,360
So I can spread it all over the neighborhood.

247
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,750
Enjoy.

248
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,950
Here you go.

249
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,250
- Enjoy the meal.
 - Thank you.

250
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,710
- Chicken's here.
 - Thank you.

251
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,340
- Enjoy.
 - Thanks.

252
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,520
- Chicken's here.
 - Thanks.

253
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,850
Oh! Bo Ah. Over here.

254
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,220
Enjoy. If it's tasty, ask your mother to buy more for you.

255
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,400
Thank you.

256
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,060
I will enjoy it.

257
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,080
While I hand out the chicken, can you hand out the flyers next to me?

258
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,710
Sure.

259
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,670
Here's the chicken.

260
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,970
If it's tasty, ask your mother to buy some.

261
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,360
Yes, thank you.

262
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,740
Take a flyer.

263
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,070
Chicken's here.

264
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,950
Have some chicken.

265
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,990
Thank you.

266
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,580
Take a look at this!

267
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,930
What is it?

268
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,490
- Chicken's here.
 - Thank you.

269
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,070
Enjoy.

270
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,330
 Isn't this chicken poor?

271
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,590
Here you go.

272
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,280
Take one.

273
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,310
One for you too.

274
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,280
 Unbelievable Bargain

275
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,170
So Ah, what is this?

276
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,330
- What do you think? It's way better than the other one, right? 
- Gosh, who will eat after reading this?

277
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,190
Hey Mister, hurry and give me some chicken as well.

278
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,050
Tell me later.

279
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,760
Enjoy.

280
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,360
Be sure to show your parents!

281
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,450
Take one.

282
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,300
Enjoy.

283
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,030
You can go now.

284
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,440
This tasty chicken.

285
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,500
Just one bite.

286
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,720
Enjoy and bring your parents next time.

287
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,900
Make sure to show this to your parents.

288
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,270
Ask your parents to buy some if you enjoy it.

289
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,750
Yes.

290
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,670
With your friends...

291
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,760
Enjoy.

292
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,080
If this is tasty, ask your parents to buy you some.

293
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,170
Yes.

294
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,750
Since this is a coupon, take it.

295
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,500
Enjoy.

296
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,610
Come back next time.

297
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,580
Enjoy and come over with your parents next time.

298
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,350
Enjoy and see you next time.

299
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,070
I'm sorry, the child just now received the last box.

300
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,960
What?

301
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,560
Instead, I can give you a 50% discount coupon with our flyer, so come back next time.

302
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,260
Our chicken is really tasty, you see.

303
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,960
Never mind. I'm not eating.

304
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,210
I feel like dying.

305
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,300
Seo Bo Ah, I think we need to talk.

306
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,380
 Park Joon Hyeok's Clinic

307
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,120
Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

308
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,850
No, thank you doctor.

309
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,110
Then goodbye.

310
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,610
Next one.

311
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,320
Director Park, how could you see each patient for twenty minutes?

312
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,220
A clinic is also a business. You need to think of your profits.

313
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,900
Mom, what brings you so suddenly to Seoul?

314
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,820
What do you mean why? How could you say something so sad?

315
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,860
My son just opened his own clinic. Of course, I need to come.

316
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,750
The interior isn't that elegant.

317
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,410
While I'm here, I should change some stuff.

318
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,000
Don't be like that.

319
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,340
When does your little brother finish work?

320
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,380
We should eat together. Tell him to come here.

321
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,740
Ah, the thing is...

322
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,200
If he feels pressured to work overtime, I'll call the company.

323
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,030
Ask him to give me his department head's phone number.

324
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,570
His department head will probably understand since it's a parent and her child meeting after a couple of months.

325
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,590
I think he went on a business trip. Overseas.

326
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,190
Really?

327
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,810
Without even telling his mother.

328
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,930
Then how about we don't eat out,

329
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,190
but shall I make you a meal?

330
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,420
It's been quite a while since you had a homemade meal, right?

331
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,600
I made the draft. But this...

332
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,290
Who comes to eat chicken after seeing this?

333
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,300
I mean, this... mommy hen.

334
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,120
How are you going to take responsibility for this situation?

335
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,310
Boss, can I be honest?

336
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,240
About what?

337
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,030
Your flyer. It stinks.

338
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,440
In this neighborhood, more than fifteen such flyers get put up every day.

339
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,550
They go straight into the trash.

340
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,020
But this. Could you throw this away?

341
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,770
That's even more of a problem. Mommy hen will even come up in their dreams!

342
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,270
You don't seem to get it, but this is the trend nowadays.

343
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,340
I don't know about trends, but this isn't going to work.

344
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,940
Isn't this common sense?

345
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,280
Yes, hyung. I will call you in a bit—

346
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,940
- What?!
 - Mom's here.

347
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,700
She's sleeping over at our house.

348
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,960
Then what about me?

349
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,400
I don't know, man. So who told you to cancel the previous lease and barge into my place?

350
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,470
Anyway, just know that I am going to take her home.

351
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,210
Now?!

352
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,470
You know what happens if she finds out you quit the company, right?

353
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,630
She's going to make a one-man demonstration in front of the company to get you reinstated.

354
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,620
Director Park?

355
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,690
- Got to go. Bye.
 - Hold on. Hyung!

356
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,740
The point is you have no sense whatsoever for things like this, so just leave them to me.

357
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,090
Got it?

358
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,210
For now, I have something urgent to do, so let's talk later.

359
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,830
Boss? Then I will distribute the rest of the flyers.

360
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,990
If I can't, say so now.

361
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,730
I take your silence as permission.

362
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,850
There's no psychopath who would look at this and come to eat chicken.

363
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,110

364
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,360
 Unbelievable Bargain

365
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,210
I'm from the Refreshing Bath Chicken place.

366
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,250
I'm from the Refreshing Bath Chicken place.

367
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,080
Working hard, I see?

368
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,480
Take a break. You're going to faint before handing all of them out.

369
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,020
Follow me.

370
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,010
I don't think I'll be able to walk anymore because of my legs.

371
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,530
How many did you hand out?

372
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,520
I don't know, maybe around 500? This will have an effect, right?

373
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,870
Of course. Because of you, the chicken restaurants in our neighborhood will all go bankrupt.

374
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,890
Using my body after a while is exhausting.

375
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,130
I don't want to live diligently.

376
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,920
You got a freckle!

377
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,530
What? Really?

378
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,000
For how long am I supposed to do this?

379
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,410
I'm dying because of that rich lord's hobby.

380
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,730
What are you talking about?

381
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,870
Something.

382
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,430
I feel like there has to be a method. Something certain and powerful.

383
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,630
Should I look into it?

384
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,080
Min Ah...

385
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,550
Here.

386
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,680
What was the password again?

387
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,180
Director Park.

388
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,240
Normally it doesn't look like this. I've just been busy these days.

389
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,110
Oh.

390
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,230
This won't do. I think I will have to stay a while.

391
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,390
No, that's really fine.

392
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,910
Are you kidding? Look at this mess.

393
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:56,410
After a few days, Choi Go will return from his trip, then I can see his face before I leave.

394
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,460
Goodness.

395
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,810
Mom. Why are you working when coming over to your son's place?

396
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,430
I will do it later, so let's go out and eat something.

397
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,520
Do you see Choi Go often?

398
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,510
Sure, from time to time.

399
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,480
Take care of him.

400
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,180
I'm sorry for you, but he always worries me.

401
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,830
Even at school, he was always lacking compared to you.

402
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,960
Even in society, he is always lacking compared to you.

403
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,860
Mom. When others hear this, they will laugh.

404
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,620
He went to a great school and made it to Myeongseong Group.

405
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,670
What is lacking about him?

406
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,780
You're right. I never expected him to enter that famous company even in my wildest dreams.

407
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,930
Because of that, I feel so happy.

408
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,210
I will do that later.

409
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,250
I'm almost done.

410
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,640
Done, done.

411
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,540
- I'm sorry, customer—
 - Fried chicken, please.

412
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,650
And this.

413
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,250
Since I have a coupon, I get 50% off, right? Go on then.

414
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,410
I'm sorry, but we cannot take any customers right now due to a special circumstance.

415
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,710
Why? You're afraid I don't have ₩5,900?

416
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,900
How can a person...

417
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,490
Fine now?

418
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,210
Bring me the chicken.

419
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,510
That's not it. Because the boss is not here, there is no one to fry the chicken.

420
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,060
What?

421
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,980
How about coming next time? Or going to another restaurant?

422
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,050
I know of a really tasty place on the street over there. How about going there?

423
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,800
Since I work here, I shouldn't say this, but the chicken here is really just so-so.

424
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,680
Now...

425
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,780
are you discriminating against your customers, huh?

426
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,250
Don't make a nonsensical excuse and just get me the chicken.

427
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,190
Excuse me? How long have we known each other that you speak so rudely?

428
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,990
What?

429
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,130
Just because you're a customer, do you think you can speak rudely, ask for the impossible, and go off on a part-timer?

430
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,670
No (spoken formally).

431
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,740
I... was just very hungry (formal).

432
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,680
I even wanted to let you know of a great place. Get out.

433
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,050
Get out, find another place or starve. You figure it out!

434
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,750
Since here we can't sell you chicken anyway.

435
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,490
This place is done for.

436
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,010
Since the boss is strange, only strange people come.

437
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,150
Oh?

438
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,880
Did you come to eat chicken by any chance?

439
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,010
Boss... I didn't kick out the customer, really.

440
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,470
I know. You still don't know how to fry chicken.

441
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,750
What are you doing? The customer's waiting.

442
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,030
Yes, I'm going.

443
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,360
Please enjoy.

444
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,780
He is our first customer.

445
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,850
Right.

446
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,370
Our chicken tastes alright, right? It has to be tasty. I'm nervous.

447
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,430
Well...

448
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:31,170
Chicken is all the same. Fried in oil.

449
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,520
You mean our fried chicken is just a dime a dozen?

450
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,520
What the heck did you do to the chicken?

451
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,170
How is this chicken?

452
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,080
Customer.

453
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,260
What seems to be the problem?

454
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,260
You were right. Rather than eating this, I would be better off starving.

455
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,780
No, that, I didn't quite go that far.

456
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,180
Customer, if you tell me what you don't like,

457
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,770
I will redo it right away.

458
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,940
If you have eyes, use them.

459
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,400
You serve something not fully cooked?

460
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,380
I'm sorry. I will fry another right away.

461
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,570
The fried chicken's here.

462
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,050
You overcooked it to the point even a fork can't penetrate it.

463
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,220
Again.

464
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,540
Again.

465
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,040
Again.

466
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,110
Can't you even do this right?

467
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,660
You just have to take them out at the right time.

468
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,740
Is it a failure again?

469
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,440
Even if you try a hundred more times, the result will be the same.

470
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,410
Compared to waiting for your chicken, it'll be faster if I fry my own chicken and go.

471
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,330
Are you alright, boss?

472
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,040
Customer, you can't just come in the kitchen.

473
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,650
You know how to make a frying mix, right?

474
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,420
Excuse me?

475
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,530
Such a nice chicken.

476
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,030
But customer, here—

477
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,940
Until when are you going to stand there? Hurry up and make the frying mix.

478
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,670
Ah, yes.

479
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
 Andrew.

480
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,340
 Andrew. Snap out of it. (in Itialian)

481
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,600
 What is he doing?

482
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,280
What are the two of them doing?

483
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,020
I'm sorry, customer.

484
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,540
I will accept this money

485
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,780
when you are satisfied with our chicken.

486
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,610
Forget about it. I won't come here again.

487
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,960
Don't be like that.

488
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,390
Be sure to come again.

489
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,560
You don't have a good understanding of ingredients yet.

490
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,140
Boss, I wanted to tell you to avoid any misunderstandings.

491
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,070
I will choose to eat, rather than being starved.

492
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,330
Excuse me, boss. Shall we clean up now?

493
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,730
Don't worry, I will clean things up.

494
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,290
You can leave first.

495
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,810
I am tired.

496
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,770
But it's so late...

497
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,460
There's no way...

498
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,450
He wouldn't keep up his hobby until this late.

499
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,950
Okay.

500
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,590
Tomorrow I will hand out all the leftover flyers.

501
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,290
Yes! It's done!

502
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,250
DONE!

503
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,770
I did it! I made it!

504
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,700
I did it!

505
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,790
Bo Ah. It's done!

506
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,950
Try it.

507
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,550
Hurry.

508
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,420
Just try.

509
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,700
But it's the same chicken as yesterday.

510
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,380
Is it tasty?

511
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,940
Yes.

512
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,880
Try the chicken breast as well.

513
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,720
It's not dry?

514
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Right. I didn't know this.

515
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,730
The cooking time for each part of the chicken is subtly different.

516
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,390
Longer for the leg and shorter for the breast.

517
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:03,570
I didn't even know this yesterday and cooked them all the same time in the oil.

518
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,420
But how did you figure it out?

519
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,390
I cooked each part for a different amount of time.

520
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,350
Because they all cook a different amount of time, the order is:

521
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,470
The Leg, Thigh, Wing and Breast

522
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:19,180
What?

523
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,200
In other words, you shouldn't put all of them into the oil at once.

524
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,270
You start with the leg.

525
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,010
And the breast is the very last.

526
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,350
If you calculate the times precisely,

527
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:33,530
each piece will be in its best state for the customer to taste.

528
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,150
Everyone should try it, but why don't we have any customers?

529
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,400
It seems like you have fun doing business,

530
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,280
despite having no customers.

531
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Of course, I do it because I want to.

532
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,250
Ah, sure. You would like it.

533
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,710
Then I will distribute the rest of the flyers.

534
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,560
Hold on.

535
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,690
I thought about it all night

536
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:06,510
and I think I know why you made such a strange flyer.

537
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,080
If we make a flyer like everyone else does,

538
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,150
it won't be remembered and will just be thrown away.

539
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,150
Right, that's what I was saying.

540
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,100
Anyway, I'm off.

541
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,100
We can't.

542
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,840
It stays in the memory, but it's still a no.

543
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,070
Then what should we do?

544
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:30,050
Instead of that. Something that can't be thrown away.

545
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:35,620
Something that can't be forgotten. Don't we need something like that?

546
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,870
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

547
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,230
It's really nice here.

548
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:06,780
Don't covet what's mine. I have no intention of yielding.

549
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,980
Don't worry.

550
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,550
I will patiently wait for a week as promised.

551
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,750
Who made such promise? Who?

552
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,540
Let's talk about that later, and start getting to work.

553
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,020
 Canola Oil

554
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,280
Why did you prepare so much?

555
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,130
As expected, there is no middle ground for you.

556
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,820
Here.

557
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,180
Are you telling me to stir it?

558
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,060
Yup.

559
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,450
Yesterday I developed muscle pain in my legs because I had to pass those flyers around.

560
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,560
But today it seems like my arm will have muscle pain.

561
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,010
How can this part-time work in a chicken shop feel like a boot camp?

562
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,260
How much longer do we have to stir this?

563
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,660
Around 30 minutes?

564
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,340
What?!

565
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,240
The weather is quite hot for autumn. Still, isn't this fun?

566
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,880
Doesn't it seem like something is happening?

567
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,810
You find everything fun.

568
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,620
You have to stir this in one direction. Otherwise, it might not turn out so well.

569
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,980
I know.

570
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:46,190
I know. My arm is about to fall off since I have been stirring in one direction the whole time!

571
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,040
Yes, hello?

572
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,350
Hold on.

573
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,630
Excuse me, Bo Ah.

574
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,520
What is it?

575
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,520
I'm sorry, but apparently the liquor is being delivered.

576
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,690
I got it. Give it here.

577
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,240
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

578
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,880
Thank you.

579
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,330
Hold on. Why am I working so diligently?

580
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,560
I'm not the housekeeper helping the lord with his holiday homework.

581
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,620
Go flop. Flop.

582
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,960
Turn into a mess!

583
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,630
Now it's done.

584
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,800
Well done.

585
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,280
Goodbye.

586
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,650
Thank you.

587
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,270
Wow.

588
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,060
Bo Ah.

589
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,510
Why are you only coming back now?

590
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,250
Whoa! It turned out great.

591
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,710
I think this is good enough. Should we try it now?

592
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,260
Yes.

593
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,120
Come on.

594
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,180
Stop spilling it. Do you know how hard it was to make it?

595
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,000
I'm sorry.

596
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,760
What are you doing here, Chairman Lee?

597
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,580
I was just walking by out front.

598
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,640
Are the stores over there cleaning up properly?

599
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,130
When should they clean up?

600
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,950
I think if they did it tomorrow evening, it would be too late.

601
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:28,540
I heard you clearly!

602
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,010
Shouldn't it be done now?

603
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,800
Just wait a bit more. If you don't want to ruin it at the end.

604
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,410
Alright.

605
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,590
Shall we just take a look?

606
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,450
Should we?

607
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,980
One, two, three.

608
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,540
Now!

609
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,850
It's really pretty.

610
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,680
Awesome.

611
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,570
Now it's like chicken legs.

612
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,160
How do people use this for washing laundry?

613
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,900
Why would you wash something pretty like this?

614
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,380
I shall bring this to a place so that it's well seen.

615
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,990
What do you think? If you get one, wouldn't you like to come to our store?

616
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,350
Well, it's just a washing soap. Why will people be tempted to come to our store with this?

617
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,980
But... can I take a few?

618
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,720
Sure.

619
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,970
It looks really just like chicken legs.

620
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,810
Mine looks more like real chicken legs, right?

621
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,500
Nonsense. Mine looks way more like them.

622
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,270
Isn't this one better?

623
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,410
Mine is better in size.

624
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,650
Try. Try. Try.

625
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,360
Me too.

626
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,780
Kids.

627
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:24,800
Take one.

628
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,650
Looks tasty.

629
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:28,630
Whoa.

630
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,090
- Me too.
 - What is this?

631
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,030
I bet it'll be tasty.

632
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,190
You can't eat it.

633
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:38,090
This is not chicken, it's washing soap.

634
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,400
Top notch, right?

635
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,260
Where did you get it?

636
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,100
Where do you think? I made it.

637
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,910
It was supposed to be for the chicken place's PR, but I took some to share.

638
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,680
But Bo Ah, you look really excited?

639
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,850
No, as if!

640
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:03,100
I'm having a really hard time these days. Legs, shoulders, waist and arms.

641
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,470
There's nothing that doesn't ache. It's just exhausting manual labor.

642
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,120
Right? And here I thought...

643
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:19,220
I found out something useful for you,

644
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,770
but I was wondering if now it had become useless.

645
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,750
What is it?

646
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,410
Someone just came by.

647
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:33,530
He said, "All the stores in this area should clean their kitchen by tonight."

648
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,690
He said those precious words and left.

649
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,410
What? Who is it? He is so nosy.

650
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,520
- The food safety inspection is happening tomorrow? 
 - Yes.

651
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,730
Grandpa told me to tell every single restaurant.

652
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,530
So I skipped over the chicken place.

653
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,980
Nothing much to it then.

654
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,110
Got it. I will tell him.

655
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,250
How frustrating.

656
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,250
You should just keep your mouth shut about it.

657
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:00,990
Then, your boss will face the food safety inspection with no preparation.

658
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,870
There is no chance.

659
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:07,710
There are no customers, I swept and cleaned the place and it hasn't been long since the opening.

660
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,760
Point is, it's extremely clean.

661
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,150
It doesn't seem like it.

662
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:17,690
Do you think that simply cleaning it is fine?

663
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:21,500
Do you have a lid on your trash can?

664
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,710
Maybe?

665
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:29,070
Everything like that has to be there. The floor has to be...

666
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,500
They are very uptight.

667
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,100
If a beginner faces them with no preparation, something will be wrong.

668
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,420
One hundred percent!

669
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,990
Even then, it's too clean.

670
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:48,020
Then do something! Put something dirty on the floors!

671
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:55,160
Something that won't be obvious to the boss, but will definitely be inspected.

672
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:57,830
Like the kitchen ducts!

673
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,550
Right.

674
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:04,120
Anyway, a fine is to be expected.

675
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:09,160
And if it's bad, it might even come to a suspension of business.

676
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,950
Really?

677
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:32,590
♫  A star has fallen, my restless heart  ♫

678
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:36,760
♫   It keeps diggin in and twinkling  ♫

679
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:42,590
♫  I’m getting a strange feeling ♫ 
♫ Awakening my lurking dream  ♫

680
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:45,710
Boss, why is everything fun for you?

681
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,470
Does it seem that way?

682
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,150
Didn't you know? You are like that.

683
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,750
♫  I don't know love  ♫

684
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,780
Am I?

685
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:57,290
When I was working at the company, people just asked me every day why I was working like I had no life.

686
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,920
♫  This is the perfect time  ♫

687
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,070
But now, living is just fun.

688
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:08,600
♫  I want to follow the sound of my burning heartbeat  ♫

689
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:14,210
♫  and live again  ♫

690
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:21,200
♫  I'll be here for dreaming, put away the maps  ♫

691
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,520
♫  Every step I take will become a road  ♫

692
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,580
♫  I don't cry for my life ♫ 
♫ The day to show the world  ♫

693
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,990
 Even if he gets ruined, he will be fine.

694
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:37,430
 Since it's just his hobby life as a rich guy.

695
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:40,500
♫  Until then, watch over me  ♫

696
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:45,310
 Just do something. Make a mess.

697
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:48,990
♫  I'll be here for dreaming  ♫

698
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,570
What is this?

699
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,760
Who are you?!

700
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,040
I mean, Bo Ah?

701
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,910
What are you doing here?

702
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,230
Boss...

703
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,720
♫   Will you be my one and only universe?   ♫

704
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:45,170
♫   Will you be my one and only universe?    ♫

705
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,860
♫   So a pretty flower that resembles you   ♫

706
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:53,030
♫   Can bloom the cracks of my heart   ♫

707
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,390
♫   You probably don’t know   ♫

708
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:02,330
♫   but you’ve become the world to someone   ♫

709
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:05,810
♫   Even my smallest wish has become you   ♫

710
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,550
♫   Even my smallest wish has become you   ♫

711
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:14,050
The second floor roof room, remember that you promised to vacate it by today.  If you draw a menu, I'll let you live here one more month.

712
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,630
Oh no, why is he doing this?

713
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,420
How about buying a new one?

714
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:20,430
 Korea's top webtoon artist, Lee Shin Sang's edition!

715
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,850
Do you still hate me?

716
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:24,910
Even if others don't know, you and I do.

717
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,920
Let us go.

718
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,330
-  Do you know the chicken guessing contest? 
 -  We will start now!

719
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,650
Let's say you win 1st, and go on the news, and the store gets famous.

720
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:33,530
What do I do?

721
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,100
You should be more confident.

722
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,620
 The first one is...

723
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:47,000

724
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:56,290
♫   Has a hidden happiness   ♫

725
