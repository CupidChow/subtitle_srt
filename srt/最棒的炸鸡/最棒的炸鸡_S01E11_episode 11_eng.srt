6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,770
Are you the one?

7
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,350
What?

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,240
Did you beat up

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,000
those guys?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,740
So what do you want me to do?

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,750
Apologize when I say it nicely.

12
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,750
You've got to be kidding me. You don't even have a dad.

13
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,970
Let go. Let go. Let go now!

14
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,140
You better let go now!

15
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,400
Grandpa, are you mad?

16
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,880
It's not that I intended that way, but

17
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,680
he said I don't even have a dad...

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,490
Aren't you hungry?

19
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:17,710
 Bo Gwang Chinese Cuisine

20
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,880
Grandpa, is today a special day?

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,160
What do you mean?

22
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,250
Hurry and eat.

23
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,750
 People used to call us as an incomplete family.

24
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,510
 Incomplete by number in the family.

25
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,770
 But I still loved my family.

26
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,350
 So I was okay.

27
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,960
 But...

28
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,190
 now I'm alone in this world.

29
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,710
 Without a family...

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,630
 Episode 11

31
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,990
Hey, Bo Ah.

32
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,380
I took care of whatever I could.

33
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,940
I didn't know how to do

34
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,360
an obituary.

35
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,300
Thank you, Boss.

36
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,030
I'll take care of it.

37
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,680
 Name, phone number, email

38
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,720
 Please contact me.

39
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,620
Seo Bo Ah.

40
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,710
Yes, Boss.

41
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,890
Can you come for a moment?

42
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,490
I contacted your friends.

43
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,070
So you came?

44
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,430
Why did this happen so suddenly?

45
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,510
Bo Ah, are you okay?

46
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,810
Yeah.

47
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,210
Yeah, right.

48
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:36,990
If something like this happened, you should've called us first.

49
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,120
If you want to cry then just cry.

50
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,990
It's okay.

51
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,600
We're here.

52
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,270
 Funeral Hall

53
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,730
Please enjoy.

54
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,320
The part-timer must've been shocked.

55
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,060
Yes.

56
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,780
But Boss, why are you here like a family member?

57
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,200
It's becauseâ€”

58
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,430
Just eat.

59
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,540
It's the end when you depart this world,

60
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,620
so take care of your elderly while you still have them.

61
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,190
It's so sad for Bo Ah.

62
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,820
She's alone in this world.

63
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,190
Why? She still has Gong Cheol.

64
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,610
Do you think he's still alive?

65
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,380
He must be dead by now.

66
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,780
Do you think?

67
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,500
 How could he never keep in touch

68
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,620
 unless he's dead?

69
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,190
 Do you think he'd live like that?

70
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,280
 Seo Myeong Dong

71
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,680
 If he was a decent human being

72
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,140
 he'd have missed his own child.

73
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,830
Excuse me, but...

74
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,320
how are you related to my grandpa?

75
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,180
It's my first time seeing you.

76
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,610
You must be Bo Ah.

77
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,800
Do you know me?

78
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,730
Of course, I know.

79
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,160
Long time, no see, my daughter.

80
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,930
Why did you dress up all of a sudden?

81
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,240
Ah, it's because Bo Ah's grandpa passed away.

82
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,190
Do you want to go with me?

83
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,900
It's okay. It's weird for me to be there.

84
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,260
But what's going on?

85
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,450
You said you have something to say.

86
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,160
Nothing serious, but

87
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,880
- your mom's chicken place
 - Yeah.

88
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,660
will be on TV soon.

89
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,890
Not on our program but on another channel.

90
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,880
I thought you should know.

91
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,190
So it'll be on TV?

92
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,980
So I guess she's really serious about this.

93
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,230
But why aren't you telling her directly?

94
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,650
Just because... I don't want to see him again.

95
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,010
I don't want to see someone who's not interested.

96
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,660
Oh.

97
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,070
Also,

98
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,580
I have something else to say.

99
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,660
Let's not see each other anymore.

100
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,200
I don't think we should even

101
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,880
see each other as friends either.

102
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,850
If you're saying this because of that night, I made a mistake.

103
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,940
Something like that won't happen again.

104
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,980
It wasn't a mistake.

105
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,320
You know that, too.

106
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,150
I want to be honest with myself.

107
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,840
I lived like that so far.

108
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,030
But no matter what, you and I are not for each other.

109
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,990
Let's stop doing this.

110
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,060
It's been brief, but thank you.

111
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,550
I am also sorry.

112
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,360
I thought we could've been great friends.

113
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,150
I know.

114
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,640
Goodbye.

115
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,230
Do you drink?

116
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,240
A little.

117
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,230
When was the last time we saw each other?

118
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,560
I don't remember.

119
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,210
Yeah, you were really little so I understand.

120
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,460
Did you know that Mom passed away?

121
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,160
I heard.

122
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,170
Then why didn't you come?

123
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,990
It was too late.

124
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,410
It can't be an excuse.

125
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,130
Oh, Gong Cheol.

126
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,780
Do you remember me?

127
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,270
Ah, yes. Long time, no see, Ahjussi.

128
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,100
What happened to you all this time?

129
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,360
Myeong Dong wouldn't talk about you,

130
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,840
so all of us thought something happened to you.

131
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,250
I'm a bad son. I'm so ashamed to see you.

132
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,650
How can an educated person like you can abandon

133
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,220
your parent and a child?

134
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,670
I was so immature back then.

135
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,900
Please take this cup. Let me serve you a drink. It's been a while.

136
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,420
Go ahead!

137
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,120
Yes.

138
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,340
- Uh? Director Park. Are you coming home now? 
- Yeah.

139
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,450
Why did you drink so much?

140
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,430
Just because. But Mom,

141
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,430
did you just hum by yourself?

142
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:19,620
Did I? You're silly.

143
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,210
What are you doing?

144
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,730
What do you mean? I'm organizing my ledger.

145
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,440
Hey, Director Park. Let me give you some allowance.

146
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,860
- What?
 - Come here.

147
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,470
Spend this. Here.

148
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,250
Spend it.

149
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,700
- Mom 
 - What?

150
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,740
Will you be on TV?

151
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,250
How did you know that?

152
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,660
Why did you do that? Do you know anyone from a broadcasting station?

153
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,550
Are you paying to be broadcast?

154
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,040
What are you talking about?

155
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,050
Our place became famous by word of mouth.

156
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,970
They begged me to be on TV so I agreed.

157
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,670
What?

158
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,660
Look at this. Come here.

159
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,930
Look at this.

160
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,810
Oh my... this person just posted a review.

161
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,520
You seem so happy right now.

162
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,420
What are you saying? I'm doing this because I'm pushed to do it.

163
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh my. She wrote so many kind words.

164
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,350
Look at this.

165
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,900
It says it's delicious. Look.

166
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,390
 Hey, Daebak incident.

167
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,450
 My mom is getting into the business.

168
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,040
 My mom was always so tired after work, but...

169
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,960
I have to quit drinking.

170
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,420
I really have to quit.

171
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,220
This may sound like an excuse, but

172
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,960
back then I wasn't ready to be a dad,

173
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,650
so I just ran away out of fear.

174
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,350
It sounds like an excuse.

175
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,980
Does it?

176
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,010
I'm sorry.

177
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,870
I'm sure you definitely had moments when you needed a dad.

178
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,590
No, I haven't.

179
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,980
I had Mom and Grandpa with me.

180
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,570
I never felt that there was a void

181
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,420
in my family.

182
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,660
Okay.

183
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:21,130
I'm greatly indebted to your mom and grandpa.

184
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:54,040
You should rest. I'll keep my eyes on the incense.

185
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,160
You should rest. You must be tired.

186
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,700
I can't fall asleep.

187
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,830
Thank you.

188
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,930
Without you and my friends,

189
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,090
I'd have been struggling a lot.

190
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,420
What if I'm not ready?

191
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,160
My grandpa told me to live as a decent human being.

192
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,210
I'm not sure what that is.

193
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm like that, too.

194
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,790
I just pretend to be an adult.

195
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,370
But don't you think that everyone's the same?

196
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,120
You're like that, too?

197
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,800
Of course.

198
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,710
I still argue with my mom regarding my future.

199
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,660
The scale has gotten bigger. That's all.

200
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,090
I thought my dad was a

201
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,360
monster with a horn on his head.

202
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,590
If that's not the case,

203
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,890
how could he not come even once?

204
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,070
I didn't understand.

205
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,910
But seeing him

206
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,000
being normal with common sense,

207
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm confused about what kind of person he is.

208
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:07,680
I don't even know what to tell him.

209
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:13,830
I'm not sure if I should smile or be angry.

210
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,770
I want to say something to encourage you.

211
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,100
I'm not sure if anything I say can comfort you.

212
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,250
So I can't say anything.

213
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:39,900
But while you're thinking through those thoughts,

214
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,250
I'll stay next to you.

215
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,650
In the movies,

216
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,140
the character would say something deep at times like this.

217
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,080
Should I say something?

218
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,570
It's okay.

219
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,540
Let's just stay like this. I think this is comforting, too.

220
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,650
Go to sleep.

221
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,760
I can't fall asleep.

222
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,970
That brat.

223
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,950
I'm happy that you're happy.

224
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,720
â™«  Iâ€™ll donâ€™t cry for my life. The day I become the me

225
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,980
â™«  I wanted to be Iâ€™ll laugh out loud  â™«

226
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:18,620
â™«  Shining more as if to show off  â™«

227
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,880
â™«  I'll be here for dreaming  â™«

228
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,900
Twenty thousand.

229
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,800
Dang, this is no fun.

230
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,480
I'll say this

231
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,540
out of concern.

232
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,260
Don't be hurt but just listen, okay?

233
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,950
I'll listen, Ahjussi.

234
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,090
You didn't come here

235
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,320
- because of money, right?
 - Excuse me?

236
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,640
Ahjussi, I'm not that kind of a person.

237
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,770
Really? Good.

238
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,410
I'm glad to hear that.

239
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,540
There's nothing for you.

240
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,510
Excuse me?

241
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:42,000
Myeong Dong wrote on his will

242
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,680
that he'll give everything to Bo Ah.

243
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,790
There's a will?

244
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,780
So,

245
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:56,820
don't be greedy because it's useless.

246
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,960
Okay?

247
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,530
Dang. He's being a problem even till the last minute.

248
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,810
 Seo Myeong Dong

249
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,890
 The business is closed for several days for personal reasons. We apologize.

250
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,220
Bo Ah, why don't you wash up and sleep?

251
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,400
You went through a lot these last several days.

252
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,840
You wash up first.

253
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,580
I'll wash up after you. I'm tired.

254
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,320
Okay, then.

255
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,310
Bo Ah! Wash up and go inside to sleep.

256
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,430
â™«  Lucky in my life  â™«

257
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:19,730
â™«  You're approaching me like a dream  â™«

258
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:25,740
â™«  When I get sad, I'm lucky in my dream  â™«

259
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:32,740
â™«  You embrace me tight with warmth  â™«

260
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:40,670
â™«  I smile like this always  â™«

261
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:47,070
â™«  Even if the world gives me a hard time  â™«

262
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:52,410
â™«  I don't want to cry  â™«

263
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:57,750
â™«  in front of you who may not know me  â™«

264
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:05,150
â™«  I'm glad that from far away  â™«

265
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:10,430
â™«  I can cherish your smile  â™«

266
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:19,580
â™«  Please take a step forward  â™«

267
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,850
Until when are you sleeping?

268
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,790
Did you forget about the promise already?

269
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,430
You said that you'll live as a decent person.

270
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,410
Grandpa.

271
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,620
Bo Ah!

272
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,520
Yes.

273
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,870
When did you get up?

274
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,640
Is that...

275
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,800
Ah, this

276
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,230
is really expensive, right?

277
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,020
This works really well.

278
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,440
Thank you, Boss.

279
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,340
What are you drawing? Is it going well?

280
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,140
Just anything. It's been a while, so my hand is stiff.

281
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,100
I was lightly warming up my hand.

282
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,690
Continue with your

283
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,590
work. I'll call you when the rice is ready.

284
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:34,440
â™«  The warm season that I thought would never come into my heart again  â™«

285
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,220
â™«  Has come into my arms with you who flew like a butterfly  â™«

286
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:46,280
â™«  I have so many questions for you, itâ€™s making me dizzy  â™«

287
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,170
â™«  From A to Z, I just want to know you  â™«

288
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,000
Bo Ah! The meal is not ready yet.

289
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,050
â™«  When your smile thatâ€™s whiter than a star spills into my heart  â™«

290
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:02,150
â™«  It feels like Iâ€™m endlessly walking  â™«

291
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,080
â™«  into your clear melody  â™«

292
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,980
â™«  Hold my hand, as if it was always us from the beginning  â™«

293
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:15,610
â™«  Because you and I, weâ€™re clearly destiny  â™«

294
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,380
Thank you, Boss.

295
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,700
â™«  Iâ€™m falling in love  â™«

296
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:27,810
â™«  Iâ€™m only getting filled with reasons I like you that are becoming countless  â™«

297
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,560
â™«  Love love love is shining light  â™«

298
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,660
â™«  When Iâ€™m with you, wherever we are, itâ€™ll be filled with light  â™«

299
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,000
Uh, uh...

300
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,680
- It's burning.
 - Oh.

301
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,890
Ah...

302
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:57,380
â™«  What words are needed when youâ€™re so dazzling by my side?  â™«

303
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:02,210
â™«  I have you, who makes me happy, just by looking at you  â™«

304
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:09,210
â™«  Whatever happens, Iâ€™ll promise you this  â™«

305
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,250
â™«  Iâ€™ll never become the source of your tears  â™«

306
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,960
So, Boss.

307
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,570
Yes.

308
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:21,830
Would it be possible to adjust my work schedule?

309
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,690
- Your work schedule?
 - Yes.

310
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,220
I want to go back to drawing webtoons.

311
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:34,570
Since lunch time is slow, I'd like to work in the afternoon.

312
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,500
Would it be okay?

313
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,190
Of course, it's okay. Anything else?

314
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,840
Just tell me if there's anything I can do to help.

315
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,990
Alright.

316
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,500
Right. When is your mom's chicken place being broadcast?

317
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,390
Don't we need to prepare something, too?

318
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:58,120
I talked to the chef. We're thinking of creating a new dish.

319
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,600
Something that can differentiate us.

320
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,540
Bo Ah. You can't take our recipe this time.

321
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,370
Boss!

322
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,740
I'll do it.

323
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,350
You will? By yourself?

324
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,230
Try it.

325
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,270
This is the new dish we came up with.

326
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,340
Then I'll try it first.

327
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,960
Wow. Daebak.

328
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,080
This is great!

329
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,830
This is good.

330
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,930
Why? Isn't this what you were looking for?

331
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,640
No, this tastes good.

332
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,440
The seafood flavored soy sauce goes well with chicken and the spiciness adds a kick to it.

333
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,940
But you don't seem satisfied.

334
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:26,030
It tastes good, but it doesn't compete with mom's chicken recipe, which will be featured on TV.

335
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:32,500
The taste is important, but I wish we had something to arouse people's curiosity.

336
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,940
People's curiosity...

337
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,960
Yes.

338
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,340
Sprinkling some special toppings can be an idea, too.

339
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,120
Welcome!

340
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,750
The bathhouse changed like this? Wow!

341
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,860
This is refreshing.

342
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,830
Hello.

343
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,950
Oh, so you have a business here. We've met before.

344
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,160
I'm Seo Gong Cheol.

345
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,790
I'm Park Choi Go.

346
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,370
Do you want me to call Bo Ah for you?

347
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,340
No, I'm not here to see Bo Ah today.

348
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,810
Then...

349
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,520
Since I'm here, let me try your chicken.

350
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,680
Please give me an order.

351
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,550
Please enjoy.

352
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,250
Mr.

353
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,110
Please have a seat.

354
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,540
Excuse me?

355
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,390
Have a seat so we can talk.

356
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,390
This is good! I didn't expect much because you're young, but this is good.

357
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:06,980
So how is the business? Is it going well?

358
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,350
Yes.

359
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,350
That's good.

360
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:17,250
Before I came here, I went to see several realtors around here.

361
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:23,260
But I found out that my dad rented out this place way too cheaply.

362
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,170
Excuse me?

363
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,690
There's a going rate, right?

364
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,820
I'm sure you looked into it when you started your business.

365
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,770
What are you saying?

366
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,410
I'll say it directly.

367
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,010
I'd like to rewrite the contract.

368
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,740
I'm sorry, but we still have a long time until our lease is up.

369
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,860
I know. I know about the five year leasing period,

370
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,170
but law aside, we're working with people.

371
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,950
There are basic business ethics.

372
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:58,200
You should know better that it's way below the market price.

373
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,320
That's true, but the previous ownerâ€”

374
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,670
The building owner has to make a living, too! This is too low!

375
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:13,740
If the rent doesn't become more realistic, there is only one option.

376
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,140
Leave my building.

377
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,810
Excuse me?

378
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,390
Webtoon? Bo Ah?

379
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,860
- Really?
 - Wow.

380
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,580
Daebak. I thought Bo Ah would struggle for fifteen days at least.

381
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,950
Plus, she'll go back to drawing webtoons?

382
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,270
That's why.

383
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:48,030
I was really worried when I saw Bo Ah's dad.

384
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,090
That's really good.

385
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:52,160
I just talked to her. She seems to be holding up well.

386
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,330
I don't think we need to worry about her.

387
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:58,230
But then what happens to Bo Ah's dad?

388
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,390
Did he take off again?

389
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,570
I think he's at Bo Ah's grandpa's house.

390
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,880
Oh, really? Then will he live there from now on?

391
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,330
Not sure. But that shouldn't be the case, right?

392
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,060
My grandpa told me

393
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,930
that he's not the type to stay in one place ever since he was young.

394
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,690
I heard something like he was in prison.

395
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:33,330
So I expected him to be someone scary.

396
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,220
Right?

397
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:40,620
I've also heard that he cons people and moves around.

398
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:45,860
But he seems like a gentleman. He has manners, too.

399
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:49,640
People talk about others so easily.

400
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,290
Since Bo Ah can't come let's just order and eat.

401
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,620
What should we eat?

402
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,910
Oh, I packed my lunch.

403
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,970
You just order yours.

404
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,870
Packed lunch?

405
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:05,300
Why a packed lunch?

406
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,030
Did you pack it yourself?

407
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,890
Why did you only pack yours?

408
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,030
I didn't pack it.

409
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,690
Chef drops it off on his way to work.

410
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,820
William?

411
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,630
His name is Andrew. Andrew Kang!

412
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,940
What are you talking about? His name is William.

413
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,240
No, it's not!

414
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,090
So it doesn't matter if it's William or Andrew.

415
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,120
Why is he packing you lunch?

416
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,350
Hello.

417
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,690
What is this?

418
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:51,320
It's your lunch. I packed mine and had some left over.

419
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,320
You can eat it or throw it away.

420
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,760
Thank you.

421
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,790
The pasta you made me before was really good.

422
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,860
The herbal medicine doctor kept asking me to cook,

423
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,780
so I had to make it and bring it.

424
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,160
I failed in adjusting the portion.

425
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,490
I see. That's what happened.

426
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,870
I'm so lucky.

427
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,200
That's strange.

428
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,010
What is strange?

429
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,890
Yeah. It's just this time.

430
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:32,850
That's understandable.

431
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:36,580
No, it's not just once.

432
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,460
Has it been about a week?

433
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,230
- Every day for a week?
 - Yeah.

434
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:46,560
The food tastes awesome, but he has hard time adjusting the portions.

435
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,720
I'm benefitting.

436
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,580
That's really strange.

437
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,050
Why are you like that? Hey.

438
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,570
I helped him to find a house and decorate.

439
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,190
He's appreciative; that's why.

440
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,990
Think hard.

441
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,860
Isn't William interested in you?

442
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,910
What?

443
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:09,200
You act so smart all the time,

444
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,740
but you're so ignorant about dating.

445
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,860
Right. You're such a pushover in dating.

446
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,390
A pushover?

447
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,190
It's not that!

448
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,790
A pushover, pushover, pushover...

449
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,760
I'm not a pushover.

450
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,740
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

451
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:52,600
What's going on with this negative vibe in the restaurant?

452
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:57,230
Bo Ah.

453
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,580
Did something happen to you today?

454
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,800
What? What kind of nonsense is that?

455
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,170
My dad came and said stuff?

456
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:24,400
Will we really be evicted?

457
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,730
No, you won't.

458
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,530
My grandpa gave me this building, so

459
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,910
my dad has no right.

460
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:47,150
So you don't need to worry at all no matter what my dad says.

461
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,890
But Bo Ahâ€”

462
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,160
You already knew about it.

463
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,750
Why did you take that garbage?

464
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:58,950
I said that to your dad, too.

465
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,600
He said no matter what's written on the will,

466
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,970
he still has the right to receive an inheritance.

467
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,600
What?

468
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,430
I looked into it, too. But what your dad said is right.

469
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:23,090
Then the will written by Grandpa is not effective?

470
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,790
No, that's not true.

471
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:29,860
Because of that, Bo Ah has the right to receive half of the inheritance.

472
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,720
What does that mean?

473
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:37,360
By law, your dad has the right to receive the full inheritance.

474
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,820
But because your grandpa passed it on to you

475
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,130
you gained the rights to receive.

476
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,300
Why is it so complicated?

477
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,330
Simply put, no matter what's on the will

478
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:55,950
your dad has the right to take half of it,

479
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,620
according to the law.

480
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,090
Then, that means...

481
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,630
This building belongs to

482
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:07,200
you and your dad.

483
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,650
Half each.

484
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,370
Then what happens?

485
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:16,360
Can my dad evict my boss?

486
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,130
Don't worry about that. It won't happen.

487
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:23,260
I told you that you have an equal rights, too.

488
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:30,490
You and your father can't do anything by yourselves.

489
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:34,210
No matter what, your consent is needed.

490
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,540
Do you understand?

491
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,630
If you get your head on straight,

492
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:47,410
the chicken shop and this building Grandfather left you

493
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,130
can be protected.

494
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:13,880
I keep showing you things that you shouldn't see.

495
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,210
Bo Ah.

496
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:25,210
Even though it was temporary, I was happy Dad came.

497
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:33,550
I thought that maybe I wouldn't be alone anymore.

498
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:43,040
But Dad just came to the funeral to look for money.

499
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:52,090
Of course, he did.

500
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:58,430
He would've come sooner if it wasn't like that,

501
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,330
when our family needed Dad.

502
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,250
What am I doing here like an idiot?

503
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,550
 Wine bar owner.

504
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,490
- Boss! What's up? Why are you calling? 
  - Yes, PD Moon,

505
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,820
 stop by the store if you're not busy today.

506
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,530
Huh?

507
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,960
 Your boyfriend's been waiting here for awhile.

508
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,290
Boyfriend?

509
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,060
That's right.

510
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:08,480
You must've had a fight, but he looks so sad all alone.

511
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,540
If it's not a big deal, just forgive him.

512
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,520
- He's not my boyfriend. 
  - What?

513
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,700
He's not?

514
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,240
 That's right.

515
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:23,470
But Boss, is he just drinking on an empty stomach again?

516
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,470
I didn't order this.

517
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:39,780
You've been drinking on an empty stomach for a while now.

518
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,060
It's on the house.

519
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,160
 Yes, hello?

520
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,710
It's me.

521
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,880
 Huh? Who...

522
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,260
 Oh! It's Bo Ah!

523
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,620
 I was planning on meeting with you.

524
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,250
 When is a good time?

525
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:48,990
I actually have something to say.

526
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:52,330
I'll just say it and hang up.

527
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:57,260
I heard you stopped by the store today and demanded more rent or to get out.

528
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,590
I will handle these kinds of things.

529
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,220
You're still young.

530
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,360
Rent needs to be raised so the building sells for the right price.

531
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,650
- That's good for you too. 
 - No.

532
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,720
I do not agree to raise the chicken store's rent

533
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,190
and I have no intention of forcing them out.

534
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,690
Bo Ah.

535
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,270
I don't know what you're thinking, but

536
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:21,600
I'm not going to let you walk all over me.

537
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,950
Grandpa didn't raise me like that.

538
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:29,240
I'm not sure what that store owner said to you, but we're family.

539
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,520
You need to trust me and not him!

540
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:40,290
People that were there for me when I needed them are family.

541
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,440
Not people that never cared for their family like you.

542
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,200
 Bo Ah.

543
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:51,530
I'm going to protect the chicken shop and this building Grandpa left me,

544
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,580
so don't think of doing any funny business.

545
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,480
I'm hanging up now.

546
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,780
 Bo Ah! Bo Ah!

547
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,400
 Open the door!

548
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,530
 Open the door! Bo Ah!

549
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,220
Min Ah, what's going on?

550
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,980
Bo Ah...

551
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,610
Something bad has happened.

552
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,800
Huh? What is it?

553
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,650
There's no need to say much, Folks.

554
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:58,370
What happened to the neighboring area that was recently unveiled?

555
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:02,460
It's gotten huge improvements! But what about our area?

556
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:06,530
For how long do we have to live in shambles?

557
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,120
Through all of Seoul's midpoint,

558
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,140
where can you find an area as worn down as ours?

559
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,860
Don't you agree?

560
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,760
Right? Ah.

561
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,410
This is a residential apartment complex.

562
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:26,010
Our area can become a residential apartment complex like this one. This is a shopping mall.

563
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:29,970
We can have this large shopping mall right at the front.

564
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:32,220
What will that do?

565
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,920
At the very least, double.

566
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,780
At least doubling the property value

567
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:42,590
of the ground you're sitting on.

568
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:46,270
Why are you not doing this?

569
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:49,220
There is no reason to not do this.

570
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,310
Isn't that right?

571
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:54,310
Right, Elder?

572
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,760
What are you saying?

573
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,440
You said Dad can't do anything to the house since I own half.

574
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,920
You said he can't do anything without my consent.

575
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,080
This is different from that.

576
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,320
If the whole neighborhood wants it, it won't matter if you don't.

577
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,670
What will happen then?

578
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:19,150
They could demolish the entire area and build an apartment building.

579
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:23,190
Then what happens to our house? And the chicken shop?

580
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,580
Everything will be gone.

581
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,220
Without a trace.

582
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:56,980

583
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:03,000
â™«  Will you be my one  â™«

584
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,450
â™«  and only universe?  â™«

585
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:13,780
â™«  So a pretty flower that resembles you  â™«

586
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:17,130
 The Best Chicken

587
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:20,380
 I will ruin that association or something.

588
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,340
 Wait and see.

589
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:25,750
 I will form an association if you write your name and sign on the paper.

590
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,800
 I'm protecting what's precious to me.

591
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:32,040
 You see, a real adult breaks out of their comfort zone.

592
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,270
 What if I don't do anything well?

593
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,970
 You're doing well right now.

594
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,390
 That's it! A good place to eat will open in quiet neighborhoods.

595
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:41,290
 And the commercial value jumps up!

596
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,720
 Let's do that, on this street.

597
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:49,940
â™«  All day, you shine like the sun â™« 
 â™«
And stars that resemble you rise   â™«
