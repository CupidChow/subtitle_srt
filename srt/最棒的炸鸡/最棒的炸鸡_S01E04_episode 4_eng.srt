 Prince Ho Dong was a thug.

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,880
 Nak Rang and Ho Dong were in love, even though their countries were against each other, according to the Korean tale.

8
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,200
 Ho Dong wrote to Nak Rang that if she destroyed the national treasure of her country, he would accept her as his wife.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,500
 Blinded by love, she executed Ho Dong's order to tear the Jamyeonggo, a drum,  which sounds an alarm when the enemy invades.

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,130
 Princess Nak Rang is a fool.

00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,080
 Are men that important?

12
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,490
 Ho Dong's invasion was a piece of cake without Jamyeonggo, and Nak Rang's father surrendered after killing his daughter.

13
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,500
Because she was crazy over a man she offered up her country to Prince Ho Dong's country,

00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,590

  Pit-a-pat, the drum, Jamyeonggo (a mythical drum that sounds an alarm when the enemy invades your territory), made a sound.

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,400
and I posed like this, and last year the one I took on the rooftop

52
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,160
where I was like this and my legs looked long. Did you show them those?

53
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,360
Bo Ah, my friends said they don't need to see your picture.

54
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,330
Why not?

55
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,850
My friends and his friends are in our neighborhood and who wouldn't know you?

56
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,310
I don't mind if they are from our neighborhood. I don't have any prejudices.

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,430
Mind letting me know his name?

63
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,410
Bo Ah, calm down a bit.

64
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,860
Is he kidding? How am I scary?

65
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,310
In every way. I found you scary as well at first.

67
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,200
You don't remember? How we first met?

68
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,630
Bo Ah, would you mind yielding the role of Snow White to Min Ah?

69
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,930
Why? I don't want to.

70
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,470
My classmates voted for me.

71
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:44,700
Don't be so stubborn. You need to learn how to yield to others to be a good kid.

H-Hunter, why are you doing this?

80
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,380
Because you are not the real Snow White!

81
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,390

Argh! I remember it.

86
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,520
A blind date in this neighborhood is impossible. Everyone knows you.

87
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,930
Then do you know someone from another neighborhood?

88
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,980
Actually, there might be one who would be alright.

89
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,950
- And he doesn't know Bo Ah? 
- Of course not.

90
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,170
- That's great then. 
 - But he doesn't want to.

91
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,860
What did he say?

92
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,120
He said it would be nice if the girl had a stable job, too.

93
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,850
Like an elementary school teacher or a civil serv—

94
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,780
Hey! I'm just a part-timer for a chicken shop right now.

95
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,320
Didn't you tell him that I'm a future cafe owner?

96
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,490
I'm going to set up a cafe as soon as the chicken place goes out of business. There's not a lot of time left until then, you know!

97
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,780
He said to call him after you do that.

98
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,070
But why the change of heart? You used to hate those blind dates.

99
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,560

How is it? Does it suit your taste?

122
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,550
No, it doesn't.

What is the issue this time?

126
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,380
Are you always standing and staring at your customers?

127
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,220
Are you trying to rub it in my face that it's on the house?

Please tell me, what is the problem this time?

130
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,430
No problem.

131
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,580
What? Then why didn't it suit your taste?

132
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,740
Because there is nothing special about it.  It's just plain chicken. How do you want me to evaluate it?

133
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,610
It's chicken you could get anywhere in Korea.

134
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,640
Chicken is just chicken. It's just fried chicken with oil.

135
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,180
- It's not that different. 
- What did you just say?

136
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,880
Why? Do you think you are the only one with a temper?

137
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,620
We have some other customers, you know?

138
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,110
One day we had up to seven tables.

139

140
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,490
Right, six tables.

141
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,230
Is that something to brag about?

142
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,630
Did any of them come back again?

143
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,000
No, right? Of course, they won't. They don't have a reason to return.

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,750
Is it that awful?

145
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,290
- Follow me.
 - Pardon?

146
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,980
I'll pay for the food I just ate. Come with me quickly.

Yes.

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,940
Not frozen chicken, fresh chicken.

151
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,230
We don't have any.

152

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,630
Go buy one. Why don't you get anything?

154
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,470
Where are the flour, corn flour, and sweet rice flour?

155
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,860
We use batter mix.

156
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,550
That's nothing to brag about. You heard, right? Buy those too.

157
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,050
Boss.

158
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,230
I will get them right away.

00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,310
Get moving, you two.

161
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,040
Welcom...

162
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,720
Give me some chicken, one that is in the worst possible condition.

163
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,350
We don't have anything like that in our store.

164
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,170
Try and look for it.

165
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,900
I'll try looking for it.

166
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,280
Come in and wash your hands.

167
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,190
Me too? But I'm just a server.

168
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,640
Stop. Let's add a little more glutinous rice flour.

169
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,640
Now just flour.

170
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,640
Stop, stop, stop.

171
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,390
What are you doing? I told you to cut it into ten parts.

172
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,130
That...

173
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,860
A chicken restaurant owner, can't cut a chicken into its parts?

174
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,010
I always bought the ones that were already cut up.

175
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,550
Chicken is seasoned by someone else, cut up by someone else. The batter mix is by someone else. Everything is by someone else.

176
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,380
How is this a chicken restaurant?

177
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,140
Grab the knife.

178
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,620
You just made a mess out of it.

179
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,020

180
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,180
Then fry it up.

181
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,730
Then make sure to give some to your part-timer so she knows how different it can be.

182
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,140
What's his deal?

183
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,960
Mom.

184
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,870
Mom?

185
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,680
Hello? Where did you go, mom?

186
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,470
No, today's the day you wanted to leave.

187
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,470
I came all the way here to see you off

188
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,560
What?!

189
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,520
I went to your brother's company. Why are you so surprised?

190
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,990
Mom, why would you go there!

191
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,640
Why can't I go for a visit?

192
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,590
Before I leave, I have to meet his team leader and have a word with him.

193
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,000
If you go all the way to his company, he will get in trouble there.

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,470
I'm doing this out of consideration for him.

195
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,570
Maybe he did something wrong to the team leader.

196
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,050
What business trip is this long? And to a place where we can't even get in touch with him.

197
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,870
Mom, I get your point, but for now calm down and—

198
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,480
Bye. I'm busy.

199
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,450
Mom? Mom!

200
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,590
About this much?

201
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,830
I don't know. He just seemed to be winging it.

202
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,870

203
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,460
Can't you drive a bit faster?

204
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,510
If you are in such a hurry, you should have gone yesterday.

205
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,600
Excuse me?

206
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,680
I can't go any faster. Do you think this is a plane?

207
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,530
A red light.

208
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,520
Here it is.

209
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,080
Alright.

210
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,930
Please hurry.

211
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:06,920
If you are in such a hurry, you should have paid for it yesterday.

212
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,110
I'll get confused if you keep rushing me .

213
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,140
- It's out now. 
- Yes, yes, yes.

214
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,500
There is a way for everything.

215
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,190
Th-th-thank you!

216
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,550
Mom! Mom! Mom!

217
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,230
Team Leader!

218
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,910
Team Leader!

219
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,660
Team Leader!

220
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,130
Son?

221
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,540
Park Choi Go's mother

222
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,900
Ah, yes, Team Leader.

223
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,860
For now, please take a seat.

224
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,850
No, my son is—

225
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,530
You must have been very surprised.

226
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,900
To be honest, I was very surprised as well.

227
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,890
- About what? 
 - Him suddenly quitting.

228
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,960
When he handed in his resignation letter last—

229
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,620
What did he quit?

230
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,160
Uhm...

231
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,860
Mom, I will explain everything. The thing is...

232
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,210
You! This little–

233
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,620
Mom. Mom.

234
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,430
Will you not come here? What exactly where you thinking?

235
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,260
I had my own ideas.

236
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,940
Move!

237
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,630
Hey!

238
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,000
Stop right there!

239
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,380
Let's talk it out, Mom.

240
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,360
You stay right there.

241
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,950
I'll definitely catch you, you punk

242
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,890
Won't you stop right there?

243
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,930
If you stop, I will as well. Let's talk it out.

244
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,580
Right, we'll talk. So come here! When I'm still speaking nicely!

245
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,400
Hey, stop there.

246
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,520
You better stop. Mom, you'll get hurt.

247
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,170
Stop moving.

248
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,230
That punk. Son!

249
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,670
Come here!

250
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,920
Let's solve this through talking.

251
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,980
Come over here.

252
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,590
Mom let's talk this out.

253
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,160
Mom!

254
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,290
Are you out of your mind?

255
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,480
Why would you quit such a great company? Are you in your right mind?

256
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,690
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

257
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,650
Mom, I started my own business.

258
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,890
Started up a business?

259
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,100
You quit a company that gives you monthly salary just so you could open your own business?

260
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,400
Fine, what kind of business is it?

261
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,140
Well, I don't think I should tell you now.

262
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,580
Son, just go back to work here.

263
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,350
Whether it's the CEO or president let's go together to find them and...

264
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,610
Just give me three months!

265
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,330
What?

266
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,440
In three months time I'll do everything to turn it into a store you can approve of.

267
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
And at that time I'll explain everything.

268
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
A store? You said you were starting a business—

269
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,180
Mom, sorry!

270
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,310
Son!

271
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,710
Really! Just stop!

272
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,610
Save yourself, at least.

273
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,860
Just tell her that you didn't know anything.

274
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,710
Pretend what? Ah.

275
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,500
How you just got back from a business trip?

276
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,780
You'll live your life well, even in the future.

277
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,950
Anyway, be careful.

278
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,160
Now that Mom knows, there's no way this is over.

279
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,640
I know that as well.

280
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,390
You don't.

281
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,590
There's nothing she wouldn't do for her own sons.

282
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,630
When I was younger, my handwriting was really bad.

283
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,830
 Let's carry on from where we left off last time.

284
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,050
 Cold dessert, then a half.

285
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,610
 Short,

286
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,330
 one summer.

287
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,560
 Do you understand up to here?

288
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,150

289
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,560
The academy said no,

290
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,480
so she said what if she paid for two people's tuition. How could you say no to her?

291
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,750
 Joon Hyeok.

292
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,660
 Son, what are you doing? Focus on studying.

293
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,080
 The winter is long.

294
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,620
 That's what it means.

295
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620
 Okay. Did you understand it?

296
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,780
Did you hear what the tutors said?

297
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,510
They don't usually accept private students,

298
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,870
but they were so sick of me that they just agreed.

299
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,350
See.

300
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,300
 Nobody

301
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,530
 wants to sit next to me.

302
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,550
 The word Celsius is a bit hard, yes?

303
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,310
 Just write it like this, Celsius.

304
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,610
 Next up.

305
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,350
If that was all, it would have been a relief.

306
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,240
One time I accidentally told her that my sunbaes made me drink and it was hard for me

307
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,870
 I am ground. You introduce yourself.

308
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,360
 Dumplings.

309
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,820
 Chrysanthemum tea.

310
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,210
 Ddosooni.

311
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,590
 Squirrel.

312
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,990
 Pigeon.

313
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,290
 Sleepy.

314
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,750
 Rabbit.

315
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,090
 Baby bear.

316
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,440
 Window face.

317
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,800
 Utility pole.

318
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,180
 Cider.

319
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,510
 Superman.

320
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,990
 Joon Hyeok's mom.

321
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,990
 Mom's son.

322
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,190
 I am ground, now let's begin.

323
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,490
 Cider, two.

324
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,740
 Cider, cider.

325
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,170
 Sleepy, one.

326
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,310
 Sleepy.

327
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,770
 One.

328
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,660
At the time I was 21 years old, but I had to beg her while crying

329
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,690
not to follow me to the school outing.

330
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,790
Thanks to you, when she came to mine, she only made food for us. She had her accommodation in a separate place too.

331
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,320
Mom finally stopped her obsession after you went to work in Myeongseong group.

332
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,590
She said she had done as much as she should.

333
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,810
I'm sure to mom you quitting your job was a big deal.

334
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,650
But did you check behind you?

335
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,160
What?

336
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,860
You don't know her fully yet.

337
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,640
Didn't you take a taxi to get away while you were right in front of her? Did you think she would leave it at that?

338
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,520
Hold on.

339
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,140
Mister, could you make a U-turn?

340
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,800
And don't make it obvious.

341
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,090
Just suddenly do it.

342
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,930
Hyung! Mom! She followed me!

343
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,400
Ajhussi, Are you really good at driving?

344
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,550
If you can lose that car following us, I'll pay double

345
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,580
No, I'll pay quadruple!

346
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,250
Boss...

347
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,020
Did you perhaps run into loan sharks?

348
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,930
What?

349
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:33,200
I mean your appearance. You look like you crawled out from being buried alive, and you barely made it.

350
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,450
I took a taxi then got off and then came through the mountain.

351
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,080
What?

352
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,400
Bo Ah, I will just take a shower.

353
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,160
This is what that man made, right?

354
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,600
Let's see how impressive his chicken is.

355
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,450
It's so good, it offends me...

356
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,380
because of his bum-like temper. Despite his great skills, he's a bum.

357
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,620
In the seasoning and the batter mix I got, there was nothing special.

358
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,020
I investigated fully before ordering the seasoning and batter mix.

359
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,290
Don't mind it, I think your chicken tastes good too.

360
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,790
I think I have to scout him.

361
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,690
Wh-what?

362
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,600
I hadn't perfected the taste of our chicken and it was wrong of me to focus on the advertisement.

363
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,190
I'll hire him and we'll have a completely new taste for our chicken.

364
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,630
B-Boss, do you have a ton of money?

365
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,490
You pay rent to my grandfather, my wage, and need to buy the ingredients.

366
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,430
But if you hire that bum, then how will you afford to pay all the fixed expenses?

367
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,460
Well, and you also saw that his hands were shaking.

368
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,160
Is that the type of person you want to hire in your kitchen?

369
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,290
Or do you want him to do the serving with that temper?

370
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,260
I'm sorry to say this when you are only trying to help.

371
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,760
Either way, we won't last more than a few months at this rate.

372
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,190
Really?

373
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:11,230
Yes. That's why I need a game changer.

374
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:20,230
A chicken that makes customers want to return at all costs.

375
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,850
What are you doing?

376
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,220
I need to find this person.

377
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,160
Who is he?

378
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,980
My boss's game changer.

379
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,400
The chicken restaurant owner said if he can't find this person, the shop will close down in a few months.

380
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,320
Then why would you look for him?

381
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,030
She's going to find him before her boss and sneak him away.

382
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,310
To where?

383
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,820
Force him to go to another country?

384
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,240
I have to find him a good job so he won't work at our restaurant.

385
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,220
You? How?

386
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,640
Pass these out.

387
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,520
Friend, with this method it'll take forever to find him

388
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,600
He's a wondering bum without a house.

389
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,760
Then what do I do?

390
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,360
If this man is hired, the restaurant will hit the jackpot.

391
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,520
Was it that tasty?

392
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,940
I want to try it.

393
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:39,240
Hey.  Give me your money.  Quickly.

394
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,030
Find this person.

395
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,040
Is that enough?

396
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,950
Who is that?

397
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,910
Kwan Hyeok, this neighborhood's delivery king.

398
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,790
He does a little of this and that as a side job. Once he receives the payment, he always gives results.

399
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,640
Yeong Ho, take this and buy some coffee.

400
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,220
- Yes, ma'am. 
- I want a latte.

401
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,950
- I want a strawberry smoothie. 
- You come with me.

402
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,610
He won't eat.

403
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,480
What? The new guy.

404
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,070
I even offered to take him to the free food bank. But he'd rather starve.

405
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,840
Just leave him be. But what does that have to do with me?

406
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,880
Don't pay too much attention to him, you also know

407
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,970
that at first everyone is like that, but when they reach the edge of death, they just follow the rest of us.

408
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,990
- Just like you. 
 - I said I'm not concerned.

409
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,580
Here, eat this.

410
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,490
Seriously.

411
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,740
At this rate, you'll starve to death.

412
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,040
You haven't eaten anything in the past four days.

413
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,280
 It's not your business.

414
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,100
I'm different from people like you.

415
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,170
I have no thoughts on living my life if I have to live like a bum.

416
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,690
What?

417
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,570
What kind of crazy guy is that?

418
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:25,000
Sleep with this. It's cold at night.

419
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,900
Mister, follow me.

420
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,910
 Signal Lamp

421
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,300
Hello. Hello.

422
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:55,560
Signal Lamp  was created to help homeless people support themselves.

423
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,860
Ehm, what are we doing here?

424
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,330
Please continue.

425
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,430
When they sell the magazines, they get to keep a percentage of the profit

426
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:10,260
It's a program that helps them earn money rather than beg for it.

427
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,010
Signal Lamp is a project that helps homeless people fend for themselves...

428
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,150
I'm not doing stuff like that.

429
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,050
Why not? It's a good thing.

430
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,070
I'm not someone who would do this stuff.

431
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm a person who used to cook. How can I sell things on the street

432
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,350
I can't, so I won't do it.

433
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,830
Cooking? I see you are not in your right mind

434
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,460
For how long will you continue living like a bum?

435
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,380
Speaking frankly, is there anyone who didn't have a dream?

436
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,970
If it has passed, just leave it in the past.

437
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,450
Everyone is living that way.

438
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,420
I'll just stay this way.  So if I live or die, don't concern yourself.

439
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,670
Don't you want to live a normal life again?

440
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,330
If you do this well,  they will even provide you with housing and the pay is really good.

441
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,850
You can get back up again.

442
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,050
Just close your eyes and try it for a day. Just one day.

443
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,690
Signal Lamp magazine. Signal Lamp.

444
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,390
Present the magazine to people and smile and shout or do something.

445
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,560
- You are also not shouting.
 - Oh please. This is for you.

446
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:53,090
What is this? Sig-signal Lamp!

447
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:57,140
Magazine. Buy a magazine.

448
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,860
It's Signal Lamp. Buy a magazine.

449
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,130
Here. Signal Lamp.

450
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,080
There's no way i'll sell five of these. No one wants to buy them.

451
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,290
Wh-Why won't they buy them?

452
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,060
Why are you like this after only two hours?

453
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:28,350
I don't know. I'm not doing this, whether it is for making money or becoming self-sufficient. I have no interest.

454
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,720
So you can do it as diligently as you like.

455
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,990
Ajhussi, didn't you hear her. You have to do this for two weeks without missing a single day.

456
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,760
Yeah, I wasn't listening.

457
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,800
If you just go, you'll be fired

458
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,530
This is driving me nuts.

459
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,970
 Barun Chicken

460
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,880
Bo Ah, where are you? It's time we open the restaurant.

461
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,090
Are you sick?

462
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,570
Boss, actually...

463
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,050
It seems like I have the flu.

464
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,390
- Bo Ah, how about food? Would you like me to bring up some porridge? 
- No.

465
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:26,110
Right now I'm in a really messy state, so please don't come up.

466
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,820
Boss, just let me rest for today.

467
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,180
That's fine, right?

468
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,720
Then, thank you, Boss.

469
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:00,430
Signal Lamp's here. It's the newest edition.

470
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,570
Signal Lamp.

471
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,240
Would you like a Signal Lamp...

472
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,860
Uhm.. Signal...

473
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,980
Please buy Signal Lamp.

474
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,610
Ah, Signal Lamp.

475
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,310
- Please give me one. 
- What?

476
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,390
Give me one.

477
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,920
Ah,  yes.

478
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,990
Thank you. Thank you.

479
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,840

482
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,560
 Signal Lamp

483
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,830
 Bo Ah, please open your door. I will give you porridge and leave.

484
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:25,970
This person, really. Why is he doing what I didn't even ask him to do?

485
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,070
Where are you?

486
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,590
Bo Ah?

487
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,770
She definitely saw the message, but why isn't she picking up the phone?

488
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,490
Is she not feeling well enough?

489
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,020
Bo Ah?

490
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,310
Bo Ah, are you alright?

491
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,300
Bo Ah.

492
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,910
Boss!

493
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,330
Boss, a customer's here!

494
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,520
Give me some chicken!

495
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,020
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

496
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,460
 Why?

497
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,020
Nobody's here.

498
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,630
Was it the wind?

499
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,910
The wind?

500
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,300
Yes, it was blowing quite a lot earlier, right?

501
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,340
The radish dish is pretty good.

502
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,970
But...

503
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,700
What is she doing dressed that way?

504
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,680
I don't have any idea.

505
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,710
If you think about it, she is working the hardest.

506
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,360
Agreed.

507
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,910
Chicken's here. Please enjoy.

508
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,490
Thank you.

509
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,440
Thank you.

510
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,350
Thank you.

511
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,510
It tastes good.

512
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,500
Bo Ah, are you sleeping?

513
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,350
Why is he here already?

514
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,340
Bo Ah.

515
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,360
It's open?

516
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,980
Bo Ah, I'm coming in.

517
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm really coming in.

518
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,910
Bo Ah?

519
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,710
Boss.

520
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,060
Bo Ah, are you alright?

521
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:02,000
I was very worried since I couldn't contact you and I thought something had happened to you.

522
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,480
I'm okay.

523
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,710
Thank you for worrying about me.

524
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,960
Then, get up and eat some porridge.

525
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,270
What? No, just leave it there. I'll eat it later.

526
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,860
Don't be like this. Get up and eat a bit.

527
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,480
I will leave after I've seen you eat.

528
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,790
That's fine.

529
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:39,800
Bo Ah, you didn't eat anything all day, did you?

530
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,100
I'm not hungry.

531
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,620
Please just leave it here.

532
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,890
I know you might not have an appetite, but you need to eat to regain your strength.

533
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,580
Just get up a bit.

534
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,600
Get up.

535
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,350
I'm sorry, boss. I didn't mean to...

536
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,840
It's because I am too sick to get up.

537
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,170
So...

538
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,590
Is it that bad?

539
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,360
No, that's not what I—

540
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,480
What are you doing?

541
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,150
Just stay in bed.

542
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,110
I blew on it so it won't be too hot.

543
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,300
What?

544
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,480
Say 'ah.'

545

00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,960
Does it taste alright?

548
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,600
Well, it's tasty.

♫  This is the perfect time  ♫

558
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,210
Bo Ah, you should chew before you swallow.

559
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,610
Why would i chew porridge?

560
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,890
Just give me more.

561
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,540

♫  The day to show the world how great I’ve become  ♫

569
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,090
I couldn't find him today,

570
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,470
even though I searched the whole neighborhood.

571
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,860
♫  How thrilling would it be  ♫

572

573
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,180
I see.

574
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:09,630
If I knew it was going to turn out like this, I should have asked for his name.

575
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:21,010
Bo Ah. Don't be sick.

576
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:21,770
♫  Not everything  ♫

577
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:26,220

00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,010
Rest tomorrow as well. And don't worry about the restaurant.

00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,220

♫  So I will believe in myself  ♫

590
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,350
Snap out of it.

591
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,760
What the?

592
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,650
It's you, again?

593
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,140
You should have five. Why did they turn into ten?

594
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:05,090
I sold all five of them and bought new ones with the money I made.

595
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:08,580
Five were sold overnight? Who sold them?

596
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,790
If you sell all 10 of these you'll get ₩25,000 out of the ₩50,000 cost.

597
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:17,590
With that, you can go ahead and be self-sufficient or use it to afford to sleep. It's all up to you.

598
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,190
I did as much as I could.

599
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,760
And I'm warning you now, but don't follow strange people.

600
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,090
There are a ton of people who would trick you by offering you jobs.

601
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,650
Except for me.

602
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,700
How did you sell them? Nobody wants to buy them though.

603
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,670
For the first time, I also realized that there are many good people in this world.

604
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,650
If you work for a day, you will realize this as well.

605
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,130
And this is the most important point of all.

606
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:05,160
Don't sell them in our neighborhood. Sell them somewhere far away.

607
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,210
And while we're at it, living near your workplace is a nice thing.

608
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,300
Why don't you try moving over there?

609
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,030
Got it?

610
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,480
Strange. She's definitely strange.

611
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,700
She's not in her right mind.

612
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,290
Bo Ah.

613
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,440
I was just coming down.

614
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,510
I told you to take today off.

615
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,660
It's fine. I'm all better.

616
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,980
Really?

617
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,600
Yes, sure.

618
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,530
But are you going somewhere?

619
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:57,120
Yes, I need to go looking for him again.

620
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,220
For him?

621
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:05,770
That...

622
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,740
M-M-Magazine. Buy...

623
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,140
Signal Lamp's h-here.

624
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,880
Buy a magazine.

Please buy a magazine.

626
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:20,220

Please give me one.

629
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,610
Keep up the good work.

630
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,650
Signal Lamp's here!

631
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,040
Signal's here. It's the newest edition. Signal Lamp.

632
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,420

00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,630
Signal Lamp.

634
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,310
It's the newest edition.

00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:10,240
Signal Lamp. Buy one!

636
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,320
The bill, please.

637
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,700
Eat it slowly.

638
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,030
Is it that delicious?

639
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:52,550
 Chicken porridge

640
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,220
Eat.

641
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,630
For the past few days, you haven't eaten. So that's the only thing you can stomach.

642
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,020
It's fine.

643
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:35,890
I will just die here. I'm different from people like you—

644
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:38,300
You think you're different, right?

645
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,560
We are all the same.

646
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,910
We all thought like you in the beginning.

647
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:57,890
Only our pride was strong, and our personality stunk.

648
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,000
Listen.

649
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:06,610
When sleeping out here in the open doesn't feel pitiful anymore,

650
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,360
or getting meals at a soup kitchen for free

651
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:15,590
no longer hurts your pride. At that moment, living like this will be bound to last longer.

652
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,620
It's not too late for you.

653
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,160
Eat, regain your strength and go back.

654
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,400
 Locker to store your belongings

655
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,900
Please insert your password.

656
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,030
Thank you for using our service.

657
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:14,170
Andrew, you just got your paycheck so you should buy me a drink.

658
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:20,150
There's no way I can spend this money. Next time i'll buy.

659
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,090
I'm going to hold on to this till the day I die.

660
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,200
Why bother? You are clearly from a rich family.

661
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,950
That watch is worth at least three months of pay.

662
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,790
Hey, this is different.

663
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:39,190
This is the very first pay check that I earned.

664
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,870
What? 
 Nothing.  (in Korean)

665
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,900
I would like to change all of this money.

666
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:26,220
 Barun Chicken

667
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,590
It can't be helped.

668
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:46,250
You tried so hard, but you couldn't find him. Then it wasn't meant to be.

669
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,710
But you tried too.

670
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,870
That chicken.

671
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:57,730
You looked all around. He probably went somewhere far away.

672
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,940
Don't be like this.

673
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,100
Let's just do well.

674
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,760
We can do it.

675
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:15,380
I want to cook again.

676
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,380
Pardon?!

677
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:22,520
Thanks to you, I want to live the right way again.

678
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,220
Because of me?

679
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,360
As you can see, I wouldn't be able to work in the kitchen.

680
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,760
Unless it's the kitchen of a disastrous chicken restaurant like this.

681
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:44,020
So I will work here from now on.

682
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:50,650
I'm Andrew Kang, Sous-chef for a Michelin three-star restaurant.

683
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,530
♫  Will you be   ♫

684
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,030
♫  my one and only universe?  ♫

685
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:09,250
♫  So a pretty flower that resembles you
can bloom the cracks of my heart  ♫

686
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:18,050
  The Best Chicken

687
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,130
 It would be nice if we get some customers tomorrow.

688
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,520
 I'm really desperate.

689
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,690
 Then you should grab at every opportunity

690
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:23,970
 Like doing deliveries.

691
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:26,340
 The little prince tames the fox.

692
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,510
 And once it becomes tame he abandons it.

693
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:30,610
 That's his first love.

694
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:31,870
 I will use my vacation.

695
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:32,630
 Vacation?

696
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,850
 I will never allow myself to be tamed.

697
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,720
 What is this? Why are there this many people?

698
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,170
 Is this really our restaurant?

699
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:41,140
 When we're in this situation, must she really go on vacation?

700
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,630
 Bo Ah!

701
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,790
♫   in the sky of my heart  ♫

702
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:54,260
♫  I’ll hang you like a star   ♫

703
00:59:54,260 --> 01:00:02,500
♫  Sweet days and nights, I only want to look at the heavenly you  ♫

704
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,270
♫  Baby I have a crush on you  ♫

705
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:09,740
♫  Will you be  ♫

706
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:14,070
♫  my one and only universe?  ♫

707
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:22,800
♫  So a pretty flower that resembles you 
Can bloom the cracks of my heart  ♫

708
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,290
♫  You probably don’t know  ♫

709
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,390
♫  but you’ve become the world to someone  ♫

710
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:36,190
♫  Even my smallest wish   ♫

711
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:40,390
♫  has become you  ♫

712
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,380
♫  Baby I need your love  ♫

713
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:49,630
♫  Will you follow the clock hands  ♫

714
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:54,090
♫  and come here?  ♫

715
01:00:54,090 --> 01:01:03,310
♫  Into this picturesque scene where your breath touches
 Into our own time  ♫

716
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:13,010
♫  Into this picturesque scene where your breath touches
 Into our own time
  ♫

717
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:17,110
