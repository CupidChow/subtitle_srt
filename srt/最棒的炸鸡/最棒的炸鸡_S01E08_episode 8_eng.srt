00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,950
 Notice

 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,470
Goodness, this place is bound to go under soon.

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,950
There's no way my son would run a chicken shop.

10
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,600
Let's see

11
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,780
Oh!

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,430
Is anyone there?

13
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,300
Excuse me

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,260
I have something to ask.

15
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,900
Is no one here?

16
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,580
Why is the door open and no one is here?

17
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,580
 Chicken QC Contest

18
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,930
What?

19
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,320
 Chicken QC Contest 
First Place Winner

20
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,890
 Let's go.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,860
When did you wake up and make all this?

22
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,340
I just made it with what you had. Enjoy.

23
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,360
Thank you for the food.

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,720
Who is it at this hour?

25
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,780
Who is it?

26
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,400
Did you order something?

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,230
They wouldn't come up here to deliver it. They would leave it downstairs.

28
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,520
Didn't you lock the door?

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,050
I forgot. I wasn't in my right mind.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,900
Who is it?

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,000
My son is here, isn't he?

32
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,310
What?

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,160
Mom!

34
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,380
Mom, why are you here so suddenly?

35
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,040
Be quiet. I don't want to hear your voice.

36
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,010
Mom, you know I was going to try and call, but

37
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,260
the restaurant somehow...

38
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,220
Mom.

39
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,140
 ?

40
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,570
 The spy who fell in love with me

41
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,370
Gosh, you can skip over the cannons and get the general.

42
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,660
- What are you doing?
 - Yes! Right. Right.

43
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,780
That is not right!

44
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,590
Don't move.

45
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,250
Will you be quiet?

46
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,510
Check!

47
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,120
You, gramps, why butt into other's chess moves?

48
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,350
Is Myeong Dong here?

49
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,120
Aigoo, what's wrong with me? My old lady told me to buy some spring onions, but I forgot.

50
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,800
Let's go.

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,270
Check mate. It's your turn.

52
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,460
What are you doing? You have to take the chariot.

53
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,920
You have to get rid of it.

54
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,040
Aigoo, I guess there was that brilliant move left!

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,260
Good Idea. Good! Good! Good!

56
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,830
Check!

57
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,350
You always complain when others butt in. Why do you...

58
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,900
Fine. You're giving me great tips.

59
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,770
Here. It's my move.

60
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,130
Are you going to keep playing?

61
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,690
How is the chicken joint doing?

62
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,260
Oh, good!

63
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,720
They got suspended for two months.

64
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,710
Will they go out of business?

65
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,260
Why? So you can butt in?

66
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,700
Nonsense.

67
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,880
Thinking about getting new tenants gives me a headache.

68
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,410
My kid seems to really like that place as well.

69
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,580
Well, well. I think you want to butt in.

70
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,980
I said thats not it!

71
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,810
If I butt into young people's matters, I'll be an old fool.

72
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,220
So you're saying you don't want to be an old fool?

73
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,590
Check!

74
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,710
What, what is this?

75
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,730
Aigoo, aigoo, geez. Aigoo, my goodness, goodness.

76
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,580
Will they really go out of business?

77
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,950
What are you doing here?

78
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,680
Well, the thing is...

79
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,540
What is it?

80
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,500
Hold on, the mood right now is a bit...

81
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,850
What are you saying?

82
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,110
Wait here for now.

83
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,100
I gave him a check-up the other day. He is fine, Mom.

84
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,370
Right, I'm fine.

85
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,230
A lot of office workers come to our hospital. Office workers are having a hard time these days.

86
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,090
They're overworked and tired.

87
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,810
Yes. When I was working at a company—

88
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,290
I told you to be quiet.

89
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,890
I'm sorry, Mom.

90
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,260
Buy some medicine and take it to your sibling.

91
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,990
I will pay for it.

92
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,830
You don't have to pay. I'll cover it.

93
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,190
How much time do you need? When do you plan to close this place?

94
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,710
It might look like this now, but

95
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,030
our shop was doing so well, we were about to become stable.

96
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,930
I was wrong for not telling you, but

97
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,510
I'm not closing the shop. I'm not just trying this out.

98
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,330
While looking for you, I searched every single store in this town.

99
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,630
Every time I opened a store door, how do you think I felt?

100
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,750
I tried to understand you.

101
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,060
I thought, can this be a café,

102
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,540
or this wine bar, this restaurant?

103
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,370
Why would you leave your company and go through this hardship?

104
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,760
Each time I opened a door, I thought it over, worried, and made an effort.

105
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,050
This isn't it.

106
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,250
What exactly do I have to understand?

107
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,230
Why this is not it, and why it won't work?

108
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,190
A chicken shop?

109
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,450
Oh, my goodness.

110
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,070
My head.

111
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,830
Don't see me out. I can't even look at you two.

112
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,680
Are you leaving?

113
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,820
- Let me see your phone 
 - What?

114
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,320
Don't you think you have something to tell me?

115
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,850
Right now isn't good, I'll get in touch with you.

116
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,690
Sure.

117
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,590
That's my number.

118
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,120
Is it okay to let Mom leave by herself?

119
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,830
She told us not to follow her.

120
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:23,090
For now, it is best to keep our distance. Nothing we say will work.

121
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,460
Right.

122
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,140
Who was that just now?

123
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,990
My mom.

124
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,650
Your mother is quite something.

125
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,580
Are you okay?

126
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,190
I'm okay, but I'm worried about my mom.

127
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,510
But now she went to my house, right?

128
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,620
Where do I go after work?

129
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,730
Do you want to stay here too?

130
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,970
Are you kidding?

131
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,420
Well, then you can leave. We are quite busy.

132
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,390
Are we busy? Why?

133
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,250
What is all this?

134
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,400
We are closed. Why did you order so much oil?

135
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,270
First, let's move it inside.

136
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,420
He told you to move it inside.

137
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,060
I really should have come ten minutes later.

138
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,360
Let go. It's heavy.

139
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,310
What is this?

140
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,320
It's not like you have money to waste. Why did you order so much oil?

141
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,880
Anyway, I don't think the sauce was the problem.

142
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,160
 There are some of you who don't know about this place yet!

143
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,200
 If you like fried chicken, then this place is a must. Great store name too, Refreshing Bath Chicken.

144
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,370
 The fried chicken is super crispy. Daebak!

145
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,820
 When I first tried this place, it was great. But yesterday, it was so-so. I'm disappointed.

146
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,850
When I checked SNS, there were some people saying that the taste was just so-so,

147
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,720
even after we changed the menu to only offer fried chicken.

148
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,760
But on the same day,

149
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,530
a lot of people were saying that it's super tasty and awesome.

150
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:36,160
We're back to square one then. Even our fried chicken doesn't have consistency.

151
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,220
Yes.

152
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,520
So I was thinking it over. After we reduced the menu,

153
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,150
we checked the seasoning carefully and the batter mix shouldn't cause any inconsistencies.

154
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,910
I think the oil was the problem.

155
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,180
Why would the oil affect the taste?

156
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,380
People don't taste the oil.

157
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,470
Oil is important too.

158
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,980
You first taste the seasoning after biting into the chicken,

159
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,330
then you taste the powder. But the final aftertaste in your mouth is the oil.

160
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,060
Right.

161
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,980
What I am saying is that I paid attention even to the oil.

162
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,590
I used brown rice oil for more crispiness and mixed in canola oil for a clean flavor.

163
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,760
You know too

164
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,220
how hard I tried to get the best ratio for the brown rice oil and canola oil mix.

165
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,790
Of course, I know.

166
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,760
But do you know how much chicken we fry in the oil?

167
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,560
That...

168
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,000
we change the oil once every two days.

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,230
We switch out one of the fryers every day.

170
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,820
Isn't that pretty often?

171
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,330
That was the problem.

172
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,730
We counted the days to change the oil, not how many chickens we fried.

173
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,680
I think that, too.

174
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,050
When we got a lot customers unexpectedly, the oil went bad faster.

175
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,000
Let's try frying it.

176
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,150
To see how many chickens we can fry and maintain the same taste.

177
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,770
Producer Beom.

178
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,900
Senior.

179
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,830
Thank you.

180
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,720
How is it?

181
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,320
I looked into it.

182
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
They don't have any records. They don't seem bad.

183
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,600
They? Which of the three?

184
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,820
Why ask? All three were in on it.

185
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,880
You found something, right. What is it?

186
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,790
I shouldn't be telling you this.

187
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,520
Why, what is it?

188
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:50,230
Have you read..."The Melodrama King on Campus"?

189
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,660
What?

190
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,880
You know, that webtoon.

191
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,340
It's really popular.

192
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,560
What should I do? You came all the way here.

193
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,020
My job is not TV broadcasting, I'm a webtoon artist.

194
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,900
- As an artist, I communicate through my work 
 - Ah.

195
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,650
I asked to see you because—

196
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,220
Since you came all the way here, I have a new idea I was thinking of.

197
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,140
I only work on my series, so I am always here.

198
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,950
I don't know what's going on in the world.

199
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,320
If you take a look at my business card, you'll realise that I'm not in variety, but—

200
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,780
Exactly, I didn't know that.

201
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,350
I don't know even after seeing your business card. I make cute mistakes.

202
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,340
If it's not a variety show, what do you do?

203
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,610
Ah!
  Culture and Current Events

204
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,220
Culture and current events, like real life documentaries?

205
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,050
No, I'm doing a best restaurants show.

206
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,200
So the reason I came here is—

207
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,710
Are you telling me to cook?

208
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,240
That doesn't sound too bad.

209
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,760
When I cook, I don't know if it's salt or sugar.

210
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,880
I just sprinkle some and it tastes good.

211
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,300
Excuse me, Writer.

212
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,060
Can you let me speak?

213
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,990
Okay, okay.

214
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,390
Do you know this person?

215
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,160
How would I know just from a photo...?

216
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,350
I know.

217
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,420
Do you remember?

218
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,870
What about these jerks?

219
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:45,330
I'm personally investigating something related to these three.

220
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,780
I heard they had done something awful to you.

221
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,600
They did, because of these guys I couldn't eat

222
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,030
or sleep properly.

223
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,950
That time I was hurt too deeply.

224
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,890
Can you explain in detail what they did to you?

225
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,880
They wrote negative comments on my work.

226
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,530
What?

227
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,960
So I reported them to the cyber investigation department.

228
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,820
I wanted to see who the heck they were.

229
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,620
But they are Seo Bo Ah's friends after all.

230
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,660
Seo Bo Ah?

231
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,020
She said her friends made a mistake and begged.

232
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,570
So I settled with them and ended it.

233
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,630
Why? Did they cause another incident?

234
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,750
Seo Bo Ah?

235
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,100
Now it's a little crooked.

236
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,230
How about now?

237
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,890
Okay, it's good.

238
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,890
Is it alright?

239
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,260
Yes.

240
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,150
Okay.

241
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,720
Turn it on.

242
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,580
Yes.

243
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,770
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

244
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,330
When our suspension is over, I'll make a flyer saying we fry only 58 chickens with one tub of oil.

245
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,720
I'll draw it prettily.

246
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,370
Thank you, Bo Ah.

247
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,490
You can turn it off again.

248
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,330
Now the issue with the recipe is resolved and we could do really well if we can start again,

249
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,100
but we can't open the store.

250
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,490
Just a month and a half.

251
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,060
But what should we do with the fried chicken we made?

252
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,770
We can't sell them.

253
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,010
Right.

254
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,890
Then can I take a few that we just fried?

255
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,260
Me too. I just need one.

256
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,550
Fine.

257
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,860
Chicken's here!

258
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,000
How is it, grandfather?

259
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,750
What is it?

260
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,560
Do you think I only visit you to ask favors?

261
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,530
- Grandfather? 
 - What?

262
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,650
What would you do if I wanted to open a chicken restaurant?

263
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,080
What do you think?

264
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
If you would live a normal life,

265
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,630
I would welcome anything.

266
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,200
No, think about it seriously.

267
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,220
If I open up a chicken restaurant,

268
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,120
I will get splashed by oil and it will be hard work.

269
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,520
Drunk customers will come and cause a ruckus.

270
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,990
Do you think there is easy work in the world?

271
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,520
The bathhouse went under because you didn't work hard enough.

272
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,220
It would've been different if you'd made an effort. There's no easy work, you know.

273
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,190
Why bring that up now?

274
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,220
Okay! Let's skip that.

275
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,890
Are you against me opening a chicken restaurant?

276
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,950
I said I wouldn't.

277
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,600
So let's say

278
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,850
I have a chicken shop, but due to a suspension,

279
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,250
I do manual labor in the mornings and Uber at night.

280
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,310
That is what my boss is doing.

281
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,250
How about now? Do you want to oppose?

282
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,420
I don't know, but I do know my granddaughter

283
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,820
wanted to be a webtoon artist.

284
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,920
I was opposed to it, but you wouldn't listen.

285
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,940
Right, now you get it. It's a similar situation.

286
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,120
So I really want to do it, but you really don't want me to do it.

287
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,470
How do I convince you in that situation?

288
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:40,340
In other words, how can we make up?

289
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,390
Do you want to draw mangas again?

290
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,700
No, why bring that up again?

291
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,480
Why do you always lose track of the conversation?

292
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,620
If you want to start again, go ahead.

293
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,010
What?!

294
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,850
I didn't know you wanted to do it so badly.

295
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,720
I was opposed to it because I wanted what was best for you.

296
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,970
I didn't quit because of you!

297
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,290
What's with you all of a sudden?!

298
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:19,690
Since when... were you... on my side?

299
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,980
That is the love of a parent.

300
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,530
We may oppose things initially.

301
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,380
How can we oppose what our child wants to do?

302
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,940
Didn't you spend too much money?

303
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,250
I got it for free, so please enjoy.

304
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,550
Why? That newbie from before?

305
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,330
Well, did he leave?

306
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,910
It's been a while. He left a while after you left.

307
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,050
He's probably living well somewhere.

308
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,770
Maybe.

309
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,560
Are you living well?

310
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,610
Yes, well.

311
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,900
Is it very difficult?

312
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,810
No matter how I calculate, I'm still in the red. Should I increase my workload?

313
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,370
But why did you come here after work? You're not going home?

314
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,000
This is all your fault! How could I go home, knowing Mom is there?

315
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,760
Go cheer her up. You were always good at that sort of thing.

316
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,940
When I was getting scolded, you'd bring over papers to work on.

317
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,260
Thinking back to that, I was super smart from a young age.

318
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,260
 Landlord Elder

319
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,290
Yes, Elder?

320
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,030
 Heard you're having a hard time these days.

321
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,990
No, it's fine.

322
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,850
I will make sure to pay the rent on time, so you don't need to worry—

323
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,560
You can be honest with me.

324
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,690
I called because I heard about everything going on.

325
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,330
That... to be honest...

326
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,790
I tried very hard, but it's not easy.

327
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,070
But I will still make sure to pay the rent on time.

328
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,130
- Forget it. 
 - What?

329
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:43,210
When you open again, pay the two months rent when you can.

330
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,550
But... I couldn't...

331
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,170
Sure, you can. Think of it as payment for the chicken.

332
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,340
What?

333
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,260
Then, good night.

334
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,430
Thank you, Elder! Thank you!

335
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,410
What is it?

336
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,730
He said it's okay to pay the rent late.

337
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,630
Really?

338
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,690
What a relief.

339
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,200
Maybe I should move in here.

340
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,040
Your landlord is very kind.

341
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,990
Hold on...

342
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,460
Doesn't the street look different?

343
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,400
How so?

344
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,880
I mean when we first came here the street was really dirty.

345
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,590
and there were "for rent" signs on all the buildings.

346
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,160
Don't you remember?

347
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,530
They were collecting rent fees.

348
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,780
Those people.

349
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,780
They were just being protective. They aren't that bad.

350
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,640
Right! I thought they were familiar! Suspects two and three.

351
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,000
Suspects two and three?

352
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,150
 Moon So Dam

353
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,550
What the? Where did he go?

354
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,020
What is it? If you have something to say, just say it.

355
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,810
The thing is...

356
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,120
You. Do you like that girl?

357
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,220
What?

358
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,390
Seo Bo Ah. Do you like her?

359
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,220
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

360
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,960
Don't like her. I'm worried you'll get hurt.

361
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,050
The fact that I still like you isn't the point here.

362
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,970
Tell me so I can understand. Why are you bringing up Bo Ah?

363
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,630
I told you.

364
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,290
Your suspension was caused by someone intentionally.

365
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,300
In my opinion, that person is Seo Bo Ah.

366
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,070
Right. I'm sure you must have a reason to say that.

367
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,540
But you are wrong.

368
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,950
She wouldn't do this.

369
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,600
Why do you believe her? You haven't even known her that long.

370
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,360
What I found out and why I did this,

371
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,490
why aren't you curious and not asking any questions?

372
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,760
Why do you believe her more than me?

373
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,360
I told you I'd wait for you.

374
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,960
I never said I was fine with you meeting other women.

375
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,020
Don't go that far.

376
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,160
So Dam...

377
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,760
I will go first today.

378
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,260
And I'm telling you now, but she's wrong for you.

379
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,060
Why is he being this way all of a sudden?

380
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,580
Why must Grandpa do this?

381
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,460
I haven't done anything, yet he's provoking me.

382
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,670
Today was a really long day.

383
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,000
Bo Ah?!

384
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,800
Bo Ah! Bo Ah!

385
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,690
Yes, boss?

386
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,950
Bo Ah, are you alright?

387
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,500
Are you hurt?

388
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,000
If you are being threatened, blink twice.

389
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,530
What?

390
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,130
That's not it.

391
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,600
It isn't?

392
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,370
I was watching this.

393
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,170
And here I thought something had happened to you.

394
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,060
I was worried, you know?

395
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,040
I was a bit loud, right?

396
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,780
But why are you watching a horror movie if it scares you?

397
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,740
Is this in preparation of the webtoon?

398
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,820
No, it isn't!

399
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,560
I just got the urge to watch a horror movie.

400
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,100
Got it.

401
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,970
Then I will leave now. Scream as much as you want.

402
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,780
♫  A star has fallen into my restless heart  ♫

403
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,990
♫  It keeps digging in and twinkling  ♫

404
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,480
E-Excuse me, Bo Ah?

405
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,940
Boss.

406
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,790
♫  Awakening my lurking dream  ♫

407
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,140
Can you not leave?

408
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,750
Can't you watch this with me?

409
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:01,720
♫  No one knows what will happen 
There’s no rule against success  ♫

410
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,800
♫  So I'm not afraid  ♫

411
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,710
♫  This is the perfect time, it’s better to make things big  ♫

412
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:16,560
♫  I want to follow the sound of my burning heartbeat   ♫

00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,810
♫  And live again   ♫

♫  I’ll be here for dreaming  ♫

415
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,530
  I remember now.

416
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,580
  Suspects two and three tried to protect their spot from the beginning.

417
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,650
  That's not what is important right now.

418
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,500
  Suspects one, two and three are just accomplices.

419
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,430
 As we expected, the real culprit was a different person.

420
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,380
  And I found out who it is.

421
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,160
  Who?

422
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,290
  Seo Bo Ah.

423
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,460
  No way! The part-timer?

424
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,570
  Are you certain?

425
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,980
 It's still my guess based on the circumstance.

426
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,270
  I am going to check from now on

427
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,640
  whether I'm right or not.

428
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,090
  How?

429
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,870
  By using bait.

430
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,200
  You are off since it's the weekend, right?

431
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,670
What are you thinking about?

432
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,150
I not really thinking about anything.

433
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,020
There was so much to think about today,

434
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,830
and I don't even know where to start,

435
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,190
so I don't want to think about anything. At least not now.

436
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,380
I should follow your example.

437
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,780
Why? Is something troubling you?

438
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:35,240
Of course, there are a lot of things. Countless.

439
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,530
Because my life is pathetic.

440
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,580
But who says we can't be a bit pathetic?

441
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:55,020
Do we always have to be someone, achieve something, and try hard?

442
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,800
Can't we just be happy being a bit pathetic?

443
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:10,790
Bo Ah, I want to protect this store.

444
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,370
Even if it takes a lot of time,

445
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:19,750
I want my mom to be proud of me one day.

446
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,180
So what I want to say is

447
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,130
I will stay here.

448
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,320
If there is something you'd like to do, go ahead.

449
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,920
And if it doesn't work out, you can come back here at any time.

450
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,440
And if there is something else you'd like to try out, do it.

451
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,410
I'm telling you it's fine to do so. I will be waiting here.

452
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,900
I wish for you that my store

453
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,360
will become a place you can always return to.

454
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:06,380
♫  I always smile like this  ♫

455
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:12,930
♫  Even though the world makes me suffer, I'll never  ♫

Wow.

It's really nice here.

458
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,310
Right?

459
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,070
It's nice.

460
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:30,860
♫  It's a good thing that I can still  ♫

463
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,170
Boss?

464
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,640
I went to work, Don't worry.

465
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,770
This guy...

466
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,340
I told him not to overwork himself.

467
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,750
Hamburgers!

468
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,700
Is there anything you don't deliver?

469
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,260
No point in being unemployed.

470
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,060
That's true, but whenever we order something, you always deliver it.

471
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,210
Where did he go?!

472
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,860
Hey, I've never heard him speak more than a sentence.

473
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,750
What about Bo Ah? Is she busy?

474
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,680
Yeah, she is meeting someone.

475
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,340
Who?

476
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,060
Put it away.

477
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,920
Hello!

478
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,580
You came again!

479
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,540
Are you renting the place?

480
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,320
It's still available. Please take a seat.

481
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,650
That's not it.

482
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:11,160
To be honest, I'm a broadcast producer.

483
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,320
A producer?

484
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,920
A while ago, I was shooting at that fried chicken restaurant.

485
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,750
Aren't you the Producer of  Yum Yum Slurp Slurp?

486
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,390
The one who knows the owner?

487
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:31,190
As expected, you know everything that goes on in the neighborhood.

488
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,150
Well, what I told you then could lead to a misunderstanding.

489
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,530
Don't worry.

490
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,030
I won't misunderstand.

491
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,570
That's your job after all.

492
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:48,180
I must produce the show, and you must grab the customers.

493
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,520
Yes...

494
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:02,660
But, why would  Yum Yum Slurp Slurp  come to our Real Estate office?

495
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:11,780
Actually while we were filming, I saw something.

496
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,220
But I didn't want to stir things up between you all,

497
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,250
so I let it slide.

498
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,010
But I kept feeling guilty.

499
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,810
You shouldn't play with food.

500
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,420
What?

501
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,030
The thing is, I saw a Brazilian chicken package in the chicken shop's kitchen.

502
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:41,460
But the menu says they use only Korean frozen chicken.

503
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,380
In one word, they lied about the chicken's origin.

504
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,120
So? Why are you telling me this?

505
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,990
As a public broadcast program, I want to air this.

506
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:58,230
But I have no evidence and no witness.

507
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,880
I'm asking you because I'm playing detective.

508
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,930
Since you know everything that goes on in this town,

509
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,460
I was wondering if you had heard any rumors?

510
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,400
Rumors...?

511
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,690
I'm not sure.

512
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,750
I see.

513
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,060
But if I don't get any evidence or info today,

514
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,020
this story will be killed, so I'm in a rush.

515
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,960
I see.

516
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,280
Even if one receipt would surface, that would be daebak.

517
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,250
Anyway, if you think of anything, please contact me.

518
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,150
I'll be waiting.

519
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,530
Goodbye.

520
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,470
What is she talking about?

521
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,800
Isn't lying about the food's origin a big deal?

522
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,350
Something's strange.

523
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,400
This seems too good to be true.

524
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,500
For now, we should call Bo Ah.

525
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,150
Maybe she knows something.

526
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,350
I don't like beating around the bush.

527
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,050
What's your relationship with my son?

528
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,090
Just employer and employee.

529
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,830
That day, it wasn't what you thought—

530
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,350
You don't need to explain

531
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,960
everything, one by one.

532
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,880
When it come to things concerning young people,

533
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,170
I'm not a narrow-minded person.

534
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,710
But it's really not like that.

535
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,840
Miss?

536
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,480
Are you going to marry my son?

537
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,250
What? No-no-no, of course not.

538
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,960
Then it's fine.

539
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,820
If you are just employer and employee,

540
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,780
or even if you are dating,

541
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,130
I don't care as long as you don't get married.

542
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,090
I see.

543
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,380
The reason

544
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,800
I asked to see you,

545
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,830
was to ask if the chicken is tasty?

546
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,000
Yes. Of course.

547
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,420
It's really delicious.

548
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,590
I'm not just saying that.

549
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,390
I really like chicken.

550
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,170
And among all I've eaten, it's the best chicken.

551
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,780
Really?

552
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,750
Then it won't be easily ruined...

553
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,910
Of course not.

554
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,190
Once the suspension is over

555
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,300
our restaurant will do well again.

556
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,130
I'm curious.

557
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,200
What's with his fried chicken

558
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,750
that there's a fuss about it?

559
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,370
Would you like to try it?

560
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,480
Originally, I was a server, so didn't know how to fry chicken.

561
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,610
But I was taught recently.

562
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,740
Actually, my chicken is still so-so.

563
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,860
If Choi Go fries it, it will be much more delicious.

564
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,960
I raised him like that.

565
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,530
So that he'd excel in everything.

566
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,590
Whoa, that's amazing.

567
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,960
Our restaurant

568
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,700
doesn't just use any oil.

569
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,090
We mix the oils.

570
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,960
With the right blend of brown rice oil and canola oil,

571
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,530
It will be crispy, savory

572
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,200
and have a nice color.

573
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,420
Really?

574
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,990
He researched that, too?

575
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,260
What is the

576
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,930
exact ratio?

577
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,760
What?

578
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,680
I didn't hear that part well.

579
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,620
I don't exactly know.

580
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,920
I'm curious

581
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,770
because my son put in so much effort.

582
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,120
Can you find out for me?

583
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,820
Yes, I can ask the boss.

584
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,590
If I wanted to ask him, I wouldn't have called you.

585
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,740
I'm putting in some effort.

586
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,470
Chicken?

587
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,310
To understand it.

588
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,360
I don't have any confidence yet,

589
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,960
so I'd like for my son to not know about this.

590
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,720
Alright, you can trust me.

591
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,180
I'll keep this a secret from the boss.

592
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,860
♫  I like chicken, I like chicken  ♫

593
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,640
♫  I like chicken  ♫

594
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,860
♫  I really like chicken  ♫

595
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,840
Its easier than I thought.

596
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,690
I will be able to do it after a few tries.

597
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:40,260
Of course. I was really worried at first,

598
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,450
but once I tried it, it wasn't too hard.

599
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,000
Really? Thats great.

600
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,720
Try it.

601
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,290
♫  Fat drumsticks  ♫

602
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,470

605
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,330
♫   I like it, I like chicken  ♫

606
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,340
You weren't exaggerating.

607
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,800
Right?

608
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,930
So,

609
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,870
what my son makes is way better than this, right?

610
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,040
Of course!

611
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,650
Please taste boss's chicken at the shop sometime.

612
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,400
What's the matter?

613
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,310
Stay quiet and follow me.

614
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,080
Would I ask you to do something bad?

615
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,030
I'm incredibly tired right now.

616
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,580
I've been working since morning.

617
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,560
I need to sleep so I can work tonight.

618
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,680
Hey.

619
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,520
It's my day off too, but I can't go home because Mom is there.

620
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,410
Just follow me.

621
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,630
There.

622
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,370
I really need to go.

623
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,360
What are you doing now?

624
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,180
I have to practice spine techniques.

625
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,360
Isn't it nice? I usually charge for this.

626
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,200
Well, it is nice.

627
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,170
If you're tired, you can go to sleep.

628
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,710
Your body will feel good when you wake up.

629
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,820
How can I sleep when it hurts so much?

630
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,230
This guy...

631
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,400
He really was tired.

632
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,270
Can you buy me some time?

633
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,020
 I got the keys to the chicken shop.

634
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:30,190
 Seo Bo Ah really doesn't know the chicken's origins?

635
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,290
Choi Go and I do all the

636
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,340
purchasing of ingredients and preparations.

637
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,340
All the part-timer did was fry the prepared chicken.

638
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,690
But will this be effective?

639
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,230
Even if they fall into our trap,

640
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:47,000
this isn't directly connected to sending the bomb.

641
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,380
- It's only speculation. 
 - Anyway, there's not much

642
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,730
we can do here legally.

643
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,190
We're just showing Choi Go

644
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:57,430
that Seo Bo Ah or her minions

645
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,260
are constantly looking for

646
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,220
opportunities to harm you.

647
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,730
  Nothing's changed here.

648
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,600
Didn't that lady say earlier that

649
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,800
today's the deadline?

650
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,490
Why hasn't Bo Ah been answering her phone all day?

651
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,570
But still...

652
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,980
This one is different than the last time.

653
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,300
I mean,

654
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,960
the chicken shop owner is the wrongdoer here.

655
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,700
How could he lie about the origin?

656
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,990
How can he lie to the consumers?

657
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,030
It's unbelievable.

658
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:57,910
You're so right.

659
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,230
We don't need to feel guilty about this.

660
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,990
Should we just

661
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,530
finish this off?

662
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,630
Just close our eyes, go there and

663
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,130
find a receipt. That's all.

664
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,500
But,

665
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm bothered about that producer.

666
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,050
Why?

667
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,430
They all know each other.

668
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,600
Even if the show's urgent, how could she do this?

669
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,040
She said it's because they're a public broadcast show.

670
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,400
Maybe she has a conscience.

671
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,360
Hold on.

672
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,630
Why did she come here to tell us that

673
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,800
as if

674
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,400
she wanted us to know?

675
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,440
Sometimes, there are folks like that.

676
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,530
Our realty office does know all the town gossip.

677
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,770
Truthfully, do we need to worry about this?

678
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,140
Since we're going there to meet Bo Ah,

679
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,020
all we need to do is discreetly look for a receipt.

680
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,520
If we're wrong, cool. If we're right,

681
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,370
then we can be the informants.

682
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,420
For the justice of our society?

683
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,680
That's it!  Hey.

684
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,340
On the way to our friend's place,

685
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,810
we kind of saw something.

686
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,230
What's wrong with that?

687
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,770
Is it wrong?

688
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,860
This is...

689
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,970
certainly not trespassing.

690
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,360
Of course not.

691
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,710
We're just going to the second floor.

692
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,670
Yes, since we can't get a hold of Bo Ah.

693
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,930
We're worried. Right?

694
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:11,020
Hurry.

695
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,480
Hurry up. Hurry.

696
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,360
Turn it!

697
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,380
How embarrassing.

698
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,930
What the? Why are there so many calls?

699
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,110
What's up, Min Ah?

700
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,640
Part-timer?

701
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,830
Chef?

702
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,420
I think we need to talk.

703
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,630
About what at this time of night?

704
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,210
But why did you pick up, Min Ah–

705
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,160
Why did you do it?

706
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,410
What?

707
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,410
 Why did you send a bomb to the shop?

708
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:11,380
Why are you here?

709
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,430
What are you talking about? Why are you here?

710
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:44,550
What are you doing here?

711
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,920
What happened?

712
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,140
What happened?

713
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,500
What do you think?

714
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:20,430
I confirmed what was necessary, and wrapped things up.

715
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,270
Turn it.

716
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,030
Turn it.

717
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,550
Hurry.

718
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,620
Stop there.

719
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:42,630
If you enter without permission, it'll be bad for the part-timer.

720
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:57,590
But why did you help me?

721
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:01,630
It's annoying if things get bigger.

722
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,430
And I had a debt to repay.

723
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,850
A debt?

724
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,360
Because of you, I wanted to live properly again.

725
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:18,450
So I wanted to give you another chance as well, to be fair.

726
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,000
This is the last chance you get.

727
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:27,380
I don't know about you,

728
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:32,230
but to me, the chicken restaurant is precious.

729
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:38,030
A chef who can't use his hand has found solace in my kitchen.

730
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,760
And I don't have anywhere else to go.

731
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,060
I'm sorry.

732
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,380
Don't be.

733
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,410
From now on, I'll be monitoring your every move.

734
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,290
I'm warning you now, but if something happens again,

735
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:04,290
I won't stay still.

736
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,350
What did he say?

737
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,740
Is he reporting us?

738
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,600
Is he going to tell the boss?

739
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,550
I'm sorry, Bo Ah.

740
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:43,100
Why would you be sorry?

741
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,720
I'm the one who is sorry.

742
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,270
I'm sorry.

743
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,860
 Notice

Boss.

00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,070
What is it?

767
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,020
♫   Love, I'm falling in love  ♫

768
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,930
 But I realized something shortly.

769
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:38,120
♫  Reasons I like you are becoming countless  ♫

770
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,240
 Even brief moments of happiness like this...

771
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,920
♫  Love love love is shining light  ♫

♫  If it’s you, even the faraway dreams become close enough to reach  ♫

776
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:09,560
You put this one in lemon, right.

777
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,890
Yes, what do you think?

778
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,940
It's fresh, so I like it. It's unique, too.

779
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,830
If you eat this with chicken it will take away the greasiness.

780
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,760
Should we fry one?

781
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,220
Boss!

782
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,710
Boss! We're in trouble.

783
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,920
What are you talking about?

784
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,000
You know the store that was empty?

785
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,700
The one on the way to our restaurant?

786
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,650
Yes, there.

787
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,620
What about there?

788
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:04,670
Thank you, please come again. Take a drink as well.

789
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,590
Thank you.

790
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,840
Mom! What are you doing?!

791
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,060
Have some chicken.

792
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,470
Please come back.

793
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:26,760
How could you set up a chicken restaurant on the way to ours?

794
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,630
This... is our recipe.

795
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,020
What happened?

796
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,680
I didn't let her know the recipe.

797
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,640
Mom, how did you know about this?

798
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,180
Who told you?

799
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,070
Was it you?

800
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:47,950

801
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:55,750
♫  Will you be my one and only   ♫

802
01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:00,070
♫  One and only universe  ♫

803
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:04,290
♫  So a pretty flower that resembles you  ♫

804
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:08,090
  Best Chicken

805
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:11,780
I'm sorry. I think it's better that I quit.

806
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,510
You thief!

807
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,610
Grandfather.

808
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:16,860
You're inside, aren't you?

809
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,990
Bo Ah!

810
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,820
I was going to ruin your store!

811
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,520
From the beginning that was my plan!

812
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,320
What do you want me to do?!

813
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,360
Yes, get angry like that. To Seo Bo Ah, too.

814
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,250
Don't go somewhere else.

815
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,890
Just stay by my side!

816
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:34,890
Since I like you.

817
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,690
♫  Your eyes more blinding than jewels  ♫
