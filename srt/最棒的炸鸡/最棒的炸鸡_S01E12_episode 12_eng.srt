1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,730
 The Best Chicken

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,580
 Park Sun Ho

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,070
 Kim So Hye

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,010
 Joo Woo Jae

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,010

6
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,330
What does that mean?

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,580
You said that since I share half, Dad can't do anything.

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,780
You said that he can't do anything without my consent.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,980
This is the separate issue.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,390
If a majority of landowners on this alley agree even if you disagree—

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,500
Then what happens?

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,300
They can demolish the whole alleyway and build an apartment complex.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,350
Then what about our house? How about the chicken place?

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,870
They'll all disappear without a trace.

15
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,630
Disappear?

16
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,930
The whole place?

17
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,930
Yeah.

18
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,960
The end of the alleyway all the way to this chicken place.

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,200
From what I hear, within the apartment complex, they'll build a shopping mall, too.

20
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,970
- Bo Ah.
 - Hey.

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,930
Are you okay?

22
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,880
I've been patient so far.

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,520
Bo Ah, calm down.

24
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,370
I talked respectfully since he was the only family member left.

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,790
I asked him not to have weird ideas.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,630
Watch me.

27
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,880
I'll destroy that union.

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,680
 Episode 12

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,390
Oh...

30
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,380
Shopping mall within an apartment complex.

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,280
I compared this picture with the alley.

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,920
But it really doesn't match with the place.

33
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,510
The new apartment complex is nice, I know.

34
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,470
Do you think the shopping center will have a movie theater?

35
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,060
If it all works out.

36
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,490
Why?

37
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,340
This is different from city redevelopment.

38
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,160
It's not sponsored by the government nor a construction company.

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,970
The neighbors want to build an apartment complex together.

40
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,800
Is there a big difference?

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,580
It's different, yet similar, too.

42
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,230
Things like this can be a success or a disaster.

43
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,130
In the news, the original tenants go their separate ways,

44
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,510
and some are even kicked out, too.

45
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,440
It can go on like that for ten years. There are plenty of cases where

46
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,270
someone goes to jail, everyone turns against each other,

47
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,190
and everyone goes into debt.

48
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,900
So then why do they want to do something that dangerous?

49
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,010
My family was really interested in it, too.

50
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,480
I told you that this has a potential to be daebak.

51
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,830
Unlike other reconstruction business,

52
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,500
the risk or the return is much greater.

53
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,860
Then it's more like gambling.

54
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,520
Bo Ah's dad came at the perfect time.

55
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,060
I didn't even think about it, but our neighborhood is really old, too.

56
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,390
Is there anyone who doesn't want to make money?

57
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,220
Right.

58
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,830
Bo Ah.

59
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,180
What is she carrying?

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,620
She's always ordering us around.

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,480
Are you almost done?

62
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,420
It's done!

63
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,550
One, two, three!

64
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,960
 Opposing the multi-functional complex

65
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,470
 Let's protect our street!

66
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,050
What are these?

67
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,180
What do you think? These can be seen from far away too, right?

68
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,190
Yes, it'll show very clearly.

69
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,780
That's great. Every neighbor has to see it.

70
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,720
But this doesn't suit our business.

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,130
Boss, are you only concerned about your business

72
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,340
when there's a possibility of the whole neighborhood being wiped out?

73
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,950
We have to protect the business first.

74
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,060
Take those down.

75
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,420
Look at his face. He's white as a ghost.

76
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,950
Huh?

77
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,270
Is this a revolution or something?

78
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,160
Even if you have that displayed, people will agree

79
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,820
with your dad if they think they'll make money.

80
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,700
People are not that dumb.

81
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,940
Then what?

82
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,500
From another perspective,

83
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,210
if they feel it benefits them to oppose

84
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,300
building a residential complex, then they probably won't do it.

85
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,460
How?

86
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't know that either.

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,620
We have to think about that from now on.

88
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,670
What is this?

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,330
Did you decide to close down the business?

90
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,420
Don't worry Mr. Chef. We'll take them down.

91
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,290
Take them down.

92
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,030
But what is that?

93
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,850
This?

94
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,730
Didn't you want to add toppings to the new menu?

95
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,510
What kind of giant shrimp are these?

96
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,310
These are the biggest shrimp.

97
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,550
I'm considering adding this as a topping for the new menu.

98
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,860
That sounds fun.

99
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,760
What are you doing not cleaning them?

100
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,340
This is daebak.

101
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,440
I have to take pictures.

102
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,050
This will create some response.

103
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,230
Can we eat this, too?

104
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,980
Of course.

105
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,170
The big one is mine.

106
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,630
 It's good!

107
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,670
How is it?

108
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,840
This is awesome.

109
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,940
I made it, so it's obvious. Be more specific.

110
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,220
First, it's really delicious.

111
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,740
And I'll crave it again.

112
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,720
I want to eat one more right now.

113
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,690
What was I expecting?

114
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,150
Boss, what about you?

115
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,260
The shrimp topping goes well with it.

116
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,420
The taste and visual are both exceptional.

117
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,750
Then let's start selling it today.

118
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,300
If more chicken joints were around here, they wouldn't consider building a residential complex.

119
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,960
What?

120
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,220
I'm just saying. If there's a variety of good food joints,

121
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,120
people would be disappointed they were closing down.

122
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,790
That's it!

123
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,830
What is?

124
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,820
Bo Ah, you just said you'd open a food business district here.

125
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,320
- I did? When?
 - Oh!

126
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,750
There are instances

127
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,970
where a good restaurant opens in a quiet neighborhood and businesses start to boom.

128
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,850
Then wouldn't it be better than a shopping complex opening?

129
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,480
That's it.

130
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,530
Like Sharosu-gil, Gydongridan-gil,
 and Songridan-gil road.

131
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,350
They all started that way.

132
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,400
What road?

133
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,080
It's easier said than done. How can one popular chicken joint start a food district?

134
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,310
There'd just be a line in front of the store.

135
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,340
It doesn't have to be only one.

136
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,090
What?

137
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:54,090
When I opened this place, I didn't know how to fry chicken

138
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,510
or interact with customers. You remember, right?

139
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,590
I clearly remember. Are you proud?

140
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,400
I researched and did my best,

141
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,370
but it's not like they teach you how to run a business.

142
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,880
That's why I taught you everything.

143
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,790
That's what I'm saying. Let's do that.

144
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,780
On this block.

145
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,760
What are you saying?

146
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,520
Explain it so I can understand.

147
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,090
Next patient.

148
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,230
- Hey! Enough already.
 - What?

149
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,820
You've been showing up at the places I frequent

150
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,410
and just lurking around.

151
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,710
The bar, cafe, and wine bar near my workplace.

152
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,570
I can't go anywhere because of you!

153
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,190
- The thing is—
 - Are you confident?

154
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,130
I...

155
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,980
I don't think everyone has to marry who they date.

156
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,410
But if you don't have plan to get married

157
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,060
and just want to date,

158
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,450
I don't like that.

159
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,190
- So Dam. 
- Can you get married to me?

160
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,750
Even though I dated Choi Go for that long?

161
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,180
Do I really have to bring this up?

162
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,910
If I'm okay with it, how do you feel about it?

163
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,530
What?

164
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,730
I can't think about all these issues the way you do.

165
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,840
I went there because I missed you.

166
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,320
I thought it'd be nice to run into you.

167
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,850
You can't  not  think.

168
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,460
You can't  not  think about these things.

169
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,960
Start thinking about it now.

170
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,900
Then you'll be scared the way I am.

171
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,360
Here you go. Take this.

172
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,160
 Community meeting for a new co-op establishment

173
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,060
 What's this?

174
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,140
What is this?

175
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,020
 Land Use Consent

176
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,210
It's nothing special.

177
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,330
It's just a form for consent to use the land.

178
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,100
Consent for what?

179
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,710
Land...

180
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,490
The empty spaces you see there,

181
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,310
you just have to fill it out, sign it, and stamp it.

182
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,550
I'm going to build a co-op establishment.

183
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,760
That way they can build residential complexes.

184
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,350
So this is where everyone was.

185
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,150
Bo Ah, what are you doing here?

186
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,030
What do you mean? I'm a  member of the community, too.

187
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,050
What's most important at this point is to build a co-op establishment.

188
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,430
For that to happen, the forms I handed you

189
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,910
must be signed by you all...

190
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,330
What is it, Bo Ah?

191
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,800
If a co-op establishment is built, is it 100% certain

192
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,110
that a shopping center and residential complexes will be built?

193
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,260
My goodness.

194
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,560
There's no such thing as 100% certainty in this world.

195
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,110
There are rare cases like a natural disaster—

196
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,390
Ahh. So it's not definite.

197
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,690
I have another question.

198
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,880
What is it?

199
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,790
While searching on the internet,

200
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,680
I read something about 'additional contributions.' What is that?

201
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,270
I read that people go bankrupt if it exceeds a couple hundred million won.

202
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,980
What's going on?

203
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,260
No need to worry.

204
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,090
That's a rare case.

205
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:09,340
There are instances where businesses pay out that amount because they have excess funds.

206
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,760
So they give you a new apartment as well as money?

207
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,130
They say it's possible that we'd have to pay.

208
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,790
Can we trust this?

209
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,840
 - We have to pay it?
 - Of course.

210
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,420
 - We can do that. 
 - This happens a lot.

211
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:32,330
Bo Ah, you must be against building a co-op establishment.

212
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,480
What should I do? Just let this neighborhood get run down?

213
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,770
Of course not.

214
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,890
Since you're asking what I think,

215
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,960
I'll go ahead and tell you.

216
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,210
I believe that our alley

217
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,850
can become a vibrant business district.

218
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,440
We'll make people from other cities come to us.

219
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,990
Then our neighborhood will become lively.

220
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,210
If it's as easy as you say, why wasn't it done already?

221
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,760
Everyone, this is nonsense.

222
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,020
If it was that easy, why don't other neighborhoods—

223
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,020
Guys.

224
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,520
 Community meeting for a new co-op establishment

225
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,210
Try some chicken.

226
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,330
Try some.

227
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,630
Try some.

228
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,340
You know there's a line outside of our chicken joint these days?

229
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,010
Our boss didn't even know how to fry chicken.

230
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,880
Then how did it become a hot restaurant?

231
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,130
That's all thanks to

232
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,600
our Boss's mentor. The Savior of our alley.

233
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,290
It's all thanks to hef Abraham Kang's consulting.

234
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,270
Who are you calling Abraham?

235
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,380
Business owners who need consulting in order to protect our alley.

236
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,260
If you want to become a hot restaurant,

237
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,080
our Chef will provide consultation at no cost.

238
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,920
Who? What? Why me? What?

239
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,100
Kim Gyoo Man, the meat.

240
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,250
Oh Yeong Ho, the ingredients.

241
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,770
They will provide everything at a low cost.

242
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,080
Then, we don't need to worry about the money?

243
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,620
- She mentioned one hundreds or something?
- Be quiet.

244
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,800
You can't talk about things like that here.

245
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,530
I understand that co-op establishments are nice.

246
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,620
I also understand that shopping centers are convenient.

247
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,290
But they can be found anywhere.

248
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,870
But our alley

249
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,850
only exists here.

250
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,730
We want to protect our alley.

251
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,270
So please reconsider before you sign those forms.

252
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Please.

 Community meeting for a new co-op establishment

254
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,230
Bo Ah, nothing stays the same in this world.

255
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,500
Our alley is already outdated.

256
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,950
I explained everything earlier.

257
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,910
We're trying to save our alley our way.

258
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,830
Dad, you're probably doing this for money, but we—

259
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,790
Hold on. Is it bad to make money?

260
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,660
Isn't it a good thing that our neighbors live a good life?

261
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,510
Why are you interfering? What's go great about the chicken joint?

262
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,420
What's so great about the rooftop room?

263
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,100
What it is and means to me,

264
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,970
you didn't even care to find out.

265
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,210
Is this your way of throwing a fit?

266
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,880
No.

267
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
It's up to our neighbors to decide anyway.

268
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,810
Like I said before, I'm just trying to protect what's special to me.

269
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,760
Just as money is important to you, other things are important to me.

270
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,960
Bo Ah! Becoming an adult

271
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,860
requires you to leave behind the world you came from,

272
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,380
not hide, like you're doing.

273
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,950
What is this?

274
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,250
What do you think it is? I'm pouring holy water.

275
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,050
This is my heart and effort.

276
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,010
Aigo.

277
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,590
Don't they normally use mountain spring water

278
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,500
or water from a well?

279
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,820
Spring water is free.

280
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,230
I paid for this,

281
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,030
so it must be better.

282
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,940
Bo Ah, when you tried to ruin my business—

283
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,030
Bo Ah, are you okay?

284
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,770
Something's fishy.

285
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,330
Geez, it's cold.

286
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,190
Boss, it's so cold. Shall we go inside?

287
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,510
Cold, cold, so cold.

288
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,080
Bo Ah, shouldn't you buy more expensive water?

289
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,910
I feel like it has no effect.

290
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,570
I can't hear you. I'm tired.

291
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,790
I worked hard today.

292
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,490
Boss, go sleep.

293
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,530
Geez. Enough with that already.

294
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:19,680
 Bo Ah! Becoming an adult requires you to leave behind the world you came from,

295
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,170
 not hide, like you're doing.

296
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,140
He's not even a great adult.

297
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,380
Trying to lecture me.

298
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,800
 Why are you doing this to me?

299
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,640
 You have to live like a decent human being.

300
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,970
When are you going to stop hiding in the bathhouse, living soullessly?

301
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,600
Bo Ah?

302
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,450
Did I wake you?

303
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,400
Bo Ah, what are you doing?

304
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,560
- Give me your hand. 
- What?

305
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,340
I said, give me your hand. I just want to hold your hand.

306
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:46,230
♫   When I'm feeling down ♫ 
♫ Lucky in my life   ♫

307
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,340
I can't fall asleep.

308
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,300
It was easy to fall asleep when I was leaning on your shoulder last time.

309
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,960
♫   I'm lucky in my dream  ♫

310
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,020
♫   You warmly hug me close   ♫

311
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,120
Why can't you sleep? You must be tired from today.

312
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,390
I know, right?

313
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,030
If, just if...

314
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,730
What if what my dad want's to do is right?

315
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,430
There might be people who would like it if our neighborhood was gentrified.

316
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,550
Do you think we're throwing a tantrum,

317
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,760
like when I was hiding in the bathhouse?

318
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,900
What if I can't do anything right?

319
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,750
When I resigned from my job,

320
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:59,430
everyone looked at me as if I was running away.

321
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:07,800
But I wasn't running. I was being courageous.

322
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,080
Bo Ah, you're not hiding. You're being courageous.

323
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,490
I'm doing well, right?

324
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,570
Bo Ah, you're doing more than well.

325
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,080
♫   I never want to show my tears   ♫

326
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,510
I'm sleepy now.

327
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:44,660
♫   I'm so happy I can cherish memories   ♫

328
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:51,320
♫   of your smile from afar   ♫

329
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,170
Welcome.

330
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,530
- Boss, you wanted a consultation?
 - Yes.

331
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,260
- Hello.
 - Hello.

332
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,700
Here.

333
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,860
How many times do I have to tell you? I'm an Italian chef. What do I know about cold noodles?

334
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:33,750
So what? We're just here to eat. Don't eat if you don't want to.

335
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,250
- Bo Ah, enjoy your meal. 
- You too, Boss.

336
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,340
And it's okay for me to get indigestion?

337
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,450
It's so good.

338
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,190
Daebak. This place is good!

339
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,460
Why aren't they busy? Best cold noodles of my life.

340
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,620
- Really?
 - Believe me or not, I'm getting spicy cold noodles.

341
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:30,090
Who said I wasn't eating? I'm saying I'm not consulting.

342
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,630
What did they do to the noodles?

343
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,140
How is this cold noodles?

344
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,980
Look at this. The noodles, soup, sauce, it's all storebought.

345
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
How is this a cold noodle restaurant?

346
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:18,210
- Hurry up and cook the noodles.
 - Okay.

347
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,530
 - Look at the line. 
 - They must be really good.

348
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,090
 The smell is...

349
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,080
 It must be a really good place.

350
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,320
♫   I like chicken, I like chicken   ♫

351
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,020
♫   I really like chicken   ♫

352
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,950
♫   Fried, spicy, barbeque, soy chicken too   ♫

353
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:03,940
Boss, our new menu is a hit. Everyone says it's good.

354
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,790
That's a relief.

355
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,830
Min Ah said the cold noodle store owner must've spread the word.

356
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,660
A few places called to schedule a consultation.

357
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,870
I'm not doing it.

358
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,690
Boss, what if our alley really becomes a hit?

359
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,560
Shall we make a name?

360
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,410
- Fried chicken for table number three.
 - Okay.

361
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,450
I said no...

362
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,810
 Co-op Establishment Approved

363
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,220
 Do you want to save your business?

364
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,130
Is this okay?

365
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,850
Yes, it is.

366
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,500
Good work.

367
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,000
The co-op establishment was approved?

368
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,960
This just means 80% approved. Nothing is decided.

369
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,830
Still, it means they came together as one.

370
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,290
That is the case...

371
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,610
To be frank, they passed the first stage.

372
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,240
There's still a long way to go. Buying land is different from getting approval signatures.

373
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,580
We did our best.

374
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,700
We still made progress.

375
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,060
A lot of hot restaurants opened. There are quite a few restaurants with long lines.

376
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,770
Our neighbors still signed the consent forms...

377
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,940
to build the co-op establishment and shopping center.

378
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,540
- So Dam.
 - Long time no see.

379
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,590
What are you doing here?

380
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:41,580
I'm not here to see you or because I want to be.

381
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,640
- Then?
 - I came to interview the burger and cold noodle joint.

382
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,460
They both said they received consulting from the jerk chef.

383
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,990
So I came to interview Andrew.

384
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,970
I thought it was odd all the new hot places I wanted to try were near here.

385
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:07,750
What? What's with everyone?

386
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,120
You all live here and are acting clueless.

387
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,460
Isn't there something different about this neighborhood?

388
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,280
Lots of people are coming from afar.

389
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,580
That's true, but it didn't go as well as we planned.

390
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,910
It's still just the start.

391
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,620
The start?

392
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,970
It feels like the start of becoming a popular alley.

393
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,680
Anyway, let me borrow Andrew. Is he here?

394
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,350
If you signed the consent form, you have to sell your land.

395
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,280
The union is already set up, but you won't sell your land. What do you want me to do?

396
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,110
Didn't you say,

397
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:10,430
"I want to build a co-op establishment and hand it down to my children?"

398
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,550
Hello? Hello?

399
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,730
He was smiling ear to ear when she said our street will be popular.

400
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,420
Why the sudden change of attitude?

401
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,220
Bo Ah?

402
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,360
Do you think I'm a bad person?

403
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,700
I don't think I'm a good person either. I'm selfish and greedy.

404
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,480
But what I'm doing for the neighborhood

405
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,140
is not that bad.

406
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,820
That could be the case or not.

407
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,210
I think there's a misunderstanding.

408
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,520
I don't think you're a bad person.

409
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,090
Then?

410
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,210
Just...

411
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,760
someone I don't know well.

412
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:18,500
Honestly, I don't know you enough to hate you.

413
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,540
I didn't get that chance.

414
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,610
I can't support what you do because I believe my method is right.

415
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,510
But since you'll be staying around,

416
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,580
I'll find out...

417
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,670
what kind of person you really are.

418
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,640
I'll be leaving now.

419
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,050
I think he's at some sundae (blood sausage) soup restaurant. He's taking a long time.

420
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,660
Andrew knows how to make sundae soup?

421
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,100
He says he doesn't, but oddly he knows how to make everything.

422
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,230
Oh.

423
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,440
What have you been up to?

424
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,250
I haven't been able to go to the restaurants in front of work,

425
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,430
nor the cafe...

426
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,300
nor the bars in front of work.

427
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,940
That's how I've been living.

428
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,830
- You're that busy?
 - It's complicated.

429
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,190
- You have no idea how annoying you are. 
- What?

430
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:23,040
Anyway, get back to work. You're probably busy opening shop.

431
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,060
Today's my day off.

432
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,430
We gathered to make a counter plan but changed it to a celebratory party.

433
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,560
All of a sudden? Celebrating what?

434
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,670
You said our alley is going to be a hot place.

435
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:09,230
♫   The warm season that I thought would never come into my heart again   ♫

436
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,530
♫   Has come into my arms with you who flew like a butterfly   ♫

437
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:21,530
♫   I have so many questions for you, it’s making me dizzy   ♫

438
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,360
Bo Ah!

439
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:32,220
♫   When your smile that’s whiter than a star spills into my heart   ♫

440
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:39,240
♫   It feels like I’m endlessly walking into your clear melody   ♫

441
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:45,110
♫   Hold my hand, as if it was always us from the beginning   ♫

442
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:50,260
♫   Because you and I, we’re clearly destiny   ♫

443
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,450
Will it take much longer?

444
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,860
No, it'll be done soon.

445
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,490
I'm hungry. I worked hard today.

446
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,940
♫   I’m only getting filled with reasons I like you that are getting countless   ♫

447
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,810
♫   Love love love is shining light   ♫

448
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:14,720
♫   When I’m with you, wherever we are, it’ll be filled with light   ♫

449
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,530
♫   What words are needed when you’re so dazzling by my side?   ♫

450
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:37,280
♫   I have you, who makes me happy, just by looking at you  ♫

451
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,130
♫   Whatever happens, I’ll promise you this   ♫

452
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,350
♫   I’ll never become the source of your tears   ♫

453
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,560
Here.

454
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,420
Are you going to keep doing this?

455
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,860
- What?
 - I clearly told you.

456
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,790
I told you to think about what would happen if we date.

457
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,550
You did.

458
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,690
You don't even care to listen.

459
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,580
Why do you keep following me around?

460
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,610
I told you not to do that. Are you stupid?

461
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,280
Sit down and talk. My neck hurts.

462
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,680
Let's talk. Stop avoiding me.

463
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,980
We're done talking. What else is there to say?

464
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,460
You're the only one who talked.

465
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,770
I'm waiting because I have something to say, but you keep avoiding me.

466
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,360
What is it?

467
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,270
I like you.

468
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,820
You just had to say it with your own mouth.

469
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,510
You told me to think about it, so I did. I like you.

470
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,380
That's not what I meant.

471
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,580
I told you think about what comes after.

472
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,980
If you like me and I like you back, what's next?

473
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,550
It's going to be awkward and uncomfortable.

474
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,970
You know too well. But?

475
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,570
But I still like you.

476
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:53,360
This time you think about it. I'm done thinking.

477
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,610
Do you like me or not?

478
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,580
I'll wait if you need time to think.

479
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:09,130
Stop thinking about what's next. Just think about whether you like me or not.

480
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:14,480
We'll think about what happens next, together.

481
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:05,940
Thank you for your review.

482
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:13,790
Next time you come, I'll give you free french fries.

483
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,150
 Mom you're mistaken. I didn't open my business to make money.

484
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:31,990
 If it's not about money, is it for the reward? Customers happiness?

485
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,860
 Is that what you're trying to say?

486
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,050
 Why can't I do that?

487
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:36,950
 Are you a child?

488
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:42,750
 I really like chicken. I like it when people enjoy the chicken I make.

489
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,860
 I'm going to make it further than you, because I enjoy it.

490
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,450
 I came to tell you this.

491
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,200
He's so immature at that age.

492
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I was wondering who he takes after.

493
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm so tired.

494
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,550
I'm so tired...

495
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,380
Everyone says it's good.

496
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,430
Boss, you like her? Why do you like this clumsy girl?

497
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,300
I'm embarrassed.

498
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,070
Stop it.

499
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,920
What part of her do you like?

500
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,360
Stop! Stop it!

501
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,120
Stop it!

502
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,210
Bo Ah! Don't listen.

503
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,920
What is he doing?

504
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,120
I grilled the meat today.

505
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,040
It was delicious.

506
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,130
It's delicious because the meat is from my store.

507
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,470
But, maybe we are celebrating too soon

508
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,970
So...

509
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:53,450
Today is actually the day the union was established.

510
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,670
This feels like a party for that.

511
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,640
Why would you say something so awful?

512
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,830
Right!

513
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:06,920
you have to make a big deal out of...

514
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,240
the small victories in your life.

515
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,800
I don't know what is going on,

516
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,960
but she said it is going well!

517
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,200
Then, Let's do a toast!

518
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,560
Okay!

519
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,890
Toast!

520
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,100
Cheers!

521
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,340
Cheers!

522
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,110
That's good.

523
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,270
What are you doing?

524
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:43,160
Why are you doing that?

525
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,010
Maybe I will fry some chicken.

526
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,750
I want some chicken!

527
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,530
- Come on! 
 - We can't end with just pork belly.

528
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,150
Those brats.

529
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,470
I said to help clean up.

530
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,580
They just left.

531
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,730
I am happy that everyone left.

532
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:16,250
What the heck? Now you and I have to clean up this mess.

533
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,310
Still...

534
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,760
We are alone now.

535
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,720
It's not over yet, right?

536
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,000
I doubt it.

537
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,730
It's not like my dad gave up yet.

538
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,840
♫   I’m getting a strange energy   ♫

539
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,410
Business won't boom overnight.

540
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,450
Still, everything should turn out okay, right?

541
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,970
♫   I don’t really know myself either   ♫

542
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,780
We'll make it turn out okay.

543
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,060
♫   There’s no rule against success so I’m not afraid   ♫

544
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,360
Get up now. Let's clean up and go inside.

545
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,460
It's cold.

546
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:20,150
♫   I want to follow the sound of my burning heartbeat   ♫

547
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:25,400
♫   and live again   ♫

548
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,940
♫   I’ll be here for dreaming, put away the maps   ♫

549
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,180
Are you warm now?

550
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,480
Can we stay a bit longer?

551
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,980
♫   I’ll don’t cry for my life ♫
 ♫ The world couldn't recognize my talent   ♫

552
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,460
Fine, then.

553
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,630
♫   How thrilling would it be   ♫

554
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,710
It feels nice sitting like this.

555
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,430
♫   watch over me   ♫

556
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,160
Right?

557
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,960
♫   I’ll be here for dreaming   ♫

558
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,360
 Some time has passed since that day...

559
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,410
 and spring has come.

560
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:22,420
What piece of work did you think I'd recommend that led you to wait?

561
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,640
I'm sorry.

562
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,270
If I get another chance, I want to try my best.

563
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,620
You're in luck.

564
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,250
Do you know the writer Malsharata?

565
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,330
Yes. He's a famous story writer.

566
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,520
He's looking for an artist for his new book.

567
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,350
Multiple people have already submitted their work,

568
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:04,090
but Malsharata makes the final decision.

569
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:08,750
What do you think? Will you give it a try?

570
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,630
Of course. I'll give it a try.

571
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:18,750
 That spring, someone was standing in the same place

572
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,270
 fulfilling his dream.

573
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,190
Wait up.

574
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,350
Bae Ki Beom.

575
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,620
What?

576
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,570
You take care of the kitchen starting today.

577
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,870
What? Why me?

578
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,190
What about you?

579
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,870
It's because I can't leave you in charge of the hall.

580
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,680
Lately, Seo Bo Ah doesn't get in until the afternoon.

581
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,450
Aren't you more nervous leaving him in charge of the kitchen?

582
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,760
It's where knives and fire are used.

583
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,890
No need to worry.

584
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:52,900
He belongs in the kitchen. He's faking that he sucks so he can slack off.

585
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,970
No... I'm not.

586
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:59,300
If you place him in the kitchen, he can cover the role of one person.

587
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,250
He can't even cover half a person's role in the hall.

588
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,010
And here.

589
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,910
What is this?

590
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,120
 Resignation

591
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,020
Andrew?

592
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,820
Now that I quit, you call me by the right name.

593
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,960
This is all too sudden...

594
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,730
There's nothing more for me to do here.

595
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,840
Choi Go, you know more about chicken than I do.

596
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,250
 That spring someone decided to leave his nest.

597
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,960
Andrew!

598
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,590
What are you going to do now?

599
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,430
No need to worry. I won't open a chicken joint nearby.

600
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:56,980
What?

601
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,770
I'm going to open my own store. Right in front.

602
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,950
A restaurant?

603
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,850
You're going to cook and run the business yourself?

604
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:26,030
Yes. So find me a good spot.

605
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,830
Will you really be okay?

606
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,570
How do you think I'd be?

607
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,690
You've tried my meal sets. How do you think it'll go?

608
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:39,870
Of course, the taste is good.

609
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:46,290
But the visual is a bit lacking to sell.

610
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:51,290
That's more than enough. I have my plans.

611
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,480
What are you going to do?

612
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,890
Are you free tonight? I'll show you if you're curious.

613
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,230
Okay.

614
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,020
Why are all the lights off?

615
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,780
- I can't see.
 - I can't see.

616
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,780
The foods going to go in my nose. Where's the fork?

617
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,630
- That's not it.
 - Geez.

618
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,790
I found it.

619
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:16,900
Hey!

620
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,330
That's my foot.

621
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,890
Why is your foot there?

622
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,400
Just shut up and eat it.

623
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,400
It's not there. Where did it go?

624
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,060
What is this?

625
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,460
I think this is it.

626
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,850
To my mouth...

627
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,750
Wait...

628
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,690
It almost went in my nose.

629
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,030
I found it.

630
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,690
How is it?

631
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,310
I said, how is it?

632
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,760
What?

633
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,630
Is it bad?

634
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,640
This is insane. Unbelievable!

635
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,530
It is really delicious!

636
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:00,680
It's even more delicious with my eyes closed.

637
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,600
You scared me.

638
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,030
Eat up.

639
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,110
It's not just for looks.

640
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,650
I told you.

641
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,110
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

642
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,780
A blind restaurant?

643
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,010
Like the movie "Overtime"?

644
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,480
Yes, it will be dark so he doesn't have to plate the food nicely,

645
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,880
It just has to taste good.

646
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,360
Then, when it opens, let's go on a date there.

647
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,200
Sounds good.

648
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,400
How did the meeting go with the webtoon editor?

649
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,470
Mom?

650
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,910
Can I get fried chicken?

651
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,610
What?

652
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:06,380
I was thinking, I had fried chicken she made for me...

653
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,270
but I never had chicken that you made.

654
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,730
So I am here to try some.

655
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,240
It tastes good.

656
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,190
You are not tired?

657
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:35,810
Isn't it obvious? Of course, I am.

658
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,830
But I realized how much I enjoy the work.

659
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,070
What?

660
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:48,850
As a restaurant employee, I didn't know, but the customers recognized my efforts.

661
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:53,580
I now understand why you wanted to do this.

662
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:01,270
I... put my restaurant up for sale.

663
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,560
You did what?

664
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,170
Don't get the wrong idea.

665
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,970
I am still not saying yes,

666
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:15,320
but I won't be as tough as I have been.

667
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:22,220
 That spring, a burst of understanding grew within her.

668
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,920
Do you know what your brother has been up to lately?

669
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,210
Not really. Why all of a sudden?

670
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:37,730
I have a feeling he has a girlfriend.

671
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:40,480
I tried to ask him, but he won't talk.

672
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,990
I swear. I really don't know.

673
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,210
Both of you are hiding something from me, huh?

674
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,600
No! we wouldn't.

675
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,180
I really don't know.

676
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,930
  And these two bravely

677
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:02,480
  took a step forward into spring

678
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,260
The service is not as nice lately, don't you think?

679
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,180
Really? I think it's the same.

680
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:13,270
No. Whenever I came here before, he gave me food on the house.

681
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,920
But not anymore.

682
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,650
Drink your wine.

683
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:25,220

Why are you laughing?

687
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,780
How pretty.

 From webtoon artist Seo Bo Ah. Episode one attached.

695
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,410
Boss, I am too scared to open it.

696
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,110
Why? You said you were confident this time.

697
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,870
You worked hard on it.

698
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,340
I did...

699
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,390
but what if there is a chance...

700
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,740
I didn't make it?

701
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,390
Then, do you want me to look at it for you

702
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:52,320
 This is Seo Bo Ah. Here is Episode 2 of my webtoon.

703
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,610
Did you check it?

704
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,900
What is it? Did I get it?

705
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,410
Well...

706
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:04,070
What? I didn't get it?

707
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,150
You are joking with me, right?

708
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,690
I said not to joke about this kind of stuff.

709
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,770
 I am sorry but I am afraid you have not been selected for Malchallatte's project

710
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,760
  We hope to work with you in the future. We wish you the best.

711
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,160
Are you okay?

712
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,160
How could I be okay?

713
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,990
  I also, have made no progress.

714
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:02,290
Will you fry me some chicken?

715
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,210
Why all of a sudden?

716
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,890
To have with my beer.

717
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,910
I will show them.

718
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:17,690
I will draw something so awesome, they won't be able to say no.

719
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,710
That's right, Bo Ah. You can send them another one that is really good.

720
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,960
♫  What is this all about?  ♫

721
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,660
What are you saying? I won't send it to that place again.

722
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,590
What?

723
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:36,070
I am going to become totally famous

724
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:40,760
and only work for their competition.  I will make sure

725
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,160
that portal service will go down.

I am so sad.

729
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,200
♫  Without a word, like magic, you colored my heart  ♫

730
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,870
  I still have a long way to go, to learn how to live life properly...

Are you sad?

735
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:20,710

  No matter how often I fall,

741
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:41,750
  I will brush it off and start again.

742
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,730
  I know how to do that now.
