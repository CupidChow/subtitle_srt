1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,190
  Best Chicken

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,640
 Park Sun Ho

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,570
 Kim So Hye

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,570
 Joo Woo Jae

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,970

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,130
You seem like a lot of fun.

7
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,200
What?

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,790
I didn't seem to realize it... I missed you.

9
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,490
Are the two dating again?

10
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,250
No, I don't think so.

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,460
Right.

12
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,730
Sorry. You know I'm like this.

13
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,510
I'm not supposed to suddenly do this.

14
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,750
Are you married?

15
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,320
Or are you seeing someone?

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,170
You're still the same.

17
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,950
Not yet, huh? That's good.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,950
How did you come here? And why?

19
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,830
This is a chicken place. I came to eat chicken.

20
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,520
But it looks like you've closed.

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,780
Should we go somewhere for a drink?

22
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,130
We're meeting for the first time in five years.

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,430
If you don't have important things to discuss, I'll leave.

24
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,600
Why? It looks like you have a lot to say to me.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,870
I'm curious about you too.

26
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,490
Let's go.

27
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,960
What are you curious about after suddenly showing up?

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,820
So prickly.

29
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,740
I know, it's sudden.

30
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,660
I didn't know I'd see you here either.

31
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,540
But I really just came for the chicken.

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,190
Aren't you being needlessly cold?

33
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,630
I'll be back later. To eat chicken.

34
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,690
 Real Estate

35
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,390
 Are the two dating again?

36
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,320
Yes!

37
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,010
Yes!

38
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,560
You can't even do that, stupid.

39
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,050
Oh, yes! Bo Ah's paying for lunch. What should we eat?

40
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,150
How about mixed food with spicy rice cake, pork blood sausage and fried veggies?

41
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,480
Hey, Bo Ah is rich nowadays. Something else!

42
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,890
Why can't I even do this properly?

43
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,280
I'm so angry!

44
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,830
Why the overreaction?

45
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
What's with her?

46
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,360
Yes, Bo Ah could be having a hard time.

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,510
The customers at the chicken place haven't let up for four days straight.

48
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,370
Because of who?

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Because of Artist Seo Bo Ah, Miss.

50
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,690
So...

51
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,200
So you're saying the chain of dominoes you worked so hard to stack has collapsed in a single moment.

52
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,020
I need to find out what my boss is thinking.

53
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,780
Even a carefully crafted tower can fall.

54
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,050
Boss, wake up.

55
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,480
Get up, boss.

56
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,750
What is it, Bo Ah?

57
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,230
Why are you still sleeping?

58
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,130
Since the store is closed today, I'm resting too.

59
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,560
Just because the store is closed, does that mean you can rest?

60
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,220
You need to broaden your contacts on your off day,

61
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,490
to gain know-how for business.

62
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,880
Know-how for business? From who?

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,750
From your seniors. Your seniors in the business.

64
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,610
Bo Ah. Is that the guy who tried to--

65
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,230
We have a physical reaction to outsiders, so...

66
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,950
There might've been a small misunderstanding.

67
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:18,660
But since you've become one of the people in the neighborhood. Let us forget the past

68
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,890
Now, a round of welcoming applause!

69
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,080
What's that?

70
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,320
We're here today to go after our own self interest and food.

71
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,000
That's why it's shortened to SF Young Adult Business Association.

72
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,150
The young adults conducting business in this corner of the neighborhood can come together in spirit

73
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,080
and think about how to further the industry.

74
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,590
We just meet up and drink.

75
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,680
For that reason...

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,480
it's coming out.

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,920
For the success of the chicken place's bossâ€”

78
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,190
No. I mean, in welcoming him to the neighborhood,

79
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,430
- let's all do one shot! 
 - One shot!

80
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,710
But, why aren't you drinking, Bo Ah?

81
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,180
I am taking some traditional herbal medicine nowadays.

82
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,490
Medicine? Are you sick?

83
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,550
Don't pressure someone who won't drink. Let's drink by ourselves.

84
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,520
My name is Oh Yeong Ho, the son of the neighborhood grocer.

85
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm Kim Gyoo Man. I run the butcher's.

86
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,710
I'm Hwang Min Ah.

87
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,870
As you know, I'm the granddaughter of the realtor.

88
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,690
Now that we introduced ourselves,

89
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,520
as a commemoration, let us down it all.

90
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,490
One shot!

91
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,740
Two, four, three!

92
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,030
The alcohol is going down.

93
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,250
Why is alcohol alcohol?

94
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,620
It's because it goes down so smoothly. That's why.

95
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,970
But what happens if he's really strong with alcohol?

96
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,690
Hey, we're the ones with the big lead in people.

97
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,150
We're going against him 4 to 1. How will he resist?

98
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,150
With my four years of experience in the real estate industry

99
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,600
I narrowed down the questions to find out the weaknesses of the business owner.

100
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,580
We're going to self-destruct with your boss.

101
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,130
You have to ask all the questions there.

102
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,330
I will not play that game.

103
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,730
Boss, are you okay?

104
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:22,370
Oh, Bo Ah! I'm fine, but are you alright?

105
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,150
For a while now, you were all shaky, Ms. Bo Ah.

106
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,480
I'm so dizzy.

107
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,740
Don't throw up! You'll sober up.

108
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,170
Then you'll be more miserable.

109
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,490
Here, drink this.

110
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,890
Thank you, Bo Ah.

111
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,010
Bo Ah, isn't this soju?

112
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,980
I think you're still not drunk yet, Boss.

113
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,200
Here. Take some more.

114
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,910
Yeah, just like that.

115
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,580
It tastes like water, too.

116
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,960
Boss, are you the type to completely black out about the day after you get drunk?

117
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,930
Bo Ah, I'm not drunk!

118
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,330
Look. When you fry a chicken

119
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,560
- the legs, thighs, wings. 
 - Yes I know. I know. For sure you're not drunk now.

120
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,980
So not now, but when you drink really a lot,

121
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,730
do you black out? 
 - I don't remember when I drank that much.

122
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,910
Look now.

123
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,090
Chicken leg, thigh, wing, and breast.

124
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,580
Oh, and chicken feet.

125
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,050
He is definitely drunk.

126
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,350
Boss, I have a few questions for you.

127
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,180
Okay!

128
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,770
How much is in your bank account?

129
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,620
- How much was it again? 
 - You don't remember?

130
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,780
Then, you're parents' jobs?

131
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,250
Are they high-income earners?

132
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,240
Do they help you when you're in need?

133
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,190
Do you have any loans, boss?

134
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,950
So... my parents' loans?

135
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,510
No.

136
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,050
Enough of that. You're ex-girlfriend from earlier.

137
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,690
How long have you guys been dating? Were you two really close?

138
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,720
To the extent that you'd hug when you've already broken up with her?

139
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,390
So Dam?

140
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,250
So Dam? or Dae Dam (a wordplay on small, "so," vs. big "dam")

141
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,890
What kind of man isn't careful so that when he's hugged, he gets hugged.

142
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,000
- Are you that kind of person boss?
 - Pardon?

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,620
Never mind. Just answer my questions.

144
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,840
We met for about... three years.

145
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,210
- You met for a long time. 
 - She was my senior at school.

146
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,900
I had a difficult time after we broke up, to be honest.

147
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,930
She broke up with me you know. A big, big break up.

148
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,060
Wow, she broke up with you?

149
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,240
So, now that you hugged her, do you like want to go out with her and stuff?

150
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,190
Do you also want to place too much significance on your first love like others, Boss?

151
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,020
What do you mean?

152
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,750
First love is just someone you love for the first time.

153
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,490
Really?

154
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,080
That girl is special

155
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,160
not because she's my first love.

156
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,610
It's because she enabled me to be the person I am now.

157
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,050
- What?
 - I learned from that girl,

158
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,390
whenever you're tired, get some chicken and beer

159
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,960
and relax that way.

160
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,630
That's the way adults heal.

161
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,250
Starting from then, I fell in love.

162
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,640
With a chicken and me.

163
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,490
Love.

164
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,500
Are you kidding me? You didn't even ask the chicken.

165
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,420
That stuff is one-sided love!

166
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,870
Are you angry, Bo Ah?

167
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,300
Let's drink.

168
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,870
What? Special?

169
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,550
I became like this because of their tug of war of love?

170
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,550
I'm going to destroy that chicken store.

171
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,680
Wow my stomach is burning.

172
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,000
When did I come down? I don't remember at all.

173
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,340
I think the order has been sent to the wrong place.

174
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,170
What did you say?

175
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,680
No. I'll eat this. This chop suey stew. How much is it?

176
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,090
I ordered it.

177
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,440
No matter how difficult one's position is,

178
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,830
how can you take the chop suey that someone else ordered?

179
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,140
I think you really covet other people's things, Boss.

180
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,080
Bo Ah? Sorry, but can I have some of the soup?

181
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,560
I'm not feeling well.

182
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,300
What did you say?

183
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,900
Never mind.

184
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,730
Now I'm starting to feel better.

185
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,660
- Your first love must have never taught you about curing hangovers. 
 - What?

186
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,880
Why are the customers so...

187
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,910
What's up, Boss? Did you just come out of a drunken stupor?

188
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,530
I had something yesterday.

189
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,490
We still have some time until we open, right?

190
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,930
- Yeah, about an hour. 
 - Then I'll go take a 30-minute nap.

191
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,490
I drank so much alcohol yesterday,  I'm exhausted.

192
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,510
Welcome, customer!

193
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,080
Please come this way.

194
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,280
What are you doing?

195
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,300
No, the customers have been waiting for so long. You're going to nap, in this situation?

196
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,330
But still, Bo Ah. It's before opening time.

197
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,140
That's why? That's why I'm here before my start time, too.

198
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,980
What are you doing? Go take orders.

199
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,020
Then I'll come down later, in time for when I start work.

200
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,860
I'd like to order, please.

201
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,160
Yes. Coming.

202
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,610
This is Refreshing Bath, Barun Chicken.

203
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,570
Excuse me? Flyer?

204
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,690
I fry with the heart of a mother. Refreshing Bath, Barun Chicken.

205
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:19,150
The special thing about that girl is not that she's the first love, but because she made me who I am today.

206
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,290
So annoying. I shouldn't have asked.

207
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,650
I think not knowing is better.

208
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,940
I really want to go there.

209
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:41,130
I ate there. It tastes terrible. Don't ever come here.

210
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,320
It's not that it tastes bad, to be honest.

211
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,250
Well, a troller comment has to be based on truth for it to be convincing.

212
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,720
How can I post a creative evil comment properly?

213
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,890
I had high expectations because you said it was good but it was so so.

214
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,730
Then I guess it's not worth waiting in line for.

215
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,590
What?

216
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,660
That's not how it should be.

217
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,250
Let's not cut them down based on taste. This chicken place is quite good.

218
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,820
This cannot be refuted.

219
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,230
I'm won't acknowledge it. I'm the one who experienced it and said it was just okay. Who are you to cut me down?

220
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,620
Not acknowledging it?! Is this jerk's tongue dysfunctional?

221
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,060
I'm still a chicken quality inspector!

222
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,970
Are you sure you've really eaten it?

223
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,250
I'm what you'd call a true chicken sommelier. Your taste buds are the ones that are weird.

224
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,330
What the hell. You an employee?

225
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,670
Bo Ah! Bo Ah!

226
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,370
What? Is that the boss?

227
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,060
Why's he in a fuss?

228
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,870
What is this?

229
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,210
What the heck am I doing, and for whose benefit?

230
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,890
What is it? We have a while until opening time.

231
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,840
Did you see this?

232
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,120
I was wondering why we got so many customers all of a sudden.

233
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,260
But that's all because of your flyers.

234
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,270
- Ah, well... 
 - Did you already know?

235
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,060
Your flyers got popular on the internet.

236
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,630
Yeah, I guess they did. People really...

237
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,640
You knew all along, yet you didn't show it off. I didn't even know about your well-intentioned consideration.

238
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,920
Thank you, Bo Ah.

239
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,300
I didn't listen to you. I also suddenly changed the draft of the flyers.

240
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,990
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

241
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,150
But, why aren't you happy?

242
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,520
No, I'm happy. Hurray. Can't you see me being happy?

243
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,500
But, I have better news than this.

244
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,790
Tada!

245
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,620
What is this?

246
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,580
We just got a call and

247
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,370
they asked who drew the chicken flyers.

248
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,500
Why?

249
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,540
Why do you think? It's because your cartoons are fun.

250
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,110
They asked if you wanted to work on a webtoon for their website.

251
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,820
Create a webtoon? Seriously? Me?

252
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,070
Yes. It's great,  isn't it?

253
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,590
It's the person in charge's number. So call it.

254
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,690
But Bo Ah,

255
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,500
is there something going on?

256
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,220
I'll get to work when it's time.

257
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,810
I'll see you later.

258
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,480
Sunbae. What's going on?

259
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,550
Today we're dating. By Seo Bo Ah.

260
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,430
By Seo Bo Ah

261
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,490
You said you'd edit my manuscript,

262
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:32,090
so that's why I gave it to you. 
 - That's why I commented on it.

263
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,920
Exactly.

264
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,020
You said that it was terrible. There's nothing that can be salvaged. You told me to draw it again.

265
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,200
Sunbae, the new work that you were starting off

266
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,570
it's exactly the same.
 - So?

267
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,790
Are you saying that I copied you or something?

268
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,020
That...
 - Yeah, the premise could have overlapped.

269
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,130
The characters are a bit similar.

270
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,660
But... there's something called quality.

271
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,000
You saw it yourself.

272
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,620
If yours is about here,

273
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,500
mine is up there.

274
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,520
How is that plagiarism?

275
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,020
It's still plagiarism. You thought of it after looking at mine.

276
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,360
Watch your mouth.

277
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,520
If I hear that you go around saying useless things, I won't be just sitting still.

278
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,890
If you and I were to face off, who do you think would support you?

279
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,620
How can you do this to me?

280
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,940
If you don't want to be framed as a liar or scammer, just shut up and sit still.

281
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,870
If even a speck of dirt ends up on me,

282
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,790
I'll be sure that you're completely blacklisted from this field.

283
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,890
Anyway, those people

284
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:40,790
will change their mind, once they find out I was the one who drew the flyers.

285
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,570
Thank you, have a good day.

286
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,650
- I'll bring you in, how many people? 
 - Two.

287
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,710
I'm here alone. I can just sit in an empty seat, right?

288
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:38,380
I'm so conflicted already. Why's that lady here again!

289
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,510
Strange.

290
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,620
What's good here?

291
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,110
Everything.

292
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,970
That's a relief. Then I'll take everything.

293
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,440
- Excuse me? 
 - I said to give me everything on the menu.

294
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,940
Excuse me, did you not see the line outside?

295
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,180
If you order several whole chickens by yourself, what about the others?

296
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,530
Our chicken place has a chicken limit per person per order, you know!

297
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,030
One person can only have one chicken.

298
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:35,230
Since when did we...

299
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,940
Then, I'll take one half seasoned and half fried. Is that okay?

300
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,740
Table 2 will have half seasoned, half fried.

301
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,190
Why did that lady come here again?
 - How the hell would I know?

302
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,550
It isn't the right time for Boss Park to date. He needs to focus on us.

303
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,560
- Right?
 - Of course.

304
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,320
If a chef's mind goes somewhere else, it affects the food.

305
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,130
Additionally, Owner Park has barely reached the walking stage in cooking.

306
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,760
Owner Park, outside there's... 
 - Yes?

307
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,260
Never mind. Forget it.

308
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,950
Don't have any distracting thoughts and just fry the chicken.

309
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,350
Why? Is there something wrong with the chicken?

310
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,080
Enjoy.

311
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,120
Excuse me?

312
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,610
Did you ask for me, customer?

313
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,300
Is it possible to talk with the boss right now?

314
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,490
It won't take that long.

315
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,220
I'm sorry, customer. He's quite deep into the business.

316
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,970
Boss is so busy frying chicken, that he doesn't have time to even mend the netâ€”(orders come flooding so fast there's no time to mend the net)
 - Today's chicken is all sold out.

317
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,300
You saw this on TV, right?

318
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,640
"Yum Yum, Slurp Slurp." Its the best food TV show these days

319
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,330
 Food show contract

320
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,060
Could our restaurant be on this show?

321
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,500
Yes. I said last time...

322
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,720
I really just came for the chicken.

323
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,150
The chicken is good, and the atmosphere is good.

324
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,740
More than that, because of your flyers it's a hot place these days.

325
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,260
I really hope you can come on our show.

326
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,460
If you agree, a camera team will visit without notice.

327
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,050
It could be tomorrow or in a month.

328
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,520
We will not go.

329
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,880
Sorry, but  I am speaking with the owner aboutâ€”

330
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,870
Then cut it short.

331
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,260
We won't go, no, we can't go.

332
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,710
Mr Park, you can get up. There's no need to listen to this.

333
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,880
- Hold on, Albert. 
 - It's Andrew!

334
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,910
- How many times do I need to tell youâ€” 
 - Why?

335
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,480
Why can't you come on our show? Everyone else is begging to be on our show.

336
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,530
Do you think this opportunity comes easily?

337
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,120
- Hold on. Calm down, both of you.
 - There's a situation at this restaurant.

338
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,650
What would an outsider know?

339
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,590
Because the chicken is delicious, we want to let other people know.

340
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,270
Why do you have so many situations when you're not even the owner.

341
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,810
If you had good chicken today, then you were lucky.

342
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,820
Excuse me?

343
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,550
We found out today during business hours that for the past few days the chicken taste isn't always the same.

344
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:44,410
We got more orders suddenly, so maybe the seasoning wasn't done correctly, or

345
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,050
anything else could be the problem.

346
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:50,740
Oh! No wonder.

347
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,780
I saw a comment online saying our chicken was just okay.

348
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,150
It was someone's review.

349
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,860
That is so disgraceful.

350
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,550
Don't tell me. You season the chicken here?

351
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,500
You don't buy the pre-seasoned ones?

352
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,790
Of course. This is a chicken place with Andrew Kang as the chef.

353
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,050
Then how will you handle a load of customers?

354
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,770
Don't tell me. You do everything by yourself here?

355
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:21,670
Like cutting up the chicken and making the sauce?

356
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:27,400
Yeah. At first, we bought the pre-made ones, but then we confirmed that the taste was different.

357
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,190
- Even if it is a little hardâ€” 
 - It's not just a little hard!

358
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,430
Even though you can get by now,

359
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:37,030
do you have the confidence to continue like this for the next two or three years?

360
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,060
See? There's already a problem here.

361
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,860
This is good.

362
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,030
As you come on the show, change your whole system.

363
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:57,050
From what I know, there are many places that make the seasoning according to your specifications.

364
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,370
Speaking logically, cutting up and spicing the chicken will be consistent if you have it done this way.

365
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,380
Speaking logically, cutting up and spicing the chicken will be consistent if you have it done this way.

366
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,660
- It's more comfortable, too. 
 - Real cooking is uncomfortable.

367
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,240
You only have heard of these strange cooking concepts...

368
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,150
For how long are you going to keep listening to her nonsense? We can't properly handle the customers that came today.

369
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,070
How can we go on the show?

370
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,070
Are you really not coming on our show?

371
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,130
Being featured on our show

372
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,050
Is like receiving validation as a chicken restaurant.

373
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,440
You decide. You're the boss.

374
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,460
Yeah, you decide.

375
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,920
Since you're the boss.

376
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,760
 So, you may or may not go on the show?

377
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,550
Yeah. There was just a lot of fuss. The final decision wasn't made.

378
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,060
Ah, this is a big deal.

379
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,400
If you appear once on that show, you'll get customers from around the country for at least a month.

380
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,870
- Really? 
 - Yes!

381
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,910
If you have proper answers to half of my questions I would be able to come up with something.

382
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:19,180
My boss was so drunk that he couldn't speak properly.

383
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,670
Ah, did we give him too much? But, what do you think?

384
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,470
Which way do you think your boss's decision is leaning toward?

385
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,400
I don't know. It's all up to Boss.

386
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,630
What is this, Seo Bo Ah? Do you understand the gravity of the situation?

387
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,540
If you go on the show,

388
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,290
Forget all about being a cafe owner or whatever.

389
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,460
I know that.

390
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,890
Whenever I try hard, something just pops up and things go the other way.

391
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,070
I think business is getting better because of me.

392
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:57,760
These days I think maybe I should be praying or something.

393
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,350
What? These days you haven't been praying?

394
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,880
Huh?

395
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,810
- Oh yes, it didn't seem like it was working. 
 - Ah, Hey!

396
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:12,440
You shouldn't skip one day.  When you do that, it's to show devotion.

397
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,230
First, get some water and do a prayer. Then come to the office.

398
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,070
Okay, I'll be right there.

399
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,540
Is that really something to be concerned about?

400
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,610
You didn't leave yet? Do you know what time it is?

401
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,180
I was waiting until you got off work.

402
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,210
But no matter how much I waited, you never came out.

403
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:07,150
I wanted to talk about us, not just work. Without any distractions.

404
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,170
I thought I wouldn't be welcomed if I came here.

405
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,350
So...

406
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,170
I prepared this.

407
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,690
You really are yourself.

408
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:35,410
Of course, I am. I wouldn't change.

409
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,810
But what about you? Please tell me.

410
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,050
How did you become a chicken restaurant owner?

411
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,440
I thought you would go to a nice company

412
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,520
and live normally.

413
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,650
I just love chicken.

414
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,240
You came to like it because of me.

415
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,920
So becoming the boss,

416
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,960
I played a part in that.

417
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,920
What are you trying to say?

418
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,080
I just like it.

419
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,940
A lot of time has passed.

420
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,860
My traces are still left with you.

421
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,400
You must be comfortable with me.

422
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,090
What?

423
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,540
What's with this atmosphere?

424
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,860
They aren't really getting back together, are they?

425
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:57,040
I didn't just date you jokingly.

426
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,410
So even now,

427
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,250
I am uncomfortable with you.

428
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,420
I think of the past when we're together.

429
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,150
I can't behave like all that was nothing

430
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,690
the way you do.

431
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,250
 Can you tell me a reason?

432
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,440
 There is no reason.

433
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:34,600
 Does that make any sense? We've been seeing each other for three years and suddenly we're breaking up.

434
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,250
 Do you really want to know? I don't want to hurt you.

435
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,490
 You are now

436
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,380
 like a finished book to me.

437
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,220
 I read it so much that

438
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,750
 I know the exact pages that the mistakes come out on.

439
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,980
 You're a book I know like that.

440
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,060
 I even

441
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,940
 know how you react to things or what you'll say.

442
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,110
 Meeting you

443
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:12,690
 doesn't make me excited or have fun anymore.

444
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,450
You...

445
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,260
are still really angry me, right?

446
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,500
- This isn't angerâ€” 
- But,

447
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,390
you know what?

448
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,600
What angers me is that

449
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,110
I still have feelings for you.

450
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,840
I understand that you are mad at me.

451
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,680
You need time to let it subside.

452
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,880
I can receive all that,

453
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,080
like you did with me before.

454
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,830
- So Dam, Iâ€” 
 - I didn't know either until we met coincidentally

455
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,050
that I still have feelings for you.

456
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,900
So let's get backâ€”

457
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,800
Boss!

458
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,710
Bo Ah, you weren't asleep yet?

459
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,120
- Quickly, come upstairs. 
 - Excuse me?

460
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,690
Do you live here with that person?

461
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,430
Why aren't you coming upstairs?

462
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:46,950
Wait! We aren't done talking.

463
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,040
â™«   A star has fallen   â™«

464
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,710
â™« into my restless heart  â™«

465
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:01,060
â™«   It keeps digging in and twinkling.   â™«

466
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,310
I'm sorry. Let's talk another time.

467
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,640
â™«   Awakening my lurking dream, Iâ€™ve come forth to the world   â™«

468
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,210
â™«   I donâ€™t really know myself either   â™«

469
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,970
â™«   No one knows what will happen   â™«

470
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,660
â™«  Thereâ€™s no rule against success   â™«

471
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,380
â™«   So Iâ€™m not afraid   â™«

472
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,410
You dropped it here?

473
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,880
You even flushed it down?

474
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,580
Then what do we do?

475
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,680
We can't do much about it.

476
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,060
It's just that maybe you would have somehow memorized the number.

477
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:44,830
I don't remember it though.

478
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,770
Is that so? It just means that it wasn't meant to be.

479
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,830
- We can't do that 
 - Huh?

480
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,400
It's something you want to do. The opportunity is right in front of you.

481
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,860
How can you just give up

482
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,410
â™«   How thrilling would it be   â™«

483
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,390
â™«   Till then   â™«

484
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,470
What do we do? I really don't remember it.

485
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,090
It's actually not that big of a deal.

486
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,100
Not everything now can be the way I want it.

487
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,280
Boss, I'm here.

488
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,820
â™«   Hardships pass just like the common cold   â™«

489
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,680
â™«   pass into nothing when it fades   â™«

490
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,960
â™«   No need to walk backwards   â™«

491
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,680
â™«    I'm surprised at myself too   â™«

492
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,630
â™«   my strong heart

493
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,110
I'm really speechless.

494
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,670
â™«  My rising dreams have given me strength   â™«

495
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,220
â™«   Even though I sweat   â™«

496
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,520
Bo Ah, when did you come?

497
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,360
Just now.

498
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,340
Did you spend all night thinking of these?

499
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,260
Yes. I'm sure that there was definitely a 3 and a 2.

500
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,460
Were you able to think of any numbers?

501
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,920
Do you always treat everyone this nicely?

502
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,570
What?

503
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,210
- Hello?
 Ah, yes.

504
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,560
Just a moment.

505
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,020
What about the delivery today?

506
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,500
Just a moment.

507
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,310
Please, can you repeat that? What time?

508
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,010
Four o'clock? That's too late, though.

509
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,560
Then today we'll sort it out ourselves. From tomorrow you can deliver on time, right?

510
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,950
Alright.

511
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,360
Bo Ah. Bo Ah.

512
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,020
- What? 
 - I found it.

513
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,860
What?

514
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,320
This is it, right?

515
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,050
It seems like it

516
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,020
- Try calling them. 
 - What?

517
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,630
We have to open soon. I can call them when I go up later.

518
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,060
Quickly.

519
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,170
  Realtor

520
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:11,330
Mr Kim! It's been a really long time.

521
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,560
What brings you by?

522
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,770
- Please, I would like to  put my shop up. 
 - Huh?

523
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:24,370
Why would you put up a business that is doing so well?

524
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:29,230
The thing is, it's killing me. I can't go on working like this.

525
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:35,800
Oh dear. It seems like your business only looked like it was doing well?

526
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,360
Yes.

527
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,600
Oh, Yes.

528
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,760
I understand.

529
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,350
I'll think about it and then I'll give you a call.

530
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,370
Okay.

531
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,350
What did they say?

532
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,570
I should work on my portfolio. Then I should come in next week.

533
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:04,360
Ah, so what are you going to do next?

534
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,620
If my work gets a good response, I'll get the job. If not, I won't.

535
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,960
That's how it is normally.

536
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,790
Normally.

537
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,200
Bo Ah, what are you doing?

538
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,920
I'm getting ready to open. It's what I normally do. Why the reaction?

539
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,760
Is that what is important right now? I'll take care of the shop.

540
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,880
Go upstairs right now and prepare your portfolio.

541
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,550
It's alright. I don't have that much of a chance.

542
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,510
But still, thank you.

543
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,780
Thanks to you I had a good dream, even if it was brief.

544
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,190
Why are you giving up  before you properly try anything?

545
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,220
Why do you keep giving me false hope?

546
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,660
Thinking about that, they said they want a scary webtoon.

547
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,830
I can't write that well.

548
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,720
I can't watch scary movies. How can I write a scary webtoon?

549
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,640
They didn't want anything other than the scary webtoon?

550
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,870
Webtoons are divided into genres and days of the week.

551
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,320
The webtoon that finished this time was a scary series.

552
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,170
So they are looking for one to replace it.

553
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:15,280
They saw the poster and said it was strangely scary.

554
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,220
- That's about right. 
- What?

555
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,560
Those people are experts.

556
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,640
They must have felt something from you. Isn't that why they contacted you?

557
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,170
I also felt that that poster was pretty scary.

558
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:32,250
Boss, look. The purpose of that wasâ€”

559
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,430
Anyway, these days there are so many customers. What will you do if I'm not here?

560
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,180
I told you not to worry about the store.

561
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,600
I was already thinking of hiring another part-timer.

562
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,650
Why all of a sudden?

563
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,260
- Is it because... 
 - I kept thinking about it.

564
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,950
- I'm going to go on the show. 
 - What?

565
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,270
Oliver will soon clock in. At that time, I'll tell you both together.

566
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:02,020
Oliver is to Twist (Oliver Twist), My name is Andrew Kang.

567
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,920
Ah.

568
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,700
What are you going to tell us? Don't tell me.

569
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,220
You're going to go on the show?

570
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,150
It's true that it's a good opportunity. I want people to know

571
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,700
that our restaurant's chicken is delicious.

572
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,050
So you're going to use chicken made by someone else

573
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,260
and go on-air to make money easily? Something like that?

574
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,180
No. We'll make the chicken ourselves the way we've been doing.

575
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,730
What will you do about the customers that come in masses? We can't even handle them right now

576
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:36,620
First, I'm thinking of hiring another person.

577
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,620
Is that the solution you came up with after thinking all night?

578
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,960
Also, I'm going to narrow the menu down to only fried chicken

579
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,270
for the present.

580
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:49,280
- What? 
 - Fried chicken only?

581
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,210
Honestly, if we go by your recipe, the seasoned chicken, and the soy sauce chicken

582
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,800
take too long to prepare and the ingredients are expensive too.

583
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,620
Let's be known for our fried chicken first.

584
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,660
Then we can slowly add items back to the menu.

585
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,240
What do you think?

586
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,480
Are you sure you can handle it? There are definitely some customers that like the other items.

587
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,640
Rather than having many things on the menu,

588
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,520
it's better to have only one item that we make well.

589
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:22,830
Well if you think that way,

590
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,940
let's prepare to open.

591
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,810
Yes, Chef.

592
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:41,780
- The texture isâ€” 
 - Hello. 
 - Mr Park!

593
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,750
Wow.

594
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,120
Why are you buying so much?

595
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,540
Our vegetable delivery guy said he couldn't make the delivery today because something came up.

596
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,810
If something comes up for the vendor every day,

597
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,520
it would be nice.

598
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,730
Right.

599
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,170
I need to hire another part-timer.

600
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:06,930
In this neighborhood is there a hard worker who you can recommend?

601
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,830
A hard worker?

602
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,890
There is.

603
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,520
A perfect part-timer.

604
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,720
- Why did you call for me? 
 - Oh, you're here

605
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,370
- Come on, come on. 
 - Why else? Yesterday you missed our appointment.

606
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,310
Sit.

607
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,270
Have this.

608
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:50,120
- Bo Ah, this brother did something for your sake today. 
 - What did you do?

609
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,080
Your boss said he wanted to hire another part-timer and he asked me for recommendations.

610
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,670
So I recommended an amazing person.

611
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:02,760
Business owners of our neighborhood's nightmare

612
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,680
whose name is also the part-timer from hell.

613
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,460
Bae Ki Beom.

614
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,620
What about him?

615
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,550
- You don't know about him? 
 - Heyâ€”

616
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,070
She's never hired a part-timer before.

617
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:20,080
Anyway, he's a lazy punk and all he can do is talk.

618
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,530
Your boss will waste money on him and will also go through a lot.

619
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,840
Who knows.

620
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,740
- Before he receives his first paycheck, the restaurant might be out of business.  
 - What?

621
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:36,400
That suddenly? That place had a line out the door all week.

622
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,490
You all know the indoor cart bar over there, right?

623
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:42,800
Not long ago Mr Kim came to us to put the place up for sale

624
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,560
Why? We went there a few times, but couldn't get in.

625
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,000
There were so many customers. Why sell that?

626
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,820
He had his reasons.

627
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:58,440
Did you guys hear of a bomb exploding?

628
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,640
- A bomb exploding? 
 - Yeah.

629
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,890
What that meansâ€”

630
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:05,410
Let's just not do it.

631
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:11,040
You didn't even let me explain it. This is a sure way.

632
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,510
You guys have done enough for me, so its enough.

633
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,800
From now on I'll take care of it myself.

634
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,610
We're done here, right?

635
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,030
Then I have to go to work so I'll be going first.

636
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,760
- I'm off. 
 - Ahâ€”

637
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,720
What's with her today?

638
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,430
She lost the drive to fight

639
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,870
because winning looks so gloomy.

640
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,650
Our pitiful Bo Ah.

641
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:07,980
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

642
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,260
Hello everyone, I'm the new part-timer, Bae Ki Beom.

643
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,280
I'm the boss here.

644
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,920
This is our chef Anâ€”

645
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,500
Anderson.

646
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,520
  Andrew Kang

647
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,010
- I'm Andrew Kang.
 - Ah.

648
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,520
It's Andrew.

649
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,480
And this is your senior part-timer, Seo Bo Ah.

650
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,550
I look forward to working with you. I'll work very hard.

651
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,200
You're just full of talk.

652
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,780
Excuse me?

653
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,520
It's nothing.

654
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:55,350
On that note, shall we open for the day?

655
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:00,830
 Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken

656
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:07,040
- Here is your chicken.
 - Thank you.

657
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,240
Where did the new part-timer go? We're so busy right now

658
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,630
I'm sorry.

659
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:28,150
I'm here doing a guerrilla cam for "Yum Yum Slurp Slurp."

660
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:33,860
Today's store is a chicken place, Refreshing Bath: Barun Chicken.

661
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,030
How can you decide to film so suddenly like this?

662
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:40,230
You're the owner, right? Could you please introduce the store to us?

663
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:44,030
An introduction about the restaurant?

664
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,520
Our chicken place is a chicken place.

665
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,870
It's really delicious.

666
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,390
When the camera comes in to film, you can start.

667
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,970
This is our restaurant's secret.

668
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,300
You can't film this! Ma'am.

669
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,620
Cut.

670
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:29,910
We'll take it from the top. Less awkward this time.

671
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,000
Owner Park, try to do your best since we're doing it.

672
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,610
Are you saying this predicament is because of me?

673
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,050
Th-Then is it because of me?

674
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:43,340
Geez. Your fortune isn't one that's suitable for television.

675
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,110
Let's go again.

676
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:47,380
How are you going to do it this time?

677
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,370
I will block it here.

678
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,880
What, why? Are you alone?

679
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,190
Sit.

680
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:15,410
Why did you come today of all days? Those things over there are making me so busy.

681
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:19,180
The new part-timer is so creative at using his time to dally.

682
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,860
I can't even glimpse him.

683
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,790
Hey, what do you want to eat?

684
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:27,590
One whole fried chicken and a fresh beer.

685
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,110
Okay. But the chicken might take awhile.

686
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:32,920
As you can see, the kitchen is... the way it is.

687
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,350
The plan seems to have gone the way it should. Do you think it'll be okay?

688
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,900
Bo Ah said not to send any terrorist threats.

689
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,050
Don't you know her personality?

690
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,670
She seems like she's quite prickly,

691
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,980
but she's actually a softie.

692
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,920
She can't push through when it counts.

693
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,430
Yeah, she seemed quite small unlike her usual self over there.

694
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,620
My heart really did ache for her.

695
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,980
So, let's not drag this on any longer.

696
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:44,470
Quickly, most certainly. End this.

697
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:47,680
If there's a crazy bitch needed in this neighborhood, let me be her.

698
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,780
She's my friend, right?

699
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,550
Hello?

700
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,000
You're the police station, right?

701
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:25,930
What? Why haven't you drunk the beer at all.

702
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,230
Are you Kim Gyoo Man?

703
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,520
Did you cut your beard?

704
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,430
Are you Yong Man?

705
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,290
Are you Kim Gyoo Man's younger cousin Kim Yong Man?

706
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,930
Yes.

707
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,210
How old are you? You're still a high schooler, right? 
 (Legal drinking age in Korea is 19.)

708
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,110
I'm a  first year in secondary school.

709
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:55,770
You. You little. Your head's not even dry yet. Get up quickly.

710
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:59,370
Don't you see that we're on air? How could you have no fear?

711
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:05,070
I'm from the local police station.

712
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,300
What brings you here?

713
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:14,120
There's been a report that alcohol has been served to a minor.

714
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,520
Please cooperate with the investigation.

715
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,030
Pardon?

716
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,930
Noona, what do I do?

717
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,990

718
01:01:56,230 --> 01:02:00,670
â™«  Will you be   â™«

719
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:05,040
â™«  my one and only universe?   â™«

720
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:13,410
â™«   a pretty flower that resembles you 
 Can bloom the cracks of my heart   â™«

721
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,750
 The Best Chicken

722
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,560
It's my resignation.

723
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,260
Aren't you being too much?

724
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,700
Because of me, you guys.

725
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,520
Boss.

726
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,920
It's okay, Bo Ah.

727
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,120
What do you mean it's okay?

728
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,390
I caught you. You're dead!

729
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,970
The three of you do not have clear criminal intent.

730
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:37,710
There could be a true villain.

731
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,550
Bo Ah, what are you doing?

732
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,580
You need to sleep. Look at the time.

733
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:48,620
â™«  The darkness leaves as I dream of your eyes more blinding than jewels  â™«

734
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:53,070
â™«  Iâ€™ll hang you like a star   â™«

735
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:57,650
â™«  in the sky of my heart  â™«

736
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:06,770
â™«  Sweet days and nights, I only want to look at the heavenly you  â™«

737
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,560
â™«  Baby I have a crush on you  â™«

738
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:14,000
â™«  Will you be   â™«

739
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,490
â™«  my one and only universe?  â™«

740
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:27,060
â™«   So a pretty flower that resembles you
Can bloom the cracks of my heart   â™«

741
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:31,630

742
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:35,700

01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:53,960
â™«  Will you follow the clock hands   â™«

747
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,330

748
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:06,790
â™«  Into this picturesque scene where your breath touches

749
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:17,290
â™«  Into this picturesque scene where your breath touches
 Into our own time  â™«
