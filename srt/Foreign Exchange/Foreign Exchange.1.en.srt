1
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,685
Have you traveled the world?

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,022
As for me, I have.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,088
I travel every week.

4
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,241
I visit different countries.

5
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,570
Jackpot!

6
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,240
I've been to a lot of places
because of my work.

7
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:36,202
Australia, Spain, USA, and Japan.

8
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,380
Just to be clear,
I'm not a pilot.

9
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,633
I'm not part
of the cabin crew either.

10
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,773
But I travel the world
because of my work.

11
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,526
I have a lot of international clients.

12
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,696
I feel like I'm traveling for free.

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,867
Not only that,
I have pocket money too.

14
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,294
Babe.

15
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,548
I hope I got the right size for you.

16
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,842
It's the perfect size, babe.

17
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,135
You're the best.

18
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,681
Anything for you, babe.

19
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,055
I miss you.

20
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,144
Wow!

21
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,655
You even gave me shoes,
and cash too!

22
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,648
Look!

23
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:15,629
Now, I don't know where
to store these.

24
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,535
- Babe.
- Wait.

25
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,620
What's that?

26
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,956
I don't remember giving that to you.

27
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,666
Oh!

28
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,085
That's nothing.

29
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,337
I bought it.

30
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,005
I forgot to put it away.

31
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,131
Oh.

32
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,717
Did you hear what I said earlier?

33
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:38,843
What?

34
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,095
You really don't miss me?

35
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,472
Just kidding.

36
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,015
Of course, I heard it.

37
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,850
Of course...

38
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,644
I miss you too, babe.

39
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,563
If you were here, I'd already
have my way with you.

40
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,276
What's taking you
so long to come here?

41
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:56,945
Uh...

42
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,698
I'm just completing some requirements.

43
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,950
Uh...

44
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,452
I also want to join you, babe.

45
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,954
Then make it up to me.

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,915
I wanna see you.

47
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,251
Down, please.

48
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,752
Yes, ma'am.

49
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,339
Let me see you too.

50
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:53,854
You feel so good, babe.

51
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:05,819
Oops.

52
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:07,147
Sorry.

53
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:08,548
I have to go now.

54
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,893
I still have an online meeting.

55
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,229
Talk to you again later.

56
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,023
- Bye.
- Okay.

57
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,107
Bye for now.

58
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,265
So, is it pink?

59
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,871
Excuse me?

60
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,831
I mean...

61
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,292
Pink suits you.

62
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,003
I've been looking at you for a while.

63
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,539
It's like I fell in love
at first sight with you, miss.

64
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,634
Can I...

65
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,681
You jerk!

66
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,683
How rude! Pervert!

67
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:46,255
I’ll let you take care of this documents.

68
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:48,479
- You do what I’ve said to you.
- Yes Ma’am.

69
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,270
Please have a seat.

70
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,296
Thank you.

71
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,366
Ma'am.

72
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,036
Um...

73
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,247
Ma'am?

74
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,918
Here are my requirements, ma'am.

75
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,682
Oh!

76
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,858
So, you're going to the UK?

77
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,412
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,317
It's been a long time
dream of mine to go there.

79
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,791
- I see.
- What about you, ma'am?

80
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,317
Have you been to the UK?

81
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,705
We're fully booked.

82
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,749
We can't accommodate you anymore.

83
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,585
Just look for another agency.

84
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,545
Ma'am, wait.

85
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,716
Ma'am, about yesterday...

86
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,552
I didn't really mean to do that.

87
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm really sorry.

88
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,807
I thought you were
my blind date.

89
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,626
Is that how you do it?

90
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,145
You touch without consent?

91
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,608
Oh, come on, ma'am beautiful.

92
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,653
You can't be mad at me, ma'am.

93
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,571
Your beauty will be ruined.

94
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,951
If you don't want me
to file a blotter against you,

95
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,180
get out of my sight.

96
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,054
Madam.

97
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:17,657
You're the only
hard worker I've seen

98
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,282
who doesn't have
calluses on their hands.

99
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,560
It's so soft.

100
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,145
Press harder.

101
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,358
There. Are you okay
with the pressure?

102
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,153
Madam, I learned this in Thailand.

103
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,704
Mia, it's you.

104
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,498
This is Rommel.

105
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,877
I saw his requirements.

106
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,632
You're the one I'll assign to
process his application to...

107
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,552
Where are you headed again?

108
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,723
To United Kingdom, my lady.

109
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,728
Ma'am, I'm fully loaded this week.

110
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,855
Maybe a different agent
can process his application.

111
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,316
Ma'am... What now?

112
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:15,156
As far as I remember, I'm the one
delegating the work here.

113
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,241
- Not you.
- Right.

114
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,368
Okay, ma'am.

115
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,710
So, I'll go to Ms. Grumpy first.

116
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,923
Later, I'll massage your back.

117
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,925
You better.

118
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,520
Good morning!

119
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,385
Give me your printed bank statement.

120
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,612
Smile first.

121
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,821
Then I'll give it to you.

122
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,159
Are you going to
hand it over,

123
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,141
or I won't process your application?

124
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,330
Come on, lighten up!

125
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,581
Here.

126
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,386
Okay, five business days.

127
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,222
- What?
- Come back here for the update.

128
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,808
Five? That's a long time.

129
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,894
You might miss me!

130
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:41,867
Well... thank you
very much, Ms. Grum...

131
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,661
Mia.

132
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,113
See you in five days.

133
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,261
Mia, are you okay?

134
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,779
Do you want me
to process his application?

135
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,311
It looks like that client
is gonna be a headache.

136
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,937
I'm okay, Gio.

137
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,564
Thank you.

138
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:33,254
Asshole!

139
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
Miss Mia!

140
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,843
Miss Mia!

141
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,679
What happened to you?

142
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,100
- What happened?
- That jerk...

143
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,981
Your foot is bleeding.

144
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,315
I'll treat it.

145
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:00,616
Let's go.

146
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,033
Are you okay?

147
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,827
Slowly.

148
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,455
This will sting.

149
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:14,633
Oh, sorry.

150
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,087
Let me clean this up.

151
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,800
What were you doing anyways?

152
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,764
You're pretty, but...

153
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,725
you might get tetanus.

154
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,737
I didn't lock the gate.

155
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,114
You take care of it.

156
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,784
You can stay here.

157
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,078
I live alone anyways.

158
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,107
We were together
for two years.

159
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,382
But he left me for someone
he recently just met.

160
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,512
[sighs] I knew it.

161
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,848
Love life.

162
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,564
He's so stupid.

163
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,660
That's why he didn't want me
to look at his phone.

164
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,616
He was cheating on me.

165
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,914
It's a good thing
Gadoy was nice to me.

166
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,334
But I had a hunch.

167
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,132
Two years...

168
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,553
Two years...

169
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,893
He's such a jerk!

170
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,856
I can't believe him...

171
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,948
Don't cry.

172
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,285
This is all my fault...

173
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,377
It's okay.

174
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,872
Ten missed calls? Really?

175
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:58,148
I'm sorry, babe.

176
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,250
Come on.

177
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,710
This doesn't happen often.

178
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,380
I fell asleep, okay?

179
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,465
I didn't set the alarm.

180
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,509
We have a schedule!

181
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:10,761
It's 8 AM here,

182
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,388
and 8 PM there.

183
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,056
Is that so hard to remember?

184
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,767
Babe, I'm just tired.

185
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,769
I was doing some errands.

186
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,730
I filed my final requirements.

187
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,775
I'm almost done, babe.

188
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,111
Really?

189
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,113
Yes.

190
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,281
Why didn't you say so?

191
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,950
Okay. Forgiven.

192
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,078
You know, I'm practicing my English.

193
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:37,955
Look.

194
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,832
Do I make you horny?

195
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,292
That's British accent.

196
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,627
Do it in an American accent.

197
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,379
Of course, of course.

198
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,631
Um, so...

199
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,259
My naughty New Yorker.

200
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,386
Undress now.

201
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Yeah, babe.

202
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:35,919
Shit.

203
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,070
Yes, babe.

204
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:52,822
Yeah.

205
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:53,935
You like it? Huh?

206
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,224
Sorry.

207
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,476
Wait.

208
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,019
Mia, wait!

209
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,412
Uh...

210
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,961
The mode of payment.

211
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,380
It can be done online, right?

212
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,675
Yes.

213
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,093
Do you have e-cash?

214
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,430
Here.

215
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,605
I've sent it.

216
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,443
It's okay with me, Mia.

217
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,714
Okay, thank you.

218
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,825
- I'll just contact you–
- No, what I mean is...

219
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,009
About us.

220
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,485
What happened to us.

221
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,043
Don't be embarrassed, it's okay.

222
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,175
It's okay for me, I promise.

223
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,683
Okay.

224
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,310
I'll go ahead.

225
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,728
I won't be staying long.

226
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,150
Update me about
the status on my application.

227
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,238
Okay.

228
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,740
Alright.

229
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,462
What was that guy talking about?

230
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,507
Nothing.

231
00:23:04,823 --> 00:23:06,676
There's something
suspicious about him.

232
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,306
He's a good person, Gio.

233
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,474
Don't worry.

234
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,880
Anybody home?

235
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,757
Anybody home?

236
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,842
Who is it?

237
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,678
Sir Rommel?

238
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,599
Miss Mia.

239
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,477
You dropped this at the office.

240
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,312
Thank you.

241
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,980
I've been looking
for this for ages!

242
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,941
Come in.

243
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,277
No, it's okay.
I just wanted to drop that off.

244
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,488
I still have a lot of
work to do at the office.

245
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,780
Lunch break?

246
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:51,865
Yet you're still working?

247
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,494
I got some food delivered.

248
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,037
Join me.

249
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,247
Come on.

250
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,874
Okay.

251
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,379
Feel at home.

252
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,048
Come on. Sit here.

253
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,553
Your house is beautiful.

254
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,347
Different themes.

255
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,389
Well...

256
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:18,934
I just noticed now.

257
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,395
Oh, I like to travel.

258
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:28,693
So, when I like a design for
a place I've been to, I copy it.

259
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,697
You've been to a
lot of countries, right?

260
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,033
Kind of.

261
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,117
So many expenses.

262
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,495
What's your job?

263
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,664
Uh...

264
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,208
Freelance model.

265
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:49,881
That's the reason why I can
travel to different countries.

266
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,509
Hmm...

267
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,844
Why UK?

268
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,557
Come on. Sit here.

269
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,435
Why UK?

270
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,111
Uh, I've been dreaming of
going there for a long time.

271
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:09,450
Even back when my parents
were still alive.

272
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,445
There are a lot of modeling gigs there.

273
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,365
So, I really want to go there.

274
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,368
I'm taking advantage of my youth.

275
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,331
Because, you know,
modeling has an expiration.

276
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,750
I suppose so.

277
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,044
We're the same.

278
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,755
I've lost both my parents too.

279
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,051
When my mom died
because of an illness,

280
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,012
my dad followed her.

281
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,805
So, here I am...

282
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,226
Testing out my luck
here in Manila.

283
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,162
Don't you have any plans
of going abroad?

284
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,901
My dream is simple.

285
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,279
I just want to be happy.

286
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,533
What kind of dream is that?

287
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,785
Everyone wants to be happy.

288
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,164
Are you happy?

289
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,875
Of course.

290
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,002
Look at me.

291
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,048
I can buy whatever I want.

292
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,966
I can eat delicious food.

293
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,344
I can pay my rent.

294
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,387
See?

295
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,849
All of these...

296
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,393
You only dreamed of
this before, right?

297
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,313
Did that make you happy?

298
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:39,282
You can get everything,
everything you want in this world.

299
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,453
But that doesn't mean
you'll be happy.

300
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,958
What if I get lucky in the UK?

301
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,919
And become content there?

302
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,296
The question is...

303
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,923
Will your application pass?

304
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,635
Okay.

305
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,595
How about this?

306
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:05,809
You'll help me get
my UK visa approved.

307
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,270
Then, in return,

308
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,816
I'll make you happy.

309
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,361
Can you do that?

310
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,530
Yes, of course.

311
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,781
Trust me.

312
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,462
No, I'll do it.

313
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,134
Finish this all, okay?

314
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,767
It's delicious.

315
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,739
Water.

316
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,525
Look at your report!
My goodness!

317
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:38,384
You keep repeating
the same mistakes!

318
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,487
Geez!

319
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:52,165
Give madam a massage,
she's so cranky.

320
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,083
Give madam a massage,
she's so cranky.

321
00:29:54,573 --> 00:30:01,049
Show her this instead.

322
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,802
Show her this instead.

323
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,844
[Rommel sent a photo]

324
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,055
Don't stare at it too long.
You might get worked up.

325
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,360
This laing you cooked
is pretty good.

326
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,112
- That's adobo.
- Oh.

327
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,906
Just kidding.

328
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,074
But it's delicious.

329
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,951
Of course, I cooked it.

330
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,039
You know, it's the first time
someone has cooked for me.

331
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,458
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

332
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,420
I usually just order fast food
since my mom passed away.

333
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,634
Really?

334
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,762
Maybe you're just flattering me,

335
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,848
that's why you're saying that.

336
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,600
I've been alone for a long time.

337
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,187
Are you happy?

338
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,607
Hmm...

339
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,527
Yes.

340
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,654
- How about you?
- Really?

341
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:10,118
Mhm, of course, I make you happy.

342
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,542
Oh, no, let me.

343
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,627
No.

344
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,468
Thank you.

345
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:40,533
For what?

346
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,601
I've never felt this before.

347
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,396
Are you a virgin?

348
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,107
I'm serious.

349
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,328
I've never been in a
relationship like this.

350
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,408
I've met a lot of women,

351
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,578
mostly foreigners.

352
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,289
But nothing happened.

353
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,763
It's really different
when it's a Filipina.

354
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,652
Maybe all you needed
was a Filipina.

355
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,467
No, you're different, Mia.

356
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,394
Why don't you come
with me to the UK?

357
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,800
Once my visa gets approved...

358
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:34,515
Let's go there.

359
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,945
Why are you in a rush?

360
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,700
Nothing will happen to us here.

361
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,244
Mia, let's go to the UK instead.

362
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,123
Let's migrate there.

363
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,918
I know some people
who can help us.

364
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,171
What you want is too risky.

365
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,007
And I don't have money to go there.

366
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,427
If money is your problem...

367
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,472
Don't think about it.
I'll take care of it.

368
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,182
I have money.

369
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,267
I can support you.

370
00:37:15,587 --> 00:37:17,235
I love you, Mia.

371
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,113
Let's go to the UK.

372
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,411
I love you too, Rommel.

373
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,565
I love you.

374
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,846
Congrats, sir!

375
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,374
Here's your visa.

376
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,800
And I hope you'll
enjoy there, okay?

377
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:52,853
Next time, you should bring me!

378
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,938
Just kidding.

379
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,148
Next time, if you need someone
to process your papers,

380
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,817
- just look for me.
- Okay.

381
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,403
I'll process it for you.

382
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,935
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

383
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,247
Hey, you seem to be
in a good mood.

384
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,666
It's nothing, I had a nice sleep.

385
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,464
Your boyfriend?

386
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,094
Rommel, right?
Isn't he your client?

387
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,097
That's fast.

388
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,994
Didn't you just
break up with your ex?

389
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,769
It's like you're just changing...

390
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,064
Are you my dad?

391
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,745
Is your opinion important
in my personal life?

392
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,739
Because as far as I know,
we're just office mates.

393
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,991
So you better know your place.

394
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,290
Shit! What do I do?

395
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,815
Thank you.

396
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,193
Are you serious?

397
00:40:46,899 --> 00:40:48,061
Hailey, I'm sorry.

398
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,447
Please.

399
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,323
No!

400
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,575
This can't be!

401
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,052
I spent a lot of money on you.

402
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,037
And you suddenly want
to break up with me?

403
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:59,582
Hailey, I explained it to you already.

404
00:41:00,016 --> 00:41:02,310
- You know–
- How about the visa application?

405
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,298
No way!

406
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,091
Don't tell me that's not true?

407
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,178
Hailey, please forgive me.

408
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,762
Please.

409
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,180
You fooled me!

410
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,556
You're a user!

411
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,017
You led me on!

412
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,727
I'll pay you back for everything.

413
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,604
For everything you sent me.

414
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,147
I promise.

415
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,065
It's that easy for you?

416
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,736
You really think
I'll be okay if you pay me?

417
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,196
What am I?

418
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,739
A lending company?

419
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,741
I hate you, Rommel!

420
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,159
I hate you!

421
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:42,708
Don't cry.

422
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:47,480
You know what, love?

423
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,645
It's my first time.

424
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:53,017
Five of my clients got their
visas approved at the same time.

425
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:55,962
That's why I'm confident that
even your visa will be approved.

426
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,350
And of course, I'm going to
file my own application soon.

427
00:42:03,726 --> 00:42:06,312
Hey, are you listening?

428
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,650
Yes, love.

429
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:11,470
I've been talking here,
and you don't seem to be listening.

430
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,780
I heard it.

431
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,573
That's a good idea.

432
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,456
You see?

433
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,750
You're not listening.

434
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,836
Sorry, love.

435
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,632
I'm just a little tired
from my modeling gig last night.

436
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,223
Who's texting you?

437
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,808
Your phone keeps ringing non-stop.

438
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,643
Uh...

439
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,772
It's a... credit card agent.

440
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,776
I promised him
that I'll get it today.

441
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,611
That's why they keep messaging me.

442
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,655
Don't worry about it.

443
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,831
You know what, love?

444
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,167
You know, you should...

445
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,337
Your boss should be
giving you a bonus.

446
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,591
Or maybe your clients
could give you tips.

447
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,846
So that your efforts
won't be wasted.

448
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,866
Mia, where were you
during lunchtime yesterday?

449
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,701
Why?

450
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,453
Were you with your boyfriend?

451
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,247
- No.
- Oh, right.

452
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,125
He was with another girl.

453
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,752
What?

454
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,087
He was with another girl.

455
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,089
Fair-skinned.

456
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,217
You know, you're so malicious.

457
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,511
I'm just saying what I saw.

458
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,930
How would you know?
Maybe they're friends.

459
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,515
Rommel is a model.

460
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,102
And he works
with a lot of women.

461
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,106
The girl was even crying.

462
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,275
They're like a couple fighting.

463
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,610
You know what?

464
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,737
I appreciated you at first.

465
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,238
Because you're kind.

466
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,908
But it's just a show.

467
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,702
Let's be straight, Gio.

468
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,288
I know you've liked me for a long time.

469
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,457
That's why you're slandering Rommel.

470
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,209
Are you that desperate?

471
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,669
Huh?

472
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,754
But I'm sorry.

473
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:38,425
Because even if I'm single,
I will never want to date you.

474
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,477
Love.

475
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,854
I'm here.

476
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,359
Love.

477
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,254
Love.

478
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,049
- What?
- Someone's calling you.

479
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,384
What?

480
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,927
Someone's calling.

481
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,011
Let me.

482
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,555
I'll answer.

483
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,518
Hello, bro.

484
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,770
Okay, okay.

485
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,148
Thank you. Sure, later.

486
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,156
You have a gig?

487
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,158
Yes, baby.

488
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,135
Friend, but it's an unknown number.

489
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:10,309
Ah, his cellphone is new.

490
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,519
That's why I haven't saved
his number yet.

491
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,108
Can I join you at your gig?

492
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,356
So that I can meet your friends.

493
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,697
Oh, babe...

494
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,450
My pictorials take a long time.

495
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:27,993
You might get bored.

496
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,787
I'll wait for you.

497
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,249
Are you okay?

498
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,834
Why are you so grumpy?

499
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,921
I'm okay.

500
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,963
Just tired.

501
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,673
Are you sure?

502
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:45,969
Okay.

503
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,471
There's food in the refrigerator.

504
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,389
Go ahead, and eat.

505
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,683
I'll go to my room first.

506
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,589
Hey!

507
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,179
Shit!

508
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,473
Shit! My money!

509
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,984
Damn it.

510
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,431
That bastard stole everything!

511
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,245
Shit. That was my last money.

512
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:55,747
But it still got stolen.

513
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,660
Why are you looking
at me like that?

514
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,931
Why did you bring so much money?

515
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,521
I borrowed money from my cousin,

516
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,607
when I tried to
start a business.

517
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,234
I was supposed to pay her.

518
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,445
She needs cash.

519
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,156
Then do more of your side hustles.

520
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:31,058
You have a lot of gigs, right?

521
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,618
Seriously?

522
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,162
I don't get a lot of gigs nowadays.

523
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,083
And one more thing,

524
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,253
I might not be able to get it back.

525
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,550
[sighs] Shit.

526
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,462
Hello, Hailey?

527
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,883
The money I was supposed
to pay you with got snatched.

528
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,259
No way!

529
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,084
Are you scamming me again?

530
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:34,888
Don't worry.

531
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,307
I'll find a way.

532
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,603
Just give me a few more days.

533
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,989
Okay?

534
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,229
I'm really sorry.

535
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,360
You don't have to do that, you know.

536
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,849
You know how to pay me in kind.

537
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:08,993
This is the last one.

538
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,652
I'll just finish this.

539
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,591
Mia?

540
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,013
My love!

541
00:50:58,038 --> 00:51:00,207
I missed you!

542
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:01,908
- Haruhi!
- I just came here.

543
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:02,934
From the airport.

544
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,854
I thought you were
going to follow me to Japan.

545
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,373
How did you get in?

546
00:51:07,706 --> 00:51:10,000
Oh, your helper.

547
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,401
She let me in.

548
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,833
Sir Rommel, do you
need anything else?

549
00:51:20,074 --> 00:51:21,303
Love...

550
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,829
Don't call me "love"!

551
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,873
You fooled me!

552
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:26,475
You're a cheater!

553
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,628
If I didn't pretend
to be your maid,

554
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,963
to your Japanese lover,

555
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:35,415
I wouldn't know
that you're fooling me.

556
00:51:37,578 --> 00:51:38,746
So, it's true.

557
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,389
What I've been hearing is true.

558
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,144
I even defended you!

559
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,178
It's true that you
have another girlfriend.

560
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,236
Not just one.

561
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,533
What?

562
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,329
The one who kept
calling me the other day.

563
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,541
That was a different girl.

564
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,669
There's a lot of them.

565
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,798
All foreigners.

566
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,635
You dated all of us
at the same time?

567
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,011
Did you?

568
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,096
No, no.

569
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:22,372
They're not my girlfriends.

570
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,975
They're not my girlfriends.

571
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,936
They're my clients
in my real job.

572
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,691
I'm not a model, Mia.

573
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,778
I'm a paid escort.

574
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,866
What? What?

575
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,660
- What?
- That's the truth, Mia.

576
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,787
Why?

577
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,872
Love.

578
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,206
Please forgive me.

579
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:52,336
Rommel, how could you
do this to me?

580
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,546
I'm sorry.

581
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,218
Why?

582
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,304
Love, please. Please forgive me.

583
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,474
Love, please.

584
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,739
Love, please don't leave me.

585
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,061
Love.

586
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,353
Love!

587
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,606
Love!

588
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,233
Love!

589
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,330
Mia, are you okay?

590
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,207
You've been really quiet.

591
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,794
Don't be sad.

592
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,379
I'm here for you.

593
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,393
- Stop it.
- I'll take care of you.

594
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:04,968
Stop it!

595
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,261
I said, stop!

596
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,345
Stop it!

597
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,639
Gio! Stop!

598
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,765
Gio!

599
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,809
Gio!

600
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,537
Gio!

601
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,698
Hey! You bastard!

602
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,493
Are you okay, Mia?

603
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,136
Let's go.

604
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,648
It's a good thing

605
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,277
you came right away.

606
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,488
If it wasn't for you,

607
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,533
Gio could've done
something much worse.

608
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,244
That bastard.

609
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,705
I'll report him to the police.

610
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,336
Are you okay?

611
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,547
Thank you.

612
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,096
Uh, Mia...

613
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,682
Do you remember what I told you?

614
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,601
The money that was snatched from me?

615
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,313
The money you were supposed
to use to pay your debt?

616
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,570
No.

617
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,701
I was supposed to pay
my Fil-Am client.

618
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,373
For her to stop pestering me.

619
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,665
Because I asked a lot
of money from her.

620
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,571
So that I could survive every day.

621
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,105
And for my visa application.

622
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,683
Mia.

623
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,794
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you the whole truth.

624
00:57:22,255 --> 00:57:24,113
I was afraid to tell you.

625
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:29,529
Because you were so happy
when we were together.

626
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:33,384
And I was afraid
you'd get mad at me.

627
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:42,208
But I hurt you more
because I lied to you.

628
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,508
I was selfish.

629
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,763
I used my clients.

630
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,348
I fooled them.

631
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:03,062
I promised I would marry them,
so I could get out of the Philippines.

632
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,732
I planned everything.

633
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,026
But when you came,

634
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,738
you changed me.

635
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,993
Mia, give me a chance.

636
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,370
Let's start over.

637
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:25,502
I will fix myself,
so I can be worthy of you.

638
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,719
I was broken, when you came.

639
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,891
But you accepted me wholeheartedly.

640
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,818
So I'll accept you wholeheartedly,
even if you're not perfect.

641
00:58:50,803 --> 00:58:53,821
You didn't fulfill my
dream of being happy...

642
00:58:55,389 --> 00:58:56,950
But you made me feel complete.

643
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,704
That's why I won't let you go.

644
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,625
Thank you.

645
00:59:06,831 --> 00:59:07,832
Thank you.

646
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,882
No more lies.

647
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,999
No more secrets.

648
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,139
No more leaving.

649
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,934
Promise?

650
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,518
Promise.

651
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:28,940
I promise, love.

652
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:45,785
I thought of a way so you can
pay Hailey, and Haruhi.

653
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:49,931
Don't worry about it.

654
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,958
I'll take care of it.

655
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:56,610
Didn't we just promise
that we won't leave each other?

656
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,717
So, let me do it.

657
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,761
How?

658
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,075
Love, I'm sorry.

659
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:39,936
You had to do this so
that we could repay them.

660
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,116
This was my idea.

661
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,752
So, you don't have to apologize.

662
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,545
I love you.

663
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,353
So no matter what,

664
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,375
wherever you want to go,

665
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,205
I won't leave you.

666
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,045
Really?

667
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:07,254
Anywhere?

668
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,522
You seem happy.

669
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:30,611
Love! Congratulations to us!

670
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,656
Congrats to you.
You did well in the interview.

671
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,286
Of course, I used my time as
an agent in the travel agency.

672
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:43,833
You know, it's a good thing I listened
to you about applying for a cruise ship.

673
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:49,922
You're always going along
with what I want.

674
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,427
At least, we don't have
to be illegal immigrants there.

675
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,570
We have a job already.

676
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,281
We'll even be able
to ride a cruise ship, love!

677
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,303
- I'm excited.
- You're excited?

678
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,728
- Yes.
- We can do this, okay?

679
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,105
Yes.

680
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,566
Hailey?

681
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,397
She still won't stop
pestering you?
