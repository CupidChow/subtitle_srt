Not me.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,460
He asked me

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,820
to kill the entire Lin family!

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,500

that your heart is burning now?

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,180
Did you do something
to the incense sticks?

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,660
That's right.

21

Come clean.

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,120
Why did you kill the entire Lin family?

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,620
Cao Fang and I

27
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,100
were imperial guards.

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,140
After we left the palace,

29
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,820
your grandfather took us in.

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,300
Cao Fang

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,820
was tasked with guarding
the Lin's residence,

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,020
while I

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,180
was brought by your grandfather

34
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,260
to the Blood Sacrifice Gang he founded.

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,980
Blood Sacrifice Gang

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,220
was founded by my grandfather?

37
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,260
Exactly. He was highly skilled
in martial arts

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,980
and established the Blood Sacrifice Gang

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,740
to punish evil.

40
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,540
Ironically, your father

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,220
was just a literary man
who loved painting.

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,780
Hence...

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,900
Hence, your grandfather

44
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,980
entrusted the Blood Sacrifice Gang
to me.

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,540
But you bit the hand that fed.

46
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
You killed the Lin family.

47
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,220
Zhou Yuan'an.

48
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,220
You are an animal.

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,020
Before your grandfather died,

50
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,180
he told me the secret of
the Lin family's treasure

51
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,340
and entrusted me with safeguarding it.

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,140
There is a stash in the mountains
belonging to the Lin family.

53
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,100
When the jade pendants
are cast together,

54
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,340
they become a key

55
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,300
to the stash.

56
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,220
But the Lin family is stupid!

57
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,900
You have wasted so much treasure
by leaving them inside.

58
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,420
So I have to find the stash

59
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,180
and use those valuables well.

60
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,060
Zhou Yuan'an, you deserve this!

61
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,260
Why?

62
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,100
