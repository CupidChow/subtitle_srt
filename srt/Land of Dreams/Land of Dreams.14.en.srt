108
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,180

109
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:52,900
Yes.

110
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,740
It's

111
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,740
an assassin organization
called Blood Sacrifice Gang.

112
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,020
Why would an assassin organization

113
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,500
kill the entire Lin family?

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,740
I'm still investigating that.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,380
The person who is tracking you now

116
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,340
is also part of them.

117
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,540
They said

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,100
the client who instructed them
to kill the Lin family

119
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,580
is you.

120
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,060
What?

121
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,220
No.

122
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,980
Miss, you know me well.

123
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,260
Of course, I do.

124
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:22,980
Mr. Cao.

125
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,700
Naturally, I know you very well.

126
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,380
Don't worry.

127
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,620
I will definitely find out
what happened back then.

128
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,500

129
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,980

I will silently protect you

133
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,620
until the day

134
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,140
you tell me everything.

135
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,020
This neighborhood has narrow alleys
and motley residents.

136
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,500
It may be a good hiding spot,

137
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,620
but it's hard to escape.

138
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,540
I must plan an escape route

139
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,580
for Mr. Cao.

140
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,060
This road branches out
into four exits.

141
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,860
With shops and residences around,

142
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,540
there are a lot of options to escape.

143
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,340
Seems like what Master has taught

144
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,940
comes in handy now.

145
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,660
Wait.

146
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,460
There is nowhere to go
behind the alleyways.

147
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
It doesn't favor attack.

148
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,540
