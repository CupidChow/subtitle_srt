81

did he say anything about

84
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,220
No, he said everything passed down

about the Lin family massacre case.

But I can't get into the secret room.

89

I would've found out the person

90

who hired the Blood Sacrifice Gang

91

and what for?

96
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,820
I keep thinking about it
over these years

97
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,780

I might miss out on some details.

98
