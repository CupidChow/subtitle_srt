Who is he?

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,220
The killer sent to assassinate you.

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,220
What?

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,700
Qingming.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,180
About the Lin family massacre case

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,460
and Jingzhe's death,

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,820
I know something about it.

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,020
How did Jingzhe die?

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,620
Jingzhe was on a mission

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,540
in Lin's residence.

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,140
Chief instructed me
to secretly protect him.

18
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,020
The mission Cao Fang requested was

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,020
to kill the three of the Lin family,

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,340
find a pair of jade pendants
they are hiding,

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,500
and send it to him

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,580
at a designated place.

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,100
Jade pendants?

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,980
After Jingzhe left the Lin's residence,

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,540
I followed him

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,180
to the designated place.

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,980
It was a forest.

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,060
Just as I got into the forest,

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,780
I heard someone fighting.

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,060
By the time I arrived,

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,420
I saw Cao Fang

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,460
killing Jingzhe.

33
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,980
You saw Cao Fang killing Jingzhe?

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,460
I did.

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,740
Cao Fang is terribly skilled.

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,780
I was no match for him

37
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,940
with my skills at the time.

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,940
So I hid behind the bushes.

39
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,260
I dared not show up to help.

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,940
After Cao Fang left,

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,740
I returned to Blood Sacrifice Gang
to report for duty.

42
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,300
Chief ordered me to bury Jingzhe well.

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,540
He was worried you might be upset,

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,780
so he stopped me
from telling you the truth.

45
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
But over the years,

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,940
Chief has always sent out scouts

47
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,300
to track Cao Fang.

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,060
He means

49
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,820
to give you an explanation.

50
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,700
Let me ask you one more time.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,420
Did you really witness

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,860
Cao Fang killing Jingzhe?

53
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,580
Yes.

54
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,740
I saw it with my own eyes.

55
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
Mr. Cao.

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,700
Why did he say

57
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,420
you killed Jingzhe?

58
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,820
This is a slander!

59
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,420
I swear to Heaven,

60
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,700
I have never even met him.

61
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,580
I believe you, Mr. Cao, of course.

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,460
It's just

63
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,300
that why Shuangjiang lied?

64
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,980
If he didn't lie about it,

65
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,220
who pretended to be you, then?

66
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,540
They asked the killer
to find the jade pendants.

67
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,020
Apparently,

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,660
they wanted to wipe out
the entire Lin family

69
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,740
for the jade pendants.

70
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,540

71
