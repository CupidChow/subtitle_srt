My family.

Any specific features?

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,100
A fifty-year-old man.

In dark blue rough fabric short clothes.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,580
A knife wound on his chest.

13

Do you know the rules
for retrieving bodies?

14

Whether or not we find
the person you want, you must pay.

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,660
My condolences, miss.

Wait to hear from me.

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,100
Chief, you asked for me?

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,420
How much do you know
about your disciple, Guyu?

23
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,820
Not much.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,820
This is

What do you mean?

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,740
The first time you saw Guyu
was in the alley near Cao Fang's place,

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,620
right?

29
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,700

31
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,860
We made a mistake.

32
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,860
You were actually being followed.

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,860
At first, we thought Guyu
was just a thief,

34
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,100
and it was a coincidence to run into her
in the alley near Cao Fang's place.

35

Did you know that she went
to look for Cao Fang's body

You said you didn't know Cao Fang,

60
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,140
and it was a coincidence
when you appeared in front of his house.

61

The Lin family was the royal descendant

with immeasurable wealth.

117
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,100
They have a stash in the mountain

118
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,740
specifically for treasure.

119
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,700
However, Lin Yucheng

120
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,020
was a dumb literary man
indifferent to money.

121
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,740
He never opened the ancestral wealth.

122
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,620
When these two jade pendants combine,

123
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,340
they make the key

124
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,100
to the stash of the Lin family.

125
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,940
Congratulations, Chief.

126
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,820
I knew I was right about you.

You are open-minded.

won't get bogged down by trivial matters,

such as love, hatred,

130
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,980
or even good and evil.

Over the years,

134
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,180
you are devoted
to Blood Sacrifice Gang,

135
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,700
and I know it.

136
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,900
Once we've retrieved all the valuables,

137
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,060
I will definitely make you rich.

138
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,940
Thank you, Chief.

139

Shut up!

162
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,140
You don't deserve to talk about him.

163
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,380
I don't deserve it?

164
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,300
I killed him.

00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,940
Why not?

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,420
lying to me.

168
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,500
Do you deserve my honesty?

169

I don't deserve it?

170
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,420
Do you really think I don't deserve you?

171
