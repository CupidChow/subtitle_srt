00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,820
why Qi Zeyu

113
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,260
would become their target.

I don't think he is a bad person.

115
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,020
I have doubts too.

116
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,160
Sacrifice Blood Gang
is an upright organization

117
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,020
that punishes evil.

118
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,980
They won't take on cases

119
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,140
without evidence.

120
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,820
Are you sure the targets
that Blood Sacrifice Gang kills

121
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,980
are all sinful?

122
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,020
Is it possible

123
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,900
that they are manipulated

124
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,500
to kill innocent people?

125
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,540
I'm not sure about that.

126
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,180

127

Also...

131
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,140
When I first joined the gang,

132
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,660
Zhou Yuan'an told me

133
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,860
that I must never kill the innocent.

Qi Zeyu is our friend.

135
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,740
We should figure out what is going on.

136
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,300
Besides, Zeyu usually stays
in the clinic.

137
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,380
If they are to kill him,

138
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,340
they don't have to scout

139
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,260
or follow him.

140
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,820
So killing him

141
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,940
might not be their ultimate goal.

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
There must be something else.

143
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,940

144
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,740
