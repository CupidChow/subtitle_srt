[Episode 15]

7
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,660
We bought this sofa

8
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,580
after you chose it
from the painting catalog.

9
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,740
We went to several places
before we finally decided on it.

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,620
How am I going

11
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,100
to find another sofa
that's exactly the same?

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,660
You jabbed and broke the back cushion.

13
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:21,900
Please tell me

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,420
what I have done wrong.

15
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,780
Why did you scare me

16
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,420
as soon as you came back?

17
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,940
You said you were checking the ledger.

18
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,940
But you are wearing outdoor shoes.

19
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,700
Did you catch the scent of

20
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,660
soybean oil

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,620
when you passed the gristmill, right?

22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,140
Besides,

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,940
you haven't taken off the shirt inside.

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,540
Goodness.

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,980
I'm done for.

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,060
I can't have any secrets.

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Luckily,

28
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,860
it was just a gristmill.

29
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,220
If I were to pass by
the Yixiang Pleasure House

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,100
and get stained with the rouge scent,

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,140
I wouldn't survive tonight.

32
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,500
You were following me.

33
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,940
Why didn't you go in just now?

34
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,260
Because I respect you.

you are very experienced
in duo tasks.

91
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,300
