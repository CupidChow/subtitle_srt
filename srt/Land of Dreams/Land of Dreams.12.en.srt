That's great.

What if Mengchen fell off it?

44

Rest assured, I'm very good at biking.

had sesame in it.

Did you get a rash?

58
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,460
Mengchen, are you allergic to sesame?

59
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,500
Mengchen, I really didn't know, I swear.

I'll apply her ointment
and get rid of the rash.

67
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,820
Put it there. I'll help her.

68

Just listen to me.

74
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,620
Since you get a rash,

75
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,700
you should steer clear
of anything too rich.

I didn't say I'm going home.

79

I'm not going.

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,580
Oh, you're not?

81
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,500
The red bean cakes miss you.

82

The swing in the yard misses you, too.

83
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,940
But most importantly,

84
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,820
I miss you.

85
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,980
Ha, you miss me?

86
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,290
I guess you've missed the moment

87
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,540

88
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,300
You're so busy.

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,380
How could you spare some time to miss me?

90
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,620
I can take care of myself.

91
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,140
That won't do.

92
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,540
You can't take care of yourself

93
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,900
the same as I do.

94
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,820
I wouldn't be at ease.

My goodness,

96
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,220
I've really underestimated you.

97
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,500
Ever since you started flirting
with Guyu,

98
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,660
you've been quite a smooth-talker.

99
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,260
Brother,

100
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,580
do you only take care of me?

101
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,260
Of course.

102
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,660
You're the most important person to me.

Brother, I'm a bit tired.

106
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,740
I want to take a nap.

107
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,380
Alright, go ahead.

108
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,460
Once you're feeling better,

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,500
I'll come and pick you up.

110
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,620

111
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,900

112
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,780
It's mine.

115
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,340
You're making trouble!

116
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,860
Who asked you to come?

117
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,260
If you can protect me,

118
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,380
I can protect you too. Let's go.

119
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,820
Well, look at that.

120
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,260
You two both saved each other once.

121
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,020
How touching.

122
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,460
The one who is with Xiaosheng is Guyu.

123
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
Why should I be excited?

124
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,460

Considering your merit in saving Qingming,

I won't punish you severely this time.
