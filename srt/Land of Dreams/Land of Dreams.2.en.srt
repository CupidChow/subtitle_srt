or have children.

194
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,220
No marrying, no children?

195
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,300
Bro,

196
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,460
do you have any secret troubles?

197
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,300
I'm a doctor.

198
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,220
You can tell me.

199
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,420
I might be able to help.

200
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,380
What secret troubles?

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,140
What illness?

202
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,580
How to treat it?

203
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,820
Nothing.

204
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,260
Shut up.

205
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,940
Bro, don't be shy.

206
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,380
Your condition is very common.

207
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:51,940
Come on.

208
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,900
Let me give you a check-up.

209
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,140
Come on.

210
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,100
What check-up?

211
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,900
Check what exactly?

212
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,300
Let go!

213
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,220
Don't listen to his nonsense.

214
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,900
Listen,

215
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,260
if you dare harass Mengchen again,

216
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,460
I won't show any mercy to you.

217
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,820
Let's go home.

218
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,260
Brother,

219
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,540
what illness do you have?

220
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,700
Let him diagnose you.

221
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,140
Though his brain might not work well,

222
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,460
what if his medical skills are decent?

223
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,660
I'm not sick.

224
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,940
