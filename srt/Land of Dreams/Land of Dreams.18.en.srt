[Qingfeng Clinic]

8
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,700
Mister.

9
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,180
What's wrong with you?

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,860
Are you all right?

11
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,260
What has happened

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,660
to you?

13
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,770
Mister, do you know

14
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,700
any traditional Chinese medicine clinics
nearby?

15
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,620
I have a big family

16
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,780
and need to keep herbs on hand.

17
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,020
I think you made a mistake, mister.

18
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,580
I run a Western clinic.

19
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,100
I'm not familiar with Chinese herbs.

20
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,100
Whether it's traditional Chinese herbs
or Western medicine,

21
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,220
as long as it can save lives.

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,340
Mister, your medicine is expensive.

23
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,700
I came all the way from overseas.
It wasn't an easy trip.

24
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,780
Stop.

25
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,180
You don't need the mask,

26
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,900
Mengchen.

27
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,740
I gave you this gun.

28
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,740
I'm left with no choice.

29
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,420
After all, this is supposed
to be a proper assassination.

30
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,620
Why did you follow me?

31
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm pointing the gun at you.

32
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,380
That should be my question.

33
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,540
Surrender the letter

34
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,420

Who sent you here?

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,540
Brother!

37
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,260
Why did you shoot him?

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,340
He wanted to seize the chest.

39
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,940
It was urgent.
I had no choice but to shoot.

40
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,380

41
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,060

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,860
How is my brother?

43
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,740
Release me. I want to check on him!

44
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,300
Mengchen, calm down.

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,700
He will be all right.

46
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,380
I'm trying my best to save him.

Who are you?

Don't hurt her!

53
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,900
Put your gun down. Trust me.

54
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,860
I swear on my life
that they mean no harm.

55
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,380
I just don't want you to be in danger.

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,340
to make sure you are safe
returning from England

58
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,260

We have to keep you safe.

60
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,780
Besides,

61
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,340
it's apparent that they are killers.

62
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,260
Well-trained killers.

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,500
But I believe in them.

64
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,500
Qi Zeyu, what are you doing?

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Aren't you a doctor?

66
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,700
Yes, I'm a doctor.

67
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
But I want to save more lives.

68
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,900
Trust me.

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,420
Mengchen!

70
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,420
Open the chest.

71
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,060
Leave now.

are waiting for the medicine.

to obtain medicine that needs permission

75
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,820
and send them to the front line

76
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,420
to save the people, right?

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,060
Yes.

78
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,980
We are saving lives.

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,060
If someone is watching me,

80
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,460
they are probably after

81
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,980
these anti-inflammatory drugs
sold at sky-high prices

82
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,020
on the black market.

83
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,300
Could it be

84
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,060
that they kill for money?

85
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,460
It is possible.

86
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,220
When I first met you,

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,340
I realized

88
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,260
someone coveted my medicine.

89
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,460
So,

90
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,660
if you believe
that the Blood Sacrifice Gang

91
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
helps punish evil,

92
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,980
why are they after me and my medicine?

93
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,060
Qi Zeyu.

94
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,860
You believe us, right?

95
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,180
Yes.

96
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,580
You can't stay where you are now.

97
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,900
You have to come home with us.

98
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,100
All right.

99
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,580
Thank you for taking me in.

100
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,780
But I'm in a really bad situation now.

101
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,900
Can you

102
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,580
promise me one thing?

103
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,620
- What is it?
- What is it?

104
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,700
Stop being lovey-dovey

105
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,380
in front of me, please.

106
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,980
You seem relaxed.

107
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,940
You take refuge here,

108
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,580
but you live so comfortably.

109
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,370
Have you forgotten

110
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,380
that the Blood Sacrifice Gang
is after you?

111
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,860
Have you also forgotten

112
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,140
that both of us are killers
of Blood Sacrifice Gang?

113
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,500
What else can I do?

114
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,060
It's always right

115
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,140
to be optimistic.

116
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,980
You won't kill me, anyway.

117
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,180
Think about this.

118
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,620
If not for the hunt,

119
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,460
I wouldn't have had this chance
to sit here

120
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,940
and watch you doing laundry

121
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,780
and tidying up the house.

122
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,060
Tsk.

123
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,300
This is strange.

124
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,940
Where is the dagger
Xiaosheng always carries around?

125
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,340
Chief.

126
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,780
Chief.

127
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,260
Chief.

128
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,780
Chief.

129
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,220
What are you doing, Shuangjiang?

130
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,540
Why did you mess up my mission

131
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,860
and get me in trouble

132
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,900
with the Heart-burning Powder torture?

133
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,940
Why did you do that?

134
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,820
I don't know what you are talking about.

135
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,700
Let go.

136
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,700
Drop the act already.

137
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,060
I was drugged
when I observed the target yesterday.

138
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,940
By the time I got there,
the person had already fled.

139
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,300
But I found your dagger

140
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,900
at the scene.

141
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,380
Speak up.

142
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,660
Why did you betray
the Blood Sacrifice Gang?

143
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,900
Why did you let him go?

144
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,860
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

145
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,020
Let go of me!

146
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Chief!

147
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,780
I will accept the punishment.

148
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,380
But I request Qingming
to take Heart-burning Powder too.

149
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,660
He betrayed the Blood Sacrifice Gang!

150
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,980
Don't slander me!

151
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,420
It's you.

152
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,940
Since Jingzhe fled,

153
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,100
you haven't been loyal
to the Blood Sacrifice Gang.

154
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,580
Don't slander Jingzhe.

155
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,460
He is my buddy.

156
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,420
Don't frame him!

157
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,380
Spare me the talk!

158
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,540
Your dagger

159
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,820
is found at my mission point.

160
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,260
How do you explain this?

161
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,420
I can accept the punishment.

162
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,340
We will take
the Heart-burning Powder together

163
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,180
and see who the traitor is.

164
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,820
Move.

165
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,900
Don't touch me!

166
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,660
How dare you deny it.

167
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,820
Chief, look at this.

168
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,940
This is a gunshot wound.

169
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,860
Chief.

170
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,220
It isn't true.

171
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,900
Qingming.

172
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,820
You are injured?

173
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
He is, Chief.

174
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,100
He was shot.

175
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,660
You can take off his clothes to check.

176
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,540
Master.

177
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,580
Are you all right?

178
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,300
I'm fine.

179
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,140
How dare you hurt my master.

180
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
Believe it or not, I will kill you!

181
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,740
What is going on here today?

182
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,700
Every one of you

183
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,940
is fighting in front of me?

184
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,460
Do you have no respect for me?

185
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,460
Chief.

186
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,940
I respect you

187
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,420
because you handed me over to Master.

188
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,820
But if anyone are to hurt him,

189
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
I will kill them.

190
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,100
But your master betrayed us.

191
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,940
Insult my master again,

192
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,020
or I will cut off your tongue!

193
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,660
Yesterday,

194
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,620
I saw someone brought
the tracking powder,

195
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,740
but no one was watching the target.

196
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,940
It was urgent,

197
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,740
so I called my master to go with me.

198
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,380
But the two men were armed.

199
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,780
We couldn't deal with them at all.

200
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,140
Master

201
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,740
was shot

202
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,820
when he tried to take the chest.

203
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,700
Qingming.

204
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,180
Good job.

205
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,220
Go to the infirmary to get treatment.

206
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,460
Yes.

207
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,500
Master.

208
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,180
Move.

209
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,380
Chief.

210
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,060
He is all right.

211
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,700
Just take a good rest.

212
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,620
All right.

213
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,740
Thank you, Physician Ge.

214
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,380
Why did you come here?

215
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,460
If Chief finds out
that the medicine in the chest is fake,

216
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,540
you will be in trouble.

217
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,380
You told me

218
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,660
that I'm no longer the Mengchen

219
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,460
who needs your protection.

220
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,620
I can fight alongside you

221
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,660

222
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,740
