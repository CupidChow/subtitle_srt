1
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:43,293
<i>There are more than</i>
<i>eight billion people in the world.</i>

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,879
<i>How will you find the one for you?</i>

3
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,216
<i>In the Philippines alone,</i>

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,385
<i>there are more than 119 million people.</i>

5
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,555
<i>What happens now?</i>

6
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,271
<i>But as they say,</i>

7
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,982
<i>you don't have to look for the one.</i>

8
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,073
<i>If they are meant for you,</i>

9
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,241
<i>they will come.</i>

10
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,963
Hey, what's that?

11
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,174
Stop using your cellphone.

12
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,344
You don't even know
what’s real on social media.

13
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,012
I told you so.

14
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,515
Huh? They’re saying the world is flat.

15
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,557
- What?
- What?

16
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,767
Look.

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,352
Can you please eat first?

18
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,895
You’re getting on my nerves.

19
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,939
You’re always on your cellphone.

20
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,190
Babe, relax.

21
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,858
Go ahead. Eat first.

22
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,445
Karen, how's your application?

23
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,073
Stepdad, I'm tired.

24
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,076
Until now, no one has called me.

25
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,079
I told you you could work at the garage
in the meantime.

26
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,289
You can work for us
while you're waiting for your application,

27
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,667
so that you won't get stressed
waiting for a call.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,255
Why are you forcing Karen
to get a job right away?

29
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,508
She's been busy with her studies
for four years.

30
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,805
You can just help me
with my gourmet dried fish business.

31
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,723
What if…

32
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,768
What if I work with Papa?

33
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,358
The soup is so hot.

34
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:31,901
It’s too hot.

35
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,239
Wherever you think you’ll be happy.

36
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,616
If you want, I'll talk to Tony.

37
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,163
Working in real estate pays well.

38
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,498
That's also a good start.

39
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,167
Right, Stepdad?

40
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,754
Wait.

41
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,423
My salad might get frozen.

42
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,020
Berns, come eat with me.

43
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,688
I already ate.

44
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,901
Look at this papaya. It’s reddish.

45
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,111
That’s delicious!

46
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,742
I know what to do.

47
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,243
I can make a papaya shake for you.

48
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,329
I also have kiwi and dragon fruit
in the fridge.

49
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,539
Do you want me to blend it?

50
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,419
Oh, dear!

51
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,089
Up until now,
you can’t take care of yourself.

52
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,134
Love you.

53
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,262
Why is there no "I"?

54
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,891
Fine, I’ll add "I".

55
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,394
But first, you should be my girlfriend.

56
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,605
No! I'm taken.

57
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,608
But okay, I love you.

58
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,568
Eat, eat!

59
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,238
- Love you.
- Love you.

60
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,989
- Love you.
- Love you.

61
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,407
- Love you.
- Hey!

62
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,808
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Did you receive my text?

63
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,351
Where are you?

64
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,896
<i>I explained it to you before.</i>

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,023
<i>Didn't we agree to it?</i>

66
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,858
<i>You work for Miguel first.</i>

67
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,985
<i>Try it.</i>

68
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,362
<i>We’re in Dubai now, son.</i>

69
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,947
<i>Did you see the comet?</i>

70
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,199
Yes, Dad.

71
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,409
It's so beautiful.

72
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,785
And it's the first night.

73
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,954
It seems like it's not moving.

74
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,415
<i>Miguel and I also talked.</i>

75
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,833
<i>Everything is okay.</i>

76
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,251
Pa.

77
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,297
<i>It only appears every 15 years.</i>

78
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,173
<i>You should make a wish. Hurry!</i>

79
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>They say it's bad luck,</i>

80
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,053
<i>but I don't believe them.</i>

81
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,974
<i>It's a blessing for us and your mom.</i>

82
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,142
<i>Who knows?</i>

83
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,810
<i>That might give you a GF.</i>

84
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,190
Hello, Pa? You're choppy.

85
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,109
Hello?

86
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,068
Pa?

87
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,278
You're choppy.

88
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,738
<i>About Miguel.</i>

89
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,575
I'll think about it.

90
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,952
<i>You don’t need to think. Please, baby.</i>

91
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,038
<i>It's just temporary.</i>

92
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,290
<i>Trust me on this. Give it six months.</i>

93
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,125
- Four.
- <i>Five.</i>

94
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,126
Four and a half.

95
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,253
<i>Okay. Four and a half.</i>

96
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,838
<i>I’ll call Miguel, okay?</i>

97
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,174
Pa, come outside! There's a comet!

98
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,468
<i>Okay, bye. Love you, baby.</i>

99
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,887
<i>Bye, son. See you!</i>

100
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,264
- <i>Love you!</i>
- Love you, Pa.

101
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,253
Really?

102
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,795
<i>Hi, Libra Gurl!</i>

103
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,302
<i>Hello, Aquaman!</i>

104
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,102
<i>I'm Aquarius Boy.</i>

105
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,315
<i>Boy? You're already 21.</i>

106
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,531
<i>I have a baby face.</i>

107
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,996
<i>So, have you graduated?</i>

108
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,916
<i>Yup, Fine Arts.</i>

109
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,502
<i>Wow, artist!</i>

110
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,546
<i>How about you?</i>

111
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,215
<i>Business Ad.</i>

112
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,551
<i>I’m actually looking for a job.</i>

113
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,848
<i>I thought you were looking for me.</i>

114
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,771
<i>What a smooth move!</i>

115
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,441
<i>It says here, "Searching for the one."</i>

116
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,528
<i>You're cool, huh?</i>

117
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,697
<i>Not really.</i>

118
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,282
<i>I'm quite boring.</i>

119
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,909
<i>I'm not bored.</i>

120
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,910
<i>For now.</i>

121
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,913
<i>Where are you in Cebu?</i>

122
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,750
<i>Naga.</i>

123
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,006
<i>Isn't that in Bicol?</i>

124
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,593
<i>Is that a joke?</i>

125
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,314
<i>Cam to cam?</i>

126
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,697
<i>That’s too soon!</i>

127
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,451
<i>We’ll get to that point anyway.</i>

128
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,785
<i>Seize the day!</i>

129
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,663
<i>Game?</i>

130
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,169
<i>Wait. I'm not prepared!</i>

131
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,713
<i>Game?</i>

132
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,632
<i>Game.</i>

133
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,140
<i>On my count,</i>
<i>we’ll turn on the cam together.</i>

134
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,558
<i>Okay?</i>

135
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,855
<i>Okay.</i>

136
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,734
<i>Three, two,</i>

137
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,860
<i>one!</i>

138
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,798
Hey!

139
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,801
Hey!

140
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,181
You’re beautiful.

141
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,185
Thank you.

142
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,980
You're cute.

143
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,566
Sis, where’s my Statistics homework?

144
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,193
Bonbon, please!

145
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,195
<i>Don't you know how to knock?</i>

146
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,572
Your door is open.

147
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,574
Oh, jeez!

148
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,492
Hey, what's that?

149
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,744
Cybersex?

150
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,830
What are you saying? What cyber--

151
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,124
That’s what you get from the Internet!

152
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,959
I’m just joking, sis! Relax!

153
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,252
No trash talk. Calm down.

154
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,753
- Trash talk?
- Yeah!

155
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,963
Hey, bro!

156
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,339
<i>I’m Troy, by the way.</i>

157
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,298
Is she your girlfriend?

158
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,092
You know what? Get out!

159
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,051
- <i>Get out!</i>
- <i>He’s your boyfriend, isn’t he?</i>

160
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,469
Get out! One!

161
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,263
- My Statistics homework!
- Fine! Out, out!

162
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,973
Hey, bro. I'm Troy.

163
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,558
<i>You’re so irritating! Get out.</i>

164
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,767
I'll kick you out!

165
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,185
- Bye, sis!
- Hurry up!

166
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,895
Don't come back.

167
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,149
That kid is so childish!

168
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,277
He's not a kid anymore,
but he still acts as if he’s a baby.

169
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,946
You seem like a demanding sister.

170
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,033
You seem nice.

171
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,121
By the way, I'm Alexander.

172
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,456
Just call me Lex.

173
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,041
I'm Karenina.

174
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,169
Just call me Karen.

175
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,753
Hi, Karen!

176
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,005
Hi, Lex!

177
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,650
- Take care of that luggage.
- Slowly.

178
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,487
- Can you handle that, Margaret?
- Wait. Oh, dear.

179
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,031
- Alexander, we're here!
- Son!

180
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:02,990
Ma! Pa!

181
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,955
Wait a minute.
We still smell like the airport.

182
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,499
You’re feasting on your mom.
Leave me some.

183
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,750
It's been eight days. I need more kisses.

184
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,084
- One more.
- One last.

185
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,295
Leave me some. Hey, wait!

186
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,213
It smells so good in here.

187
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,089
- You’re smelling food again.
- Of course.

188
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,508
I’m hungry. We just came from--

189
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,343
- Dried fish.
- Dried fish.

190
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,385
Scrambled egg.

191
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,471
Salted egg.

192
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,225
Fried rice. And, of course, mango juice.

193
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,518
Fresh from the farm.

194
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,019
My favorite!

195
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,940
Oh, madam,
he’s been bugging me since last night.

196
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,442
He told me that he's going to prepare
your breakfast.

197
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,778
He even chopped the tomatoes.

198
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,862
He said he’ll do it himself.

199
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,031
- You didn't help him?
- No, I didn't.

200
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,157
I've got no work to do.

201
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,826
Hey, don't get married yet.

202
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,078
I'm going to lose my baby too soon.

203
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,955
How will you have a grandchild
if you’re like that?

204
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,207
I'll just buy you a dog.
You want that, don't you?

205
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,793
- I hope it's a big one, just like you.
- The dog will jump on you.

206
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,011
Miss.

207
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,431
Can you assist me here?

208
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,642
- Miss.
- Yes?

209
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,810
How about this one?

210
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,105
Sorry, sir. Just a moment.

211
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,523
Okay.

212
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,484
It's a 2021 model. Automatic.

213
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,279
The registration is included
when you avail.

214
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,239
The battery and tires are still okay.

215
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,866
Excuse me.

216
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,078
She's not focused on her work.

217
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,413
HOW ARE YOU?

218
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,873
WERE YOU ABLE TO CLOSE A SALE?

219
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,000
I’M ON MY WAY
AND WE CAN HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER

220
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,376
Miss!

221
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,796
Miss!

222
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,714
- Can you please assist me here?
- Yes, sir.

223
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,715
Sorry, sorry.

224
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,844
Honestly, Ma,

225
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,054
I feel ashamed. Stepdad Miguel means well.

226
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,557
I know how eager he is to help me out,

227
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,852
but that work isn’t really for me.

228
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,270
My child.

229
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,357
I hope you give Miguel a chance.

230
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,651
He just wants to help you.

231
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,280
It's not like that, Ma.

232
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,574
I'm just not comfortable working there.

233
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,460
I'll tell him.

234
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,420
Really?

235
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,672
Thank you, Ma! I love you!

236
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,798
I love you, too.

237
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,385
That place isn’t really for me.

238
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,553
Why not?

239
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,393
Okay. Try me.

240
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,103
I'm good at giving advice.

241
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,189
Or…

242
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,192
maybe it’s just not
the right environment for me.

243
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,777
It doesn’t excite me.

244
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,029
What excites you?

245
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,910
Me?

246
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,872
What a pick-up line!

247
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,540
You're so sly.

248
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,960
No, but seriously,

249
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,629
do what makes you happy. Right?

250
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,552
Just like now, you’re happy.

251
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,721
Huh?

252
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,100
You’re happy because you’re talking to me.

253
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,996
Why…

254
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,376
Are you okay?

255
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,879
Can I work with you instead?

256
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,344
Okay. Fine.

257
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,388
- Really?
- Yes.

258
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,557
I love you, Papa.

259
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,350
I love you too, baby.

260
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,107
So, Karen, this is my house.

261
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,817
<i>Wow!</i>

262
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,694
<i>Your house has a second floor.</i>

263
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,611
<i>I envy you!</i>

264
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,073
<i>My parents love to travel.</i>

265
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,700
<i>They love souvenirs. Like this one.</i>

266
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,910
<i>It's from Africa.</i>
<i>And there are more downstairs.</i>

267
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,370
I'll show you.

268
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,371
Wait.

269
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,457
- <i>Give me a tour!</i>
- Wait.

270
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,710
- <i>Show me around. Hurry!</i>
- Okay.

271
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,172
<i>Like these. Do you know</i>
<i>where these are from?</i>

272
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,383
<i>These are from different parts of Asia.</i>

273
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,678
- Lucky you.
- <i>And last…</i>

274
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,889
I have someone to introduce to you.

275
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,474
Wait.

276
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,892
That’s the start.

277
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,352
You’re overreacting.

278
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,813
He’s a grown man now, okay? Relax.

279
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,317
Do you have a dog? Can I see?

280
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,569
- Can I see him? Hurry!
- <i>Wait.</i>

281
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,404
You’re so slow. Hurry!

282
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,281
- <i>Where?</i>
- Tada!

283
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,199
Meet…

284
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,118
Chopper.

285
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:03,290
- See? My partner in crime.
- <i>Nice. You got your own car.</i>

286
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,292
<i>You know,</i>

287
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,419
<i>I think you and Stepdad Miguel</i>
<i>will get along.</i>

288
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,463
<i>You have the same car color.</i>

289
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,218
<i>As cute as me?</i>

290
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,552
Fine.

291
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,678
- You're cute.
<i>- Like that?</i>

292
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,224
Dimple.

293
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,396
This is a very friendly
neighborhood, ma'am.

294
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,357
It’s five minutes away from the market.

295
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,317
Fifteen minutes away
from school and church.

296
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,779
And we have 24-hour security personnel
for your safety.

297
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,531
Total of 140 square meters.

298
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,492
- Floor area…
- <i>Mama and Papa have separated.</i>

299
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,661
<i>The usual. They don't get along.</i>

300
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,830
- Good luck!
- The payment is convenient too.

301
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,831
<i>So,</i>

302
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,541
<i>that's the reason why</i>
<i>you don’t want to work</i>

303
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,251
- <i>at the used car sales garage?</i>
- Thank you.

304
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,585
<i>Because of your Stepdad Miguel?</i>

305
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,839
<i>Maybe.</i>

306
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,049
First house tour.

307
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,759
You closed the deal right away!

308
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,761
Of course! I got it from my papa.

309
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,013
Congratulations, baby girl!

310
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,265
Thanks, Papa!

311
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,225
<i>Or, simply, I just want to be with my dad.</i>

312
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,894
There’s still plenty of food.

313
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,146
You already ate too many.

314
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,648
<i>Everything seems easy</i>
<i>when I'm with my dad.</i>

315
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,859
<i>Even when I was young,</i>

316
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,902
<i>we always ate together.</i>

317
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,406
<i>Ever since he left home,</i>

318
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,118
<i>I felt like something was missing.</i>

319
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,789
- Good night.
- Good night, son.

320
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,499
Good night, son.

321
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,171
- Good night.
- <i>I am an only child.</i>

322
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,381
<i>My parents are both senior citizens.</i>

323
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,799
<i>I love them so much.</i>

324
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,887
<i>They taught me to be contented</i>
<i>and be thankful.</i>

325
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,901
<i>As simple as waking up in the morning</i>

326
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,360
<i>and you're still alive…</i>

327
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,072
<i>It's already a blessing</i>
<i>that you should be thankful for.</i>

328
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,658
<i>Everything that happens has a reason.</i>

329
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,622
<i>There are things</i>
<i>that are hard to understand.</i>

330
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,458
<i>Of course, your mom had a hard time</i>

331
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,251
<i>when your dad left.</i>

332
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,212
<i>But your Stepdad Miguel came. See?</i>

333
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,173
<i>That's how destiny brings people together.</i>

334
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,970
I love Stepdad Miguel.

335
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,640
I have no complaints about him.

336
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,392
He's responsible.

337
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:32,189
And I know that he loves my mom so much.

338
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,317
But, of course,

339
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,987
I only have one dad.

340
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,406
Of course.

341
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,286
On my seventh birthday,

342
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,581
there was a storm.

343
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,209
<i>They had a fight.</i>

344
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,835
Admit it, Tony!

345
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,046
I already know.

346
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,258
So, just tell the truth!

347
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,343
Is she doing it on purpose?

348
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,844
Why now?

349
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,475
Why don’t you admit
that it came from Hazel?

350
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,688
Why don’t you believe me
that it wasn’t her?

351
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,357
You’ve been making me feel stupid!

352
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,652
I’ve been working
my butt off in Singapore.

353
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,153
And then this?

354
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,662
<i>Someone delivered a portrait of a woman.</i>

355
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:35,085
<i>It was for me, but it didn’t say</i>
<i>where it came from.</i>

356
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,431
<i>My mom thought that</i>
<i>it came from my dad's mistress.</i>

357
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,558
<i>I mean, from Hazel.</i>

358
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,352
<i>Because the portrait says "Xel".</i>

359
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,898
<i>It was purposely sent on my birthday.</i>

360
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,861
<i>Even before, they always fought over her.</i>

361
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,156
<i>I put the portrait in the storage room,</i>

362
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>together with other meaningless trash.</i>

363
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,580
<i>That's where it belonged.</i>

364
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,176
<i>Two weeks later,</i>

365
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,429
<i>they separated.</i>

366
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,143
But you know what?

367
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,357
My dad's mistress died three years ago.

368
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,071
I thought they would get back together.

369
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,448
But…

370
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,451
Stepdad Miguel and my mom were together.

371
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:56,541
Maybe if Stepdad Miguel wasn't there,

372
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,669
they would get back together.

373
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,802
We only live once, Lex.

374
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,765
Is it wrong to wish for a normal family?

375
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,266
Karen.

376
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,143
Hmm?

377
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,897
I'm adopted.

378
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,650
Huh?

379
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,986
I still haven’t met my real parents.

380
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,156
I don't remember them at all.

381
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,872
My mama and papa were passengers
on the ship, MV Maricar.

382
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,087
And the ship sank because of a typhoon.

383
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,135
Then,

384
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,972
while the ship was sinking,

385
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,228
a married couple
with five children approached them,

386
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,774
asking them to save me

387
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,822
because they couldn’t save us all.

388
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,326
I was still a baby then.

389
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,539
<i>They're my real family, Karen.</i>

390
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,501
<i>I’ve known these things</i>
<i>since I was in elementary.</i>

391
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,047
<i>My mama and papa</i>
<i>didn't hide anything from me.</i>

392
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,677
<i>Somehow, I'm still lucky.</i>

393
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,262
Let me do it.

394
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,014
<i>They're so kind to me.</i>

395
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,350
<i>I never felt</i>

396
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,020
<i>that I'm alone.</i>

397
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,813
<i>Most of all,</i>

398
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,818
<i>I never felt that</i>

399
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,322
<i>I’m not their son.</i>

400
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,657
I love you.

401
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,993
I love you.

402
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,663
I always wonder before I go to sleep,

403
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,917
are my real parents still alive?

404
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,212
Are they looking for me?

405
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,254
What do you think?

406
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,096
Sorry, I made you cry.

407
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,475
I can feel your sadness.

408
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,898
Do you want to be happy?

409
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,316
Huh?

410
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,819
Let’s meet soon!

411
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,991
How? You’re too far.

412
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,454
A plane ticket to Manila is quite cheap.

413
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,499
What are we going to do?

414
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,626
I just want to meet your family.

415
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,378
I want to get to know them.

416
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,382
Aunt Pam, your stepdad Miguel, and Bonbon.

417
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:51,883
Hey!

418
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,344
Don't tell them anything, okay?

419
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,056
Okay.

420
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,140
Game.

421
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,725
Where are we going to meet?

422
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,315
I only know U-belt and Luneta.

423
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,817
Wow!

424
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,068
Luneta?

425
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,152
That's classic.

426
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,363
Where in Luneta? That’s a big place.

427
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,450
Do you know Kilometer Zero?

428
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,080
It's right in front of the Rizal Monument.

429
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,082
There's a centennial clock there.

430
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,709
That's where we'll meet.

431
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,420
Kilometer Zero?

432
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,506
So, we're really starting from zero?

433
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,343
From zero and beyond.

434
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,972
From zero and beyond.

435
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,807
Nice!

436
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,947
<i>Okay. What's your phone number?</i>

437
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,408
<i>Is that necessary?</i>

438
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,368
<i>Let's just talk here.</i>

439
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,787
<i>Just in case there’s no Internet.</i>

440
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,955
<i>Okay.</i>

441
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,833
<i>0939</i>

442
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,169
<i>44585</i>

443
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,212
<i>490.</i>

444
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,797
<i>How about you?</i>

445
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,345
<i>0917</i>

446
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,554
<i>223</i>

447
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,223
<i>45719.</i>

448
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,027
<i>This is my first time doing this.</i>

449
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,779
<i>Me too!</i>

450
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,572
<i>Don't kidnap me, okay?</i>

451
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,867
<i>Why don’t you kidnap me instead?</i>

452
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,371
<i>Okay. See you!</i>

453
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,998
<i>See you!</i>

454
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,912
<i>The subscriber cannot be reached.</i>

455
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,789
<i>Please try again later.</i>

456
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,735
<i>The subscriber cannot be reached.</i>

457
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,820
<i>Please try again later.</i>

458
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,466
Sir…

459
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,675
Sir, excuse me.

460
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,596
I think she’s no longer coming.

461
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,229
Do you have a wife?

462
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,482
Me? No, I don't have one yet.

463
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,025
How about a girlfriend?

464
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,486
I have a girlfriend,
but she doesn't know about it yet.

465
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,779
I'm still courting her.

466
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,663
What's this?

467
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,706
You can have it.

468
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,749
I can have this?

469
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,294
That’s special. It’s from Cebu.

470
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,962
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yes.

471
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,631
Thank you!

472
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,734
<i>How dare you!</i>

473
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,111
Me? Why me?

474
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,821
I've been waiting for you for two hours!

475
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,989
You’ve been saying that you live in Cebu,

476
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,657
but what if you just live here,
in Morayta?

477
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,783
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

478
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,826
What do you mean?

479
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,036
I've been waiting for you
for two hours last night.

480
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,954
You’re a poser!

481
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,205
What?

482
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,207
What do you mean two hours?

483
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,710
I am the one
who waited for you for two hours.

484
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,712
What? If you really came last night,

485
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,088
why didn't you send me a message?

486
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,341
Like, "I’m here now. Where are you?"

487
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,137
Karen, I've been calling you
so many times.

488
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,849
There was no signal,
and the number you gave me was wrong.

489
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,850
What?

490
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,351
You're the one
who gave me the wrong number.

491
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,020
Wait, I'll send you something.

492
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,022
Check this out!

493
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,737
Wait.

494
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,740
Here, take a look.

495
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,289
So, why didn't I see you?

496
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,043
<i>Why didn't I see you, too?</i>

497
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,211
I don’t know!
Maybe because you didn't show up.

498
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,212
<i>What do you mean I didn't show up?</i>

499
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,505
Look, I’m here, in Manila.

500
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,132
Here, look!

501
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,885
What can you say?

502
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,054
There’s a place like that in Cebu!

503
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,639
You didn't show up, period!

504
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,392
Karen, you're the one who didn't show up.

505
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,103
Oh, my God!

506
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,486
Okay.

507
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,405
<i>Let's just forget about this.</i>

508
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,242
It looks like you don't have
any intention of admitting it.

509
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,786
<i>Fine. Okay.</i>

510
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,664
Make up for this!

511
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,458
Tonight, 7:00 p.m.,

512
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,878
at Kilometer Zero, in front of the clock!
Goodbye!

513
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,556
Hey!

514
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,351
Lover’s quarrel?

515
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,361
Hey, what's going on?

516
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,698
Relationship problems, Mom.

517
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,782
Grown-ups.

518
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,795
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is not a registered number.</i>

519
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,881
<i>Please check the number and dial again.</i>

520
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,248
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is not a registered number.</i>

521
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,334
<i>Please check the number and dial again.</i>

522
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,217
Sir, do you like some roses?

523
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,302
Please buy some. Please buy all of these.

524
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:15,029
Ma'am, there might be an emergency again.

525
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,841
So, how was the tour, sir?

526
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,634
Did you like the unit?

527
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,552
What do you think, honey?

528
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,723
This is okay for us.

529
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,727
By next week, let's settle the papers,
so it'll be quick.

530
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,271
Thank you, Sir Villanueva! Ma’am,

531
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,188
- thank you!
- Thank you.

532
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,399
I told you it fits everything you need.

533
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,984
You can call me Paco.

534
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,279
You look familiar.

535
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,238
Have we met?

536
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,785
I'm not sure, Sir Paco.
I have a lot of clients lately.

537
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,288
By the way, thank you again. Thank you!

538
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,205
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you.

539
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,498
You're welcome. See you soon, okay?

540
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,416
Yes.

541
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,293
- I'll wait for your call.
- Okay.

542
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,717
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

543
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,386
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

544
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,807
<i>Happy birthday, happy birthday!</i>

545
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,728
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

546
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,937
Make a wish.

547
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,355
Make a wish.

548
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,906
Happy birthday, baby!

549
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,540
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT

550
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,636
- Hi, Karen! Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

551
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,012
- It’s time to eat.
- Okay.

552
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,308
Mom, was there a delivery for me?

553
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,852
Delivery? The cake.

554
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,562
Who was it from?

555
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,357
Who else? It’s from your Dad.

556
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,945
Pam!

557
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,323
Happy birthday to your daughter!

558
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,824
Have you eaten?

559
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,343
You have so many guests.

560
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,844
How was it, baby?

561
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,847
Are you happy with your party?

562
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,035
Why?

563
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,829
Baby.

564
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,790
What happened?

565
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,796
I'm okay, Papa.

566
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,507
I'm happy that you're here.

567
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,304
Baby.

568
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,223
Soon,

569
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,143
you will understand.

570
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,105
Your mom and I are happy

571
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,190
with what we have now.

572
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,652
I still love her.

573
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,612
She loves me.

574
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,367
Whatever kind of love we have now,

575
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,036
we're good with that.

576
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,997
And we're contented with it.

577
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,501
Love doesn't mean
being there all the time.

578
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,422
Love is more than that.

579
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,035
WE LOVE YOU!

580
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,059
You know what? If you have nothing to say,
then I’ll just turn this off.

581
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,063
Belated happy birthday!

582
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,234
That's all? You’re done?

583
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,195
You’re so confusing!

584
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,239
I’m confusing?

585
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,075
Really? Please, Lex!

586
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,743
Are you bored?
Is that why you're talking to me?

587
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,120
Is that why you're playing me around?

588
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,080
You gave me a gift? You, jerk!

589
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,416
- Hey, foul!
- What foul?

590
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,712
25B Ilang-Ilang Street, Marikina City.

591
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,505
- So, what now?
- What do you mean "what now"?

592
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,965
That's where I had your gift sent
five days ago.

593
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,842
Lex, enough, please.

594
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,677
Enough of this!

595
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,638
I accepted your call for you
to stop playing me around!

596
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,849
Okay? Not me! Stop fooling me!

597
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,644
That's all? You don't plan to apologize?

598
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,022
Apologize? Me?

599
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,860
Me? Apologize to you?

600
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,367
Lex, why are you doing this?

601
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,537
Are you bored?

602
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,248
Why are you fooling me?

603
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,626
Do I look gullible? Am I dumb?

604
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,962
You're so annoying!

605
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,724
Karen,

606
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,851
sit down.

607
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:07,900
Please.

608
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,153
Sit down. Let's talk.

609
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,034
Please?

610
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:28,295
You said you went there twice, right?

611
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,464
Me too, twice.

612
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,383
Hey, wait.

613
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,261
Don't talk yet. Okay?

614
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,221
Let's talk about this.
Let's clear this up.

615
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,101
Did you really go to Kilometer Zero?

616
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,276
Oh? Wait.

617
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,696
Don't get mad yet.
The answer is yes or no.

618
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,074
Let's try to clarify
everything that happened.

619
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,953
Let's clear this up because maybe
we just missed each other.

620
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,957
So, did you really go to Kilometer Zero?

621
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,293
Yes.

622
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,254
Manila, Kilometer Zero.

623
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,590
There you go.

624
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,176
Very good. Let's talk calmly.

625
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,762
Okay? No shouting.

626
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,849
Uhm…

627
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,103
Which part of Kilometer Zero
did you go to?

628
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,440
In front of the Centennial Clock.

629
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,694
Good. Me too. That’s where I went.

630
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,032
Okay, next.

631
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,910
Did you go there at 7:00 p.m.?

632
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,330
Not 7:00 a.m. but 7:00 p.m.

633
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,165
I told you.

634
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:50,419
Seven p.m., night. It’s dark. Okay?

635
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,338
- I took a selfie, right?
- Wait.

636
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,465
Calm down. Okay?

637
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,425
Calm down. Just relax.

638
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,637
You just celebrated your birthday,
and now you’re hot-tempered.

639
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,096
Don’t match the storm outside.

640
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,640
Storm? It’s your fault!

641
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,558
Just calm down. Calm down.

642
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,435
Okay, next.

643
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,190
The first one was September 14th.

644
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,276
Second, September 15th.

645
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,237
Fourteenth and 15th.

646
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,240
Maybe you went there on a different date,
that's why we didn't see each other.

647
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,533
Yes.

648
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,578
September 14, Saturday.

649
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,830
September 15, Sunday.

650
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,748
What?

651
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,001
September 14 is a Monday.

652
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,547
- Then, September 15 is a Tuesday.
- So, the dates aren’t matched, too?

653
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,718
Wait!

654
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,308
Here! Read it!

655
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,851
Read it. Here.

656
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,353
Wait.

657
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,064
14, Saturday.

658
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,148
Here.

659
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,901
15, Sunday?

660
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:57,736
Are we good?

661
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,782
Wait! Wait.

662
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,911
Now, you read it.

663
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,163
Read this, Karen. Okay?

664
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,668
September 14, Monday.

665
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,922
September 15, Tuesday.

666
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:18,966
See?

667
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,551
Okay?

668
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,679
So, it’s Monday and Tuesday.

669
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,059
Wow!

670
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,228
Hey, what's your problem?

671
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,563
What’s wrong with you?

672
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,649
Your calendar is old! It's from 2009!

673
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,192
Is this a prank?

674
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,611
Huh?

675
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,779
Yes, it is 2009.

676
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,989
It’s year 2009 now.

677
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,158
What? 2009?

678
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,868
2024!

679
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,369
Are you crazy?

680
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,579
Look!

681
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,538
Here.

682
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,834
2024?

683
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,009
Hey!

684
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,887
Hey.

685
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,014
Hey!

686
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,225
You're in Marikina, right?

687
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,685
This again?

688
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,353
Can you…

689
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,857
open the window? Let me see the outside.

690
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,150
What are you thinking?

691
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,776
Come on, please.

692
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:22,946
Wait!

693
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:26,909
Here!

694
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,455
What's this about?

695
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,712
Are we good?

696
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,298
Wait. Look at this.

697
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,094
Look at this.

698
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,348
<i>Earlier, in an emergency meeting</i>
<i>that was scheduled</i>

699
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,099
<i>by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo,</i>

700
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,644
- <i>Defense Secretary…</i>
- What’s this?

701
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,063
Prank? Your set-up is amazing!

702
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,482
<i>Rescue operations are underway</i>
<i>in the towns of Marikina,</i>

703
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,400
<i>Cainta, Pasig, and other neighborhoods.</i>

704
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,403
<i>More than 20 rubber boats</i>
<i>and 20 six-by-six trucks</i>

705
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,241
<i>have been deployed to these places</i>
<i>to save people--</i>

706
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,163
Karen,

707
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,832
I've been wanting to talk to you
about this since last night.

708
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,669
<i>Because Metro Manila</i>
<i>is experiencing a typhoon now,</i>

709
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,337
<i>the Typhoon Ondoy.</i>

710
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,423
And the entire Metro Manila
is in a state of calamity,

711
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,342
and Marikina is flooded.

712
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,140
It's only 2009 here, so, I guess,

713
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,893
it’s 2024 there?

714
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:35,996
I'm still not convinced.

715
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,457
<i>I still need proof.</i>

716
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,335
If I need a proof,
it should come from you.

717
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,128
Huh? Why me?

718
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,921
You’re in the future.

719
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,882
I can't give you anything

720
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:50,427
that you can't research
because I'm in the past.

721
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,680
So, it should be something
that hasn’t happened here yet.

722
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,725
Whoo!

723
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,977
It's weird, but it's cool.

724
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:00,854
Okay.

725
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,357
What proof do you want?

726
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,859
What will happen here tomorrow?

727
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,486
I don't know.

728
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,988
Think of what can happen here tomorrow

729
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,949
that was recorded on the Internet
or in the newspapers.

730
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,368
<i>Something like that.</i>

731
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,661
Tomorrow?

732
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,042
September 27, 2009.

733
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,002
Lotto!

734
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:28,882
For sure, there is an online record
of the lotto results tomorrow.

735
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,967
Okay, game!

736
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,428
Wait. Uhm…

737
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,849
September 27, 2009.

738
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,018
Lotto results.

739
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,187
Gotcha!

740
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,314
<i>Some of the victims</i>

741
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,565
<i>drifted away from the river</i>

742
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,735
<i>and were never again seen</i>
<i>by their loved ones.</i>

743
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,861
<i>Ten of these people</i>

744
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,948
<i>were taken away by the Marikina river,</i>
<i>including six kids.</i>

745
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,783
<i>The cemetery has a list of their clothes</i>

746
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,202
<i>and some of the victims' identification.</i>

747
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,539
My Lord, have mercy. Poor people.

748
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:04,209
Papa, after the typhoon,
we need to help them.

749
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,086
Check where we can donate.

750
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,421
Yes, Mama.

751
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,005
<i>Of course, you need to find them.</i>

752
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,340
<i>So, if someone is looking,</i>

753
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,718
<i>we tell them the whereabouts rightaway.</i>

754
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:13,969
Wait!

755
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,555
- It's news time!
- Pa, wait.

756
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,724
Just a minute. One minute, please.

757
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,058
Please.

758
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,354
<i>And the lucky number combination</i>

759
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,647
<i>for lotto tonight,</i>

760
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,567
<i>for 16 million pesos,</i>

761
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,486
<i>September 27, 2009, is…</i>

762
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,490
Son, when did you start playing the lotto?

763
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,242
Wait. Okay?

764
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,287
<i>Here are the numbers that will be drawn.</i>

765
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,415
- <i>Forty-two.</i>
- <i>Forty-two.</i>

766
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,709
- <i>Forty.</i>
- Forty!

767
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,169
<i>Forty.</i>

768
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,045
- <i>Zero four.</i>
- Zero four!

769
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,131
<i>Zero four.</i>

770
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,048
- <i>Thirty.</i>
- Thirty!

771
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,216
<i>Thirty.</i>

772
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,386
- <i>Forty-six.</i>
- Forty-six!

773
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,054
<i>Forty-six.</i>

774
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,390
<i>And the last number is…</i>

775
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,602
- <i>Thirty-five.</i>
- Thirty-five!

776
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,020
<i>Thirty-five!</i>

777
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,105
Thank you, Lord!

778
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,398
We won!

779
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,733
We won!

780
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:10,776
<i>And we have…</i>

781
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,319
<i>No winner.</i>

782
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,487
<i>No winner!</i>

783
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,989
Yes! Yes!

784
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,699
- Yes!
- Why didn’t you place a bet?

785
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,867
You didn’t play.

786
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,162
I just made a guess.

787
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,123
- What? You guessed?
- My God!

788
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,042
I thought you placed a bet.

789
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,752
You shouted as if you placed a bet.

790
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:29,711
Yes!

791
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:31,880
What a waste!

792
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,049
What a waste.

793
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,551
We could have used it as donation.

794
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,889
That's why I couldn't contact you.

795
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,392
I was just seven years old that time.

796
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,062
Why couldn't I contact you?

797
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,273
Weird.

798
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:00,367
Wait. What's your Facebook account?
Friendster?

799
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,829
Friendster? Friendster is gone.

800
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,330
Where are you going?

801
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,248
What?

802
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,165
How did that happen?

803
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,334
What…

804
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,293
Karen, you can ride with me.

805
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,586
No, thank you! I already booked a ride.

806
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,712
Bye!

807
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,674
How will I have social media

808
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,093
when I don't even have
a cell phone then, right?

809
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,053
Are you on Facebook?

810
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,096
Wait, wait.

811
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,599
So, you're going
to look for me in my future?

812
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,017
Yes.

813
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,853
I don’t want to look at my future.

814
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:31,857
And you'll find out
what I look like by then.

815
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,149
If I'm still alive, right?

816
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,527
Huh? Why would you die?

817
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,528
Are you sick?

818
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,947
No. You can’t predict the future.

819
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:44,119
Because I might suddenly
get eaten whole by a shark.

820
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,079
Or I might get hit by a train.

821
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,998
I might be gone.

822
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,833
Hey, knock on wood!

823
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,463
So, if you're already 36 here,

824
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,549
maybe we never really met.

825
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,843
<i>Maybe you already have a family here.</i>

826
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,971
Okay, but keep it to yourself.

827
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,473
<i>Alexander Ramos.</i>

828
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,725
<i>Karen, I'll say it again.</i>

829
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,437
Whatever you find out there,

830
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:14,316
please keep it to yourself.

831
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,526
Okay.

832
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,196
Since we don't know what will happen

833
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,240
and until when,

834
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,701
let's leave it at that.

835
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,244
Carpe Diem!

836
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,121
- Seize the day!
- Seize the day!

837
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,171
Karen, what's going to happen
to the world in the next 15 years?

838
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,256
I have many stories to tell you.

839
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,633
Brace yourself.

840
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,053
Sir, take care of that.

841
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,012
Thank you!

842
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,641
I'll follow in a while.

843
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,020
Just wait a bit, Ms. Karen.

844
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,146
Okay, sir.

845
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,528
Here!

846
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,364
All done. Thank you, Sir Paco.

847
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,115
Thank you. I'll go ahead.

848
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,076
Take care.

849
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,413
Sir, I thought you're an architect.

850
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,539
Yeah, why?

851
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,792
I just got confused.

852
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,545
Usually, only seafarers
have miniature ships.

853
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,925
That's a miniature of MV Maricar.

854
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,844
The ship MV Maricar.

855
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,639
MV Maricar?

856
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:28,807
Yes.

857
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,767
It sank in 1988.

858
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,103
I was just four years old then.

859
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:37,440
Luckily, someone saved me,
but I never saw my family after that.

860
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,611
But it's like a miracle
that I met one of my brothers.

861
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,947
He survived.

862
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,367
So, I decided to have it made

863
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,411
for my parents,

864
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,871
for my other siblings,
that I never saw again.

865
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,957
Just to remind me of them.

866
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,460
Hoping that some of them
are still alive now.

867
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,299
How many siblings do you have, sir?

868
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,468
Five.

869
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,765
While the ship was sinking,

870
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:15,478
a married couple with five children
approached them.

871
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,899
They begged to save me

872
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,028
because they couldn’t save us all.

873
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,195
<i>I was still a baby then.</i>

874
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,407
<i>They're my real family, Karen.</i>

875
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,954
Did you have a baby sibling that time?

876
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,249
Yes. He’s the one I met, Philip.

877
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,460
He’s the youngest. Why?

878
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,502
Philip?

879
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,006
Philip Villanueva.

880
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,341
But he now uses the name Alexander Ramos.

881
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,676
Long story.

882
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,261
You mean Lex?

883
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,638
Do you know my brother?

884
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,225
Where is your brother now?

885
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,728
He's now based in Italy.

886
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,188
He's working there.

887
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,814
So, you know each other?

888
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,566
So, did you meet?

889
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,611
Yeah, he found me in 2009.

890
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:08,948
He said someone gave him
some info about me.

891
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:09,866
Wait.

892
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,912
When did you meet in 2009, sir?

893
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,705
Actually,

894
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,083
it’ll be next week, but in 2009.

895
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,835
It's been 15 years already.

896
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,592
Are you okay, Ms. Karen?

897
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,554
Sorry.

898
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,556
Sorry, sir.

899
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,141
Sorry, I have to go.

900
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,781
Joaquin Villanueva.

901
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:55,411
You'll meet him next week, Lex. 2009.

902
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,747
You found him.

903
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,544
You found him, Karen.

904
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,130
I don't know.

905
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,423
It just happened.

906
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,934
I have a big brother.

907
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:34,284
I’M JOAQUIN VILLANUEVA. WHO’S THIS?

908
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,010
<i>Hello. Are you the one who messaged?</i>

909
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,344
Hi! Yes.

910
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,723
I'm Lex. Alexander Ramos.

911
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,683
<i>Are you also a survivor?</i>

912
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,485
Come in, son.

913
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,093
Son, is there a problem?

914
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,434
- Huh?
- Pa.

915
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,105
Lex?

916
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,296
Um, Karen, Bonbon.

917
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,342
You know how much I love your mama.

918
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,596
And we have already talked to your dad.

919
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:25,812
And we have… decided…

920
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,941
to get married next year.

921
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:30,858
Yes!

922
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,194
Long overdue!

923
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,823
- Congrats, Ma!
- Thank you!

924
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,493
What month next year?

925
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,996
Nothing yet, just next year.

926
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,166
Congrats!

927
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,627
Congrats, Stepdad Miguel!

928
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,921
Thank you!

929
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,176
<i>Do we need to reach this point?</i>

930
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,178
It's my future!

931
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,264
Karen, I think it's wrong.

932
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,640
No!

933
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,892
We found your brother, right? See?

934
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:05,977
It's okay.

935
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,062
Maybe that’s why this is happening to us.

936
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,440
For us to correct something in our past.

937
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,446
So, what?

938
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,823
It’s fine with you
that a family will be broken,

939
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,326
even if you can do something to avoid it?

940
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,329
Who said that
your family is broken, Karen?

941
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,748
Aunt Pam and your stepdad Miguel’s
relationship is good.

942
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,499
Why do we need to do this?

943
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,460
Lex, you don't understand me!

944
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,545
We can still be complete again,

945
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,756
and you're the only one who can do that!

946
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,301
Please?

947
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:43,973
Just this one time.

948
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,518
Promise.

949
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,941
So, what do you plan to do?

950
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,738
My papa!

951
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,338
<i>Dear Mr. Lopez,</i>

952
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,757
<i>you don't know me,</i>

953
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,302
<i>but I hope you’ll believe</i>
<i>what I'm about to say.</i>

954
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,722
<i>I saw what would happen to your future.</i>

955
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,809
<i>Your family will be broken.</i>

956
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,645
<i>But you can avoid that</i>

957
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,147
<i>if you ask for forgiveness from your wife</i>

958
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,567
<i>and promise to fix your relationship.</i>

959
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,278
<i>This is for your children.</i>

960
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,447
<i>Future Guy.</i>

961
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,410
Karen, after this,
let's go to the stockroom.

962
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,120
Help Mommy there.

963
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:48,955
Okay, Mama.

964
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,592
Hey, sis,
there's still breakfast on the table.

965
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,927
Hurry up. We might be late!

966
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:49,140
Yes, we'll be there
by 10:00 a.m., for sure.

967
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,434
What?

968
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,187
Karen, get dressed now!

969
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,190
Okay, 48 bottles. Are you sure?

970
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,150
Thank you so much, my regular client!

971
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,611
Ma, where’s Papa?

972
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,451
<i>Bonbon.</i>

973
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,166
Condolence, Karen.

974
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,254
<i>Ma?</i>

975
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,222
<i>Papa!</i>

976
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,790
Papa became an alcoholic, Lex.

977
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,169
<i>He died three years ago.</i>

978
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,505
Liver failure.

979
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:52,054
Sorry, I tried to help,
but I never thought it would lead to this.

980
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:56,100
Papa’s gone.

981
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,275
It's my fault!

982
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,568
I shouldn't have asked you!

983
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:09,822
I shouldn't have meddled!
It's all my fault!

984
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,496
Karen…

985
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,373
maybe it's not too late.

986
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,876
He's still alive in my timeline.

987
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,462
My Mama, my Mama.

988
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,380
She's going through everything alone.

989
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,925
Mama’s alone, Lex.

990
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,136
Wait.

991
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:37,266
Didn't you say that your mom and dad
had a major fight

992
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,809
because of the portrait?

993
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:42,063
When was that again?
Maybe we can use that to stop it.

994
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,192
It's gone. It was my birthday.

995
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,610
It's over.

996
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:51,614
Wait.

997
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,494
Mama.

998
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,044
Good afternoon!

999
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:07,922
Yes?

1000
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,676
This is for Mrs. Pamela Lopez.

1001
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:19,308
Delivery from Cakes and Sweets.

1002
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,811
Maybe the address is wrong.

1003
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,562
I didn't order a cake.

1004
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,440
I didn't make a mistake

1005
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,652
because it says
25B Ilang-Ilang Street, Marikina City.

1006
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,487
This is for you--

1007
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,280
Ma'am.

1008
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,410
Who sent this?

1009
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,371
Ma'am, there's nothing written on the box.

1010
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,707
I think they didn’t put it there.

1011
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:46,043
But there's something written
on the cake that says…

1012
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,753
"Happy Family Day!"

1013
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:48,963
Then,

1014
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,800
"Love, your husband and your children."

1015
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,428
Did you open it?

1016
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:59,348
I just helped with the icing, ma'am.

1017
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,852
That's all. Okay, ma'am.

1018
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:03,978
- Thank you!
- Thank you, ma'am!

1019
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,401
Is it Family Day today?

1020
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,154
Someone sent a cake.

1021
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,546
Wow! There's a cake!

1022
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,882
Bonbon, there’s a cake!

1023
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:42,683
Karen.

1024
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:30,940
Sis!

1025
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,532
Breakfast is ready.

1026
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,408
Come, let's eat!

1027
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,328
How’s baby Miguel?

1028
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,288
Let's eat, babe.

1029
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,541
- Bonbon?
- Sis, let’s eat.

1030
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,917
Papa's on the way.

1031
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,752
I'll ride with him to the highway.

1032
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:55,339
By the way, sis.
Mama's attorney will call later.

1033
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:56,757
The hearing will proceed next week.

1034
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,050
What hearing?

1035
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:03,139
You’re the one who follows up
Mama’s case in Singapore, right?

1036
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,395
<i>Bonbon got someone pregnant.</i>

1037
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,606
Mama is in prison.

1038
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,485
<i>Papa's alive.</i>

1039
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,445
<i>They're not separated.</i>

1040
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:20,239
But…

1041
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,953
I don't know why this is happening, Lex.

1042
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:31,041
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

1043
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:35,045
<i>I just want us all to be together.</i>

1044
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,051
Give me three days.

1045
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,470
I'll try to get you guys back together.

1046
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,310
For the last time, trust me.

1047
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,325
Philip?

1048
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:50,996
Lex?

1049
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,395
My youngest brother!

1050
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,648
Joaquin.

1051
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,153
Ma?

1052
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:09,158
- There's breakfast on the table.
- Bonbon!

1053
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,910
Sis, I’m wet. I just came from the shower.

1054
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,203
Ma?

1055
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,121
Ma?

1056
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,540
Yes?

1057
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,251
Are you okay?

1058
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:22,046
Stepdad Miguel?

1059
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,639
I think I want to cook squid.

1060
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,058
Yes! My favorite!

1061
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,184
Stepdad Miguel, let me help you.

1062
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,101
Ma?

1063
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,575
Lex, where are you?

1064
01:13:58,892 --> 01:13:59,935
Pa,

1065
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,229
I'm here in the stockroom now.

1066
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,148
<i>Baby, the yellow envelope.</i>

1067
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,525
<i>It says it's for CBA.</i>

1068
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,944
Okay, I'll call you later.

1069
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,195
Thanks, baby!

1070
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,412
Gotcha!

1071
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:27,671
Okay.

1072
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:04,309
X

1073
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,394
E

1074
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,062
L…

1075
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,730
Lex?

1076
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:13,360
<i>25B Ilang-Ilang Street, Marikina City.</i>

1077
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:15,070
That's where I sent
your gift five days ago.

1078
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:16,905
Sis, my Statistics homework!

1079
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,992
<i>Bonbon, you’re annoying!</i>
<i>Don't you know how to knock?</i>

1080
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,077
- <i>I'll kick you out!</i>
- <i>Bye, sis!</i>

1081
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:14,921
Oh, God.

1082
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,675
Just relax, Ma. It'll be okay.

1083
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:25,849
Ma’am, sir! Paco is here.

1084
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:28,185
He's also handsome!

1085
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:38,403
Ma, Pa.

1086
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:48,288
My older brother.

1087
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:55,337
Good afternoon.

1088
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:10,912
<i>Everything that comes to our lives</i>

1089
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,290
<i>is a blessing</i>
<i>that we should be thankful for.</i>

1090
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:15,542
<i>Mama, Papa,</i>

1091
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,502
<i>and now, my brother.</i>

1092
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,171
<i>I don't have anything else to ask for.</i>

1093
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,338
<i>Thank you, Karen.</i>

1094
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,967
<i>Lex is right.</i>

1095
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,594
<i>Nothing needs to be changed.</i>

1096
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:30,056
<i>You just need to be contented</i>
<i>and love those who love you.</i>

1097
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,705
Hey, you made a wish!

1098
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,337
Stepdad Miguel,

1099
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:04,382
why did you choose Mama?

1100
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,550
I love her.

1101
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,891
How do you know if…

1102
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:15,936
you really love someone?

1103
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:19,981
I'll tell you a story.

1104
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,025
I didn't tell this to your mom.

1105
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:23,443
You're the only one who will know this.

1106
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:26,655
But this is our secret.

1107
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:29,241
Come here.

1108
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,913
I met someone before.

1109
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,374
He was selling this blue car to me.

1110
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,626
He said

1111
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,670
he's from the future.

1112
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:45,757
Chopper?

1113
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,344
He came to me with this car.

1114
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:51,096
He was selling it to me.

1115
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:52,722
He said,

1116
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,725
50% off.

1117
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,853
But there's a deal.

1118
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:00,814
What deal?

1119
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:04,317
He said, two years from now,

1120
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,570
2011,

1121
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:10,282
I will meet a woman in a bazaar.

1122
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,576
<i>Her name is Pamela.</i>

1123
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,286
<i>She‘s selling gourmet dried fish.</i>

1124
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,290
You need to buy gourmet dried fish,

1125
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,000
three bottles, the spicy one.

1126
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,543
That's the deal.

1127
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,461
At first, I was thinking,

1128
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,840
"What is this? A joke?"

1129
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:30,343
Or someone crazy who’s bored
with his money.

1130
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,264
But…

1131
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,018
when I saw your mom,

1132
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:43,231
it's true that time slowed down.

1133
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:49,779
<i>It’s like I really wanted</i>
<i>to hear her voice.</i>

1134
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:53,116
<i>And then I learned that she's separated</i>

1135
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,493
<i>and she has two babies,</i>

1136
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,787
<i>you and Bonbon.</i>

1137
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,956
<i>But I simply didn't care.</i>

1138
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,668
<i>She accepted me even though</i>
<i>I can’t give her kids.</i>

1139
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,922
<i>She said that you and Bonbon</i>
<i>are enough for her.</i>

1140
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,884
<i>And she will take care of the three of us.</i>

1141
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:14,930
Karen,

1142
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:20,477
you accepted me wholeheartedly
in your lives.

1143
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,606
And maybe that's what love is.

1144
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:30,403
To love and accept the person you love,

1145
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,614
whoever the person is,

1146
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:33,907
or whatever the person is.

1147
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,286
It's magic.

1148
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,167
You know, Karen,

1149
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:49,255
the reason why I want you
to work with me in the garage

1150
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,803
is because I want to get closer to you.

1151
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:00,600
I know that I can't replace your dad
in your heart.

1152
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,231
But we can be family.

1153
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:08,608
Right?

1154
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,612
Because I love all of you.

1155
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,712
I love you, Dada.

1156
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:30,630
I love you, Dada.

1157
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:33,216
What did you call me?

1158
01:23:36,886 --> 01:23:37,804
Dada.

1159
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,559
I'm sorry, Dada.

1160
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,853
I'm sorry.

1161
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:03,329
Ma.

1162
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,040
How are you?

1163
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,005
You know, 30 years ago,

1164
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,674
your dad and I were also here,

1165
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,260
looking at it.

1166
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,513
We closed our eyes at the same time.

1167
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,517
We smiled at the same time.

1168
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,192
You were happy earlier.

1169
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,906
And that happiness is immeasurable.

1170
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,582
That's how we felt
when you came into our lives.

1171
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:55,632
Lex,

1172
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,636
you will always be our son.

1173
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:07,560
Ma.

1174
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,774
I love you and Dad so much.

1175
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:21,574
And if

1176
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:25,829
my real parents were alive,

1177
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:31,626
the love I have for you will not change.

1178
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:37,215
And Ma,

1179
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:42,095
when I saw my brother Paco yesterday,

1180
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,764
it’s like something
had been added to my life.

1181
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,561
And it was so light.

1182
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:51,771
So light.

1183
01:25:57,318 --> 01:26:00,155
That's also how I felt
when you came into my life.

1184
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:08,246
You made us complete.

1185
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:15,920
Son.

1186
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:21,342
Family is not about being blood-related.

1187
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,222
It’s about what’s inside the heart.

1188
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:37,150
I love you.

1189
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:38,902
I love you.

1190
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,371
So, what now?

1191
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,167
We're already two in your heart.

1192
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,004
Is that okay?

1193
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,714
Huh?

1194
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,635
Wait a minute.

1195
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:07,597
Why is--

1196
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,974
Why is Chopper not in the garage?

1197
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:14,187
It wasn't in the garage.

1198
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:24,173
Hello.

1199
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:28,720
Hi.

1200
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,023
I'm sorry.

1201
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:46,904
I'm really sorry.

1202
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,710
I was the reason
why your parents separated.

1203
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,056
I didn't know.

1204
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,100
I didn't know.

1205
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,399
I didn't know it would come to this.

1206
01:29:26,986 --> 01:29:27,945
I shouldn't…

1207
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,284
have sent your portrait.

1208
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:36,537
I wish it didn't happen.

1209
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:39,207
Sorry.

1210
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,336
You didn't know.

1211
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:46,214
I'm not mad at you.

1212
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:48,591
Besides,

1213
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:50,718
you're the one who found a way

1214
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,137
to make everything back to normal, right?

1215
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:58,184
You even went to Dada Miguel.

1216
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:02,063
You even sold Chopper.

1217
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,317
I want to give you…

1218
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:11,447
a happy and complete family, Karen.

1219
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:16,869
You did, Lex.

1220
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:19,330
You did it.

1221
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:23,584
You’re not mad?

1222
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:28,589
I'm not mad at you.

1223
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:35,096
We tried so many times
to change my future,

1224
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:38,891
but it still stays the same.

1225
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:44,689
Maybe all of this
was meant to happen, Lex.

1226
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:46,732
You,

1227
01:30:47,733 --> 01:30:48,734
me,

1228
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:50,528
Stepdad Miguel--

1229
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:53,239
I mean, Dada,

1230
01:30:53,322 --> 01:30:54,615
the portrait.

1231
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:01,122
I kept looking for a change,

1232
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:06,210
but I didn't see how happy Mama,

1233
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,254
Bonbon,

1234
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,132
Dada, and even Papa

1235
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:13,885
were with what we have now.

1236
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:22,977
I didn't see that
there's nothing to change.

1237
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,236
Thank you, Lex.

1238
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:34,530
Thank you.

1239
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:36,741
Bro.

1240
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:40,286
- Bro.
- Little bro,

1241
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:42,246
can I just stay here?

1242
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,457
The other room is too big. It's scary.

1243
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,460
- Sure.
- Oops.

1244
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:52,215
- Sorry.
- Karen, it's my brother.

1245
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:53,424
My brother Paco.

1246
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:57,637
Bro, this is Karen.

1247
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,930
Hello.

1248
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:00,848
Hi, sir--

1249
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:03,768
Hi, Bro Paco.

1250
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,479
Don't take him too seriously.

1251
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:07,939
He's a charmer.

1252
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:09,649
But he's handsome, right?

1253
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:12,526
Go now, brother. Go there, over there.

1254
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:13,986
We’ll sleep next to each other. Quick.

1255
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,405
Bye, Karen. I'll be right back.

1256
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,617
Wow!

1257
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,202
So weird!

1258
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:25,998
I have another surprise.

1259
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:27,124
Huh?

1260
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:29,085
It's not over yet?

1261
01:32:29,168 --> 01:32:31,587
I think my heart
can’t take it anymore, Lex.

1262
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:32,922
Come on.

1263
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:34,882
Game?

1264
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:37,009
Game.

1265
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:43,015
I'll send you a picture. Wait for it.

1266
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:49,021
After I went to your stepdad Miguel,
I went to Marikina.

1267
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,485
I went to see you.

1268
01:32:58,990 --> 01:32:59,991
And…

1269
01:33:04,036 --> 01:33:05,246
we saw each other.

1270
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:09,834
<i>I told you something.</i>

1271
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:12,169
Souvenir from the past.

1272
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:14,505
Souvenir?

1273
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:17,758
Souvenir.

1274
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,012
Just take care of it.

1275
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:23,431
Take care of it. Don't lose it.

1276
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,726
And when you're 22 years old,

1277
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:28,352
and it's still with you…

1278
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,479
you'll get lucky.

1279
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:32,231
Oh, it has magic?

1280
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:37,570
Bonbon!

1281
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:42,950
Sis, what's that?

1282
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,785
Bonbon, I have an amulet.

1283
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:47,580
Thank you! What's your name?

1284
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:50,041
Aquaman.

1285
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,626
Thank you, Aquaman!

1286
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,797
Let's take a picture, okay?

1287
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:57,798
Come on, Bonbon.

1288
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:00,551
Let's take a picture with Aquaman.

1289
01:34:00,634 --> 01:34:01,469
Game.

1290
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:04,555
One, two, three, smile!

1291
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:17,318
You’re Aquaman?

1292
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:19,570
Did you get lucky?

1293
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:24,784
Magic.

1294
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,831
Last chance.

1295
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,625
Kilometer Zero.

1296
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,794
Monday, 7:00 p.m.

1297
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:36,796
Let's meet.

1298
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:39,799
Even if we don’t actually meet,

1299
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,676
just the same time.

1300
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:02,780
<i>In my time,</i>

1301
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:04,573
<i>in your time.</i>

1302
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:07,576
<i>In the same place,</i>

1303
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,162
<i>at the same time.</i>

1304
01:35:14,166 --> 01:35:15,668
<i>Let's be there at the same time,</i>

1305
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,131
<i>and think that we're together.</i>

1306
01:35:27,721 --> 01:35:29,306
<i>Let's close our eyes at the same time.</i>

1307
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,605
<i>I'll hold your hand.</i>

1308
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:38,524
<i>Together.</i>

1309
01:35:39,191 --> 01:35:40,359
<i>At the same time.</i>

1310
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,903
<i>In our own times.</i>

1311
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:44,947
<i>Let's be one.</i>

1312
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:48,325
<i>And let's wait for the magic.</i>

1313
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:50,578
<i>Magic?</i>

1314
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:50,471
Hi, Karen.

1315
01:36:52,806 --> 01:36:53,766
Lex?

1316
01:36:55,809 --> 01:36:56,894
How are you?

1317
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:03,359
Flowers?

1318
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:13,410
Otap, fresh from Cebu.

1319
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,954
It waited for 15 years.

1320
01:37:25,422 --> 01:37:27,550
A lot has happened in 15 years.

1321
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:28,926
A lot has changed.

1322
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:33,847
But what I feel for you, Karen,

1323
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:35,307
when I first saw you…

1324
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:38,060
stays

1325
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:39,937
here.

1326
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:47,778
<i>You're always with me.</i>

1327
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,905
<i>I always feel connected with you.</i>

1328
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:24,481
Great job, Mr. Ramos!

1329
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:28,444
Who’s this woman in all of your works?

1330
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:35,159
She’s my future.

1331
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:37,161
Beautiful!

1332
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:38,579
Yes.

1333
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,670
<i>In everything I think and do,</i>

1334
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:50,049
<i>you're always there, Karen.</i>

1335
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:52,384
<i>You became part of my life.</i>

1336
01:39:01,226 --> 01:39:03,520
September 14 and 15.

1337
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,815
Why didn't you see me, then?

1338
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,489
I've always been here, Karen.

1339
01:39:14,573 --> 01:39:15,991
Always.

1340
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:25,334
<i>September 14, 2024. Saturday.</i>

1341
01:39:25,959 --> 01:39:27,753
<i>I really wanted to approach you.</i>

1342
01:39:33,175 --> 01:39:36,970
<i>September 15, 2024. Sunday.</i>

1343
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:44,228
<i>I really wanted to hug you and tell you</i>
<i>that I'm here, Karen.</i>

1344
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:45,646
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

1345
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:51,485
If I met you earlier

1346
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:52,945
and I didn’t wait,

1347
01:39:54,446 --> 01:39:57,741
a lot of things might not have happened.

1348
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:01,745
Maybe this wouldn't have happened either.

1349
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:08,001
A lot of what ifs

1350
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:10,879
in those 15 years.

1351
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:14,925
A lot of questions. A lot of hopes

1352
01:40:19,555 --> 01:40:21,640
that we could have met…

1353
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:23,100
in the same timeline.

1354
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:31,233
<i>I wish I was there when you graduated</i>

1355
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,360
<i>to celebrate with you.</i>

1356
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:36,238
I thought you had a meeting.

1357
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:40,075
You're more important, my love.

1358
01:40:43,829 --> 01:40:46,373
- Congrats!
- Thank you, my love!

1359
01:40:50,043 --> 01:40:53,046
Yes, I'm on my way now. Yes, okay.

1360
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,882
See you. Bye!

1361
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:56,467
- I’ll take that.
- I’ll do it.

1362
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,968
- Sorry, sorry.
- Let me carry these.

1363
01:40:58,051 --> 01:40:59,928
Hello, I'm almost there.

1364
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:02,723
Yes. Okay, thank you!

1365
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:05,768
Gosh, wait!

1366
01:41:07,269 --> 01:41:09,188
Love, there’s no rain yet.

1367
01:41:10,355 --> 01:41:13,317
Love, it’s drizzling. See, look.

1368
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,444
Don't you have work today?

1369
01:41:15,527 --> 01:41:18,363
No, my boss is sick.

1370
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:23,452
- Thank you!
- Love, let's look for…

1371
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:26,163
<i>I wish I was there</i>
<i>when you were looking for a job.</i>

1372
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,999
<i>I'll go with you wherever,</i>

1373
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,584
<i>no matter what.</i>

1374
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:33,545
<i>I'll do everything for you, Karen.</i>

1375
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:40,803
Congrats!

1376
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:43,180
Thank you!

1377
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,641
You know what?

1378
01:41:47,726 --> 01:41:49,728
You're my lucky charm.

1379
01:41:54,066 --> 01:41:55,400
You are my lucky charm.

1380
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,030
Thank you!

1381
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:04,660
<i>I wish I was there when you</i>
<i>closed your first deal in real estate</i>

1382
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:09,164
<i>to tell you how brilliant you are</i>
<i>in everything that you do.</i>

1383
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:16,421
<i>I wish I was there when you were sad,</i>

1384
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:21,176
<i>so that I could show you</i>
<i>that I'm always here.</i>

1385
01:42:22,845 --> 01:42:26,265
<i>That I will never leave you,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1386
01:42:27,015 --> 01:42:29,309
<i>Never, Karen.</i>

1387
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:30,561
Here you go.

1388
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:31,687
This is hot.

1389
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:38,193
One more? It's hot.

1390
01:42:43,365 --> 01:42:44,658
<i>I wish…</i>

1391
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:47,411
<i>you and I…</i>

1392
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:49,162
<i>until the end.</i>

1393
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:57,212
Now,

1394
01:42:58,964 --> 01:43:00,007
I'm different.

1395
01:43:05,053 --> 01:43:06,889
I'm scared that--

1396
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:10,851
Lex.

1397
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,146
Fifteen years.

1398
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:18,650
You waited for me for 15 years.

1399
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:28,327
Karen, even if it's 20 years,

1400
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:31,246
I'd still wait for you.

1401
01:43:33,123 --> 01:43:34,416
As long as it's you.

1402
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:39,004
Nothing has changed.

1403
01:43:39,922 --> 01:43:41,715
Alexander Ramos,

1404
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:47,179
you're still my Aquaman.

1405
01:43:54,102 --> 01:43:55,771
Karenina Lopez…

1406
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:01,985
you’re still my Libra Gurl.

1407
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:09,242
So, what's next?

1408
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:12,120
Where do we start?

1409
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:20,837
From zero and beyond?

1410
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:23,757
From zero and beyond.

1411
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,768
<i>Among the billions</i>
<i>of people in this world,</i>

1412
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:37,854
<i>if you belong together,</i>

1413
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,773
<i>destiny will find a way.</i>

1414
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,859
<i>You don’t need to look for them</i>

1415
01:44:43,777 --> 01:44:47,823
<i>because they will come at the right time.</i>
