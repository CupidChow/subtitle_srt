1
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,439
Then I'll use the life you owe me

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,359
to trade for Old Street.

3
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,200
I owe you a life.

4
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:48,960
Amir.

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,960
Luanshan Copper Mine.

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,799
Who saved your life?

7
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,159
You.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,439
You're from Cloud Thunder's Thirteen Protectors.

9
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,759
Then I'll see you soon.

10
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,439
We await your esteemed presence.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,760
Let's go.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,760
Take me to Uncle Ghost Wolf's lair.

13
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,400
You really are a madman.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,719
You're right.

15
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,159
That's why they call me Madman Zhao.

16
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,519
I'll go alone.

17
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,879
You stay in Old Street.

18
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,239
What do you mean?

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,120
I can handle Uncle Ghost Wolf.

20
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,120
Shengzi.

21
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,120
Do you still consider me a brother or not?

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,280
It's precisely because I see you as a brother

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,359
that I won't let you come.

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,480
We still don't know what's going on with Hua Lian.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,680
I don't want anything else to happen to you.

26
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,120
Shengzi.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,480
I...

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,719
You don't trust me?

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,439
When has Zhao Fengsheng ever

30
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,799
let his brothers down?

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,879
I never heard Tianyu say she had a boyfriend.

32
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,879
How did she suddenly decide to get married?

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,319
This set looks nice.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,199
Tianyu will definitely like it.

35
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,280
If I ever get married one day...

36
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,240
Er Ni.

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,759
You're so beautiful.

38
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,560
Er Ni.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Marry me.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,599
Please marry me.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,560
My feelings for you are clear as day.

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,039
I'm willing to take care of you for a lifetime.

44
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,719
Really.

45
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,520
Qian

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,919
Tian

47
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,560
Yu!

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,840
Bai Yuchen!

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,560
Can't you tell good advice from bad?

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,960
You have the nerve to take credit

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,360
for Shengzi's achievements.

52
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,599
How blind was I?

53
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,520
I want to marry you.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,360
Er Ni.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,439
You'll soon be Mrs. Bai.

56
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,080
Isn't that a good thing?

57
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,560
Mom!

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,919
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

59
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,400
I don't like him.

60
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,759
Who do you like then?

61
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,240
You like that Zhao Fengsheng, huh?

62
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,719
In what way is he better than Yuchen?

63
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,759
He's a manager at a big company.

64
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,120
At least he can give you a good life.

65
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,840
Auntie.

66
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,439
Don't worry.

67
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,479
After Ya Qing and I get married,

68
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,120
I'll move you all to the city.

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,879
You won't have to suffer in Old Street anymore.

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,199
For you.

71
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,080
Great, great.

72
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,840
Take it back.

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,919
Auntie, this...

74
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,400
That would be wonderful.

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
Er Ni, come with me, quick!

76
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,400
Da Gang!

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,879
Why are you dressed like that?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,599
Today is my and Ya Qing's engagement day.

79
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,719
Jin Jungang, I'm warning you.

80
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,719
If you dare cause trouble for me,

81
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll show you what happens when you cross me.

82
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,319
Engagement?

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,639
Yes.

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,879
Er Ni!

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,599
How can you get engaged at a time like this?

86
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:08,919
I...

87
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,199
Shengzi was captured and taken to Uncle Ghost Wolf's lair!

88
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,319
Er Ni!

89
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
Why do you jump

90
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
the moment you hear Zhao Fengsheng's name?

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,879
So eager.

92
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,680
Aren't you ashamed?

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,279
Shame isn't important.

94
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,439
I can't let anything happen to him.

95
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,839
No, wait...

96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
Let's go, go, go!

97
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,279
Here, have a smoke, have a smoke.

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,360
Brothers, tomorrow's my treat.

99
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,519
Just mention Crow's name when you get there.

100
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,800
I guarantee you'll all be comfortable.

101
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,879
No problem, it's settled then.

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,079
I'll contact you tomorrow.

103
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm off first.

104
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,519
Thanks, thanks.

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
Thank you, thank you.

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,759
So intimidating.

107
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:06,879
Kid.

108
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,199
You've entered my Ghost Face Hall.

109
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,120
So shut your mouth.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,160
Kneel when you climb the steps.

111
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,000
Isn't this the uncle

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
I beat until he coughed up blood?

113
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,519
What?

114
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,720
Using your numbers to enforce rules on me?

115
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,399
You looking for death?

116
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,279
Daring to speak to Master Mu like that!

117
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm here to see Uncle Ghost Wolf.

118
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,800
What the hell is Mu Jinfu?

119
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,959
Does he run this hall?

120
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,040
You!

121
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,199
Uncle Wolf!

122
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,279
This punk is still so arrogant in our hall.

123
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,600
Shouldn't we teach him a lesson?

124
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,800
Old Wolf.

125
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,639
Was it you who had this bastard from Daixiang Village

126
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,519
traffic children?

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,720
Not to criticize you,

128
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,839
but trafficking kids damages your karma.

129
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,399
It's the kind of thing that gives your kids no assholes.

130
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,759
If I'd known you were rotten to the core,

131
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,360
I shouldn't have saved you back then.

132
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,480
You say you're from Cloud Thunder.

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,879
Got proof?

134
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,120
The leader of the Thirteen Protectors.

135
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,800
Seems you still remember me.

136
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,439
So?

137
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,439
Can we talk now?

138
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,279
Mr. Zhao.

139
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,720
Please, upstairs.

140
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,360
Uncle Wolf

141
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,839
This guy has some skills.

142
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,000
Have the brothers come together.

143
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,439
All of you, wait here for me.

144
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,800
What exactly is this Cloud Thunder?

145
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,839
Master Mu, do you know?

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
This Zhao Fengsheng...

147
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
What's his background, really?

148
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,240
Come, come, come.

149
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,079
I've hastily prepared a few simple dishes.

150
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,759
I hope Brother Zhao won't find them lacking.

151
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,480
Back when I was mining in Amir...

152
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,079
I ran into rebels.

153
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,480
If not for Brother Zhao bringing men to rescue me,

154
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,959
I, Old Wolf, probably

155
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,079
would have turned to bones long ago.

156
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,800
You remember quite clearly.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Brother Zhao, I truly didn't know

158
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
that the leader of Cloud Thunder's Thirteen Protectors

159
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,800
was actually Old Street's Zhao Fengsheng.

160
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,439
If I had known,

161
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,000
I would never have touched a single blade of grass on Old Street.

162
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,720
I see you as my savior,

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,399
and I wish to become one of your own even more.

164
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,279
If you give Old Wolf a chance,

165
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm willing to bring all my brothers

166
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,399
and our weapons to join you.

167
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,160
This glass of wine, I toast to you.

168
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,480
What era is this anymore?

169
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,360
Don't pull this routine.

170
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Coming back this time,

171
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,959
I just want to live a quiet life.

172
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,240
I heard

173
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,800
that Cloud Thunder's Young Master Li has returned to Jialong.

174
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,000
If there's a chance,

175
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,959
could you please help make a connection?

176
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,279
I'd like to express my respect.

177
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,040
Stop testing

178
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,519
my relationship with Li Xiangping.

179
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,079
And don't think about dragging other connections into this.

180
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,040
If you listen to me,

181
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,879
I can give you a chance to meet him.

182
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,519
But if you oppose me,

183
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,480
I wouldn't mind

184
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,199
having all of Cloud Thunder come and "take care" of you.

185
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,279
Yes.

186
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
It was my fault, Old Wolf's fault.

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,519
An entity like Cloud Thunder

188
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,399
shouldn't be something people like us

189
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,680
should be inquiring about.

190
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,080
I'll have my men withdraw from Old Street immediately.

191
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,080
Old Wolf.

192
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm not trying to fight you for territory.

193
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,720
Old Street is my home.

194
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,879
I don't want,

195
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,159
and I won't let anyone

196
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,799
disturb the lives of the neighbors.

197
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,559
Understood.

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,639
If needed,

199
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,759
my Ghost Face Hall,

200
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,519
all the brothers,

201
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,559
are willing to follow your orders.

202
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,159
Well said.

203
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
When I have time,

204
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,840
I'll take you to meet all the Cloud Thunder brothers.

205
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,840
Thank you, Brother Zhao.

206
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I, Old Wolf,

207
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,960
truly need such an opportunity

208
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,799
to personally thank all of Cloud Thunder's benefactors.

209
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,279
Brother.

210
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,639
Brother, stop fighting!

211
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,159
Stop fighting, brother!

212
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,000
Get away!

213
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,240
Move aside!

214
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,759
Get out of my way!

215
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,440
Screw you!

216
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,559
Who dares come closer?!

217
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,200
You're looking for death!

218
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,799
You kidnapped my brother's sister

219
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,480
and beat Painted Face up like this!

220
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,320
This grudge,

221
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,080
we, the Four Pests of Old Street,

222
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
have now settled with your Ghost Face Hall!

223
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,960
Zhao Fengsheng is one thing,

224
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,720
but you few losers dare to barge into Ghost Face Hall?!

225
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Looking to die?!

226
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,559
Brother!

227
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,279
Painted Face!

228
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,879
Don't be impulsive!

229
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,720
Mu Jinfu is a master.

230
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,879
You're no match for him.

231
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,080
He beat my brother up like this!

232
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,440
How can I not be impulsive?!

233
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,399
Gangzi!
