1
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,600
That's the smell.

2
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,359
Coal Mine Old Street

3
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm back.

4
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,159
Zhao Fengsheng

5
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,599
Zhao Fengsheng

6
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,400
Zhao Fengsheng

7
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,319
Zhao Fengsheng

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
Neighbors

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,359
Zhao Fengsheng

10
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,879
I'm back, neighbors.

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,000
Get out of here!

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,959
I'll kill you!

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,640
Get lost!

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,079
Wait a second.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,159
Neighbors

16
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,400
Don't waste such good food.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,560
Neighbors

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,640
You dare to come back?

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,799
Neighbors, listen to me.

20
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,519
Hold on.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,519
Hit him!

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,879
I've turned over a new leaf.

23
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,799
Neighbors

24
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,760
My name is Zhao Fengsheng.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,280
Five years ago,

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,439
my brothers and I crossed

27
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,640
the underworld in Bian Shui.

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,599
The trouble spread to the Old Street.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,599
Neighbors,

30
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,959
you had some small grievances with me.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,920
Boss.

32
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,159
Boss.

33
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,079
Members of the Yunting Mercenary Group's Southwest Squad,

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
reporting for duty.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,079
Report for what?

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,719
This is a gift from your brothers.

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,159
This is Bian Shui,

38
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,120
not Amir.

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,439
With your big show of force,

40
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,120
what if you scare my dear neighbors?

41
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:10,960
Boss,

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,680
we know

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,159
you're returning home quietly this time.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,000
That's why we only dared to wait for you here.

45
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
We didn't go near the Old Street at all.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,479
Xiao Jiu is still the sensible one.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,039
Brothers,

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,759
this time I'm back

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,520
just wanting to live a simple, quiet life.

50
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,960
It's also my parents' dying wish.

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,240
So take the gift back.

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,000
Boss,

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,479
it was all thanks to your leadership

54
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,520
that we brothers

55
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,199
were able to get out of Amir,

56
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,759
that living hell.

57
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,439
Yes.

58
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,159
Now,

59
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,039
the brothers have all inherited their family businesses.

60
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,080
My family

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,919
has also agreed to let me take over

62
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,479
all the operations in the Bian Shui area.

63
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,039
So,

64
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,599
from now on, just say the word, boss,

65
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,159
and in the Bian Shui area,

66
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
there's nothing my Li family can't handle.

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,039
What's all this shouting?

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,599
Can't you understand plain speech?

69
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,000
All of you, go back.

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,719
I'll call you if I need anything.

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,240
Yes, sir.

72
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,120
Those who forced me out of the Old Street

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,080
should get to know

74
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,120
Madman Zhao all over again.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,800
Zhao Fengsheng is back in Coal Mine Old Street.

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
We can't let him find out

77
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,319
our secret in the Old Street.

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,560
Find a way to drive him out.

79
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,479
Fight!

80
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,400
Go, go, go!

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,280
Fight!

82
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,199
Let's go, let's go!

83
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,960
What a disgraceful pose.

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,120
Can't control your pants, huh?

85
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,560
Who gave you the guts to sleep with my girl?

86
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,360
Brother Xiaobei,

87
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,919
Gangzi and I drank too much.

88
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,280
You can't blame him entirely.

89
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,199
Did I tell you to speak?

90
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,360
Chen Xiaobei, you human trafficker!

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,960
What kind of man bullies a woman?

92
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280
If you've got something, take it out on me!

93
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
That's more like it.

94
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,400
Brother Crow says

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,759
we're going to renovate this dump of a bathhouse

96
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,719
properly.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,840
Turn it into Bian Shui's biggest money pit.

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,080
That way,

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,639
Zhou Xiaoman and her sisters

100
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,240
will have a place to earn money, right?

101
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,080
Crow ruined the Old Street so badly.

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,919
And you're still working for him?

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
Don't you believe the neighbors will kill you?

104
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,479
In the neighbors' hearts, I, Chen Xiaobei,

105
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,800
am a good boy.

106
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,199
Do you think they'll believe me

107
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,519
or you, one of the Four Pests of the Old Street?

108
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,800
Besides,

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,639
the one who harmed the Old Street was Zhao Fengsheng.

110
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,600
What does that have to do with me, Chen Xiaobei?

111
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Xiao Bei.

112
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,439
Why is it that as soon as I'm back,

113
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,160
I hear you talking trash about me?

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,040
Shengzi!

115
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,240
Madman Zhao!

116
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,720
It really is you!

117
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,279
What are you doing?

118
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,360
Stop being so girly.

119
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,519
Because of Zhou Xiaoman,

120
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,879
Crow's people

121
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,279
want our bathhouse.

122
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,319
Brother Shengzi, all these years you...

123
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,079
Cut the crap.

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,439
Is this enough?

125
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,680
You think a lousy watch will get rid of me?

126
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,560
I want the whole darn bathhouse!

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,720
Think I'm giving you face, huh?

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
While I was away,

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,519
you tried a honey trap on my brother?

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,959
How about

131
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,879
you and I have a proper fight?

132
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,759
Zhao Fengsheng!

133
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,160
You still dare to oppose Brother Crow?

134
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,680
You ungrateful traitor!

135
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,199
Brother Xiaobei!

136
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,519
Since when is Zhao Fengsheng such a good fighter?

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Want to stay and learn a few moves from me?

138
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,639
Brother Shengzi!

139
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,399
You just wait!

140
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,839
Brother Crow will send people to deal with you!

141
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,480
Let's go.

142
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:52,839
Xiaoman.

143
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,240
Brother Gangzi.

144
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,920
Come on, let's go.

145
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,600
Go.

146
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,399
Hurry, go!

147
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,839
Shengzi

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,079
Oh my god

149
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Bro, I've missed you to death

150
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,240
Don't be so girly

151
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,680
Still haven't lost that Northeast accent

152
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,959
I'm a Northeast boy through and through

153
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,879
Don't wanna change it

154
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,319
How've you been all these years in prison?

155
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,199
Hurry up and take your clothes off

156
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,000
Let me see if you're missing anything

157
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
Who went to prison?

158
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,279
Who's spreading that rumor?

159
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,079
I wasn't in prison

160
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,720
Then why didn't you call once in five years?

161
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
I thought you...

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,439
Can't you wish me well?

163
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,959
You know what, kid?

164
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,639
Ever since the rumor you were in jail spread

165
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,959
Your "Madman Zhao" reputation got even louder

166
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,199
Now, in our Old Street

167
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,839
Whenever a kid starts crying

168
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,839
Just mention your name

169
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,000
They're guaranteed to shut right up

170
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,879
You're really my good brother, huh?

171
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,639
You've completely ruined my reputation

172
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,199
I'm sorry

173
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,519
Sorry, sorry, Shengzi

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,720
You just got back

175
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,879
Let me welcome you properly

176
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,120
Wash away the bad luck

177
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,160
Where's Hua Lian?

178
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,240
Hua Lian had some business to attend to

179
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
We won't wait for him

180
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,399
Let your big brother entertain you first

181
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,160
Can we get something a bit more decent?

182
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,160
Wait upstairs

183
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,720
Let's get you a girl for a massage

184
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,439
I'll make sure you're taken care of real nice

185
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,839
Hello, big brother

186
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm your masseuse for today

187
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,519
Just call me Lele

188
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,759
Gangzi's doing alright

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
Keeping such a sexy lady around

190
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,879
So, big brother, can I start

191
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,000
your massage now?

192
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,639
Lele, right?

193
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,839
Sure, sure

194
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,480
You look a bit unfamiliar, big brother

195
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,519
You're not from our Old Street

196
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,399
Just got back from abroad

197
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,279
It's normal you don't know me

198
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,600
Abroad, huh?

199
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,879
But I heard

200
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,000
girls overseas are very open

201
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,680
No, no, no

202
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,240
Whether they're open or not

203
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,040
depends entirely on personal charm

204
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,839
Take my looks, for example

205
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,759
Wherever I go

206
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,800
there's always

207
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,519
an open-minded sisterhood

208
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,519
Lele, Lele

209
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
A little lighter, please

210
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,279
Sorry, big brother

211
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,559
I'm pressing the acupoint for your kidneys

212
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,000
You're not... kidney-deficient, are you?

213
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,279
Kidney-deficient?

214
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,080
That's absolutely impossible

215
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,360
Press harder

216
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,039
I won't make a single sound

217
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Alrighty then

218
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,879
Shengzi just got back

219
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,600
Er Ni, take it easy

220
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,000
Don't break him

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,799
Er Ni?

222
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,480
It's your old lady, me

223
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,360
Who let this young mistress out?

224
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,440
Er Ni

225
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,919
Long time no see

226
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,639
You're something else, Zhao Fengsheng

227
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,559
No wonder I chased you for so long

228
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,840
and you never agreed

229
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,799
Turns out you like foreign girls

230
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
What's the matter?

231
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,559
Think I'm not open enough?

232
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,159
I'm wrong

233
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,120
I'm really wrong

234
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,679
Then tell me

235
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,320
why didn't you come find me first when you got back?

236
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,120
No, I... I...

237
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,120
Fine, don't say it

238
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,600
Come on, let's go get our marriage license

239
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,440
What?

240
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,600
Get married

241
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,559
I've waited over ten years for you

242
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,600
You dare disagree?

243
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,559
I was only gone for five years

244
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,000
How did it become over ten?

245
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,320
You're still playing dumb here?

246
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,240
I've been following you since I was sixteen

247
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,720
How many times have I confessed to you?

248
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,679
Every time, you found an excuse to avoid me

249
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,879
What's that supposed to mean?

250
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,399
You look down on me that much?

251
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,120
No

252
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,799
Er Ni

253
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,480
We're like brother and sister, too familiar

254
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,399
I don't mean it like that

255
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:15,639
I...

256
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,879
You don't mean it like that?

257
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,360
I don't believe it

258
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,320
Today, I'm gonna

259
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,639
force myself on you

260
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,440
Don't

261
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,480
You've grown up, huh
