1
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,560
Zhao Fengsheng

2
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,000
We meet again.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Tang Hongtu

4
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,159
Lure the tiger away from the mountain.

5
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,520
Zhao Fengsheng

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,679
You really think our Tang family

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,920
is so easy for you to control?

8
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,159
Zhao Fengsheng, oh Zhao Fengsheng.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,159
Ghost Face Hall members, listen up!

10
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,319
Yes!

11
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,400
Whoever finds the mine entrance

12
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,959
will be promoted directly to Hall Master.

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,760
Anyone who dares to resist,

14
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,599
kill them on the spot.

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,480
Yes, sir!

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,599
Mu Jinfu assassinated Uncle Gui Lang.

17
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,799
You people of Ghost Face Hall,

18
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,200
want to follow such a scoundrel?

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,959
Following Mr. Mu and Second Master Tang,

20
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,920
we get to live the good life.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,879
An old man like Uncle Gui Lang,

22
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,200
who only knows how to talk about rules,

23
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,359
should've died long ago.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,560
Enough talk!

25
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,400
Do it!

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,000
Money, money!

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,400
Protect the young lady!

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,920
Forget about the money!

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,640
Get out of here first!

30
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,000
Take Miss Qian and the others away first!

31
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,120
Go!

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,760
Darn it!

33
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,879
Come on!

34
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,400
Trying to keep the Four Pests of the Old Street here?

35
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,480
It's not that easy!

36
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,400
Let's go!

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Look at those moves.

38
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,280
Zhao Fengsheng must be an important figure in Cloud Thunder.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,919
If we let him escape,

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
no one can withstand Cloud Thunder's retaliation.

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,639
Zhao Fengsheng!

42
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,280
You're as troublesome as your father.

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,520
So you did know my father.

44
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,240
Did you kill him?

45
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,960
Go down and keep him company.

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,319
Brother!

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Shengzi!

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,800
Shengzi!

49
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,639
Shengzi!

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,039
Shengzi!

51
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,479
Get to the hospital, quick!

52
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,840
After them!

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,199
Forget about chasing them!

54
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,400
Finding the gold mine is what matters.

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,879
Old Mu!

56
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,080
Go and capture all the Qian family members for me.

57
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,360
Take the rest and hurry to find the mine.

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,360
You must be quick.

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,599
You few, come with me.

60
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,280
Follow me.

61
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,319
You two, take the case.

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,319
Miss Cui.

63
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,479
Let me stop your bleeding first.

64
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,639
Nurse!

65
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,319
Can you tell me

66
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,400
when Shengzi will wake up?

67
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,319
I don't know.

68
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,639
They're still operating inside.

69
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,719
Erni.

70
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,199
Shengzi is blessed and lucky.

71
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,160
Stop your bleeding first.

72
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,279
It's okay.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,120
Shengzi's life is so tough.

74
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,160
He's made it through so many close calls.

75
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,959
Even the Ox-Head and Horse-Face can't keep him.

76
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,160
Right, Hualian?

77
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,600
Brother will be fine.

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,000
He's fine.

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,399
Erni.

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,759
I haven't had your wedding wine yet.

81
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,519
Shengzi will definitely be okay.

82
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,120
I need a few more people!

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
Patient in OR three is hemorrhaging badly.

84
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,439
He's not going to make it.

85
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,560
Nurse!

86
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,680
What did you say?

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240
I said he's hemorrhaging badly!

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,399
Then what can I do?

89
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,120
Draw blood.

90
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,160
Take my blood.

91
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,680
I'm universal type O.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,759
Take mine.

93
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,399
I'm the same as my brother.

94
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:15,879
Nurse! Nurse!

95
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,519
Take mine.

96
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,399
I have plenty of blood.

97
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,519
Calm down, all of you.

98
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,319
The patient is in critical condition.

99
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,399
Don't delay us from saving him.

100
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,079
Zhao Fengsheng!

101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,279
You jerk!

102
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm telling you,

103
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,920
you better not die in there.

104
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,120
If you dare die in there,

105
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,439
I'll burn all your dirty magazines

106
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,720
at your house.

107
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,879
Doctor!

108
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,759
How is he?

109
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm very sorry.

110
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,519
We did everything we could.

111
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,639
Doctor...

112
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,800
Zhao Fengsheng!

113
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,439
Don't think you can leave me behind!

114
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,519
I'm telling you,

115
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,079
even as a ghost I'll haunt you!

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,439
Shengzi!

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Shengzi!

118
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,519
Shengzi!

119
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
Shengzi!

120
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,839
What's all the noise?

121
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,319
Weren't you told to wait over there?

122
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,279
My brother is gone!

123
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,439
Where am I supposed to wait?

124
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,560
What do you mean, gone?

125
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,079
Zhao Fengsheng has already been wheeled out of the OR.

126
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,040
What are you doing?

127
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,360
Wheeled out?

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,879
Wasn't he inside?

129
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,199
Zhao Fengsheng was in OR two.

130
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,399
The one inside is OR three.

131
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Crying...

132
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,279
...at the wrong grave.

133
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,319
Also, Zhao Fengsheng asked me to give you a message.

134
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
Go on.

135
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,759
One of you has a voice like a duck,

136
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,759
the other is like Sun Erniang.

137
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,759
Learn from the quiet one.

138
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,800
Stop howling.

139
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,519
This...

140
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,000
sounds like something Shengzi would say.

141
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
Shengzi is okay.

142
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,560
He's okay.

143
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,600
He's okay.

144
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
It's good that he's okay.

145
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,279
It's good that he's okay.

146
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm going to find that jerk Zhao Fengsheng

147
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,240
and settle the score.

148
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,920
You jerk!

149
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,839
I'm going to kill you!

150
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,800
Wait for me!

151
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,040
All these years

152
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,319
I've finally obtained it.

153
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,920
From a mere street vendor to the King of Bian Shui.

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,720
From now on,

155
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,720
my Tang family will be Bian Shui's number one clan.

156
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,800
With this gold,

157
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,079
what is the Li family?

158
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,279
What is Li Xiangping?

159
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,639
Second Master.

160
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,720
The people from the Old Street

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
are already trapped in the casino by us.

162
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Before I finish mining this gold,

163
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,639
keep them cooped up in the casino.

164
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,879
Anyone who dares to come out,

165
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,279
just kill them.

166
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,039
Good.

167
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,639
Second Master.

168
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,960
The Qian father and daughter

169
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,639
have been captured and brought to the mine entrance.

170
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,039
Excellent.

171
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,399
Today is the day my Tang family

172
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,600
dominates Bian Shui.

173
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,360
Foolish son.

174
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,200
All of this is yours.

175
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,559
Let's go.

176
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,120
Let go!

177
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,559
Let go!

178
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,879
Let go!

179
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,679
Let go!

180
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,679
Let go!

181
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,440
Tang Hongtu!

182
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,600
Kidnapping people at gunpoint...

183
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,279
Aren't you afraid of the Li family's

184
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,399
retaliation, Second Master?

185
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,559
Dad.

186
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:29,840
You...

187
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,639
Retaliation?

188
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,240
From now on, when Li Xiangping sees me,

189
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,159
he'll have to call me Young Master Tang.

190
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,639
You, Second Master Tang, boast of being self-made,

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,559
but you're clearly just a bunch of robbers!

192
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
In a place like Bian Shui,

193
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,519
having the toughest fist is what rules.

194
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,759
Get out of the way!

195
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,759
You jerk!

196
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,879
Still defying me?

197
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,480
Don't move if you want to live!

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,120
Otherwise, I'll...

199
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,840
make you end up like Zhao Fengsheng.

200
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,279
Zhao Fengsheng?

201
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,519
What happened to him?

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,120
Don't tell me you like Zhao Fengsheng too?

203
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,480
What a pity.

204
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,080
My old man shot him dead.

205
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,519
He's dead?

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,519
How could he die?

207
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,559
Qian Tianyu.

208
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,639
There's a huge gold mine down there.

209
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,960
How wonderful it would be

210
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,600
for us to have our fun down there.

211
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,399
Let go!

212
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,159
Jerk!

213
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,000
Let her go, you...

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,759
Let go!

215
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,639
What are you doing?!

216
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,759
Don't move if you want to live!

217
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,279
Dad!

218
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,600
I won't let you touch Tianyu!

219
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,600
Second Master Tang!

220
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,000
Aren't you the one who values your reputation most?

221
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,120
How can you just watch your precious son

222
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,559
do such a beastly thing?

223
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,159
Reputation...

224
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,879
is hard-earned.

225
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,759
Therefore,

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,840
if people are dead, they can't talk, can they?

227
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,679
What do you mean?

228
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,840
What do I mean?

229
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,519
Do you know why we brought you here?

230
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,039
In a moment, we'll kill you,

231
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,720
and toss you right into this mine lake.

232
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
The Qian family will vanish

233
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,039
from Bian Shui forever.

234
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,000
You...

235
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,600
You're not even human!

236
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,960
My precious Tianyu.

237
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,519
If you serve me well in a moment,

238
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,360
I might not have the heart to kill you.

239
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,919
You could live on as my slave.

240
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,200
Come on.

241
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,759
Let go!

242
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,399
Let's go!

243
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,639
You jerk!

244
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,279
Let go!

245
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,279
I'll fight you to the death!

246
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,960
Dad!

247
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,679
You old fool!

248
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,360
Dad!

249
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,799
Dad!

250
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,399
Dad!

251
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,039
I'll deal with you!

252
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,679
Tianyu, my dear.

253
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,639
Kneel down.

254
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,519
Call me Master.

255
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,279
Or I'll blow your father's brains out.

256
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,519
Dad...

257
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,679
Say it!

258
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,840
Tang Huiyao!

259
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
Your grandpa Zhao Fengsheng is here!
