1
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,240
This is Tang Hongtu.

2
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,439
Second Master Tang.

3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Tang.

4
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,200
Second Master Tang.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,119
The head of the number one Tang family in Bian Shui.

6
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,359
It's me.

7
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,879
To be able to work for Second Master...

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,359
is my honor.

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,840
May I ask what you want me to do?

10
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,760
I want you to go back to Old Street.

11
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,840
Get everyone to sign the demolition contract...

12
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,319
with our Tang Group.

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,480
Second Master...

14
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,799
That kid Zhao Fengsheng saved...

15
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,879
has already woken up.

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,719
If I go back now...

17
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,239
the neighbors will probably investigate me...

18
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,280
What are you afraid of?

19
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,280
Those two idiots who did the kidnapping...

20
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,200
Master Mu has already taken care of them for you.

21
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,760
As long as you deny it to the end...

22
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,079
who dares to call you a trafficker?

23
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,519
Chen Xiaobei.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,439
Do you think I called you here...

25
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,920
to discuss this with you?

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,359
If you don't handle this well...

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,359
you...

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,480
will go down to join your two brothers.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,200
Master Mu...

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,840
Second Master...

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
Have mercy!

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,799
Darn it.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,719
I'll do it.

34
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,000
Xiaobei.

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,919
These past few days...

36
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,319
you've really worked hard.

37
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,039
It's nothing.

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,039
Our houses are really old, right?

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,199
They'll need renovating sooner or later.

40
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,719
Coincidentally...

41
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,000
I know this big boss.

42
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,639
No problem, no problem.

43
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,319
Chen Xiaobei!

44
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,599
This trafficker dares to come back?

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
Let's teach him a lesson!

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,000
I've also looked at the contract.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,319
I just wanted to help the neighbors...

48
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,039
renovate their houses.

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Build new buildings, live in new homes.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,680
Chen Xiaobei!

51
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,439
Come here!

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,560
Let go!

53
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,159
What are you doing?

54
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,360
What's going on?

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,599
What have you learned from Zhao Fengsheng?

56
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,280
Be polite to the neighbors.

57
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,319
Uncle Snake...

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
This jerk framed Fengsheng.

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,159
Today he must explain himself to everyone.

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,360
It really was a misunderstanding.

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,960
Didn't we already explain it clearly?

62
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,319
You think saying "misunderstanding" settles it?

63
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,560
How do we account for the neighbors wronging Fengsheng?

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
I apologize.

65
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,439
I'll accept any punishment you give.

66
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,639
You said it.

67
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,319
Don't play dumb.

68
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,000
You've been hanging out with the Traffickers' Village

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,120
people for a long time.

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,360
Xiaoxiao was kidnapped by you.

71
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,039
Brother Fengsheng.

72
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,319
This is a huge misunderstanding.

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,400
That day, I saw Xiaoxiao being kidnapped.

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,319
In a moment of panic,

75
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,879
I thought you were with them.

76
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,520
Brother.

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,199
I

78
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,400
have already heard.

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,039
You and Gangzi took care of the Traffickers' Village guys

80
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,159
and even stormed the Ghost Face Hall.

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,919
You're heroes of our Old Street.

82
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,599
Right?

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,439
Yeah.

84
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,240
Don't call me brother.

85
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,319
You're not worthy.

86
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,719
You want to put on an act for me?

87
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,719
Brother Fengsheng.

88
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

89
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,000
About the misunderstanding,

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,919
it was my fault.

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,120
I apologize to you.

92
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
I'll kowtow to you.

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,560
Fengsheng.

94
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,400
Forgive others when you can.

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Xiaobei.

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,159
Back then, wasn't he

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,039
also worried about Xiaoxiao?

98
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,759
Auntie Wang, don't you get it?

99
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,439
He's a trafficker.

100
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,919
Don't talk nonsense.

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,159
Fengsheng.

102
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,159
The misunderstanding about you being a trafficker,

103
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,639
the whole Old Street knows.

104
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,599
Besides, you didn't lose anything.

105
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,479
Let's just drop this matter.

106
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,800
I didn't lose anything?

107
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,319
We're all neighbors here.

108
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,920
Why make such an ugly scene?

109
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm not trying to make a scene.

110
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,360
Think about it yourselves.

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,319
Every time he's about to be exposed,

112
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,879
he disappears and hides.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,959
He wasn't here when the Ghost Face Hall surrounded Old Street.

114
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,839
He wasn't here when Xiaoxiao woke up.

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
Isn't that clear enough?

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
Brother Fengsheng.

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,879
A colossal misunderstanding.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,839
These past few days,

119
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,920
I've been helping the neighbors

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,839
find opportunities to get rich.

121
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,120
Opportunities to get rich?

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,199
The neighbors have all joined the Chinese Association.

123
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,480
What else do we need you to arrange?

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,720
Selling goods earns just a pittance.

125
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,519
Look at Auntie Wang's hands.

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,680
Even with calluses this thick,

127
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,879
can she earn enough for an apartment?

128
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,000
Young Bei is also thinking of the neighbors.

129
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,439
He contacted a big boss from outside

130
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,959
to redevelop our Old Street.

131
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,399
What?

132
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,879
Redevelop?

133
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,519
What big boss?

134
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
Explain yourself clearly.

135
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,879
Second Master Tang from the Tang Group.

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,319
He said

137
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,199
our Old Street has huge development potential.

138
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,040
He plans to acquire Old Street

139
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,199
and turn it into high-end apartments.

140
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,079
Tang Hongtu wants to demolish Old Street.

141
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,160
He calls it redevelopment.

142
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,759
And on a separate plot nearby,

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,680
he'll build new houses for the neighbors.

144
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,319
Plus a large sum of demolition compensation.

145
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,120
And compensation money.

146
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,399
That's good news!

147
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,839
The neighbors will have a better life.

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
Such a good deal...

149
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,519
what's in it for the Tang Group?

150
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,879
Boss Tang

151
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,079
naturally wants to develop Bian Shui better.

152
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,800
He says

153
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,600
as Bian Shui's leading enterprise,

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
this is how to attract foreign investment

155
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,160
and grow bigger.

156
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
Does Uncle Snake and the neighbors know?

157
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,279
Of course, it's been explained clearly.

158
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,399
Xiaobei.

159
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,120
Come on, let's go.

160
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,519
Tell Auntie the details again.

161
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,560
Right, right.

162
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,439
Let's go.

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,439
Fengsheng.

164
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
Why did you pull me back?

165
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,040
I still think

166
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,800
this guy Chen Xiaobei

167
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,920
is a bit suspicious.

168
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,639
Who cares if Chen Xiaobei is suspicious?

169
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,920
Demolition isn't a bad thing.

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,560
Think about our Old Street houses.

171
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,759
How many years old are they?

172
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,160
We still have to use public toilets.

173
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
What a hassle.

174
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,480
I know that, of course.

175
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,839
Our Old Street has no real business,

176
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,199
no profitable industry.

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,480
Tang Hongtu spending big money to buy Old Street...

178
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,000
I still can't figure it out.

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,839
Why overthink it?

180
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
As long as the Tang Group pays up,

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
we won't lose out.

182
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,879
Right?

183
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,199
Once we have the money,

184
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,920
Er Ni's mother

185
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,759
won't stand in the way of your marriage.

186
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
We're talking serious business.

187
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,319
Why bring up Er Ni?

188
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,279
Understood, understood.

189
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,360
I'll have the guys go ask around

190
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,480
to see what's really going on.

191
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,319
Is Brother Fengsheng home?

192
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:45,920
You jerk!

193
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,839
You dare show your face?

194
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,720
What's wrong?

195
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,120
Here to kowtow, apologize, and admit your mistake?

196
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,079
Brother Fengsheng.

197
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,639
It was all a misunderstanding before.

198
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,000
Today, Second Master himself sent word.

199
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,240
He'd like to invite you to the Tang Group for a chat.

200
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,800
Tang Hongtu is inviting me?

201
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,879
Yes.

202
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,959
Second Master said

203
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,319
you, Zhao Fengsheng, are a man of courage.

204
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,319
You wouldn't even dare to meet him.

205
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,920
A provocation.

206
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,560
Fengsheng.

207
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,439
Don't fall for it.

208
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,480
Tang Hongtu is a man who holds sway over Bian Shui.

209
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,079
He has no need to play dirty tricks with me.

210
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,519
And I happen to want to meet him.

211
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,079
Let's go. Lead the way.

212
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,240
Brother Gangzi

213
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,519
Second Master only invited one person.

214
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,120
So,

215
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,759
let's go.

216
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,560
Director Wang, you better win big today.

217
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,920
Playing, huh?

218
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,439
You've gotten prettier again.

219
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,920
The Tang Group even has a casino in Bian Shui.

220
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
Master Mu.

221
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,800
Master Mu.

222
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,040
Please lend me another five hundred thousand.

223
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,079
I'm sure I can win it all back.

224
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,480
Master Mu.

225
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,279
Lend you more?

226
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,399
Your house,

227
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,319
your car,

228
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,600
and your beautiful wife

229
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,800
are already mortgaged.

230
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,079
What do you have left to borrow against?

231
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,560
Master Mu.

232
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,079
You...

233
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,319
Look, how much am I worth?

234
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,839
I'll mortgage myself, Master Mu.

235
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,680
A life is the cheapest thing there is.

236
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,000
You two,

237
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,240
take him to the coal mine to dig.

238
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,160
A hundred a day.

239
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,960
Until his debt is paid.

240
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,159
A hundred bucks a day?

241
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,799
When will I ever get out?

242
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,600
Master Mu!

243
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,559
Zhao Fengsheng.

244
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,759
You dare show your face in front of me?

245
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,399
Master Mu.

246
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,639
Your new look is so cool.

247
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,759
How can you be so darn annoying?

248
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,519
You know what?

249
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,480
I'll settle the score for this eye

250
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,360
right now.

251
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,360
Master Mu.

252
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,000
Second Master wants to see Zhao Fengsheng.

253
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,559
I know.

254
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Otherwise,

255
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,320
you wouldn't be standing here talking nonsense.

256
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,039
Weren't you a dog for the Ghost Face Hall?

257
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,440
Now you're a dog for the Tang family?

258
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,240
Are you addicted to being a dog?

259
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,159
You!

260
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,120
Didn't Uncle Gui Lang teach you how to talk to me?

261
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,919
Uncle Gui Lang?

262
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,960
He's already dead.

263
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,240
Your backer is gone.

264
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,679
And you're still acting so tough with me?

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,879
You did it?

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,159
He was getting senile.

267
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,320
So I had no choice

268
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,399
but to show some filial piety

269
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,960
and put him out of his misery.

270
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,559
After all,

271
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,960
Uncle Gui Lang and I were acquainted.

272
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
I'm considering

273
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,639
whether to gouge out your other eye

274
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
to see him off properly.

275
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,639
Zhao Fengsheng.

276
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,360
Don't look at me like that.

277
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,480
If Second Master didn't want to see you,

278
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,200
I'd finish you off right now.

279
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,600
Can't be bothered with your nonsense.

280
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,840
Come with me to see Second Master.

281
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,960
Killing the Ghost Wolf leader,

282
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,279
taking in Mu Jinfu,

283
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,799
demolishing Old Street...

284
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,279
This series of moves

285
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,320
seems to be all Tang Hongtu's doing.

286
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,159
What does this Second Master Tang want?

287
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,480
I've long heard of Old Street's Zhao Fengsheng.

288
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,840
Brother Shengzi.

289
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,759
I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.

290
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,559
This sofa of yours is comfortable.

291
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,200
Must have cost a lot, right?

292
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
A sofa is nothing.

293
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,879
As long as you, Brother Shengzi,

294
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,759
are willing to join my Tang Group,

295
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,159
villas, luxury cars, beautiful women—you'll have it all.

296
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,279
So you're recruiting me, Second Master?

297
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,000
That's right.

298
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,559
You, Zhao Fengsheng, with just two or three men,

299
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,759
managed to take down Traffickers' Village

300
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,440
and even bravely stormed the Ghost Face Hall.

301
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,799
It's truly impressive.

302
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,600
I admire you.

303
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
You flatter me, Second Master.

304
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,080
After you took over the Ghost Face Hall,

305
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,720
you're the biggest local power in Bian Shui.

306
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,480
There's no need to recruit me.

307
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,720
You probably don't want me leading the neighbors to cause trouble

308
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,679
and delay your demolition project, right?

309
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,080
Brother Shengzi gets straight to the point.

310
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,559
I do have that intention.

311
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
Second Master.

312
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,000
You say our Old Street is just a piece of worthless land.

313
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,600
No industry to speak of.

314
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,720
Why are you so fixated on it?

315
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,360
Expanding industrial investment,

316
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,320
increasing our presence in Bian Shui,

317
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,879
attracting foreign capital...

318
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,200
This is

319
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,799
our strategic goal

320
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,200
as the Tang Group.

321
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,840
I don't understand.

322
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,000
Brother Shengzi isn't well-versed in business.

323
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
That's understandable.

324
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,559
But you just need to remember one thing:

325
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,480
Having our Tang Group develop Old Street

326
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,799
is nothing but beneficial for all of you.

327
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,759
And what if I disagree?
