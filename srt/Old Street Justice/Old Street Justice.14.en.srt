1
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,560
Young Master Li

2
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,679
How could Zhao Fengsheng know Young Master Li?

3
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,359
Dad, you must be mistaken.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,359
Zhao Fengsheng

5
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,359
He's the one Young Master Li

6
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,960
personally called to look after.

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,359
The guest I waited all day to receive.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,759
Without those connections,

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,359
who could have come back from Ghost Face Hall

10
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,000
completely unscathed?

11
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,079
So what he said was all true.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,319
He didn't latch onto the Qian Family

13
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,439
because of my connections.

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,439
You...

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,400
You've stirred up big trouble.

16
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,560
Therefore,

17
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,640
you go find Zhao Fengsheng and apologize.

18
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,239
So?

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,760
Painted Face is pretty badly hurt.

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,920
Luckily he's tough.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,359
A hospital stay and he'll be fine.

22
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,120
He

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,840
can take a beating.

24
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,239
Xiao Qian is fine too.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,079
Not to be rude, but

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,760
that Uncle Gui Lang

27
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,079
really is a man of his word.

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,280
He's quite a character.

29
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,760
Come on, come on.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,359
Let's open a good bottle today.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,879
No matter what,

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,040
you're now the big hero

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,159
in the eyes of our neighbors.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,879
That was a satisfying payback.

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,120
Deep friendship, down in one gulp.

36
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,120
Bottoms up.

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
That pretty boy got what he deserved.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,800
And that Qian Family young lady,

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Er Ni's friend is really not great.

40
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:12,840
Her eyes...

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,319
are stuck up on the top of her head.

42
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:14,919
No wonder

43
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,719
she hangs out with Bai Yuchen.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,199
I heard from Er Ni

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,080
recently

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,000
you ran into that Tang family young master

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
and you helped him out too.

48
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,360
How can that woman be so ungrateful?

49
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,639
I just saw her downstairs at Er Ni's place.

50
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,840
From the looks of it,

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,319
she really plans to live on Old Street.

52
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,639
Just to keep an eye on you.

53
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,560
Watch me?

54
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,319
I'm watching her!

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
Who knows what she's up to.

56
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,319
Nothing good, for sure.

57
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,039
If you ask me,

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,479
we should teach her a lesson.

59
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,840
That...

60
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,240
isn't good, is it?

61
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,560
She's from the Qian Group.

62
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,879
After Old Street joins the association,

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
we'll still need the Qians.

64
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,960
We can't force the issue.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,879
Yeah.

66
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,800
So what do we do?

67
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,240
Our Old Street's

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,280
Jiutiao Sanlong Hutong.

69
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,879
Get Painted Face.

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
Jinfu.

71
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,240
In this world,

72
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,120
some people you just can't afford to cross.

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,159
Let the eye incident end here.

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,599
Don't go looking for trouble with Zhao Fengsheng again.

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,039
Take this case of money for your use.

76
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,240
Thank you, Uncle Gui Lang.

77
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,360
Too scared to offend some Old Street punk.

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,479
How can you be the underground king of Bian Shui?

79
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,680
Mu... Mu Jinfu.

80
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,879
Isn't this what you taught me?

81
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
If you're not ruthless,

82
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,719
how do you make others submit?

83
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,599
Old fool.

84
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,240
Hello?

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,800
Second Master Tang.

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,959
The task you assigned is done.

87
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,879
Good.

88
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,279
The Tang Group's casino business is yours to manage.

89
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,399
Thank you, Second Master Tang.

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
From now on, Bian Shui's underworld and legitimate world

91
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,480
will all listen to you.

92
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,959
You've done well.

93
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,879
Old fool.

94
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,600
Who's going to apologize to that toad?

95
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,839
He's the one who's shameless.

96
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,319
What kind of darn place...

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,439
What kind of darn place is this?

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,399
Who?

99
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,639
Who... who's there?

100
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,040
I see you.

101
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,079
Come out right now.

102
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,839
Jiutiao Sanlong.

103
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
You still want to go back there?

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,879
That Jiutiao Sanlong is creepy.

105
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,120
Adults never let us go through there as kids.

106
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,439
According to the neighbors,

107
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,199
dozens of families used to live there packed tight.

108
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,560
But in less than three years,

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,160
only two households were left alive.

110
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,199
The neighbors all say

111
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,160
because there was a mining disaster underneath.

112
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,000
Over a hundred vengeful spirits are trapped down there.

113
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,680
The resentment is heavy.

114
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,399
Mom...

115
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,199
Mommy...

116
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,319
This...

117
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,519
Shengzi.

118
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,959
I think we went too far this time.

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,639
This...

120
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
It's not right to leave her at my place.

121
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,120
And my bathhouse

122
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
is full of naked old men.

123
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
I can't put her there either.

124
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,279
No movement for so long.

125
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,720
She couldn't have been scared to death, could she?

126
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,920
Wake up.

127
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,920
Wake up.

128
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,319
She's still breathing.

129
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,199
She fainted from fright.

130
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,759
So what do we do?

131
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,360
Wait for her to wake up.

132
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,600
But...

133
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,560
Her staying at my place all night

134
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,000
what would that look like?

135
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:54,879
This...

136
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,319
She won't become a vegetable from the scare, will she?

137
00:07:59,319 --> 00:07:59,959
That won't work.

138
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,240
Maybe we should take her to the hospital.

139
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,279
What are you standing around for?

140
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,800
Help me carry her, quick!

141
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,759
I don't touch women.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,879
Their bodies are too soft.

143
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,680
No, no.

144
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,800
A blanket.

145
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,680
A blanket.

146
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,399
A blanket!

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,720
Being tall makes you smart, huh?

148
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,080
No.

149
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,480
No.

150
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,080
Put... put her down.

151
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,279
What are you doing?

152
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,200
It's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,840
I was trying to take you to the hospital.

154
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,840
Pervert!

155
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,919
Pervert!

156
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,759
It's not like that.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Get away from me!

158
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,159
Pervert!

159
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,759
Cover her with the blanket.

160
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,639
Shengzi, have you guys seen Tianyu?

161
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,799
Get away!

162
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,480
Pervert!

163
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,000
Jerk!

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,759
He's not here.

165
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,720
What are you all doing?

166
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,559
Get away!

167
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,799
You get away!

168
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,080
Zhao Fengsheng, what are you doing?

169
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,600
Get away!

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,279
You filthy pervert!

171
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,879
Listen to me, Er Ni.

172
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,399
Let go!

173
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,120
I'll beat you to death!

174
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,039
Filthy pervert!

175
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,960
Let go!

176
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Zhao Fengsheng, you...

177
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,840
What on earth are you doing?

178
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,519
Er Ni.

179
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,679
Er Ni, you've got it all wrong.

180
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,240
Gangzi and I...

181
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,799
Gangzi and I were drinking next door.

182
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,679
He was right there.

183
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,639
I was just about to take her to the hospital.

184
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,720
You had a few drinks...

185
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,240
...and forgot who you are.

186
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,279
Er Ni.

187
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,679
You really misunderstood, Er Ni.

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,519
I'll hit you!

189
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,039
You three...

190
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,240
...have you never seen a pretty girl before?

191
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,480
One's got a nosebleed.

192
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,039
One's harassing my best friend.

193
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,559
One's sick and still can't behave.

194
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,240
Just see if I don't...

195
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,399
...beat you all to death today!

196
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,639
Er Ni.

197
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,960
Er Ni, you misunderstood, Er Ni.

198
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,759
Er Ni, listen to my explanation.

199
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,080
Stop right there!

200
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,600
Er Ni.

201
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,039
It's a huge misunderstanding!

202
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,679
Open the door for me!

203
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,279
You really misunderstood me.

204
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:52,720
Zhao Fengsheng.

205
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,600
We were going to take her to the hospital.

206
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,399
Zhao Fengsheng, open the door!

207
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,080
If you've got the guts, open the door!

208
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,120
Er Ni, believe me, Er Ni.

209
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,480
Open the door!

210
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,000
Pervert!

211
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,159
Miss Qian.

212
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,440
Um, sorry about that.

213
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,039
Gangzi and I took the joke too far.

214
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,240
Miss Qian.

215
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,960
How about you also dress as a ghost to scare Shengzi and me?

216
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,360
Yeah.

217
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,440
Scare the pants off us, even.

218
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,559
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,080
You...

220
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,879
How can you two speak so...

221
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,200
...vulgarly?

222
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
Vulgar.

223
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,679
If you can't speak properly, shut up.

224
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,480
Move aside, move aside.

225
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,279
Let Tianyu go back and rest.

226
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,759
Get some good rest.

227
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,279
Er Ni.

228
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,000
Mom.

229
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,440
You didn't come home all night.

230
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,360
Were you hanging out with Zhao Fengsheng again?

231
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,519
...messing around together?

232
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,559
You can't just say things like that.

233
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,159
I was taking care of Tianyu yesterday.

234
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,840
And you're still lying to me?

235
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
You were taking care of Miss Qian?

236
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,639
Where is she then?

237
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
Miss Qian just left.

238
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,679
That's bull!

239
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,200
You're the one talking bull!

240
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,080
I'll beat you to death!

241
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,919
Auntie Liu, don't hit him!

242
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,799
I'll beat you to death!

243
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,279
Mom.

244
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,039
Mom, mom, mom!

245
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,200
You stay away from Er Ni!

246
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,799
Auntie Liu.

247
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,360
Don't hit him, don't!

248
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200
Stay away from Er Ni!

249
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,879
I think Shengzi and Er Ni are a good match.

250
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,120
It'd be nice if they got together.

251
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,159
You think they're a match, so they are?

252
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,120
Then I think you and Widow Niu are a match.

253
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,360
Why don't you go find her?

254
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,360
I...

255
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,919
Auntie Liu, aren't you...

256
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
...talking nonsense?

257
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Widow Niu is over seventy.

258
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,600
How could I be a match for her?

259
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,639
What I meant was...

260
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,320
...you've also seen that Bai Yuchen kid for what he is.

261
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,399
He's just rotten to the core.

262
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,480
That's why Shengzi...

263
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,399
What are you implying?

264
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:47,879
Auntie Liu, Auntie Liu!

265
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,480
Mom.

266
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,200
Mom, take it easy, easy!

267
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,960
My Er Ni...

268
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,600
...if she doesn't marry Bai Yuchen...

269
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,840
...she has to marry that Zhao Fengsheng?

270
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,440
Auntie Liu, Auntie Liu, Auntie Liu!

271
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,120
Alright, alright, alright.

272
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,919
All the neighbors know I've turned over a new leaf.

273
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,000
It's not right for you to chase and hit me like this.

274
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,720
Pah!

275
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,519
A toad lusting after a swan.

276
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,639
Get out of here, now!

277
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,960
Get out!

278
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,960
Stop hitting, stop!

279
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,440
Get out!

280
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,759
Mom, don't hurt him.

281
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,120
I'll beat you to death!

282
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,080
Stop hitting, Auntie Liu.

283
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,159
Auntie Liu, don't hit the wrong person.

284
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,120
Aim higher.

285
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,960
I'll beat you to death!

286
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,919
Okay, okay, Mom.

287
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,799
You're Er Ni's mom.

288
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,600
I won't stoop to your level.

289
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,240
Mom, mom.

290
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,759
You silly girl.

291
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,120
You didn't show your face all night.

292
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,039
I was worried sick.

293
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,320
I'm so angry.

294
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's go.

295
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,840
We're going home.

296
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,919
Don't you look.

297
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,279
Come on, let's go.

298
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,159
Go.

299
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,919
Hurry up.

300
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,679
Boss Mu

301
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,480
Boss Mu

302
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,879
Spare me!

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm just a nobody.

304
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not worth your personal effort.

305
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,639
If you weren't still useful for Old Street,

306
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,679
do you think you'd still be alive?

307
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:57,960
Boss Mu.

308
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,120
Your orders.

309
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,759
I'll go through fire and water.

310
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,360
Old Street

311
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,200
I must obtain it.

312
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,759
But don't use force on that Zhao Fengsheng.

313
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,559
How to proceed specifically,

314
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
you will listen to Mr. Tang from now on.
