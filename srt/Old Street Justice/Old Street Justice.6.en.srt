1
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,399
Stay out of the way.

2
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,039
Shengzi.

3
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,479
I'm fine.

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,759
Old as you are, and you still resort to sneak attacks.

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,759
A lackey truly has no shame.

6
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,640
All offense, no defense.

7
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,960
You're the rabid dog.

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,640
Everyone, quiet!

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,439
Dad.

10
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,239
Why aren't you here yet?

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,239
Did you go and cause trouble again?

12
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,079
Ran into a few guys in the way.

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,439
You were at the Likasu family's hotel,

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,439
weren't you?

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,120
Get your ass back here now.

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,760
Okay.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,319
Zhao Fengsheng, right?

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,719
I'll remember you.

19
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's go.

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,400
I haven't had enough fun yet!

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,359
Shengzi.

22
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,000
Shengzi!

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,920
You're coughing up blood!

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,640
Go to the hospital.

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,799
What blood?

26
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,359
That old geezer just kicked me by surprise.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,680
He made me spit out that expensive red wine

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
I was drinking.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,240
If you hadn't provoked Tang Huiyao,

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,439
none of this would've happened!

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
You woman!

32
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,800
Bite the hand that feeds you.

33
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,479
Can't be bothered with you.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,759
You...

35
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,479
Tianyu.

36
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,199
Let's go.

37
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,759
Hurry up, hurry!

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
Protect Miss Qian for me!

39
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,360
All of you, protect Miss Qian!

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,560
Stop pretending.

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,319
The milk comes after the baby's gone.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,599
Useless.

43
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,159
It's all because you angered Young Master Tang.

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
If you hadn't been impulsive,

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,599
there wouldn't have been a fight today.

46
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,039
Coward.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
Tianyu, we're heading out.

48
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:46,879
Ya...

49
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,800
Miss Qian.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,759
Are you alright?

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,039
Should we take you to the hospital?

52
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:53,960
No need.

53
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,759
We've offended the Tang family this time.

54
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
I need to go home and tell Dad,

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
so he can be prepared.

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:09,800
Mom

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,080
Shengzi hasn't been feeling well these past couple of days.

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,319
I need to go take care of him.

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
He's just a small-time hoodlum.

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,080
Always getting into fights and brawls.

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,120
How could you possibly take care of him?

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,680
No,

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,639
Shengzi did that for me back then.

64
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,919
Don't you mention that good-for-nothing to me.

65
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,719
Get inside, now.

66
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,039
Old Buddha has something important to announce.

67
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,520
Let's go.

68
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,680
Old Buddha,

69
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,919
what's happened exactly?

70
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,240
Why have you called everyone here?

71
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,000
Everyone, please take a seat.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,800
Sit, sit.

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,560
Quick, have a seat.

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,879
Everyone knows

75
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,599
Bian Shui is at the border of three Southeast Asian countries.

76
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,520
Chinese people don't have much influence here.

77
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,080
We neighbors

78
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,560
rely on doing a bit of small handicraft work

79
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,680
just to barely scrape by.

80
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,879
Old Buddha is right about that.

81
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,120
Auntie Wang gets up at five every day to do embroidery.

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,840
Old Pang,

83
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,039
at his age,

84
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,400
pedals a broken tricycle every day

85
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,319
to deliver coal briquettes to rich families.

86
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,120
The young people have no choice

87
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,360
but to go out and find work.

88
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,840
We have no other way either.

89
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,199
What you're talking about is all in the past.

90
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,319
Manager Bai says

91
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,680
he can take all the businesses on our Old Street

92
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,959
and join the Qian Group's

93
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,160
Chinese Association.

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,720
What's the Chinese Association?

95
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,040
Yuchen,

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,279
you explain it to everyone.

97
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,040
Manager Bai,

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,759
you tell us.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
Alright, alright.

100
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,920
The Chinese Association

101
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,920
is actually a Chinese chamber of commerce

102
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,279
established by our Qian Group.

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,120
It can help our neighbors

104
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,480
sell all their products.

105
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,959
That's good.

106
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,399
This is a good thing!

107
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,439
A good thing.

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
Exactly, exactly.

109
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,519
But,

110
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,000
we have to give up a little profit.

111
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,319
Give up a little profit?

112
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,639
How much profit?

113
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,560
It's like this.

114
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,360
According to the usual practice,

115
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,839
you need to pay twenty percent of your profits.

116
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,879
However,

117
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,560
we have Manager Bai speaking up for us.

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,399
Now,

119
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,720
every month,

120
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,160
you only need to pay ten percent.

121
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,199
Ten percent?

122
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,480
Ten percent.

123
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,959
Ten percent.

124
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,959
Ten percent is fine too.

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,800
As long as we can sell all our goods,

126
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,040
it's okay if we work a little harder.

127
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,800
That's right.

128
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,079
I agree.

129
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,480
Then what are we waiting for?

130
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,079
Let's join the association quickly.

131
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,519
Manager Bai is really doing us a huge favor.

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
Everyone, everyone, everyone.

133
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,680
I can help everyone

134
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,680
apply for membership.

135
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,000
It's just that,

136
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,199
our President Qian

137
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,360
pays great attention

138
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,639
to the Chinese Association's public reputation.

139
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,399
Things like child trafficking,

140
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,839
if they happen again,

141
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
then no one's pleading will help.

142
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Our Old Street,

143
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,120
it's Zhao Fengsheng who's causing trouble.

144
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,879
At worst, we just kick him out. Darn it.

145
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,600
Right?

146
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,879
Yes, that's right.

147
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,920
Kick him out!

148
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,079
And Zhou Xiaoman too.

149
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,240
Neighbors,

150
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,279
who doesn't know she's a prostitute?

151
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,959
Zhao Fengsheng actually brought that kind of woman

152
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,879
back to the Old Street.

153
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,839
It's a total slap in the face for the Old Street.

154
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,839
Right!

155
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,279
Kick that woman out!

156
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,720
And that Da Gang too.

157
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,360
He's always hanging around with that Zhao Fengsheng

158
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,000
and Zhou Xiaoman.

159
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
He's no good either.

160
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,199
That's right.

161
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,319
I'm also one of the Four Pests of the Old Street.

162
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,519
You kick me out too!

163
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,639
Yaqing!

164
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,160
Er Ni!

165
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
You were just led astray by Zhao Fengsheng.

166
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,480
If you don't associate with him,

167
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,959
the neighbors won't blame you.

168
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,600
Mom!

169
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Yaqing.

170
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,319
Your mother makes a good point.

171
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,240
I know you're a

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
kind-hearted girl.

173
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,079
But look at me.

174
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
I work so hard

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,079
actually just to gain your approval.

176
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,879
Manager Bai,

177
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,040
you want to become our Old Street's son-in-law, huh?

178
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,639
Er Ni,

179
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,519
you see?

180
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,680
Such incredible good fortune

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,920
has fallen upon you.

182
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,279
Why don't you have a nice chat

183
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,959
with our Manager Bai?

184
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Tomorrow,

185
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,399
tomorrow you two should go see a movie,

186
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,120
have dinner,

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,519
and have a proper blind date.

188
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,399
Whoever wants to suck up to Bai Yuchen,

189
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,480
go do it yourself.

190
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,560
Don't drag me into it.

191
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,879
Yaqing! Yaqing!

192
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
You wretched girl!

193
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,600
Auntie,

194
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,639
Yuchen is the good son-in-law I've picked out.

195
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,279
Don't you get any funny ideas about him.

196
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
If you want Yuchen to become

197
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,240
our Old Street's son-in-law,

198
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,319
first we have to kick out those scoundrels.

199
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,360
Yes!

200
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,040
Drive out that pauper Zhao Fengsheng!

201
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,720
Yaqing will never escape my grasp again.

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,480
Er Ni

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,399
Let's go.

204
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,079
Elope.

205
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,560
We'll take Da Gang too.

206
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,560
And Zhou Xiaoman as well.

207
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,839
We'll leave this place.

208
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,319
The four of us will elope.

209
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,240
Getting passionate at a time like this?

210
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,680
Alright then.

211
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,199
What's going on?

212
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
You're not drunk, are you?

213
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,480
My mom insists on marrying me off to Bai Yuchen.

214
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,360
And the neighbors want to kick you and Zhou Xiaoman...

215
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,439
...out of the Old Street.

216
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,639
We might as well just leave.

217
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,399
Let's go.

218
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,439
Dear neighbors...

219
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,240
Who's been feeding you lies again?

220
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm going to talk to them.

221
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,560
Er Ni!

222
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,559
Come out here!

223
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,399
Er Ni!

224
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,279
My mom's here.

225
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,279
I need to go hide.

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,799
Come out!

227
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,559
Talk nicely in a moment.

228
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,559
Don't you dare lose your temper.

229
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,600
Go hide then.

230
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:47,919
Er Ni!

231
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,080
Come out here!

232
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,480
Come out here!

233
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,639
Er Ni, you get out here!

234
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,720
I'll beat you to death!

235
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,399
Er Ni!

236
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,039
Open the door!

237
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,440
Xiaoman.

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,759
Tell me...

239
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,480
...how can we make...

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,039
...the neighbors believe Shengzi?

241
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,279
How about we drag Chen Xiaobei out and beat him up?

242
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,080
Make him admit he's a kidnapper.

243
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,279
Brother Gangzi.

244
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,840
Chen Xiaobei has too good a reputation on the Old Street.

245
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,679
Unless we catch him red-handed...

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,799
...no one will probably believe it.

247
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,840
Right.

248
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,679
Let's go find them.

249
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,799
Here they are.

250
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,440
Just as I thought, hanging out with this bitch.

251
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,080
What did I tell you?

252
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,879
Look! Look! Look!

253
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,960
What's the occasion today?

254
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,279
So many people here for a bath?

255
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,480
We're not here for a bath today.

256
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,919
Right.

257
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,120
Not here for a bath.

258
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,600
If not for a bath, why come to my bathhouse?

259
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,399
The neighbors just want to ask you...

260
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,200
...if you even want to stay in the Old Street.

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,039
What do you mean?

262
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,720
I, Da Gang, have lived in the Old Street for decades.

263
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,759
Are you trying to kick me out?

264
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,960
Manager Bai wants to lead all the neighbors...

265
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,000
...to join the Qian Group's Chinese Association.

266
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,759
If you can sever ties with Zhao Fengsheng...

267
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,080
...and people like Zhou Xiaoman...

268
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,679
...the neighbors will let you stay.

269
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,360
Yes.

270
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,679
Exactly.

271
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,320
That's right.

272
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,720
Correct.

273
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,360
A woman like you staying in the Old Street...

274
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,240
...is an embarrassment to our Coal Mine Old Street.

275
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,480
Yes, for joining the Chinese Association...

276
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,320
...she's an obstacle.

277
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,279
Right, right, exactly.

278
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,360
Drag her out!

279
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,200
Get out!

280
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Brother Gangzi!

281
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,240
Brother Gangzi!

282
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,399
What are you doing?

283
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,879
What are you doing?!

284
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,919
Brother Gangzi!

285
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,960
Da Fo!

286
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,399
What are you trying to do?

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,799
Da Gang.

288
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,720
The neighbors see you have a good heart...

289
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,960
...and want to give you a chance.

290
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,039
Don't be ungrateful.

291
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,960
Zhou Xiaoman has already left.

292
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,639
As long as you go back to your Jin Family Ancestral Hall...

293
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,320
...and sever ties with Zhao Fengsheng...

294
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,960
...I promise the neighbors...

295
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,159
...won't say a single word against you.

296
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,960
I, Jin Jungang...

297
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,320
...and Shengzi are sworn brothers.

298
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
Blood brothers.

299
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,919
Wherever Shengzi is...

300
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,000
...that's my home.

301
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,399
So what?

302
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,679
Want to start a fight?

303
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,399
Bring it on!

304
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,879
Come on!

305
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,200
Let's go!

306
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
You think I'm scared?

307
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,759
Start what fight?

308
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,759
Isn't the Old Street chaotic enough?

309
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
If you remain stubborn...

310
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,039
...from now on, your bathhouse...

311
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,039
...won't have a single customer.

312
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,360
Let's see how you...

313
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,399
...survive in the Old Street then.

314
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:24,919
Right.

315
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,240
Yeah.

316
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,279
This dump of a bathhouse...

317
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,279
...no one will come.

318
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,279
Think it over.

319
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,399
Think carefully.

320
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,720
Dad, let's go.

321
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,559
We're not coming back.

322
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,279
Let's go.

323
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,240
Go, go, go.

324
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,120
Never coming back.

325
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,039
We'll never come again.

326
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,799
See how you survive.

327
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,519
Exactly.

328
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,639
Wait for it to go bankrupt.

329
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,320
I won't come either.

330
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,679
It's just the Chinese Association.

331
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,000
Why bully my brother?

332
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,879
Shengzi.

333
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,480
They drove Xiaoman away.

334
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,600
And they want me to cut ties with you.

335
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,279
I heard everything.

336
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,120
I'll handle it.

337
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,639
What are you doing here?

338
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,919
Old Buddha.

339
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,600
You want to drive me out of the Old Street.

340
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,799
There are only two reasons.

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,799
First...

342
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,679
...you think I kidnapped Xiaoxiao.

343
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,720
Second...

344
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,600
...Bai Yuchen says it's because of me...

345
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,960
...you can't join the Chinese Association.

346
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,039
Right?

347
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,799
These two things are the most important...

348
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,279
...issues for our Old Street.

349
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,279
How can you still act so indifferent?

350
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,720
That's because I'm completely innocent.

351
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,960
I have a clear conscience.

352
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,120
Xiaoxiao was you...

353
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,080
...Auntie Feng.

354
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,279
Even a convicted criminal...

355
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,879
...can hire a lawyer to appeal.

356
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,399
You can't just call me a kidnapper based on guesses.

357
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,679
That's not right, is it?

358
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,440
That's true.

359
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
You can't just listen to Bai Yuchen's nonsense.

360
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,000
Old Buddha.

361
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,480
I know you're tight on money...

362
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,440
...because of saving Xiaoxiao.

363
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,159
Saving Xiaoxiao is one thing...

364
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,000
...but we also need to earn a living.

365
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,360
Otherwise, if another child gets poisoned...

366
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,200
...how will we pay the hospital?

367
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,200
Yes.

368
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,639
I know you don't trust me yet.

369
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,559
That's fine.

370
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,320
The truth will come out when Xiaoxiao wakes up.

371
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,159
Don't just sweet-talk us.

372
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,320
You probably wish my child...

373
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,039
Da Fo.

374
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,039
Whether it's saving Xiaoxiao...

375
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,600
...or clearing up your misunderstanding of me...

376
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,360
...I, Zhao Fengsheng, am willing to do it.

377
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,840
As for the Chinese Association matter...

378
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,919
...I'll handle it.

379
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,879
Brother.

380
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:00,879
That's the spirit.

381
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,440
Damn right.

382
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,240
You'll handle it?

383
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,639
What do you mean?

384
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,360
It means...

385
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,759
...without going through Bai Yuchen...

386
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,879
...I can get everyone to join immediately...

387
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,679
...the Chinese Association.

388
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,799
You?

389
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,120
Do you even know Manager Bai...

390
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,840
And what's more...

391
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,279
...no one has to hand over any profits.

392
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,200
This... can't be.

393
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,279
Impossible.

394
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,080
Not even ten percent profit?

395
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,679
You're just...

396
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,159
...you're just bragging to us.

397
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:21,919
Bragging.

398
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,480
If I can't handle such a small matter...

399
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,080
...then my years abroad...

400
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,279
...would have been a complete waste.

401
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,960
Is what he said true or not?

402
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,039
Is he even reliable, looking like that?

403
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,639
What's the rush?

404
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,639
One or two more days won't make a difference.

405
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,679
Right.

406
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,039
How about...

407
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,840
we let him try?

408
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,679
With his sloppy, carefree attitude,

409
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,799
is he reliable?

410
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,759
But we can't just keep waiting forever.

411
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,799
Neighbors,

412
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,000
just give me three days.

413
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
If I, Zhao Fengsheng, can't do it,

414
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,639
I'll pack up and get out of the Old Street immediately.

415
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,279
Three days.

416
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,679
Give him three days to try.

417
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,559
Fine.

418
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,679
I'll give you three days.

419
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,399
Good.

420
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,600
If you fail,

421
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,320
don't blame the neighbors for being unkind.

422
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,480
Deal.

423
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's go, go, go.

424
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,799
Take care on your way, neighbors.

425
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,960
Watch your step.

426
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,080
Not bad, Shengzi.

427
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,600
Your bragging skills have improved.

428
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,159
Who's bragging?

429
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
Three days is enough for us

430
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
to pack up and run away.

431
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,720
What was that place you went abroad to called again?

432
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,519
Your big brother here

433
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,720
has saved up a bit of a marriage fund.

434
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,679
We'll bring Xiaoman along,

435
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,519
for the journey.

436
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,080
Why are you on the same page as Er Ni?

437
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,360
It's just a matter of one phone call.

438
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,480
Why would we need to run away?

439
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,440
Wait here.

440
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
Are you talking about...

441
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,799
the Chinese Association?

442
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,360
Hurry up.

443
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,320
Get me some change.

444
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,159
Your brother needs to make a call.

445
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,080
You don't even have a dime and you're still bragging.

446
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,840
You only have one yuan yourself.

447
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,399
Just wait and see.

448
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,559
Where's my lighter?

449
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,360
President Li.

450
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,120
The head of the Jin family invites you to dinner tonight.

451
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,279
To discuss the matter of the seven-hundred-acre rubber plantation.

452
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,639
For matters of ten or twenty million in the future,

453
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,840
you can decide for yourself.

454
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,600
Understood.

455
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,240
Whoever you are,

456
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,759
I'm only giving you ten seconds.

457
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,759
Er Leng?

458
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,399
Is that you or not?

459
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,559
Boss!

460
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,440
It's me.

461
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,519
It's Er Leng!

462
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,879
You finally called me!
