1
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:43,960
Erni

2
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,399
If we go by what others think,

3
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,200
I'm nowhere near as good as Bai Yuchen.

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,359
Why do you always hang out with me?

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,799
Is now the right time to take advantage of me?

6
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,240
With this old, salty tofu of yours,

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,679
I'm worried I won't even digest it.

8
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,799
You want to ask

9
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,159
why I took a liking to you?

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,319
This is the reason.

11
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,599
Xiao Qing

12
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,400
We've asked you out so many times, but you never show.

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,959
I need to go home and do my homework.

14
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,680
What homework?

15
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,079
We brothers never went to school.

16
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,319
Come with us for a little tutoring.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
I'm not going.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,280
You...

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,840
Let go of me!

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,760
A bunch of Steel Mill trash!

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,239
Daring to bully someone from our Old Street!

22
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,120
Zhao Fengsheng!

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,519
Still wet behind the ears, trying to play the hero?

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,719
Old Street

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,519
is under my, Zhao Fengsheng's, cover.

26
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,519
You cover it?

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,799
That piece of land, Old Street,

28
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,359
our Steel Mill has its eyes on it.

29
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,439
You little brat,

30
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,319
can you really cover it?

31
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,879
Let's go.

32
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,640
Think you can leave?

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,759
Trying to run?

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,919
I'll kill you, kid!

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
I'll smash you!

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,599
I'll smash...

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll smash you!

38
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,199
I'll smash you!

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,439
I'll smash all of you!

40
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:27,919
Go, go!

41
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,919
Smash you all!

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,080
Are you okay?

43
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,080
This is nothing.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,599
If anything happens in the future, call your brother.

45
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,199
I'll cover you.

46
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,960
Is your injury okay?

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,199
It's fine.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,960
So I've been handsome since I was a kid, huh?

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,240
Do you even understand romance?

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,599
You completely ruined the good mood.

51
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,120
It's fine.

52
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,240
No, no, no.

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,560
Don't move.

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,280
It's dangerous.

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,639
Do you even know how to ride?

56
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,400
If not, I'll do it.

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
Da Gang's junker only has foot brakes.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,639
It wears out shoes too fast.

59
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,319
I'll do it, I'll do it.

60
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,680
Hold on tight!

61
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:19,960
Okay.

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,120
Let's go.

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,199
Be careful.

64
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,080
Pretty impressive, right?

65
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,240
So impressive!

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,319
Not bad at all.

67
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,879
Everyone can relax now, right?

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,360
The banners are already hung up.

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,960
Old Street's Admission ceremony has to be this dignified.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,719
Alright.

71
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,439
Shengzi.

72
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,639
I heard from Erni

73
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
you pretended to be a janitor

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,879
and solved the whole thing.

75
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,560
You really do have the most clever ideas.

76
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,759
Don't listen to her nonsense.

77
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,240
I didn't pretend to be any janitor.

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,199
Don't worry.

79
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,960
Brother knows you care about face.

80
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
I won't tell anyone else.

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Our Old Street is really going to be Admitted.

82
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,479
Old Buddha said it himself.

83
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,319
Could it be false?

84
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,400
Auntie Wang even has the gifts ready.

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,599
This old woman of mine,

86
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,479
doesn't know how to do anything.

87
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,199
Can only manage a bit of handiwork

88
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,360
to express my thanks.

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,480
No need to be so polite.

90
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,879
Today's problems are all solved.

91
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,959
We're all still one family.

92
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,759
Right, don't stand on ceremony.

93
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,360
Where is everyone?

94
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,079
Manager Bai

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,519
Such a grand occasion.

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,360
Manager Bai

97
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,879
I've prepared a gift for you.

98
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,279
Really?

99
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,319
You're too kind.

100
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,240
Too kind.

101
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,199
Manager Bai

102
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,279
I've brought something for you too.

103
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,959
To show my gratitude.

104
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,199
Manager Bai

105
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,000
This old woman thanks you.

106
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,399
What's going on?

107
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,160
They seem to be thanking Bai Yuchen.

108
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,519
Everyone, this...

109
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,319
Put it over there.

110
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,879
Over there.

111
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,800
Put it over here by me.

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,279
Come on, come on.

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,360
This guy's addicted to stealing credit.

114
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,160
Let's go deal with him.

115
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,600
Everyone is being too polite.

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:55,759
Too polite.

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,079
You're all too kind.

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,879
As for me,

119
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,680
I merely

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,079
did a little bit of insignificant work.

121
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,920
If you want to thank anyone,

122
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,560
thank the Qian Group's

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,639
Miss Qian and Chairman Qian.

124
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,279
Alright?

125
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:06,759
Good!

126
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,399
Good!

127
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,120
Yuchen,

128
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,680
Don't be so modest.

129
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,360
You're Old Street's great benefactor.

130
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,160
I dare not, I dare not.

131
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,519
You're not just our benefactor,

132
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,279
you're also Old Street's son-in-law.

133
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,680
Right, right, right.

134
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,839
That Guiying,

135
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,160
gave birth to a fine girl.

136
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,079
Otherwise,

137
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,279
how could we have connected with Manager Bai

138
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,839
and the Qian Group?

139
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,600
Isn't that right?

140
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,000
Makes sense, makes sense.

141
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,279
This is from your auntie,

142
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,720
a "Mandarin Ducks Playing in Water" embroidery for you.

143
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,439
I wish for you

144
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,920
and Manager Bai "a hundred years of happiness."

145
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,600
Here, take it.

146
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,040
No, no, no.

147
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,759
No, I can't.

148
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,240
She's shy.

149
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,759
Thank you.

150
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,399
Mom, what are you doing?

151
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
Auntie Wang,

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,079
that's very thoughtful.

153
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,439
Everyone, please don't be so formal.

154
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,639
Just call me Yuchen from now on.

155
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,399
Just Yuchen is fine.

156
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,079
Alright.

157
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,800
Auntie Wang,

158
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,480
You can't just play matchmaker like that.

159
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,920
Also, Old Street's admission

160
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,199
was all thanks to Shengzi.

161
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,399
Shengzi went to the Qian Group to secure it.

162
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,079
Right?

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,319
He...

164
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,240
Shengzi,

165
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,439
quickly tell everyone.

166
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,519
Was it you who brought the Qian Group people here?

167
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,360
I promise everyone,

168
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,079
yesterday, Chairman Qian

169
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,240
personally discussed Old Street's admission with me.

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,879
You...

171
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,439
That's right.

172
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't you dare lie to the neighbors here.

173
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,639
Okay?

174
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,439
What?

175
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
What you all don't know is,

176
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,920
yesterday, our Chairman Qian

177
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,720
canceled all appointments to meet an important guest.

178
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,560
All appointments were canceled.

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,439
Even the matter of Old Street's admission

180
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,879
was something I submitted a report on

181
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,040
and passed up.

182
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,839
Thank you, thank you.

183
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,639
Zhao Fengsheng,

184
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,160
do you have anything else to say?

185
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,240
The person Chairman Qian met yesterday

186
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,480
was me.

187
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,399
It was a brother of mine.

188
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,160
You...

189
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,920
You say Chairman Qian canceled all appointments

190
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,399
just to see you?

191
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,040
Right?

192
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,519
Yes.

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,319
Look at what you are.

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,879
Our Yuchen

195
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,160
needs an appointment

196
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,360
to see Chairman Qian.

197
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,399
You, this little punk,

198
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,399
think Chairman Qian would personally receive you?

199
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Alright, alright.

200
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,079
Now's not the time to argue.

201
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,160
Hurry up and get the ceremony ready

202
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,800
to welcome the Qian Group leaders.

203
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,319
Okay.

204
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,199
Hurry, hurry.

205
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,639
Make some more preparations.

206
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,000
Alright, alright.

207
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,319
None of you believe me, right?

208
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,439
Just wait, I'll show you all

209
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,920
who's the one full of lies.

210
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
The Qian Group is here!

211
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,879
The Qian Group is here!

212
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,800
The Qian Group is here!

213
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,959
Go welcome them quickly!

214
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,680
President Qian!

215
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:25,959
Careful.

216
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:27,839
I'll do it.

217
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,399
Neighbors!

218
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,399
These two

219
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,920
are from our Qian Group:

220
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,519
Miss Tianyu and Mr. Chen.

221
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,199
Welcome!

222
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,600
Welcome, welcome!

223
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,439
Welcome, welcome!

224
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,639
Miss Tianyu, Mr. Chen,

225
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,839
welcome! Welcome!

226
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,279
This woman is also a person in charge?

227
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,560
She wouldn't come here to cause trouble on purpose, would she?

228
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
What's there to fear?

229
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,720
The head of the Qian family already agreed.

230
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,079
She's just a young girl.

231
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,040
What can she do?

232
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,000
Tianyu.

233
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:56,959
Yaqing.

234
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm here.

235
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,600
Go ahead.

236
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,439
Go, go, go

237
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,399
What's the meaning of this?

238
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,120
If we let the Qian Group

239
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,519
know Old Street has a human trafficker,

240
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,720
what if they don't let us join?

241
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
One bad apple spoils the whole barrel?

242
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,600
Exactly.

243
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,000
Uncle,

244
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,639
that's a bit harsh.

245
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,720
Thank you, Qian Group,

246
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,839
for letting our Old Street

247
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,160
join the Chinese Association.

248
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,240
Thank you both for coming.

249
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,079
Please, have a seat.

250
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,199
Since

251
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,240
the Qian Group agreed to Old Street's admission,

252
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,679
they naturally see your development potential.

253
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,919
After Old Street joins,

254
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,879
you won't need to pay any profit share.

255
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,480
Really?

256
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,519
Not even ten percent?

257
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,559
What's going on?

258
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,799
This is fantastic news!

259
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,759
What a great deal!

260
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,679
Brother Chen,

261
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,080
how come they don't even want a profit share?

262
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,159
Miss,

263
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,440
the day Mr. Zhao met with Chairman Qian,

264
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,519
the Chairman personally ordered

265
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,320
the waiver of Old Street's admission fee.

266
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,000
Who did you say met with my father?

267
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,639
Zhao Fengsheng.

268
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,559
Mr. Zhao.

269
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,240
That jerk snuck into Haihu Yuan yesterday.

270
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,720
What on earth did he say to my father?

271
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,200
This... this is wonderful!

272
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,159
Thank you, Bai Yuchen and President Qian!

273
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,840
Yuchen,

274
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,600
you were too modest before.

275
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,759
You have so much say

276
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,519
within the Qian Group.

277
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,159
You're probably going to be Vice President.

278
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,159
No, no.

279
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,519
The Qian Group has never done this before.

280
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,639
Did these Old Street folks really

281
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,799
hit the jackpot?

282
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,200
Thank you, Qian Group,

283
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,120
for giving our Old Street such a big discount.

284
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,200
Thank you.

285
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,679
Thank you, Manager Bai, for your help.

286
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,399
No, no.

287
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,720
It's my duty.

288
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Thank you, President Qian.

289
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,679
Thank you, Manager Bai.

290
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,360
Thank you, thank you.

291
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,639
Erni,

292
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,240
Now you see it clearly, right?

293
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,840
Leave that good-for-nothing Zhao Fengsheng now.

294
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,039
Only Manager Bai

295
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,159
is right for you.

296
00:09:59,159 --> 00:09:59,960
Um,

297
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,360
let me say something.

298
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,840
Our Old Street joining

299
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,080
was negotiated by Shengzi himself with Chairman Qian.

300
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you all kissing up to the wrong person?

301
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,759
Gangzi,

302
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,320
I know you and Zhao Fengsheng are good brothers.

303
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,440
You want to speak up for him.

304
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,960
But look at what day it is today.

305
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,720
Zhao Fengsheng,

306
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,279
before President Qian arrived,

307
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,919
you could brag all you wanted.

308
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,559
If you have the guts,

309
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,759
then today,

310
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,759
in front of everyone and President Qian,

311
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,679
dare you say it again?

312
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,639
Why wouldn't I dare?

313
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,240
Brother Chen,

314
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,159
you were there yesterday.

315
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,200
Tell them

316
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,120
how I negotiated

317
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,960
with Chairman Qian yesterday.
