1
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,479
For matters of ten or twenty million in the future,

2
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,799
you can decide for yourself.

3
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,560
Yes.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,200
No matter who you are,

5
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,719
I'm only giving you ten seconds.

6
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:50,960
Er Leng?

7
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,320
Is that you or not?

8
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,520
Boss!

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,399
It's me.

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,479
I'm Er Leng.

11
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,840
You finally called me.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,879
I need to ask you something.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,480
Boss,

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,239
your orders.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,120
Do you know anyone from the Bianshui Qian Family Group?

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,760
The Qian family in Bianshui?

17
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,959
I know them.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,879
The head of the family is called

19
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,079
Qian Zongran.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,959
He controls an organization called the

21
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,000
Chinese Association.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,799
He's a subordinate under me.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,799
Yes, yes, yes.

24
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,719
That's the guy.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,040
I need to ask him for a favor.

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,400
Boss,

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
I'm now the president of the Li Group,

28
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,439
and the family's first-in-line heir.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,879
Why ask that guy Qian when I'm much more useful?

30
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,319
Thirty seconds left.

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,920
Boss,

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,920
it's just a matter in Bianshui, right?

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,799
We'll handle him.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,079
Er Leng, your habit of talking nonsense...

35
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,799
I'll bring the Li family's people directly.

36
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,280
No matter if he's some local bully

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,200
or a mountain tiger,

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,239
I'll take care of him.

39
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,159
Er Leng, receive your orders.

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,200
Yes!

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,920
Boss.

42
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,959
I want to see Qian Zongran tomorrow.

43
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,879
Can you make it happen?

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,959
Yes.

45
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,760
Location?

46
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,680
Haihu Yuan.

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,439
Time?

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,879
I'll have him clear his entire day.

49
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:04,840
I...

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,640
No, Auntie,

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,799
I haven't finished speaking.

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,000
Time's up.

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,000
You...

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,639
We're all neighbors.

55
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,599
Why are you so stingy?

56
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,360
You're about to be kicked out of Old Street.

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,400
Who's your neighbor?

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,639
You...

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
That's a bit much.

60
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,840
Pah!

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
Still dreaming of entering the Qian Family Group?

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,719
Putting on a show with one dollar?

63
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,080
Why don't you take a piss and look at yourself?

64
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,400
See what kind of trash you are.

65
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Really.

66
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,319
Hello?

67
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,039
Yes.

68
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,800
Young Master Li.

69
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,439
I'll clear my entire day tomorrow,

70
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,000
awaiting Mr. Zhao's arrival.

71
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,120
Good.

72
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,840
Yes.

73
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,120
Chen Zhexiong.

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,919
Your orders.

75
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,479
Cancel all appointments for tomorrow.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,919
Have everyone in the Qian family prepare.

77
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,039
To receive the honored guest.

78
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

79
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,240
Chairman.

80
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,039
Who is coming tomorrow

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,960
that you're taking it so seriously?

82
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,080
A person

83
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,280
whom Young Master Li personally called to look after.

84
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,120
The Li family's Li Xiangping.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,960
Chairman, rest assured,

86
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,400
I will make sure everyone in the Qian family

87
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,319
is extremely careful.

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,080
May I ask,

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,000
what is this honored guest's name?

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Old Street's Zhao Fengsheng.

91
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,400
Do you know him?

92
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,560
Tianyu?

93
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,280
It's me.

94
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,560
Yaqing.

95
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,520
What's up?

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
It's like this.

97
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,319
Shengzi promised the neighbors he'd join

98
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,560
the Chinese Association.

99
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,439
I wanted to ask for your help.

100
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,439
He...

101
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,639
Wasn't he acting all impressive yesterday?

102
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,759
In the end, he's still just a

103
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,400
darn fraud who relies on women.

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,159
Tianyu,

105
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,240
please just help him.

106
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,680
I have nothing to say to him.

107
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Yaqing,

108
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,959
if it weren't for you,

109
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,759
I would never have any interaction

110
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,480
with this kind of hoodlum.

111
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
But he already promised the neighbors

112
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,639
he'd get the joining done within three days.

113
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,519
The Chinese Association matter.

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,319
If you don't help him,

115
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,759
no one else can.

116
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,399
This kind of hoodlum really dares to make such big promises.

117
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,319
Yaqing,

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
it's not that I won't help you.

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,319
It's that our Qian family

120
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,959
is receiving an important guest today.

121
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,040
My father specifically ordered

122
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,839
that no one is to go out casually.

123
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,040
I see.

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,279
Then I'll think of another way.

125
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,279
Thanks.

126
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,000
Dad is meeting an important guest today.

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,680
Why isn't this area cleaned up properly?

128
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,519
And here too.

129
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,240
So many fallen leaves.

130
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,360
Get someone to take care of it.

131
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,439
What's with this darn bike and the mop tied to it?

132
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,800
You.

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,519
Come here.

134
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,560
Me?

135
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,319
Qian Tianyu.

136
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,879
You work here?

137
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,160
Zhao Fengsheng.

138
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
What are you doing here?

139
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,199
Yaqing gave you my home address.

140
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,480
I'm here to see someone on business.

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,879
What's it to you?

142
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
You know I don't want to see you.

143
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,079
Dressed like that, sneaking in, huh?

144
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,040
Someone like you,

145
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,639
who only brags by relying on women,

146
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,839
expects me to help you?

147
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,720
Let me tell you,

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,879
I'm not Yaqing.

149
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,920
Even if you cleaned

150
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,160
all the bird poop here today,

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,839
I wouldn't pity you,

152
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,040
nor would I listen to your apology.

153
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,480
Psycho.

154
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,639
Why are you so narcissistic?

155
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,319
Me? Narcissistic?

156
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,000
I...

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,439
You...

158
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,000
You jerk!

159
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,920
Get out of here!

160
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,199
Where's the manager?

161
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,920
Come here.

162
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,000
Do you know what important day it is today?

163
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,839
Don't you know?

164
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,160
Just now, a hoodlum riding

165
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,720
a broken bike entered Haihu Yuan.

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
Find him for me immediately.

167
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,319
Yes.

168
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,279
I'll go look right away.

169
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,920
Me? Narcissistic?

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,399
Brother.

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,199
Is Chairman Qian here?

172
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:12,959
You are?

173
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm Zhao Fengsheng.

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,199
I have an appointment with Chairman Qian.

175
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,800
So it's Mr. Zhao.

176
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,600
Please, come in.

177
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Chairman.

178
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,120
I've been looking forward to your visit.

179
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,839
Alright.

180
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,720
Uh, this...

181
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
The bike goes here, right?

182
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Please.

183
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,680
Of course, of course.

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,879
Brother Zhao.

185
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,720
Tomorrow, I'll personally send people to Old Street

186
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,040
to sign membership contracts with the residents.

187
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,319
That settles it.

188
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,519
Thank you, Chairman Qian.

189
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,000
You're too kind, Brother Zhao.

190
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,199
Old Street is located at the junction of three borders.

191
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,480
Its development potential

192
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,240
is still quite significant.

193
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,480
Chairman Qian, please don't feel pressured.

194
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
How could I?

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,079
I, Qian, have long hoped for Old Street to join.

196
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,720
It's just that the residents' thinking is conservative,

197
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,040
unwilling to trust outsiders.

198
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,120
That's true.

199
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,759
My uncles and aunts,

200
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,720
their tempers are as hard as stone.

201
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,319
However,

202
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,439
with Brother Zhao leading from now on,

203
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:15,120
Old Street is sure to shine brilliantly.

204
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,000
Then I'll take your kind words as a blessing.

205
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
I'll take my leave now.

206
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,360
Brother Zhao.

207
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,720
Won't you stay for a simple meal?

208
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,319
Everything is already prepared at home.

209
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,519
No need to trouble yourself.

210
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,160
When time permits,

211
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,079
I'll trouble you again then.

212
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,959
You go see him out.

213
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,319
Take care, Mr. Zhao.

214
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Chairman.

215
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,759
I've looked into this Zhao Fengsheng.

216
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,759
I heard he's just a hoodlum from Old Street.

217
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,399
That can't be.

218
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,279
A hoodlum,

219
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,319
how could he know Young Master Li?

220
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,279
I heard he suddenly disappeared five years ago

221
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,680
and only recently returned to Old Street.

222
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,079
Young Master Li also left five years ago.

223
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,160
After returning,

224
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,399
he immediately obtained the heir status.

225
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,720
Could there be some connection in between?

226
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,040
If you can't figure it out, don't dwell on it.

227
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,000
Do not investigate Zhao Fengsheng's background any further.

228
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,279
To avoid getting involved in the conflicts of big shots.

229
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,399
Yes.

230
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,959
We

231
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,959
only need to build a good relationship with Zhao Fengsheng.

232
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,240
If the Qian Family Group can gain the Li family's favor,

233
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,679
it will become as stable as Mount Tai.

234
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,120
We'll never have to fear

235
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
being annexed by the Tang Family.

236
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,320
Er Ni

237
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,840
On such a hot day,

238
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,279
who are you squatting here waiting for?

239
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,639
Waiting for an idiot.

240
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:58,919
Who?

241
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,240
Which one?

242
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,879
You, of course, you idiot.

243
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,519
Tried to sneak into the Qian Family Group

244
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,759
as a janitor and got kicked out, right?

245
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
Who do you think you're looking down on?

246
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,440
The Qian Family Group

247
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,279
politely invited me in.

248
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,240
Kicked out.

249
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,080
And besides...

250
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,799
Alright.

251
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,440
Stop pretending in front of me.

252
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,279
Shengzi.

253
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
Tianyu isn't an unreasonable person.

254
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,519
Here's the thing.

255
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,000
Tomorrow, I'll arrange a meeting for you two.

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,919
You apologize to her sincerely,

257
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,159
and she'll put in a good word for you

258
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,960
regarding the Old Street joining the association.

259
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,279
She'll let you stay on Old Street.

260
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,639
Er Ni.

261
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,519
Don't go begging people.

262
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,360
I've already settled this.

263
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,360
President Qian will send someone to sign the contract tomorrow.

264
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,600
Fine.

265
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,360
Even if the neighbors try to kick you out,

266
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,320
so what?

267
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
At worst, I'll build a brick wall at your door.

268
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,039
Whoever comes,

269
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,679
I'll smack 'em dead.

270
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,399
Don't you dare.

271
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm afraid your mom

272
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
will set my house on fire.

273
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
You have no sense of gratitude.

274
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,320
Can't you praise me a little?

275
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,360
Praise.

276
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
Praise, praise, praise.

277
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,120
Er Ni is the most righteous

278
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,679
and most beautiful woman I've ever met.

279
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,000
And?

280
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,159
And also...

281
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,720
And also... the most generous,

282
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,320
and strongest woman.

283
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,960
You... you...

284
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,360
Damn Zhao Fengsheng!

285
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
You wait for me!

286
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,039
You wait for me!

287
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,639
Wait till I get on the bike!

288
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,279
Slow down!

289
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,600
Let's go!

290
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,360
Go.

291
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,200
Take me to get something good to eat.

292
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,120
Let's have a couple of beers.

293
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,720
Alright.

294
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,879
You seem a bit heavier than last time.

295
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,120
Do you even know how to talk?

296
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,039
Do you know how to talk?
