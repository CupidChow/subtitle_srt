1
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,240
Stop

2
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,880
You've grown up, huh?

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,320
Don't be shy.

4
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,000
Er Ni

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,119
Impulse is the devil.

6
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,759
Impulse is the devil, Er Ni!

7
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:00,840
No

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,600
Zhao Fengsheng

9
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,640
Shengzi, is this girl feisty enough for you?

10
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,400
Gangzi, you son of a bitch, you set me up!

11
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,159
Zhao Fengsheng, stop!

12
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,840
If we don't let Er Ni vent her anger...

13
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,760
...where will she vent the fire she's held for five years?

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,959
Er Ni

15
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,159
Er Ni, don't be impulsive, Er Ni!

16
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,599
Zhao Fengsheng

17
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,599
You jerk, stop!

18
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,599
I said, hurry up!

19
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,560
Zhao Fengsheng

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,079
That scoundrel's sneaked back.

21
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,200
That filthy hooligan!

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,519
Causing trouble for girls as soon as he's back.

23
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,280
Let's go.

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
Go, go, beat him out of here!

25
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:35,959
Go, go, go!

26
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,719
Zhao Fengsheng

27
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,359
Stop!

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,319
Zhao Fengsheng

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,400
Stop!

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,680
Zhao Fengsheng

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,599
Run faster!

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,439
Zhao Fengsheng

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,359
You jerk!

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,079
Er Ni

35
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,280
You stop, Zhao Fengsheng!

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
Hit him!

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
Neighbors!

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,040
It's a misunderstanding!

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,319
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding!

40
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,879
Neighbors, it's a misunderstanding!

41
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,680
Hurry, hurry!

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,400
Er Ni

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,920
Listen to me!

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,200
What did that jerk Zhao Fengsheng do to you?

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,159
Nothing!

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,000
It's a misunderstanding, Mom!

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
Er Ni, Er Ni!

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,599
Don't be afraid.

49
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,439
The neighbors will help you deal with him.

50
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,759
No

51
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,479
Er Ni

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,520
Go back inside!

53
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,120
Mom

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,520
Go.

55
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,280
Filthy hooligan!

56
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,680
You dare come back?

57
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,479
Beat you to death!

58
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,159
Hit him!

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,479
Where'd he go?

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,240
Where is he?

61
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,000
Is he up ahead?

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,719
Up ahead.

63
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,360
Chase him that way!

64
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,960
Drive him out of Old Street!

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,039
Hiding from the neighbors, then hiding from Er Ni.

66
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,520
Hiding from Er Ni, then hiding from the neighbors again.

67
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,680
Can't let them keep misunderstanding like this.

68
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,719
Need to talk to them.

69
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,680
Looking like I'm sneaking around at night...

70
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,039
...if I go explain to the neighbors now...

71
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,360
...they'd surely beat me to death.

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,439
That kid Dafo...

73
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,280
...was chasing me the most enthusiastically.

74
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,960
So borrowing his clothes isn't too much to ask.

75
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,199
This is Dafo's son.

76
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,719
Just like his father was as a kid.

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
Don't worry, Brother Xiaobei.

78
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,879
Before tomorrow morning...

79
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,319
...this kid will be delivered to the Traffickers' Village.

80
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,479
Be smart about it.

81
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,800
The boss has given orders.

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,159
We must frame Zhao Fengsheng for the goods theft.

83
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,919
Go.

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,039
Move.

85
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,599
What are you doing?

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,719
Put the child down.

87
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,039
Put him down!

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Zhao Fengsheng!

89
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,439
Fancy meeting you here.

90
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,719
Get out of my way.

91
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,519
I don't have time for this.

92
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,240
Stop him!

93
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,240
Stop the car!

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,279
Put the child down!

95
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,000
Someone, help!

96
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,040
Zhao Fengsheng is kidnapping the child!

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,279
What's going on?

98
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,360
What happened?

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
Come out, quick!

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,240
Everyone, come out!

101
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,079
What's the matter?

102
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,839
Zhao Fengsheng!

103
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,600
Zhao Fengsheng took Xiaoxiao!

104
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,279
Xiaoxiao!

105
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,800
You're turning the tables on me?

106
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,639
My Xiaoxiao!

107
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
Neighbors!

108
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,759
The trafficker is Chen Xiaobei!

109
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:39,839
Chen Xiaobei is the trafficker!

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,759
If he hadn't stopped me from chasing the car...

111
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,279
If he hadn't blocked me...

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
I would've saved Xiaoxiao already!

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,639
That's bullshit!

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,759
If I hadn't stopped you...

115
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,879
you would've gotten in the car and fled!

116
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,279
My two brothers can vouch for me.

117
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,319
Yes, it was him! It was him!

118
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:48,879
He really did it.

119
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,839
Zhao Fengsheng!

120
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,040
Give my Xiaoxiao back!

121
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,639
Auntie Feng...

122
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,000
You...

123
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,720
The clothes are mine.

124
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,160
If it's not you, Zhao Fengsheng, then who?

125
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,959
My Xiaoxiao!

126
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,600
Mom! Mom!

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,279
Xiaoxiao!

128
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,519
It's all my fault.

129
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,439
I shouldn't have said those things about you not coming back to Old Street.

130
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,800
You're truly despicable.

131
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,560
For the sake of all our years as neighbors...

132
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,600
I beg you, let Xiaoxiao go.

133
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,480
Give Xiaoxiao back.

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,240
I'll kowtow to you right here.

135
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,759
Auntie Feng!

136
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,800
Mom! Mom!

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,439
Neighbors!

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,319
I, Zhao Fengsheng, am also from Old Street.

139
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,439
How could I do such a heartless thing?

140
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,759
Hand over Xiaoxiao!

141
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,000
Everyone, calm down!

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,199
Hand over the child!

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
Don't push him too hard.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What if he...

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
hurts the child?

146
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,199
What then?

147
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,879
Dad.

148
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,279
What do you mean?

149
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,759
Just let him go look.

150
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,079
As long as Xiaoxiao comes back...

151
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,519
we can deal with Zhao Fengsheng later.

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,439
Fine.

153
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,240
I understand.

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,879
Quiet, everyone!

155
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,560
Don't get worked up.

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:44,959
Settle down!

157
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,720
Listen to me.

158
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,839
Zhao Fengsheng.

159
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,000
Can you really bring my child back?

160
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,959
Five years ago, because of me...

161
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,959
Because of what I did...

162
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,680
everyone lost the coal mine.

163
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,839
But this time...

164
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,639
with everyone watching...

165
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,199
we'll see the truth in your actions.

166
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,040
If by tomorrow noon...

167
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,079
you don't bring my child back...

168
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,240
I'll tear your house down.

169
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,920
and drive you out of Old Street for good.

170
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,360
Neighbors!

171
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,240
Everyone!

172
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,000
Please, help look for her too.

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,959
Alright, don't worry.

174
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,519
Thank you.

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,920
Split up and search.

176
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,920
Dafo.

177
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,800
Let's search over there.

178
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
I'll go with you.

179
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Let's go, together.

180
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,959
Get lost.

181
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,120
Fine.

182
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,480
If it's not him, then who?

183
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,360
Enough talk.

184
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
He'll take revenge on us later.

185
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,480
Hey, Boss Crow

186
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
The kidnapping of the child

187
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,879
has been pinned on Zhao Fengsheng.

188
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,680
He can't stay in Old Street anymore.

189
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
Chen Xiaobei works for Wuya.

190
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,319
Then we'll find Wuya.

191
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,079
Once I get the child back,

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,680
you'll see how I settle the score with you, jerk.

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
What?

194
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,519
Shengzi kidnapped Xiaoxiao?

195
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,480
How is that possible?

196
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,399
Have they lost their minds?

197
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,240
Where do you think you're going?

198
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,959
That Zhao Fengsheng,

199
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,920
fighting and brawling since he was a kid is one thing,

200
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,839
but now he's even doing something as inhuman

201
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,759
as trafficking children.

202
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,560
And you still dare to associate with that kind of person?

203
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,279
Mom!

204
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,519
Did you see it with your own eyes?

205
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,319
Forget it.

206
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm not talking to you.

207
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Where are you going?

208
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,360
Yaqing.

209
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,720
Tianyu.

210
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,240
Auntie.

211
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:13,879
Miss Qian.

212
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,079
What brings you here?

213
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,920
I came to see you and your mom.

214
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,560
You didn't even come to the party I invited you to.

215
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:19,639
Hello, Auntie.

216
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:19,920
Have a seat.

217
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,399
I can't even run into you at the spa.

218
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,839
What have you been so busy with?

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Yaqing,

220
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,879
let me introduce someone to you.

221
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,720
Bai Yuchen.

222
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,680
He's a department manager at our Qian Group.

223
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,319
He's actually one of our group's

224
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,639
key young talents to be cultivated.

225
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,240
Yuchen,

226
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,959
this is my best friend, Cui Yaqing.

227
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,120
Hello, Yaqing.

228
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,839
Actually,

229
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,959
I've known about you for a long time.

230
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,759
These,

231
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,279
are all gifts I brought for you

232
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,319
from Western Europe.

233
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,120
Please accept them.

234
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,040
Let's be friends.

235
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm sorry,

236
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,519
Tianyu's friends are my friends.

237
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,160
There's no need for a special introduction.

238
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,800
Right, right.

239
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,319
As for the gifts,

240
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,160
they're not necessary.

241
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,439
This silly girl doesn't know how to talk.

242
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,759
Miss Qian, Manager Bai,

243
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,600
you two sit for a while.

244
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,680
I'll go make some tea for you.

245
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,959
Thank you, Auntie.

246
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,079
So, what do you think?

247
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,680
Think about what?

248
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't play matchmaker.

249
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,279
Take him away, now.

250
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,360
I already have someone I like.

251
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,720
Who?

252
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,519
Still that little punk?

253
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,959
How is he worthy of you?

254
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,959
That's because you don't know Shengzi.

255
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,560
I'll introduce you two another day.

256
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,720
He's not that kind of person.

257
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,120
He's back.

258
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,879
The neighbors have some misunderstandings about him.

259
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,120
I need to go see him.

260
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,919
You two stay here.

261
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,240
Yaqing!

262
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,120
You silly girl!

263
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,080
You get back here!

264
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,519
That Er Ni girl,

265
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,879
has no manners at all.

266
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,759
Miss Qian,

267
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,559
have some tea.

268
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Manager Bai,

269
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,960
here, have tea.

270
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,039
Yaqing and Zhao Fengsheng are...

271
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,799
Our Er Ni

272
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,519
has no such relationship with that Zhao Fengsheng.

273
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,919
It's all because Er Ni was naive as a child.

274
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,039
She spent all day playing with Zhao Fengsheng,

275
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,200
Gangzi, and Painted Face.

276
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:08,840
As a result,

277
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,559
they were called the Four Pests of the Old Street.

278
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,919
From now on, I absolutely forbid Er Ni

279
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,559
from having any contact with that trafficker.

280
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Trafficker?

281
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,960
You don't know?

282
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,519
Let me tell you.

283
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,440
That Zhao Fengsheng,

284
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
has no conscience.

285
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,720
He's too wicked.

286
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,159
Chen Xiaobei saw him

287
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,799
trafficking Xiaoxiao away.

288
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,559
Bei Wazi!

289
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,440
You, the street procurement specialist,

290
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,279
really know how to save money for Old Street.

291
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,679
This time, at the Old Street Residents' Committee meeting,

292
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm going to praise you properly.

293
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,960
Everyone has a hard time doing business.

294
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,360
If I don't help the neighbors save money,

295
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
they can't make ends meet.

296
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,120
Right?

297
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,759
Hurry home for dinner.

298
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,919
Sure, sure.

299
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,200
Xiao Bei.

300
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,960
Bro.

301
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,879
A beauty.

302
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,600
You're a lucky man, bro.

303
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,519
What nonsense are you talking?

304
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,600
This is my grandaunt.

305
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,080
My dear lady.

306
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,879
Where are you off to?

307
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,679
Playing mahjong.

308
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,480
One player short of three.

309
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,399
My dear lady,

310
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,919
I still have some business with the guys.

311
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,360
Next time.

312
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,840
Definitely next time.

313
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
What do you mean?

314
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,200
Afraid this lady has no money or something?

315
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:20,720
No.

316
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,440
Don't make this lady lose her temper.

317
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,279
Let's go, quick.

318
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,879
Hurry up!

319
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,720
Are you done yet?

320
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,559
Come on, come on.

321
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,559
Is it burnt?

322
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,399
It's still raw.

323
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,919
Grill it a bit longer.

324
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,159
Get a bottle of booze.

325
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,759
What do you want?

326
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,200
Who is it?

327
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Looking for trouble?

328
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,519
You're from Wuya, right?

329
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,159
You picking a fight?

330
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,480
Who do you work for?

331
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,559
You've got it wrong, brothers.

332
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,360
I have goods to move.

333
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,159
I was hoping you guys

334
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,720
could introduce me to Boss Crow.

335
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,399
Boss Crow?

336
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,320
You think you can just meet him?

337
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,600
Here.

338
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,440
Big brother.

339
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,519
You think I need your damn cigarette?

340
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,200
No, it's not that.

341
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,000
I have a lot of goods.

342
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,039
If I can make a deal with Boss Crow,

343
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,600
your cut will be substantial.

344
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,120
Twenty percent.

345
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,840
No problem.

346
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,679
Follow me.

347
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,919
Isn't Boss Crow on the boat?

348
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,159
Are we talking or not?

349
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,960
We are.

350
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,840
Of course we are.

351
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,320
Boys!

352
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,399
Eat and drink up!

353
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,440
Come on, everyone.

354
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,039
Sit wherever.

355
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,759
Keep going.

356
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,200
Three of Bamboos.

357
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,440
Mahjong!

358
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,559
Flush!

359
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,840
Not bad, Brother Xiaobei.

360
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,320
Your luck is really good.

361
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,919
Making money again.

362
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,240
This pot's a bit big, Grandaunt.

363
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,960
Keep playing.

364
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,440
Thanks, Grandaunt.

365
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,879
Why am I so unlucky?

366
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,799
I keep losing.

367
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,840
It's luck.

368
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,799
Just luck.

369
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
Blame that jerk Zhao Fengsheng.

370
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,000
After knowing him for so many years,

371
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,039
I never thought he was that kind of guy.

372
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
Zhao Fengsheng will be gone soon.

373
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,480
Then you won't have to worry, Grandaunt.

374
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,480
Shengzi will be gone?

375
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,879
What do you mean?

376
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,799
Did I say that?

377
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
You didn't say it, right?

378
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,679
Seems not.

379
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,320
Didn't say it.

380
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:28,879
Never said it.

381
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,279
You must have misheard, Grandaunt.
