1
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,159
Boss

2
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,719
Xiao Jiu

3
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:49,960
It really is you.

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,759
Shengzi

5
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,679
This is

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,920
a friend I met abroad.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,799
A hoodlum is just a hoodlum.

8
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,480
Look at how you're dressed.

9
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,000
Yaqing

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,359
Let's go in first.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,319
We shouldn't keep the bosses waiting too long.

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,480
Can't you see Shengzi is talking to someone?

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,280
I remember the room number.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,359
I'll talk to my friend for a moment.

15
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,159
You go ahead.

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,359
Boss

17
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,840
That's your wife, right?

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,079
Absolutely stunning.

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,519
What nonsense are you spouting?

20
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,799
Who's that punk?

21
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,200
Daring to act so cocky on my turf.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Don't mind him.

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,680
Aren't you the Su family heir?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
Why are you dressed like a hoodlum?

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,280
Boss

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,959
Can't you tell I'm copying you?

27
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,959
You tell me.

28
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,519
You finally made it here, right?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
Let's go to the presidential suite.

30
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,200
Food, drinks, and fun.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,000
Guaranteed to satisfy you.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm just here to have a meal with friends.

33
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,120
Don't you have business to attend to?

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,920
Go tend to your business.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,519
Business isn't as important as you are.

36
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,400
Xiao Jiu, on command!

37
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,560
Right face!

38
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,719
Go change out of these clothes, now!

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,760
I won't allow it.

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,640
Is there anyone in all of Bian Shui more handsome than me?

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,079
Go.

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,719
Yes, sir.

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,719
Manager Wang.

44
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:07,640
Young Master.

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,800
Whatever my boss needs,

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,319
arrange it all perfectly for him.

47
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,360
Rest assured, Young Master.

48
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,800
Off you go.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,759
After you.

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,680
Yaqing

51
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,639
Eat more today.

52
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
You two are a perfect match.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,960
A match made in heaven.

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,520
Yes.

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,879
When will you invite us to the wedding banquet?

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,919
It's still early, still early.

57
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,680
Sit over there.

58
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,759
Go over.

59
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,479
Where did this hoodlum come from?

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,759
Get out!

61
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,039
Boss Qin.

62
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,759
This is my boyfriend.

63
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,360
Miss Cui.

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't be ridiculous.

65
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,919
How could your boyfriend be this kind of trash?

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,680
Yeah.

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
Only someone like our Manager Bai,

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,759
a man of power and talent,

69
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,400
is worthy of our Miss Cui.

70
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,520
Qian Tianyu didn't come.

71
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,520
So she sent you two pieces of stinking dog shit

72
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,439
to disgust me.

73
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,240
What did you say?

74
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,719
Such uncouth speech.

75
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,800
He really is just a hoodlum.

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,599
Zhao Fengsheng.

77
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,719
Boss Qin and President Zheng

78
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,080
are honored guests personally invited by Miss Qian.

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,639
If you don't understand business matters,

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,039
then just shut your mouth.

81
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,120
Just eat your meal properly.

82
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,479
Pretty Boy.

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,680
You can't even speak properly.

84
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,439
Come on, show me how to shut up and eat.

85
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,240
You...

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,800
You're slacking off all day long.

87
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,919
Coming to a formal gathering

88
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,680
without even decent clothes.

89
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,599
No wonder people look down on you.

90
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,039
Tian Yu.

91
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,560
Tian Yu is my good friend.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,159
For my sake,

93
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,159
don't argue with her.

94
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,000
Fine, fine, fine.

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,439
I'll just focus on eating, okay?

96
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,360
Let go of me.

97
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,840
Yaqing.

98
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,120
With Boss Qin and President Zheng helping you solve

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,879
the shop renovation and cosmetics issues,

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,240
you'll soon become

101
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,759
the biggest beauty salon owner in all of Bian Shui.

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,639
Tian Yu.

103
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,960
I wasn't thinking about expanding.

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,360
I think earning enough to get by is fine.

105
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,039
And also,

106
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,319
don't always hang around with Shengzi.

107
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,039
Yaqing.

108
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,960
You can't be unambitious like some people.

109
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,360
You deserve a better life.

110
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,599
You deserve a better person.

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
Before opening chain stores,

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,480
you and Bai Yuchen should go on a fact-finding tour.

113
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,079
I trust his work ability.

114
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,120
Me, go on a business trip with him?

115
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,759
Yaqing.

116
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,560
It's like this.

117
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,720
By following me, you can learn a lot.

118
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,199
It won't be long

119
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,319
before you quickly integrate into our circle.

120
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,040
Right?

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,759
Then you won't have to suffer with your mom

122
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,079
in that rundown place on the old street anymore.

123
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,519
Shengzi.

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,879
Do you want to move out of the old street?

125
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,959
No.

126
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,160
That shrimp is good, give me some more.

127
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,560
Here.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Tian Yu

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Manager Bai

130
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,160
I appreciate your kindness.

131
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,639
However,

132
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,360
Wherever Shengzi is, I'll be.

133
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,879
About the beauty salon,

134
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,160
let's just forget it.

135
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,240
Yaqing.

136
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,839
Yaqing, why can't you understand?

137
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,680
He's just a hopeless loser,

138
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,399
a good-for-nothing.

139
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,800
Your life will be ruined if you stay with him.

140
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,680
He snatched a child from me.

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,279
A man who never tells the truth.

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
If Erni ends up with trash like you,

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,759
*that* would be ruined.

144
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,319
What nonsense are you spouting?

145
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,800
Everyone on Old Street knows

146
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,079
it was you, Zhao Fengsheng, who trafficked the child.

147
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,120
How dare you slander others here?

148
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,240
Defaming Bai Yuchen.

149
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,319
How can you be so shameless?

150
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,439
I can't be bothered arguing with a woman

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,279
who's all boobs and no brains.

152
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm done eating.

153
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,319
Let's go.

154
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,040
You...

155
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,279
You vulgar, shameless toad!

156
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,800
Zhao Fengsheng, you stop right there!

157
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,480
Miss Qian invited Yaqing today.

158
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,920
Who said you could freeload here?

159
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,319
If you want to leave,

160
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:57,959
fine.

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,199
Pay for the meal first.

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,399
It was just a few shrimp

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,639
and a few glasses of wine.

164
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,680
How much could it be?

165
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,759
Ten imported prawns

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,040
and a bottle of 20-year-old French vintage.

167
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
Twenty thousand yuan isn't unreasonable, is it?

168
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,199
Is Xiao Jiu's dump of a restaurant really this expensive?

169
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,040
Can this guy even afford that?

170
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,199
Of course he can't.

171
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,759
Exactly.

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,639
I'll pay for it.

173
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,800
Yaqing,

174
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,519
As a man,

175
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,120
if he can't even pay for a meal,

176
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,439
how can he make you happy?

177
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,439
What's wrong with that?

178
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,959
I don't care about that.

179
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,480
You...

180
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,120
Zhao Fengsheng,

181
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,160
if you can't cough up the money,

182
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,000
get lost on your own.

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,639
Fine.

184
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,959
Don't make things difficult for Yaqing anymore.

185
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
This little act of yours,

186
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,079
are you trying to embarrass me on purpose?

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
It's just a pity

188
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,920
you still underestimate me, Zhao Fengsheng.

189
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,800
Manager Wang, come here for a moment.

190
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,279
Mr. Zhao.

191
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,240
How may I assist you?

192
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,000
Help me calculate the bill for this table.

193
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,040
Put it on my tab.

194
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,399
I'll settle it with Xiao Jiu in a couple of days.

195
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,360
He's putting it on credit?

196
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,639
On credit?

197
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,959
If you can't afford it, don't eat here.

198
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,319
Mr. Zhao, forget about this meal,

199
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
even if you bought the entire hotel,

200
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,600
we absolutely would not charge you a single cent.

201
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,279
What's going on?

202
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,240
No idea.

203
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,920
Wait,

204
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,480
Manager Wang,

205
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,639
are you mistaken?

206
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,040
Have you mistaken him for someone else?

207
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,639
Shengzi,

208
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,920
what's the deal?

209
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,000
That won't be necessary.

210
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,839
I'm not a wasteful person.

211
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,480
Understood.

212
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,120
Everyone,

213
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,160
the expenses for your private room

214
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,519
have already been settled by Mr. Zhao.

215
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,439
Please, enjoy yourselves.

216
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,319
What's with this manager?

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,920
He's in cahoots with Zhao Fengsheng.

218
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,480
No.

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,839
Earlier, Zhao Fengsheng met a thug

220
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,959
named Xiao Jiu at the entrance.

221
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,720
Manager Wang probably doesn't want trouble.

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,199
Hoodlums in Bianshui love to bully business people.

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
No wonder Bianshui can't develop.

224
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,800
The kind of person I despise most

225
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,319
is exactly like you.

226
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,839
I wasn't picking a fight with you,

227
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,680
and you keep yammering on, huh?

228
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,079
If you're cranky because it's that time of the month,

229
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,160
go smash some rocks,

230
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,600
carry sacks,

231
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,399
and blow off some steam.

232
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,920
Don't take it out on me.

233
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
You!

234
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
What are you saying, you shameless jerk?

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,399
Oops,

236
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,279
slipped out.

237
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,560
Zhao Fengsheng!

238
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:27,920
Stop!

239
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,040
You stop right there!

240
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,720
You jerk!

241
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,519
Tian Yu!

242
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,480
Don't be angry.

243
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,200
Yaqing!

244
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Yaqing! Yaqing!

245
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,720
Let's go, let's go.

246
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,000
Jerk, you stop right there!

247
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,759
Tian Yu!

248
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,039
Tian Yu!

249
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,879
Who's the blind fool causing trouble?

250
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,559
Don't you have eyes?

251
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,279
*You're* the blind one!

252
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,679
Pick that up for me.

253
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,440
Little sister,

254
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,799
give big brother a kiss,

255
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,679
and I'll give your bag back.

256
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,440
Pervert!

257
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,360
Who's this little sister?

258
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,799
I hadn't heard Bianshui had

259
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,399
such a beauty.

260
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,519
Watch your mouth.

261
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,519
In front of Young Master Tang,

262
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,879
do you have the right to speak?

263
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
Young Master Tang?

264
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,679
You're Tang Huiyao?

265
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,320
You've heard of me.

266
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,399
Then this will be easy.

267
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,759
Today, you two sisters

268
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,799
will keep me company and have some fun.

269
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,799
I'm Qian Tianyu of the Qian Group.

270
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,759
Don't you dare touch us.

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,399
Flies are everywhere.

272
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
So annoying.

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,919
What do I keep you around for?

274
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,639
Yes.

275
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,679
Knows a thing or two

276
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,879
Enough.

277
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,600
You've had your fun.

278
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,919
Now it's my turn to have some fun.

279
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,759
Get out of my way!

280
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,279
You've got guts.

281
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,000
Daring to ambush me?

282
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,080
Where'd this little runt come from?

283
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,159
Not bad.

284
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,919
Where'd this damn cripple come from?

285
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,720
Get lost!

286
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,799
What did you say?

287
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,279
Zhao Fengsheng

288
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,440
Watch your mouth!

289
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,080
He's with the Tang Group.

290
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,399
How many lives do you have to spare?

291
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
What group?

292
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,399
Means nothing to me, Zhao Fengsheng.

293
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,799
The Tang Group.

294
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,840
The most powerful group

295
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,639
in all of Bian Shui.

296
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,360
Darn it.

297
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,519
Who dares offend Young Master Tang?

298
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,759
We're all done for!

299
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,639
The Tang Group...

300
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
You're Tang Hongtu's son?

301
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,080
A waste like you

302
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,240
dares to say my father's name?

303
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,879
Looking to die?

304
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,960
Your father...

305
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,759
People who always bring up their dad

306
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,240
are usually cowards.

307
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,879
Mu Jinfu!

308
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,360
Break his legs for me!

309
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,879
Hold her down for me!

310
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,240
Who dares come closer?

311
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,279
I'll crack his skull open!

312
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,200
Go, go!

313
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,320
A tough one.

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,679
With skills like that, you're someone's dog?

315
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,559
What a waste.

316
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,600
You arrogant brat.

317
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,240
You're asking for it.

318
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
Stay back, don't get in the way.

319
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,279
Shengzi.
