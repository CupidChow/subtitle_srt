1
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Oh my god

2
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,359
Tianyu

3
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,159
Anything you want to say to Brother Zhao?

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,000
Go on, hurry.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,039
No matter what you do,

6
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,280
your father supports you.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,799
Tianyu

8
00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,880
Are you okay?

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,359
I'm fine.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,400
Shengzi

11
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,120
Where did you get so many people?

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,000
How many more secrets are you hiding from me?

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,840
Erni, Erni.

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,359
There are so many people here.

15
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:18,959
Give me some face.

16
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,599
Say it.

17
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,280
Give me some face.

18
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,079
Yunting members, listen up!

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,799
Greet Sister-in-law.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,920
Hello, Sister-in-law!

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,920
Dad.

22
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,159
We still have the gold mine matter to deal with.

23
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's go for now.

24
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:40,920
Okay.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,640
Let's go.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,799
Uh...

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,760
Thanks for your hard work, brothers.

28
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,079
I need to talk to Shengzi about something.

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,159
Sister-in-law.

30
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,040
Please.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,480
Xiaojiu.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,159
Who is your boss?

33
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,879
Stop her!

34
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Boss.

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,200
My ear...

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,280
seems to have been deafened by the gunshot.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,599
I can't quite hear what you're saying.

38
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,240
Xiaojiu, Li Xiangping, listen up!

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,199
Boss, boss!

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Go to the casino immediately and rescue all the neighbors.

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Some of them are elderly.

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Be careful on the way.

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,280
Yes, sir!

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,199
Don't worry, boss.

45
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,639
If any neighbor loses a single hair,

46
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,520
hold me accountable.

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,280
Brothers, follow me!

48
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,000
What are you two doing here?

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,319
Shengzi.

50
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,479
When did you make so many new brothers?

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
And they're calling you 'boss'?

52
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
So where do Painted Face and I rank?

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
What's wrong, Gangzi?

54
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,759
What do you mean, 'what's wrong'?

55
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,960
He's jealous.

56
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,240
Well, of course!

57
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,759
We're the brothers who grew up together.

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,800
Why are you recruiting so many brats?

59
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,759
Look at him.

60
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,439
Right?

61
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,919
Painted Face, come here.

62
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,800
Let me tell you.

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,240
This...

64
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,560
How about it?

65
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,080
Did this sister-in-law of yours

66
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,360
make you look good?

67
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,159
Painted Face.

68
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,879
Gangzi.

69
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,159
You...

70
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,919
Listen to me, all of you.

71
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,719
Zhao Fengsheng.

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
You don't know how lucky you are.

73
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,840
It's been years since we just chatted like this.

74
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,319
Yeah.

75
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,479
We, the Four Pests of the Old Street,

76
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,199
swore our oath right here back then.

77
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,719
We promised

78
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
to never abandon each other,

79
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
to live and die together.

80
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,719
And we've kept that promise.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Brother.

82
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,080
Since we were kids, you got hurt fighting for me.

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
This time, you helped me save Xiaoqian.

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,439
I owe you too much.

85
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,520
Don't be like Gangzi.

86
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
All sentimental.

87
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,560
Who are you calling sentimental?

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,879
Shengzi.

89
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,240
Don't think just because you trained outside for a few years,

90
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
I can still take you down with one leg.

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,159
Believe it or not.

92
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,639
Come on, come on.

93
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,080
Let's spar.

94
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,599
Hurry up.

95
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,479
Come on.

96
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,000
Stop fighting!

97
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,919
Stop it!

98
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,520
Come on, come on.

99
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,960
How childish!

100
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,400
Your leg, your leg!

101
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Stop fighting, stop!

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,199
Alright, alright.

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,840
Okay, okay.

104
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,840
I give up.

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,360
You win, Brother Gangzi.

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,439
You'll always be the top dog of Old Street.

107
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,120
Since I'm the big brother,

108
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,000
let me ask you.

109
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,039
What are you going to do about you and Erni?

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
Erni...

111
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,120
Erni.

112
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,399
I do have feelings for you...

113
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,480
It's just that...

114
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,319
But I still have things to settle.

115
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,800
Can you... give me a little more time?

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Some people...

117
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,480
always have endless things to do.

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Anyway, I understand now.

119
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,839
A beauty like me

120
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,319
shouldn't just let romance pass me by

121
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,920
and give someone a free pass, right?

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,959
Wait.

123
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,680
What do you mean?

124
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,279
It means

125
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,639
we have to try being boyfriend and girlfriend first.

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,560
During this time,

127
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,160
I'll be watching your performance.

128
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,079
Got it?

129
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,720
Don't you know what you're supposed to do?

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,720
Er... Erni.

131
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,319
We're too familiar with each other.

132
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,439
I really don't know how to make a move.

133
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,040
You really kissed me!

134
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,199
That was my first kiss!

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,319
You really did it!

136
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,720
You stabbed me from behind.

137
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,759
Then you have to take responsibility for me.

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,560
Responsibility.

139
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Shengzi

140
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,639
They're here.

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,040
Here.

142
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,600
Perfect timing.

143
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,079
Big Buddha.

144
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,199
What are you up to now?

145
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,079
No.

146
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,279
I'm not up to anything.

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,120
The neighbors want to apologize to Shengzi.

148
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,959
All these years,

149
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,800
we've misunderstood Shengzi.

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Yes, yes, yes.

151
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,439
Shengzi,

152
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,040
it was all my fault before.

153
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,000
I apologize to you.

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,800
Thank you for saving our Xiaoxiao.

155
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,839
Auntie.

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,519
It was nothing. Don't mention it.

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,920
And me, your auntie,

158
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,360
I believed Chen Xiaobei's lies before.

159
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
I apologize to you.

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,040
You can use our phone anytime from now on.

161
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Shengzi,

162
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,639
I'm sorry, kid.

163
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm sorry to all the neighbors.

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,120
Please give me a chance to make things right.

165
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Uncle She.

166
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,879
Uncle She,

167
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,279
when I was little, you told me something.

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
To know one's faults and be able to change

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,560
is the greatest virtue.

170
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,319
Whether the neighbors can forgive you

171
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,680
depends on your own heart.

172
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,519
Shengzi makes a good point.

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,240
Old She,

174
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,360
you've lived for decades.

175
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,079
You know the principles.

176
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,519
You decide for yourself.

177
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,199
Please judge me by my actions.

178
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,560
Thank you, Shengzi.

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,519
Shengzi!

180
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,399
Come down!

181
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
What are you shy for?

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,279
The neighbors prepared a Community Feast.

183
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,879
Come down!

184
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,519
Auntie Liu won't hit you.

185
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,639
Exactly!

186
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
And your marriage to Erni.

187
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,560
If you don't come down and talk to your

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,920
mother-in-law properly soon...

189
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,279
How did she become my mother-in-law again?

190
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,519
Although Shengzi is very capable,

191
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,160
he's full of bad habits.

192
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
If he wants to marry my daughter, Liu Guiying's girl,

193
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,319
I'll have to vet him thoroughly.

194
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,720
You're still vetting such a good son-in-law?

195
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,000
My niece

196
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,199
has been waiting to meet Shengzi for ages.

197
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,560
Let them get to know each other first.

198
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,279
Go on, get out of here.

199
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,079
Your niece lives miles away.

200
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,319
Why are you butting in?

201
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,160
You say one thing but mean another.

202
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,279
Neighbors!

203
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,439
Stop talking here.

204
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,519
Let's go to my place, drink and chat.

205
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,279
Alright?

206
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,959
Alright, alright, alright.

207
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,399
Shengzi, come down!

208
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,040
Shengzi!

209
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,879
Let's eat! Let's eat!

210
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,079
Let's go, let's go.

211
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,240
Go.

212
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,079
Eat.

213
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,959
Shengzi, let's go, go, go.

214
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
Let's go, let's go.

215
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,480
Where's Shengzi?

216
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,000
He said he drank too much

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,120
and went back to sleep first.

218
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,040
Didn't you say you could hold your liquor, kid?

219
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Shengzi!

220
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,959
Ran off to avoid drinking, huh?

221
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,720
Shengzi!

222
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,399
Come out here!

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,920
Shengzi's not here.

224
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,360
Brother.

225
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,480
He said he had something to take care of.

226
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,720
Old Street.

227
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,039
Boss.

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,960
This is all the information on Lei Sinian.

229
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,559
Boss,

230
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,200
why not stay in Old Street a while longer before leaving?

231
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,960
Old Street is too beautiful.

232
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm afraid if I stay,

233
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,840
I won't want to leave.

234
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,279
Erni.

235
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,639
You know he can't sit still.

236
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,559
As long as his heart is with Old Street and you,

237
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,200
he'll come back as soon as he's done.

238
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,639
Erni!

239
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,840
Where are you going to chase him at this hour?

240
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,679
I can't bear to leave the people of Old Street,

241
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,879
the affairs of Old Street,

242
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,960
and the brothers of Old Street.

243
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,879
I can't bear to leave you either.

244
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,840
Zhao Fengsheng!

245
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,720
Zhao Fengsheng!

246
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,639
I'll wait for you another five years!

247
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,360
Ten years!

248
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,679
I can do it!

249
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,639
You must come back alive!

250
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
As long as you're alive,

251
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,879
I'll come back to marry you.
