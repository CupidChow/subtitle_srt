1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,840
But you only need to remember one thing.

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,799
Having our Tang Group develop Old Street

3
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,240
is nothing but beneficial for you.

4
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,000
And what if I disagree?

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,000
I hear

6
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,239
Brother Shengzi

7
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,359
has some connection with Young Master Li of Jialong.

8
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,640
You know Li Xiangping?

9
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,319
I wouldn't say we're close.

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,879
But over the years,

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,480
I've had quite a few dealings

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,079
with Old Master Li.

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
Young Master Li just returned.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,959
I was just thinking of finding a chance to meet him.

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,359
Second Master Tang,

16
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,359
you're even connected to forces in Jialong?

17
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,519
Could it be that behind you

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,519
is some immensely powerful figure?

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,400
Brother Shengzi knows too much.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,519
That probably isn't good for you.

21
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,719
Just idle curiosity, idle curiosity.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,200
Please don't take offense, Second Master.

23
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,040
The reason I called you here today

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,319
is to let you know

25
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,359
Old Street

26
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,000
is something I am determined to get.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
If you

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,359
merely want wealth and status,

29
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,359
or to be esteemed in public,

30
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,079
I can satisfy you.

31
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,319
But if you insist on obstructing me,

32
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,080
even if you have the Li family's backing,

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,240
I can personally send you out of Bian Shui.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,319
Brother Shengzi,

35
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,919
think it over carefully.

36
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,680
They all say you, Zhao Fengsheng,

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
are decisive and calm.

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,080
You must think this through very carefully.

39
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,400
This chocolate wrapper...

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,759
Dad...

41
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,560
Dad...

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Your dad just came up to break up your fight.

43
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,159
No idea who ambushed him.

44
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,400
I shouldn't have gotten into a fight.

45
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,840
You can scold me all you want.

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,439
Dad...

47
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,879
Don't stay silent, Dad.

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
Let's take Uncle back first.

49
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,120
Give me a hand.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,039
Come on, come on.

51
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,280
My dad doesn't eat chocolate.

52
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,360
Could it have been left by the killer?

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,280
They say

54
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,840
if you follow Second Master,

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,199
you'll eat well

56
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,199
and drink well.

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,560
I'm certainly willing.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,879
Good.

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,479
Brother Shengzi knows which way the wind blows.

60
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,400
I like young men like you.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
What business do you want to manage?

62
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,759
Take your pick from here.

63
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,240
Second Master really knows how to enjoy life.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,120
This stuff is delicious.

65
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,439
Tang Hongtu is likely connected to my dad's death.

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
I can't turn against him yet.

67
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,120
What?

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,759
Nothing catches your eye?

69
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,079
If it's all just these kinds of businesses,

70
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,279
Li Xiangping could give them to me.

71
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,959
I really can't muster any interest.

72
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,240
Then what do you want?

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,879
I want...

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,839
your life.

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
This casino.

76
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,439
Second Master!

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,959
This casino belongs to the young master!

78
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,839
Shut up.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
Why the casino?

80
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,160
Because it makes money the fastest and the most.

81
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,680
You have vision.

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
You have ambition.

83
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,920
Truly worthy of being called Madman Zhao.

84
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,279
Very good.

85
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,720
From now on,

86
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,959
Brother Shengzi is the general manager of this casino.

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
Yes.

88
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,319
Ambitious enough.

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,560
That's the true spirit of youth.

90
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,199
I, Tang Hongtu, have room for your greed here.

91
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,319
Second Master,

92
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,600
truly a grand vision.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,319
I'll go attend to business now.

94
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,759
Second Master,

95
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,680
Zhao Fengsheng only has a few thugs from Old Street.

96
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you so concerned about saving his face?

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,360
And you even gave him the casino?

98
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,839
Saving his face?

99
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,519
When have I, Tang Hongtu,

100
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,160
ever worried about a petty thug?

101
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,439
Then... what are you doing?

102
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,720
This Zhao Fengsheng is, after all, Li Xiangping's man.

103
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,399
Killing him outright would be hard to explain to the Li family.

104
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,439
Keeping him close

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
firstly,

106
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,000
prevents him from sabotaging the Old Street demolition.

107
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,319
Secondly,

108
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,000
it makes it easier to find a legitimate pretext

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,480
to eliminate Zhao Fengsheng.

110
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Second Master is wise.

111
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,439
I'll go keep a close eye on him then.

112
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Er Ni!

113
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Where's Zhao Fengsheng?

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Out fooling around somewhere again?

115
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,480
You've got Shengzi all wrong.

116
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,519
He's got something to handle recently.

117
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,360
He's busy.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,920
What kind of thing can't even be told to me?

119
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,000
Darn it, Jin Jungang!

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
Covering for Zhao Fengsheng!

121
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,519
Are you still my brother or not?

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,279
I'm really not covering for him.

123
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,639
It's just that last time,

124
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
Chen Xiaobei introduced Shengzi to Tang Hongtu.

125
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
He's working at the Tang Group now.

126
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
You dare to believe Chen Xiaobei's words?

127
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,199
I'm going to find him.

128
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,480
Shengzi was afraid you'd act impulsively.

129
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,160
That's why he told me not to tell you.

130
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,480
Whatever you do, don't sell me out.

131
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,279
Where are you going?

132
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,560
I have important business to attend to.

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,360
Zhao Fengsheng

134
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,240
Not bad.

135
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,279
Shengzi.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,680
Er Ni.

137
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,319
I'm at work.

138
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,160
What are you doing here?

139
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,600
You're my man, but you're not learning good things.

140
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,399
What if you get addicted to gambling and sell me off?

141
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,399
Quit your job right now.

142
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,360
What are you thinking about all day?

143
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,959
I suspect my dad's death...

144
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,600
...is related to the Tang Group.

145
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,439
I agreed to come work for Tang Hongtu...

146
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,959
...to investigate this secretly.

147
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,879
Uncle Zhao's death?

148
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,560
Right.

149
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,839
I wouldn't joke about something...

150
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,680
...like this with you.

151
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,360
Go home, hurry.

152
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,079
No.

153
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,920
If you're investigating something...

154
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,639
...you need someone to cover for you.

155
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,920
Besides...

156
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,560
You know my gambling skills.

157
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
As long as I'm here...

158
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,759
...they'll be too busy to watch you.

159
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,079
It's too dangerous for you. Get out of here.

160
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,279
I promise I'll just play cards.

161
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,439
I won't cause any trouble for you.

162
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,360
And also...

163
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
...not everyone here is from the Tang Group.

164
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,399
With so many people around, I won't get hurt.

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,759
Don't worry.

166
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,519
Er Ni.

167
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,360
Er Ni!

168
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,680
Xiaoman.

169
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,319
I've been looking for you for so long.

170
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,279
I thought you'd left Bian Shui.

171
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Why are you back working for Ghost Face Hall?

172
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,199
I thought Old Street was my home.

173
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,920
I never thought in the end...

174
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,800
...this den of wolves would take me in.

175
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,120
The neighbors have come to their senses now.

176
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,159
Come back with me.

177
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,759
I don't want to go back.

178
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,279
Brother Gangzi.

179
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,399
Go ahead.

180
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,559
What do you need?

181
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,200
Old Street is going to be demolished, right?

182
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,720
I want to get a loan to buy up more land.

183
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,240
I didn't expect to run into you here.

184
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,440
Brother Gangzi...

185
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,360
...the news about Old Street's demolition...

186
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,639
...is known all over Bian Shui.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
People coming to me for loans to buy land...

188
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
...are lining up for blocks.

189
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,639
If you're just playing around...

190
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,559
...you might not even get a spot.

191
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,240
Don't you know me?

192
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,759
When have I ever done things small?

193
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,440
Since I'm getting a loan...

194
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
...I'm going big.

195
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,919
How much do you want?

196
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,720
One million.

197
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,679
That's...

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,159
...not a small amount of money.

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,159
Xiaoman.

200
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,799
Don't worry.

201
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,559
Once the demolition compensation comes...

202
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,840
...I'll double my money.

203
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,240
When that happens...

204
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,240
...I'll take you to live a good life.

205
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,360
Brother Gangzi is still good to me.

206
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,919
I'll let you know once my application is ready.

207
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,639
It's good to have an insider handling things.

208
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,519
Alright.

209
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,440
Xiaoman...

210
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,159
...you really won't come back with me?

211
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,080
I'm fine here.

212
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,120
You should go back.

213
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,320
Wait for my good news.

214
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,039
Okay.

215
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,679
Brother Gangzi...

216
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,039
...I'm sorry.

217
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't go back.

218
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,840
All of this...

219
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
...is Wuya's fault.

220
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,600
Hurry up.

221
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,600
Here are your cards.

222
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,399
Isn't this Master Mu?

223
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,759
Little girl.

224
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,080
Didn't you get enough of a beating last time?

225
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,840
You dare come to my turf again?

226
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,919
You run a casino.

227
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,000
You open your doors to welcome money.

228
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,519
I don't think Master Mu...

229
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,519
...would hit a pretty girl...

230
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,159
...right here, would he?

231
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,120
If you want to gamble, find a table.

232
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,879
But I didn't bring any money today.

233
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,679
I'd like to borrow some from Master Mu.

234
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,879
You dare come to gamble with no money?

235
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,519
How much do you want?

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
What's your interest rate here?

237
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,799
Thirty percent a month.

238
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,720
Fine.

239
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,559
Go get the money for me, sister.

240
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,480
Come with me.
