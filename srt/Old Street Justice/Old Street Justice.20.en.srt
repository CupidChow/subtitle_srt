1
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,039
Chairman

2
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,960
Something's wrong!

3
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:43,759
Mu Jinfu brought men

4
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,960
and took control of all our people.

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,679
What?

6
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,439
Tang Hongtu, he...

7
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,200
Old Qian.

8
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,679
It's rare for you to visit.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Why is no one here to welcome me?

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,079
Second Master.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,439
What brings you here at this time?

12
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,200
I heard

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,320
you're preparing contracts,

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,240
trying to snatch the Old Street demolition business from me.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,759
How do you know?

16
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,520
I...

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,200
Second Master,

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,599
you really are cunning.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,439
The spy you planted here

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,159
was actually an old-timer.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,120
I'll ask you one last time.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Are you trying to take Old Street from me?

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,040
Second Master, you know well

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,200
my Qian Family is subordinate to the Li Family.

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,519
What business we do in Bian Shui,

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,959
and how big we do it,

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,799
is all decided by Young Master Li.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,599
So you're saying

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,400
that competing with me for Old Street

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,760
is also Li Xiangping's order?

31
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,400
Old Street is located at the tri-border

32
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,200
of Jialong,

33
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,799
Lika, and Badi.

34
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:45,879
In the future,

35
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,439
it will surely be a key land and water transport hub.

36
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,760
Young Master Li heard

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,000
you invested heavily in Old Street,

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,920
so

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,680
he wanted us to come and follow you,

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,439
to get a share of the profits.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,959
A share?

42
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,599
I think you want to take food from my plate.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,280
No,

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,599
Second Master, don't be upset.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,759
Young Master Li wants to expand his influence in Bian Shui.

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,439
Our Qian Group

47
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,400
has to do something, right?

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,560
You don't need to keep using the Li Family to pressure me.

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,639
All the business channels in Bian Shui

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,400
are in my hands.

51
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,000
If I want to bankrupt your Qian Family,

52
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,560
I can do it anytime.

53
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,120
Second Master, you certainly have that power.

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
However,

55
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,120
Young Master Li won't just sit back and watch.

56
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,599
His Li Family can't enter Bian Shui.

57
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,120
Believe it or not,

58
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,599
it won't be long

59
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,280
before I, Tang Hongtu, stand equal to the Li Family.

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,879
The Li Family has operated for over a century.

61
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,120
I can't imagine what cards

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
you, Second Master, have to oppose the Li Family.

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,240
Don't try to fish for information.

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,919
I'll just tell you this:

65
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,159
If you merge into my Tang Family now,

66
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,800
I'll buy your Qian Group

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,719
for double the price.

68
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,520
If you choose to oppose me,

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
then prepare to

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
disappear completely from Bian Shui.

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,919
Second Master,

72
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,039
think it over carefully.

73
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,439
If you keep eyeing Old Street,

74
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,960
then get ready to say goodbye

75
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,240
to Bian Shui.

76
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,199
That old turtle!

77
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,960
That old bastard!

78
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,639
Chairman!

79
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,319
Old Street geological survey...

80
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:30,079
Ore transport channels...

81
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,399
Gold and silver sales...

82
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,120
No documents related to my father.

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,560
Mom's gold bracelet,

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,040
and this key...

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
My father had a similar one.

86
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,879
Old Street geological survey.

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,319
Mom's bracelet.

88
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,759
My father was killed.

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,600
Gold mine.

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,839
Demolition.

91
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,240
Could it be that Old Street...

92
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,759
has... has a gold mine?

93
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,439
Gangzi!

94
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,639
Gangzi!

95
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,079
Er Ni!

96
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,279
Tang Huiyao!

97
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,920
What the hell do you want?

98
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,759
Jin Jungang bullied someone under me.

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,079
My brothers are also itching for a fight.

100
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,839
We might have gone a bit too far.

101
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,399
Who did Gangzi bully?

102
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,800
Sister Er Ni...

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,959
It's me.

104
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,879
Zhou Xiaoman.

105
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,879
Since when did you become Tang Huiyao's person?

106
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,800
I...

107
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,600
After the neighbors drove me out of Old Street,

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,720
I almost starved to death.

109
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,519
It was Young Master Tang who was kind,

110
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,079
giving me a loan-sharking job.

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,160
I never expected

112
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,040
that Gangzi last night

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,519
cornered me in the office,

114
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,319
saying

115
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,879
I'm a prostitute,

116
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,160
and then assaulted me.

117
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
That's bullshit!

118
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,240
Gangzi might be a lecher,

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,120
but he never bullies people.

120
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,399
Setting up a honey trap, huh?

121
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,439
How much money do you want? I'll give it to you.

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,399
Er Ni,

123
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
do I, Tang Huiyao, look like I need money?

124
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,600
Jin Jungang bullied someone under me.

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,279
Of course I'll take an eye for an eye.

126
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,920
What are you doing?

127
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,600
Aren't you his life-and-death friend?

128
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,040
Sleep with me,

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,879
and this matter

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,680
will be settled.

131
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,680
Painted Face!

132
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,319
Where's Gangzi?

133
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
Inside.

134
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,120
Witch!

135
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
You even brought people?

136
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,000
Aren't you afraid Jin Jungang will die here?

137
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,759
Anyone who dares touch my brother

138
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,839
will die!

139
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,199
Kill him!

140
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,920
Get him! Get him!

141
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,920
A woman

142
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,319
and a cripple.

143
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,240
What can you possibly do to me?

144
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
Er Ni, my dear

145
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,000
Looks like we can't get away today.

146
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,560
Let's fight them to the end.

147
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,000
Brother.

148
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,240
What are you doing here?

149
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,720
They've tied up Gangzi.

150
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,879
Gangzi's leg is crippled.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Tang Huiyao.

152
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,120
You really have a death wish.

153
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,839
Who the hell do you think you are?

154
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,360
If it weren't for Li Xiangping backing you,

155
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,079
you wouldn't even be fit to be a dog in my Tang family.

156
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,840
Wuya.

157
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,279
Where's the thing I gave you?

158
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,799
Kill him.

159
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,519
Zhao Fengsheng.

160
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,960
A gun.

161
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,720
You dare to use this thing?

162
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,679
Anyone who doesn't want to die,

163
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,120
kneel down now!

164
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,399
Kneel!

165
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,559
Gangzi.

166
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,720
Gangzi.

167
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,440
Gangzi!

168
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Xiaoman.

169
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,519
Xiaoman.

170
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,039
Brother Gangzi.

171
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,759
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,799
I just wanted to kill

173
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,360
that jerk Wuya.

174
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,799
Xiaoman.

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,799
Xiaoman.

176
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,600
Nobody move!

177
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,840
Nobody move!

178
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,919
Get Gangzi out of here, fast!

179
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,879
Xiaoman.

180
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,279
Go.

181
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,720
Go!

182
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,279
Nobody move!

183
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,120
Make them back off.

184
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,960
Move aside.

185
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,679
Move aside!

186
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,039
Don't move.

187
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,600
Nobody move!

188
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,200
Zhao Fengsheng.

189
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,320
What are you doing?

190
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,279
Dad, save me!

191
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,480
Save me!

192
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,759
Ask your useless son

193
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,759
what he's done.

194
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,840
You let him go,

195
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,279
and I'll make things right for you.

196
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,559
Leave the car.

197
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,320
You...

198
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,080
Get lost.

199
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,120
Zhao Fengsheng, don't be ungrateful.

200
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,080
If you keep talking nonsense,

201
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,000
Let them go.

202
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,159
Let's go.

203
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,879
Behave yourself.

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,240
Gangzi.

205
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,200
Gangzi.

206
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,879
Gangzi!

207
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,559
How dare you!

208
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,519
He got Xiaoman killed!

209
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,799
It was Wuya!

210
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,279
It was Wuya, not me!

211
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,679
It was me, it was me!

212
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,000
Release Young Master Tang.

213
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,159
Xiaoman.

214
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,320
Xiaoman's life was so pitiful.

215
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,240
Did I say you could speak?

216
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,919
A woman like you staying in Old Street

217
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,039
is a disgrace to us people of Coal Mine Old Street.

218
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,720
Hurry up.

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,120
Brother Gangzi.

220
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,879
Get out of here, quick.

221
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,799
You darn witch, have I been too nice to you?

222
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,200
I will avenge her.

223
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,039
Gangzi.
