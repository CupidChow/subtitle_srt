1
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,679
Sit down.

2
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,200
Have a few drinks with me.

3
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,759
After drinking, we'll be friends.

4
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,960
I, Tang Huiyao, naturally won't make things difficult for a friend.

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,079
Get the hell away from me.

6
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,039
This lady needs a friend like you?

7
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,159
I'm giving you face.

8
00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,880
A woman I've taken a liking to...

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,560
Let go of me!

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,679
...never gets away.

11
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,159
Clear the room.

12
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,240
Get out! Go!

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,799
Let go!

14
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,840
Let go of me!

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,280
You dare to harass this lady?

16
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,159
Take one more step...

17
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,200
...and I'll crack your skull open.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,000
A great beauty...

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,680
...talking about fighting is so boring.

20
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,040
What are you doing?

21
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:20,920
I need to report...

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,159
...the daily accounts to Second Master Tang.

23
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,879
Move aside.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,680
Second Master Tang isn't here.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Report tomorrow.

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,239
Bullshit.

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,280
Second Master Tang said...

28
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,640
...he must know the daily accounts.

29
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,359
At least let me...

30
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,879
...put this file on his desk.

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,879
Not letting me in, huh?

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,959
Fine.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,560
When Second Master Tang asks about it...

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,519
...I'll say you two stopped me.

35
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,280
Okay?

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,640
Well...

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,439
Go on, get moving.

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,599
Young Master Tang is throwing a fit inside.

39
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,359
Hurry up and go.

40
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,439
Go, go, go! Hurry!

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,760
Get out of my way!

42
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,400
Move!

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,560
Er Ni.

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,799
Zhao Fengsheng is just a dog begging for scraps.

45
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,560
Follow me...

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,439
...and you can have anything in Bian Shui.

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,400
Hold her down for me.

48
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,799
Let me go!

49
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:07,959
Let me go!

50
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,759
Even the wildest horse...

51
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,960
...I will ride.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
Let go!

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
Let me go!

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,039
Hold her down.

55
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,439
Let go!

56
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Hold her down.

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,960
Coward.

58
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
If you have the guts, let me go!

59
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,919
Tang Huiyao, you're looking for death!

60
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,680
Playing the hero to save the beauty?

61
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,120
Zhao Fengsheng.

62
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,719
Get this straight.

63
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,199
She, in front of everyone...

64
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,960
...accused my Tang Family casino of cheating.

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,400
You, as the casino manager...

66
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,719
...tell me how we resolve this.

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
Shengzi.

68
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,759
They set me up.

69
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,680
I'm asking you.

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,479
How do we resolve it?

71
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,560
Er Ni came with me.

72
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,199
What does Young Master Tang want to do?

73
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,599
I, Zhao Fengsheng, will take it.

74
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,639
You'll take responsibility?

75
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,919
Good.

76
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,840
I'll give you this chance.

77
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,599
This first bottle...

78
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,120
...is for her saying my Tang Family casino cheats.

79
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,639
The second bottle...

80
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,199
...is compensation for her slapping me.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,159
This third one...

82
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,520
...is for your negligence as casino manager.

83
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,240
So you're saying...

84
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,680
...if I finish these three bottles today...

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,280
...today's matter is settled?

86
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,520
Considering my father...

87
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,159
...personally recruited you...

88
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
...I'll give you this face.

89
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,639
Shengzi.

90
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,680
This is all strong liquor.

91
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,599
Three bottles will kill you.

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,199
Don't worry.

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,080
You know how much I can drink.

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,919
The Tang Family's liquor is good stuff.

95
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,319
Might as well drink it.

96
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,400
Manager Zhao.

97
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
If you can't drink this...

98
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,400
...my boys here can help pour it down your throat.

99
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
No need for your concern, Young Master Tang.

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,959
This is my spiritual fuel.

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,480
It only gives me more energy.

102
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,639
Shengzi.

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,439
This guy can really drink.

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Young Master Tang.

105
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,720
This is 42-proof baijiu.

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,160
The kick will hit him soon.

107
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,279
Shengzi.

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,199
I'll drink it for you.

109
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Little sister Er Ni.

110
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,519
You're drunk.

111
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,600
Aren't you afraid I'll lay hands on you?

112
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,839
I'm fine.

113
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,639
Keep drinking.

114
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,240
Shengzi.

115
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's see how long you can keep up the act.

116
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,120
Drink it!

117
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,560
Shengzi.

118
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,120
This liquor is really good.

119
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,240
Shengzi.

120
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,600
Shengzi.

121
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,680
Shengzi.

122
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,959
Get the hell out of my way

123
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:20,720
What?

124
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Let go of me!

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,360
Get up.

126
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,800
You wanna drink, huh?

127
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,240
Let me go!

128
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,120
Drink!

129
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,519
You like to pretend, don't you?

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
Screwing things up for me, huh?

131
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,480
Let go!

132
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,879
Drink.

133
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,160
Keep pretending!

134
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,319
Drink.

135
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,000
Drink.

136
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,879
Drink it!

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,959
Drink.

138
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,360
Drink!

139
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,399
Huiyao.

140
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,240
Stop!

141
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,279
Dad.

142
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:50,639
You...

143
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
What are you doing here?

144
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,199
Shengzi.

145
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,600
Shengzi.

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,920
Brother Shengzi.

147
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,360
Are you okay?

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,759
Are you alright?

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
Second Master Tang.

150
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,000
I failed to manage the place properly.

151
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,399
It's my fault.

152
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,639
I'll drink.

153
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,759
I know what happened.

154
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,360
Brother Shengzi has already drunk two bottles.

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,160
Let's end this matter here.

156
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,920
Dad...

157
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,720
Shut up.

158
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,199
Thank you, Second Master.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I was wrong.

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,560
From now on...

161
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,600
It won't happen again.

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
Old Mu! Old Mu!

163
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,040
Old Mu, hurry!

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,199
Zhao Fengsheng.

165
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,600
Don't vomit on Second Master.

166
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,000
Let go.

167
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,639
A perfectly good place...

168
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,279
Look what you've turned it into.

169
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,240
Let go.

170
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,319
Get him out of here, now!

171
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,279
Dad...

172
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,079
Are my words meaningless?

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,439
Shengzi.

174
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,199
Let's go.

175
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,680
Dad.

176
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,720
A hoodlum like Zhao Fengsheng...

177
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
Is worth you protecting him like this?

178
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm protecting him?

179
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,399
Zhao Fengsheng has deep ties to Li Xiangping.

180
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,720
He can't die in our casino.

181
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,600
And the Old Street matter isn't settled yet.

182
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,759
Now is not the time to go to war with the Li Family.

183
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,000
You're so interested in a shabby old street?

184
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
We have plenty of other business we can do.

185
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,279
This Old Street...

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,399
is the most profitable business.

187
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Old Street can make money?

188
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,759
Look.

189
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
What is this?

190
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,160
A gold bracelet of such fine quality.

191
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,040
Where did you get it?

192
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,639
Stole it from Zhao Fengsheng's house.

193
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,560
Zhao...

194
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,199
Zhao Fengsheng's house?

195
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,439
Where would a hoodlum like him get that kind of money?

196
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,519
Zhao Fengsheng...

197
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,319
doesn't know this bracelet is with me.

198
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,199
He also doesn't know...

199
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
that beneath Old Street lies a top-tier gold mine.

200
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,639
A top-tier gold mine?

201
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,199
How big is it?

202
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,399
Bracelets like this, produced by the ton.

203
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,399
By the ton.

204
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,720
That's a business worth billions.

205
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,519
Dad...

206
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,279
Are you telling the truth?

207
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,440
Once I extract the gold...

208
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,440
we can arm ourselves.

209
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,480
Then, forget about Bian Shui...

210
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,080
even that Li Xiangping...

211
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,919
won't be a match for us father and son.

212
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,919
Good.

213
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,399
It's okay.

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,120
Just get it all out.

215
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,600
Check if anyone's following us.

216
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,519
No one.

217
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,720
That's good.

218
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,120
I've already located Tang Hongtu's office.

219
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,720
Too many people during the day, hard to act.

220
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,879
I'll go again tonight.

221
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,679
You're going back?

222
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,480
Tang Huiyao won't let you off.

223
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,440
It's called hiding in plain sight.

224
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,960
They all think I'm drunk as a dog.

225
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,360
So this is the perfect time.

226
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,720
Let me go with you.

227
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,399
I almost got you killed just now.

228
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,720
I don't want the things I regret...

229
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
to increase by one more.

230
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
Listen to me.

231
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,080
Two people are too big a target.

232
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,279
Shengzi.

233
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,919
Listen to me.

234
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,399
Then you must be careful.

235
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,320
Don't worry.

236
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,639
I'll come back.
