1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,640
Jin Jungang

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,119
This should be enough, right?

3
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,399
Put the gun down.

4
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,560
Release Young Master Tang now.

5
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,159
Gangzi

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,079
You're not like them.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,319
Don't get blood on your hands.

8
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,519
Go.

9
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,239
I wanted to kill that jerk Wuya.

10
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,680
If you had killed him,

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,079
Brother and everyone else couldn't have left.

12
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,519
Start the engine.

13
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,400
Drive.

14
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,200
Zhao Fengsheng

15
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,599
I'll kill you!

16
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,319
How is Gangzi?

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
The doctor said he's not in mortal danger.

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,159
It's just that...

19
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,800
He might need crutches for a few years.

20
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,319
That jerk Tang Huiyao.

21
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,639
Shengzi, what are you looking for?

22
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,840
Uncle, Auntie.

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,360
Isn't this you as a kid?

24
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,680
This is...

25
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,560
A key.

26
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,840
Second Master.

27
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,039
It seems Zhao Fengsheng's actions at the casino

28
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,120
were really to find something.

29
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,319
What's the use of saying this now?

30
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
Go and quickly

31
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,919
check the ledgers and other important documents again.

32
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,159
See what's missing.

33
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,159
Yes.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
Huiyao.

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,159
Does it still hurt?

36
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,319
Does it hurt or not?

37
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,520
It doesn't hurt anymore, Dad.

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,759
Dad.

39
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,680
Zhao Fengsheng took the bracelet.

40
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,919
Could he already have...

41
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,159
discovered the secret of the gold mine?

42
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,840
So what if he has?

43
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,560
Huiyao.

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,759
When facing trouble, don't hesitate.

45
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,439
You just need to keep looking forward.

46
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,919
That's how your old man

47
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,360
climbed up, step by step.

48
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,639
Dad.

49
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,000
What should we do now?

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,519
Our Tang family is the strongest force in Bian Shui.

51
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,680
We must crush Old Street and Zhao Fengsheng directly.

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,319
Crush him.

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,399
How?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,839
How do we do it?

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,279
Smother them with money.

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
I'll give you thirty million.

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,439
Feed it to those people on Old Street.

58
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,959
We must get Old Street before Zhao Fengsheng tells them

59
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,439
the secret of the gold mine.

60
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,800
Really give that much money to those Old Street trash?

61
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,720
Give it to them.

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
Will they even know how to spend it?

63
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,079
Take out the counterfeit money we've made over the years.

64
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,519
Once Old Street is demolished,

65
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,120
what can they do even if they find out?

66
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,839
Good.

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,319
I'll get people on it right away.

68
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,639
So...

69
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,279
this is what Dad meant in his letter.

70
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,560
Shengzi.

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,839
Why is Tang Hongtu so fixated on Old Street?

72
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,279
It's time to reveal Old Street's secret.

73
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Weren't you going to tell us the secret?

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
Why bring us to the backyard?

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Tang Hongtu has always wanted to get Old Street.

76
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,439
If I'm not mistaken,

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,560
the secret is right here.

78
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,920
A gold mine worth a fortune.

79
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,319
Gold?

80
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,839
We grew up on Old Street.

81
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,279
The older generation dug coal and iron mines for years.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,079
We never heard of any gold mine.

83
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
This is the secret my dad always kept.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,439
And the reason something happened to him.

85
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,800
What exactly happened?

86
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,759
Brother.

87
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,839
This isn't just mud inside.

88
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,759
This is the spot.

89
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,319
There really is a hole.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,959
This looks like an old mine.

91
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,120
My dad's letter said

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
this was opened by my great-grandfather

93
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
over a hundred years ago.

94
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,079
Back then, due to rebel army interference,

95
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,160
there was no time to mine it.

96
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,040
Later,

97
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
more and more people came to Old Street,

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,079
and this mine shaft was never opened again.

99
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,800
So that's how it is.

100
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,079
It really is gold dust.

101
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,839
So beautiful.

102
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,360
It's so shiny.

103
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,079
This is what my dad

104
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,560
risked his life to leave for me.

105
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,600
Brother.

106
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,120
I don't understand.

107
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,360
Five years ago, when I fought with Wuya,

108
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,399
my dad tried to come protect me.

109
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,639
But he was assassinated on the way.

110
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,160
That's true.

111
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,639
Wuya's men were all on Old Street at that time.

112
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,279
And after my dad died,

113
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,879
Tang Hongtu suddenly appeared in Bian Shui.

114
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,559
In just a few years,

115
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,720
he became a billionaire.

116
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,279
You're saying...

117
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,639
Uncle Zhao's death is related to Tang Hongtu?

118
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,720
Tang Hongtu wants to demolish Old Street

119
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,879
for this gold mine.

120
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,159
Brother.

121
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
Then what should we do?

122
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,600
First, protect Old Street.

123
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,320
Then crush the Tang Group hard.

124
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,879
Make Tang Hongtu kowtow and apologize at my dad's grave.

125
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,159
Good.

126
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,440
We also need to avenge Dagang.

127
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,600
Deal with that Tang Huiyao.

128
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,720
There's another thing.

129
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,320
Chen Xiaobei and Uncle Snake used a fake contract

130
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,639
to trick the neighbors in the north.

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,840
They only paid a down payment

132
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,360
and demolished half of Old Street.

133
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Luckily, this mine shaft is in the south.

134
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,159
Should we tell Old Buddha and the others

135
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,360
about this gold mine?

136
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,679
It's not that I don't trust Old Buddha.

137
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,840
It's just that with many people, words spread.

138
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,879
Once news of the gold mine gets out,

139
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,799
I'm afraid the neighbors will panic.

140
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,159
Brother is right.

141
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,759
If this gold mine is exposed,

142
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,879
forces outside Bian Shui will get involved.

143
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,559
So we need to cooperate with the Qian Group

144
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,120
and then crush the Tang Group hard.
