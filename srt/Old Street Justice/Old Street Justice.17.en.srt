1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,799
Come with me.

2
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,000
Er Ni offered to help.

3
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,640
I can't be too proud to accept.

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,039
While we can.

5
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,840
Zhao Fengsheng.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,400
I've been gone for a few days,

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,239
and you've taken over my casino?

8
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,599
Should I praise you,

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,079
or should I beat you up?

10
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,680
I, Zhao, am not very capable,

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,519
but I've earned Second Master's trust.

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,319
If you're unhappy about it,

13
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,560
go complain to your father.

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,439
Do you know who you're talking to?

15
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,159
Just a dog,

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,799
daring to block its master?

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,200
Young Master Tang.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
In this world, you have to follow the rules.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,159
If we're talking about dogs and masters,

20
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,079
it's not your place to say so.

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,879
Second Master said

22
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,840
casino matters are reported directly to him.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,040
So there's no need for you to intervene.

24
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,359
You're lecturing me about rules?

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,079
Fine.

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,000
Then, as the General Manager of the Tang Group,

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I'd like to see

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
what skills you have to hold my casino.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you mean?

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
Play a game with me.

31
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,240
If you win,

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,599
the casino is yours to manage for now.

33
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,439
If you lose,

34
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,400
pack your things and get out immediately.

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,400
Hold on, hold on.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,960
Stop.

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,479
Young Master Tang is setting up a game.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,439
Move aside, move aside.

39
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,560
Get back, get back.

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Hurry up, hurry up.

41
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,759
Young Master.

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,240
I'm just here to run the casino and make money.

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,400
Using gambling skills to beat you

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
isn't necessary.

45
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,319
How about I call Second Master

46
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,560
and ask him what he thinks?

47
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,759
Why go that far?

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,719
Since you don't dare gamble with me,

49
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,319
then kneel right here.

50
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,840
Kowtow to me twice.

51
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,080
Call me "Master" a couple of times.

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Call him Master.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
Call him Master! Call him Master!

54
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,159
Shengzi already said he won't play.

55
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,280
Why are you pestering him?

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,159
If Young Master Tang's itching to gamble,

57
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,759
I'll play with you.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
Miss Er Ni.

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,439
I didn't expect to see you here.

60
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,919
Zhao Fengsheng, you really are a coward.

61
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,080
For something like this,

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,280
you need a woman to stand up for you?

63
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,639
If you want to gamble, then gamble.

64
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,560
Too much talk makes you sound like a girl.

65
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,000
Trust me.

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,639
Someone like Young Master Tang,

67
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,840
who doesn't even dare sit at a woman's table,

68
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,360
has only this much skill.

69
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,960
And he has the nerve to call others cowards?

70
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,520
Interesting.

71
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,159
Compared to Qian Tianyu,

72
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,759
you suit my taste better.

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,840
A woman's card table or a woman's bed,

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,919
there's none I, Tang Huiyao, wouldn't dare get on.

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Minimum bet is five thousand.

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,759
No maximum limit.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,879
Dare to play?

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,919
Let's play then.

79
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,520
Deal the cards.

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,839
Twenty thousand.

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,000
Twenty thousand right off the bat?

82
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,000
Miss Er Ni is playing big.

83
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,519
None of your business.

84
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,639
Are you calling or not? Speak up.

85
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,800
Trying to bluff me from the start?

86
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,959
It's just twenty thousand.

87
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,680
I'll call.

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,439
Please show your cards.

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,839
Ace high.

90
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,000
Pair of Kings.

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
Young Master Tang.

92
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,399
Yours are so small,

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,639
and you dare show them off?

94
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,160
It's just one hand.

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,519
Continue.

96
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,839
Twenty thousand.

97
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,959
There are people watching the stairwell.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,759
Tang Hongtu's office

99
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,720
won't be easy to get into.

100
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,600
Sorry.

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Straight.

102
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,279
Beats yours.

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,879
The lady's luck is really good.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,600
It's time for the shift change.

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,839
Young Master Tang.

106
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,800
You've lost so much already.

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,720
Where's your home-field advantage?

108
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,319
Deal.

109
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,639
Three of a Kind, Kings.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,040
Lady Luck is smiling on me too.

111
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,399
It seems Miss Er Ni has a good hand.

112
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,920
Maybe I'm bluffing you again.

113
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,439
If I could die under Miss Er Ni's skirt,

114
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,839
I'd gladly be bluffed by you.

115
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,839
Disgusting.

116
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,839
All in.

117
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Unless you have three Aces,

118
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,480
my hand is unbeatable.

119
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,079
It can't be that coincidental, right?

120
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,600
I see Young Master Tang is running low on chips.

121
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,519
Let this lady play one last hand with you.

122
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,279
I'm all in too.

123
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,680
How much is that?

124
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,199
Young Master Tang doesn't have enough chips, does he?

125
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,480
Yeah.

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,680
Such a big bet.

127
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,839
For the first time, I feel really poor.

128
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,000
No chips, no game.

129
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,839
Then I'll just take it all...

130
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,120
It's not over yet.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
Don't be in such a hurry.

132
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't forget whose turf this is.

133
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,639
Bring more chips.

134
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,839
Brother Tang really has the resources.

135
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,680
Yeah.

136
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,480
Young Master Tang is so eager to give me money.

137
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,240
My hand isn't small either.

138
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,399
And,

139
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,639
I have a feeling it's bigger than yours.

140
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,279
Then this lady will let you lose knowing why.

141
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,960
Three of a Kind, Kings

142
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,519
Three Kings!

143
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,879
She's going to win, right?

144
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,840
What a huge hand!

145
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,919
Young Master Tang is sure to lose this time.

146
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,720
Yeah.

147
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,840
Unless she has three Aces.

148
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,960
Exactly, exactly.

149
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,679
Sorry.

150
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,639
Three Aces.

151
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,480
Really?!

152
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,440
Miss Er Ni.

153
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,919
This is too outrageous.

154
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,879
You lose.

155
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,360
How can one hand possibly have

156
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,480
both three Kings and three Aces?

157
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
You're cheating, damn it!

158
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,600
Er Ni.

159
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,320
Don't make baseless accusations.

160
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,639
To accuse someone of cheating, you need proof.

161
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,039
Tell me, who's cheating?

162
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,440
Then why did you change the dealer just now?

163
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,799
This is the Tang Casino.

164
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,039
We change dealers on schedule.

165
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,759
Ask anyone here if that's not the case.

166
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,120
That's right.

167
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,360
Yeah! What, you can't accept it?

168
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,159
Little girl.

169
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,039
At the gambling table, you win some, you lose some.

170
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,240
You can't expect to win all the time.

171
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,399
So it's a setup, huh?

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,919
I'm done playing.

173
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,480
Er Ni.

174
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,919
Accusing my Tang Casino of cheating,

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
tarnishing our reputation like this...

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
We can't just let this slide.

177
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,240
What do you want?

178
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
Sit down.

179
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,519
Have a few drinks with me.

180
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,120
After a drink, we'll be friends.

181
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320
I, Tang Huiyao, naturally won't give a friend a hard time.
