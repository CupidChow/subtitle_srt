1
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,880
I have some good news to share.

2
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,479
Xiaoxiao is awake.

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,920
Once he can speak,

4
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,560
everyone will know the truth.

5
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,240
Dafo's child is awake.

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,240
Didn't they say he needed several dialysis sessions?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,640
Xiao Bai.

8
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,759
Do you dare to go to the hospital with me to confront this?

9
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,359
This rundown hospital in Old Street

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,840
couldn't cure such severe poisoning so quickly.

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,120
This kid is trying to bluff me.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,519
Fine, let's go.

13
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,760
I have a clear conscience.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,439
Right, right, right.

15
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,120
Doctor!

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,640
Doctor!

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
How's my child?

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,519
Don't worry, family.

19
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,560
He's been cured.

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,000
He'll be wheeled out shortly.

21
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,400
Okay, okay.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,159
My Xiaoxiao.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,239
My Xiaoxiao.

24
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,519
Doctor!

25
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,560
Please help him quickly.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,040
Alright.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,079
Come in.

28
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,760
Go ahead first.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,920
Xiao Bai.

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,000
Weren't we going to confront each other?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,319
Let's go.

32
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:40,840
Go.

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,799
That's great.

34
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,959
My Xiaoxiao.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,959
He's finally better.

36
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,719
Zhao Fengsheng.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,159
What are you doing here?

38
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,599
I heard Xiaoxiao was waking up.

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,480
I'm here to prove my innocence, of course.

40
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,799
I won't let you see my Xiaoxiao.

41
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,920
Auntie Feng.

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,319
So many people are watching.

43
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,439
What else are you worried about?

44
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,239
Besides,

45
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,200
I was the one who changed Xiaoxiao's attending doctor.

46
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,000
You...

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,799
Otherwise, how could he have woken up so early?

48
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,400
You...

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,599
You're a loser who can't even afford pickled vegetables.

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,680
How could you afford to hire a specialist?

51
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,719
I did see a new doctor arrive earlier.

52
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,520
It was you, Yuchen, who invited him, right?

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,159
Xiaoxiao, Xiaoxiao.

54
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:22,800
Xiaoxiao.

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,479
Xiaoxiao.

56
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,159
Xiaoxiao.

57
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,000
Xiaoxiao.

58
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,039
My good grandson.

59
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,639
Daddy.

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,919
Grandpa.

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,919
Grandma.

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,199
Grandma.

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Grandma missed you so much.

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,840
Good boy, my good boy.

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,080
Little chick.

66
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,400
Chicken Uncle.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,560
You little rascal, you do remember me.

68
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,080
Chicken Uncle, hold me.

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,639
What are you trying to do?

70
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,080
Still trying to lay a hand on our Xiaoxiao?

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,159
You blockhead.

72
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,319
Your son just asked for a hug.

73
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,560
Why don't you get it?

74
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,639
Xiaoxiao.

75
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,599
Do you remember the bad guy who tied you up that day?

76
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,280
I don't remember.

77
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,120
See?

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,800
See?

79
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,719
I told you so.

80
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,319
Zhao Fengsheng is a liar.

81
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
I only remember an uncle who saved me.

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,240
He told me not to sleep.

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,120
Otherwise, if I slept too much, I wouldn't see Daddy

84
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,439
or Grandpa and Grandma.

85
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,080
My good boy.

86
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,680
You've suffered so much.

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,479
Xiaoxiao.

88
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Tell Daddy,

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,159
exactly which uncle saved you?

90
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,960
Him?

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,479
Which one?

92
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,360
Him.

93
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,520
Xiaoxiao.

94
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
It was me.

95
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,159
I was the one who carried you back that day.

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,280
Have you forgotten?

97
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,759
Hug.

98
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,759
Chicken Uncle.

99
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,879
The one who saved me was Chicken Uncle.

100
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,159
Really?

101
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,039
I wouldn't remember wrong.

102
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Good child.

103
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,599
So good.

104
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,280
It really was him.

105
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,639
Now the truth is clear, right?

106
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,199
Could it be...

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,199
that it really was Shengzi who saved Xiaoxiao?

108
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:11,960
Manager Bai

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,560
Dafo

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,960
Uh...

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,360
The child just woke up.

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,480
He's not fully conscious yet.

113
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,959
Now that things have come to this,

114
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,560
Manager Bai, tell us the truth.

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
What exactly is your connection

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,360
to those traffickers from Daixiang Village?

117
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,759
Bai Yuchen!

118
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,199
Did you poison our Xiaoxiao?

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,959
Talk!

120
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,040
It's a misunderstanding!

121
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,519
A misunderstanding!

122
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,120
A misunderstanding!

123
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,279
Here's what happened.

124
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,600
Xiaoxiao was already unconscious.

125
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,759
I was afraid of delaying his treatment,

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,800
so I helped you get the child back.

127
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,639
Really!

128
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,680
You really have some nerve!

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,800
I risked my life to save Xiaoxiao.

130
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
I told you to bring the child back first.

131
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,279
But what did you do?

132
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,360
You pinned the trafficker label on me!

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
And you made it sound so noble!

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Even though

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,560
you, Zhao Fengsheng, carried the child back,

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
but

137
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,160
who's to say

138
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,800
you weren't just putting on an act

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,839
to avoid being blamed by the neighbors?

140
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,160
You were faking it!

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,199
At a time like this,

142
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
you still want to call me a trafficker?

143
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,480
Yes!

144
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,240
You ARE a trafficker, you hear me?

145
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,160
Bai Yuchen,

146
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,319
you've been deceiving us for so long.

147
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,240
From now on, you're banned from Old Street.

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,000
And another thing!

149
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,759
Don't you dare try to ruin

150
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,839
Shengzi and Er Ni's relationship!

151
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,839
Do you understand?

152
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,319
Exactly!

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,879
You Bai family scoundrel!

154
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,879
So you're that kind of a swindler!

155
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,519
You schemed and caused all this trouble

156
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,720
just to trick our Er Ni into marriage, right?

157
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,120
Thank goodness

158
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,600
we saw your true colors today.

159
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,079
Mother-in-law...

160
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,720
Now that's not fair to say.

161
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,360
Wasn't it you

162
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,439
who coveted my position as Qian Group manager

163
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,439
and pushed your daughter onto me?

164
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,399
You!

165
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,079
And you, "Buddha"!

166
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,959
I'm talking to you!

167
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,040
Aren't you afraid I'll make

168
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,600
all of you starve?

169
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
Who do you think you're talking to?

170
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
So arrogant!

171
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,720
Seems to me

172
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,680
you're the one who'll be starving.

173
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,519
Let me tell you,

174
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,319
I

175
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,240
am a manager of the Qian Group!

176
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,439
Crushing you

177
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,279
is as easy as squashing bugs!

178
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,839
Is your power really that great?

179
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,199
Anyone who didn't know better

180
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
would think you're the chairman of the Qian Group.

181
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,079
Ch-Chairman Qian!

182
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,480
Y-you...

183
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
What brings you here?

184
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,120
You should have told me,

185
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,519
given me a call.

186
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,040
Bai Yuchen,

187
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,279
I hereby officially notify you

188
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,560
that you are fired from the Qian Group.

189
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,560
Furthermore, in Bianshui,

190
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,439
any industry related to the Qian Group

191
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,480
will blacklist you.

192
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,480
Serves you right! See if you dare strut now.

193
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,040
No, no, no!

194
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,319
Please!

195
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,279
Chairman Qian, please don't!

196
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,639
My heart was only for

197
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,920
the development of our Qian Group!

198
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,480
Y-you must give me another chance!

199
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,319
You offended Mr. Zhao,

200
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,759
and you still dare to babble here?

201
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,920
Throw him out.

202
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,480
No, wait!

203
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,399
Mr. Zhao is...

204
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,279
Mr. Zhao!

205
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Mr. Zhao!

206
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,120
I've offended you.

207
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,519
No.

208
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,360
Zhao... Zhao Fengsheng.

209
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:57,600
No.

210
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,160
No, no.

211
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,920
Shengzi, Shengzi.

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,600
Please help me.

213
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
I can't lose my job.

214
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,439
Before, on Old Street...

215
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,519
Er Ni, it was all my fault.

216
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:03,920
I'm a jerk.

217
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm a jerk.

218
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,879
You can't make me lose my job.

219
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,199
Get out.

220
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,160
Please help me.

221
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm a jerk, Shengzi.

222
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,040
Get out!

223
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,720
Get out!

224
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,480
I can't be without a job.

225
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,959
I have an old mother to support.

226
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,480
Shengzi, I'm begging you.

227
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,959
Zhao Fengsheng.

228
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,079
Brother Zhao.

229
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
I'm truly sorry.

230
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,839
That the Qian Group has such scum.

231
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,519
Caused you trouble.

232
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,279
It's fine.

233
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,480
Chairman Qian, you've helped a lot already.

234
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,279
Neighbors.

235
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,560
This is the chairman of the Qian Group.

236
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,439
Chairman Qian.

237
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,439
Chairman Qian.

238
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,600
The one who changed Xiaoxiao's doctor.

239
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,600
Is him.

240
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:36,959
Thank you.

241
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
Thank you, Chairman Qian.

242
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,839
Ma'am.

243
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,759
You're welcome.

244
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,639
This is all because of Brother Shengzi.

245
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
That we stepped in to help.

246
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,240
Shengzi.

247
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,959
Before, Auntie wrongly blamed you.

248
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,560
Auntie shouldn't have listened to that Manager Bai.

249
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,680
That liar's nonsense.

250
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,839
Auntie thanks you for saving our Xiaoxiao.

251
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,879
Auntie is...

252
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,079
Apologizing to you.

253
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,439
Someone your age kneeling to me...

254
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,279
Will shorten my life!

255
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,439
I should be kneeling to you.

256
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,120
Thank you.

257
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
We're all neighbors here.

258
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,519
As long as the misunderstanding is cleared up.

259
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,759
Shengzi.

260
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,319
Shengzi is magnanimous.

261
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,399
This old man is also embarrassed.

262
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,399
Oh, come on.

263
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,720
What are you saying.

264
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,439
I'm all...

265
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,759
Embarrassed now.

266
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,759
But I've left you some time.

267
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,000
I want to hear how you'll praise me.

268
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,680
For... for a whole day?

269
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Yeah.

270
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,240
I suffered such great injustice.

271
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,200
Shouldn't you praise me properly?

272
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,559
But no repeating.

273
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,320
Alright, alright.

274
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,639
Okay, okay, okay.

275
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,120
Okay.

276
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,720
Okay.

277
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
You chased me away the hardest.

278
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,919
Dafo.

279
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,519
Then... then...

280
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,840
Then I'll praise you for two days.

281
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,639
Two days.

282
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,720
Auntie.

283
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,440
You hit me the hardest.

284
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,039
Misunderstanding.

285
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,679
It was all a misunderstanding.

286
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,200
Misunderstanding.

287
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,440
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

288
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,000
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

289
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,519
As long as it's a misunderstanding.

290
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,080
Xiaoxiao.

291
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,000
Xiaoxiao.

292
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,720
Xiaoxiao.

293
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you know why Chicken Uncle...

294
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,960
Is called Chicken Uncle?

295
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,960
You loved eating chicken since you were little.

296
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,919
You ate all the chickens in my house.

297
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,799
Right, right, right.

298
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,639
Exactly, exactly.

299
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,799
It's because...

300
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,120
I grew up eating from a hundred homes.

301
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,679
Right.

302
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,000
From now on, the chickens in our house...

303
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,159
Will be ready for you too.

304
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,639
Always ready for you.

305
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Right.

306
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,799
Shengzi.

307
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm sorry.

308
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,559
Shengzi.

309
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,919
From now on, our Old Street...

310
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,720
Will always be your family.

311
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,159
Family.

312
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,639
Family, family.

313
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,600
Family.

314
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,519
What?

315
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,240
You want me to apologize to that jerk Zhao Fengsheng?

316
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,039
Dad.

317
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,080
You might not know this,

318
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,320
Ya Qing almost had a marriage ruined because of him.

319
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,519
And she was seriously injured.

320
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,799
How can I apologize to such scum?

321
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,200
Wouldn't that make our Qian family lose face?

322
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,320
Take that Bai Yuchen under you,

323
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,000
he's a typical selfish person.

324
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,200
He even dared to steal credit from Mr. Zhao.

325
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,919
I've already kicked him out of the group.

326
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,399
What?

327
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,240
How could Manager Bai be such a person?

328
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,519
Dad, are you mistaken?

329
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,720
He usually acts...

330
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,480
Tianyu.

331
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,320
You will have to manage the group someday.

332
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
You must learn to judge people.

333
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just now at the hospital,

334
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,159
the child named Xiaoxiao,

335
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,320
in front of everyone,

336
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,200
has already confirmed it.

337
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,639
How could this be?

338
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,480
I almost married Ya Qing to him.

339
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,919
What have I done?

340
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,679
But, Dad,

341
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,639
that Zhao Fengsheng,

342
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,240
he's definitely not a good person.

343
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,000
He's just a petty person trying to use our Qian family

344
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,279
to climb the social ladder.

345
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:00,960
He usually...

346
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,840
I don't care how much you dislike him now.

347
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,799
In the face of the entire Qian family's future,

348
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,080
it's not worth mentioning.

349
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
What do you mean?

350
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,720
The Tang family

351
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,120
is already about to move against our Qian family.

352
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,279
For our Qian family to survive,

353
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,159
we must have Zhao Fengsheng

354
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,639
ask Li Xiangping for help and support.

355
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,799
Only then do we have a slim chance.

356
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,240
Young Master Li?

357
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,360
How could Zhao Fengsheng possibly know Young Master Li?

358
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,039
Dad, you must be mistaken.

359
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,120
Zhao Fengsheng

360
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,240
is the guest that Young Master Li

361
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
personally called to ask me to look after,

362
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,919
the one I waited all day to receive.
