1
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
Tang Huiyao

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,960
Your grandpa Zhao Fengsheng is here.

3
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,120
Dad, are you okay?

4
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,760
Zhao Fengsheng

5
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:16,959
You're not dead?

6
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,560
You...

7
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Who are you people?

8
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,439
How do you have so many weapons?

9
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,159
Why so surprised?

10
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,280
You know I'm with Yunting.

11
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,640
Isn't it normal to have a few armed brothers?

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,439
What the hell is Yunting?

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,799
Didn't my father shoot you dead?

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
The fortune teller said

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,480
my fate, Zhao Fengsheng's, is tough as nails.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,319
Even the King of Hell can't kill me.

17
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,959
What does your Tang family

18
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,439
have to kill me with?

19
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,920
Let's see how tough your fate really is!

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,359
Huiyao!

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,640
A puny little Tang family

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,120
dares to bully my boss?

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,200
Looking for death!

24
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,120
I've seen plenty of mad dogs.

25
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,479
You, Tang Huiyao, don't qualify.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,360
Mu Jinfu!

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Do it now!

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,919
Playing with guns against us, Yunting?

29
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,919
Don't you know who the masters are?

30
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,759
Young Master Li of Jialong.

31
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,000
Tang Hongtu.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
I thought you were

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,800
a proper businessman.

34
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,599
I never expected

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,199
you, old man, to be so cunning.

36
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,319
Young Master Li.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Will you really start a war with my Tang family

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
over one Zhao Fengsheng?

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,879
War?

40
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,039
Are you worthy?

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,039
I admit,

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,599
your Li family holds immense power in Jialong.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,000
But this is Bian Shui.

44
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,360
I still have my brothers from Ghost Face Hall.

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,680
If we really fight to mutual destruction,

46
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,560
that wouldn't be appropriate, would it?

47
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,479
Second Master Tang is right!

48
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,280
Young Master Li,

49
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,840
this mine contains gold worth billions.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,520
If our two families cooperate,

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
with your Li family taking the lion's share,

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,000
your Li family

53
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,240
will firmly suppress

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,919
Jialong,

55
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,719
Lika,

56
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,520
and all the families in Badi.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,520
Securing the top spot in the southwest!

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,159
You could become the richest!

59
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,960
Young Master Li is amazing!

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,080
Young Master Li,

61
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,919
I know Zhao Fengsheng

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,000
worked with you in Amir.

63
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,319
Will you really give up such huge profits

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
for this nobody?

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
A nobody?

66
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,439
If my boss is a nobody,

67
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,039
then what am I?

68
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,919
What are we, his Yunting brothers?

69
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,199
Boss.

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,439
You, the esteemed Young Master Li, call him boss?

71
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,879
Just who is Zhao Fengsheng?

72
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,560
You don't even understand my boss's identity,

73
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,520
and yet you try to drive a wedge between us?

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,039
Impossible!

75
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
He, Zhao Fengsheng,

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,280
is just a small-time hoodlum who joined Yunting!

77
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,479
One-Eye!

78
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,519
Listen up!

79
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,839
My boss,

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
Zhao Fengsheng,

81
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,800
is the leader of Yunting's Thirteen Guards,

82
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,680
our eternal Captain.

83
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,439
Captain?

84
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,120
Impossible!

85
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,319
He's Yunting's mysterious Captain?

86
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,519
Absolutely impossible!

87
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,360
He's just a hoodlum from Old Street!

88
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,920
How could he possibly be one of the Thirteen...

89
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,000
How could he be the Captain of the Thirteen Guards?

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,480
He...

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
You're looking at the sky with your ass in the air,

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,160
blind!

93
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,839
Then you are...?

94
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,800
I am the heir of the Su family from Lika.

95
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,439
The Su family, third of the Ten Great Families.

96
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,600
I am the heir of the Yan family from Badi.

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,319
Heir of the Ma family from Jialong.

98
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,079
Heir of the Cao family from Lika.

99
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Zhao Fengsheng is...

100
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,240
Darn it.

101
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,519
Darn it.

102
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,000
Even a god couldn't save us now.

103
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,240
My father died right here years ago.

104
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,079
I ask you,

105
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,279
was it you who did it?

106
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,639
I don't know your father.

107
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,120
Huiyao!

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,399
Dad!

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,920
What time is it for this?

110
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,959
Say it! Say it!

111
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,600
Talk!

112
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,519
I can't say it!

113
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,759
If I talk, we all die!

114
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,079
Dad!

115
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,839
You think if you don't talk,

116
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,000
we, Yunting, won't find out?

117
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,240
Stop!

118
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
I'll talk.

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,519
Your father...

120
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,519
I sent people to kill him.

121
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,759
My father had no grudge against you.

122
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,839
Why did you kill him?

123
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,360
Someone...

124
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,759
...gave me the order.

125
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,399
Who?

126
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,000
Mancheng...

127
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,120
...the Lei Family.

128
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,240
The Lei Family of Mancheng.

129
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,560
That's a force as rich as a nation.

130
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,279
The Lei Family is far away in Mancheng.

131
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,600
Why would they want my father dead?

132
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,360
Your mother was the eldest daughter of the Lei Family.

133
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,759
My mother?

134
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,839
The Lei Family's eldest daughter?

135
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,920
The one who ordered your father's death...

136
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,040
...is your uncle.

137
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
Lei Sinian.

138
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,199
My uncle killed my father?

139
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,879
Why?

140
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,399
Why?!

141
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,480
Your father wanted to use this gold mine...

142
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,079
...to help you seize the Lei Family heir position.

143
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,920
He brought this upon himself.

144
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,680
I understand now.

145
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,800
So when you assassinated my father...

146
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
...you discovered clues about the gold mine.

147
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,800
I was going to use you to threaten your father...

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,759
...to force him to reveal the mine's secret.

149
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,959
But Bian Shui has many factions.

150
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,319
I also feared the Lei Family learning of the mine.

151
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,279
That's why I plotted all this in secret.

152
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,000
Now that the truth is out...

153
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,600
...I'll send you down...

154
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,240
...to apologize to my father!

155
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Zhao Fengsheng!

156
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,920
I planned all of this.

157
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,560
I take full responsibility for my actions.

158
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,199
I don't beg for your mercy.

159
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,600
But I beg you to spare my son.

160
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,199
I, Tang Hongtu...

161
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,279
...kneel in gratitude for your great kindness.

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,519
Dad!

163
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,360
Dad!

164
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,439
Dad!

165
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,439
Dad!

166
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,160
Dad!

167
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,440
Dad!

168
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,600
Those who harmed you...

169
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,440
...will finally pay the price.

170
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,679
Dad...

171
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,840
Dad...

172
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,759
Zhao Fengsheng!

173
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,600
You'll pay for this!

174
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,600
Dad!

175
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,039
If I weren't so tough...

176
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,879
Dad!

177
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,320
...I'd have died by your hands long ago!

178
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,000
And you dare seek revenge on me?

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,080
Zhao Fengsheng!

180
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,559
You drove my father to his death!

181
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,879
I'll take your life!

182
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,919
Zhao Fengsheng!

183
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,159
Boss.

184
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,320
How should we handle these people?

185
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,559
Tang Hongtu has paid with his life.

186
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,960
But Tang Huiyao...

187
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,600
...has committed so many evils.

188
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,360
We can't let him go.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,559
No!

190
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,440
I won't go to prison!

191
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,919
I'm a young master of the Tang Family!

192
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,200
I won't go to prison!

193
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,080
You few, carry him down.

194
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,679
Zhao Fengsheng!

195
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,639
Zhao Fengsheng!

196
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,120
I won't go to prison!

197
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,879
No prison!

198
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,879
Zhao Fengsheng!

199
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,799
Zhao Fengsheng!

200
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,480
Brother Zhao!

201
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,480
No!

202
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,600
Master Feng!

203
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
Master Feng!

204
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I was blind!

205
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,639
I was so blind!

206
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,399
Blind!

207
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:50,960
If you're still unhappy...

208
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,559
...gouge out my other eye too!

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
One-Eye.

210
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,720
You have a murder case on your hands.

211
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,440
You must face legal judgment.

212
00:09:59,159 --> 00:09:59,919
Legal judgment.

213
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,200
Take those who followed Mu Jinfu...

214
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,919
...and send them with him to the Bian Shui police.

215
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,559
Yes, sir.

216
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,799
Mr. Zhao, I beg you!

217
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,519
I won't go!

218
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,840
I don't want to go to prison!

219
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,639
Please, let me go!

220
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,200
Take him away.

221
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,279
Mr. Zhao!

222
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,519
Mr. Zhao, I won't go!

223
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,879
I don't want to rot in a cell!

224
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,679
Mr. Zhao, spare me!

225
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,440
Mr. Zhao!

226
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,080
Brother Fengsheng.

227
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,519
Thank you for saving my life.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,679
It's because of me...

229
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,200
...that you were dragged into the Tang Family conflict.

230
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,639
I should have protected you all.

231
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,840
I didn't even know...

232
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
...you're the captain of Yunting.

233
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,600
Could you have guessed?

234
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm a mysterious man.

235
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,320
I've been underestimating you all along.

236
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,200
No need to apologize.

237
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,240
Our Old Street doesn't have many business-savvy people.

238
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
The reconstruction of Old Street and the gold mine's development...

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,679
...will still need the Qian Group's efforts.

240
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,960
Regarding the gold mine...

241
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,440
...Brother Fengsheng, you can leave it to us with peace of mind.

242
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,840
The Qian Family...

243
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,399
...will definitely build you...

244
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,919
...a massive financial reserve.

245
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,840
Then I thank you.

246
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,759
I'll take my leave now.

247
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,399
Alright.

248
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,600
Boss.

249
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,279
Not bad.

250
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,759
You're really something now.

251
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,879
Keep talking nonsense and see what happens.

252
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,679
Tian Yu.

253
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,600
If you have something to say to Brother Zhao...

254
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,639
...go say it now.

255
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Looking for a beating, are you?

256
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
So you're Zhao Fengsheng.

257
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,840
In all my life...

258
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,000
...I've never seen someone as...

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,519
...lacking in self-awareness...

260
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,559
...you lunatic!

261
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,639
How can you be so narcissistic?

262
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,279
Me? Narcissistic?

263
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,919
Me?

264
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,480
You!

265
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,919
You jerk!

266
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,919
Get out of here!

267
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,840
Jerk!

268
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,679
Jerk! You stop right there!

269
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,519
Tian Yu.

270
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,320
Scoundrel

271
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,559
Scoundrel

272
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,639
Let go of me!

273
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,879
No matter what you do,

274
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,320
your father will support you.
