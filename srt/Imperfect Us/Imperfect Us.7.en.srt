1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,540
They say...

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,879
when one of the two microscopic particles...

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,410
from the same source changes,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,919
the other one...

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,480
will change in the same way.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,359
Even if...

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,820
they are miles apart.

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,399
It's not telepathy.

9
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,070
It's a real scientific phenomenon.

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,199
It's called...

11
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,799
quantum entanglement.

12
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:35,646
(Diagnosis Report, Zhang Yi Jing)

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,609
My poor client.

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,109
She's only 40 years old.

15
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:40,679
Rebecca!

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,679
Then,

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,049
are the both of us...

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,750
with the same birthday who are in love...

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,820
with the same man entangled too?

20
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,069
Is consciousness pranking us again?

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,316
Why do I feel like I hear the sound of the ambulance...

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,439
a lot more often lately...

23
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,670
and they are especially loud?

24
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,399
It's shouting that something is happening in the distance.

25
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,879
Who is it?

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,950
Is anyone with him?

27
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,989
(Jian Qing Fen calling)

28
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,639
What is it?

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,349
Nothing.

30
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,750
I dialed the wrong number.

31
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:29,120
(Jian Qing Fen)

32
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,530
Hey.

33
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,599
Hello, Mr. Xu.

34
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,900
I'm He Yong Li's mom.

35
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,469
I'd like to ask if he's in class right now.

36
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,979
Nothing's wrong. I was just checking.

37
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,210
Okay, bye.

38
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,050
Hey, Mom.

39
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,719
Is everything okay?

40
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:36,750
No, I'm just asking.

41
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,659
You're the only one left.

42
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,500
Are you okay?

43
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,629
My dear entanglement.

44
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,300
(Rebecca Zhang, Blocked)

45
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,680
Qing Fen, you should know too.

46
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,080
I can't disclose my client's information.

47
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,780
I know, I do.

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,250
I just want to confirm if your client is my friend...

49
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,560
If she's the Zhang Yi Jing I know.

50
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,860
Please?

51
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,889
I just want her date of birth.

52
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,759
And...

53
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,129
And her address.

54
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,860
No, I can't.

55
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,029
I'm serious.

56
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,839
Qing Fen, don't give me a hard time.

57
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,639
Please?

58
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,379
No, I can't.

59
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,930
Stop slowly.

60
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,060
Okay, move your feet.

61
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,100
The current contestant is...

62
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,939
Rebecca Zhang from Taiwan.

63
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,810
She's almost 40 years old,

64
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,999
but she claims to have the physique of a 25-year-old.

65
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,850
Goodness. Not bad.

66
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,310
Hey.

67
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,449
Hey.

68
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,350
Amazing.

69
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,560
Okay, slowly.

70
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:30,269
(Zhi Yin)

71
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:38,279
(Lease)

72
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,029
Mr. Yu!

73
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,470
Are you home?

74
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,680
If you don't pay your rent,

75
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,810
I'm going to call the police.

76
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,550
I can hear you. There are sounds!

77
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,720
I'll wire it to you later.

78
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:37,240
(Jian Qing Fen wants to add you. "Is Rebecca really okay?")

79
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,550
(320 days ago)

80
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,610
Wake up.

81
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,149
Remember not to eat.

82
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,350
Hey.

83
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,065
You have to report to the health center at 8:30am.

84
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,620
Remember to bring your poop and pee.

85
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:01,959
Wake up.

86
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,170
Did you pack your poop and pee?

87
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,810
Hey, you.

88
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Hey.

89
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,329
Let's go home.

90
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,899
It's almost 9pm.

91
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,719
You haven't eaten anything today.

92
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,009
Stop messing around.

93
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,680
The market is opening next week.

94
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,649
I'm running out of time.

95
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,389
I don't have time to joke around with you.

96
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,480
You don't have to joke around.

97
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm very serious.

98
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,300
It's impossible between us.

99
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,439
What I need right now isn't vanilla romance.

100
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,180
What I want is a simple companionship...

101
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,980
that can last a long time.

102
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,810
How do you know I'm not like that?

103
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,050
- Are you? - I am.

104
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,670
"Be careful, it's slippery here."

105
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,289
"You can do it."

106
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:37,889
"We're almost there."

107
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,559
"You can make it."

108
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
I can say all that.

109
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,000
It's quite touching,

110
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,979
but I don't want to turn you into an easy catch.

111
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,245
And I don't have the time for that now.

112
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:49,200
Do you want to know...

113
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,639
why the Japanese word for shrimp is "ebi"?

114
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,769
I really...

115
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
All right.

116
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,916
I know you girls are too lazy to peel shrimp.

117
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,940
So,

118
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
I'm good at "it."

119
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,350
My goodness.

120
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,019
Come on, let's eat shrimp.

121
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,800
I'll peel the shrimp, so you don't have to.

122
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:08,889
Just eat it as it is.

123
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Let's go.

124
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,460
Call it a day.

125
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,629
It's hunched over.

126
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,230
And it has whiskers.

127
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,070
Its nutritional value is as high as an old man's wisdom.

128
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,900
Old man in the sea, that's why it's called "ebi."

129
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,639
It's accurate, right?

130
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,779
Here.

131
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,879
I can't eat anymore.

132
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,909
It's just one bite.

133
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,279
I can't even take half a bite.

134
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,850
You ordered so much.

135
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,860
I want a bite of every dish.

136
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,889
Don't waste food.

137
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,129
No wonder they say...

138
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
that men in love...

139
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,769
gain weight easily.

140
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,470
Hey.

141
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,139
Not yet.

142
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,279
We need to get the test results first.

143
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,190
Our relationship is all set after you get your insurance.

144
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,149
But you know what?

145
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,289
When you're running,

146
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,049
if you start only on the count of three,

147
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
you'll be one beat late.

148
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,395
It's about getting ready when you hear the word "set."

149
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,230
When the referee says "ready,"

150
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,860
your running foot moves forward.

151
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,529
I'm already way ahead.

152
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,010
Has it been a while since you watched the Olympics?

153
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,570
They use guns now.

154
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,850
Old man's wisdom.

155
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,570
Hey, where are you going?

156
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,740
I'm busy. What else?

157
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,186
Hey, wait for me. I'll get my helmet.

158
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,440
I already called a cab.

159
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,049
What are you doing?

160
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,379
Waiting for the elevator with you.

161
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,190
Sixteenth floor.

162
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,190
The doors are opening.

163
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
What are you doing?

164
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,660
Taking the elevator with you.

165
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,639
Seriously, you've got nothing to do?

166
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Of course not.

167
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,250
I'm busy waiting for "the gun" to go off.

168
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,389
Can we hold hands first?

169
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
No.

170
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,299
Can I sleep on your couch?

171
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,529
No.

172
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,750
Yu Xiang Li, what are you doing?

173
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,760
I can at least look at you for two more minutes.

174
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,070
Let's get the medical report before we go to the venue.

175
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,509
No.

176
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,056
Let's get the report first before setting up the venue.

177
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,740
No.

178
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,525
Let's get the report first and then set up, okay?

179
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:23,549
No.

180
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,596
Only girls in their twenties...

181
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,730
like to be picked up and dropped off, okay?

182
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:38,029
Aren't you physically 25 years old?

183
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,000
I look 25 years old too.

184
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,309
Mr. Yu.

185
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:56,409
The deadline is midnight today.

186
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,309
Did you forget...

187
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,379
It's all done.

188
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Where are you going?

189
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,350
He's weird.

190
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
So weird.

191
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,330
Can you go faster?

192
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,270
I have to be at the venue at 6am tomorrow.

193
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,299
No.

194
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,700
Please?

195
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,306
I'm afraid I'll be late if I can't get up.

196
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,770
Didn't you say you wouldn't be scared if someone is with you?

197
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,379
Thank you.

198
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,080
Drive safely.

199
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,289
I... I suddenly...

200
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Well...

201
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,210
I really need to pee.

202
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Yes.

203
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,419
You're not coming, are you?

204
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,049
I'm taking a cab home.

205
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,590
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

206
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,330
I'm really tired and I want to go home.

207
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,090
I'll get a cab, bye.

208
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,669
Now you know how important I am?

209
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,669
Yes.

210
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,940
Now I know why you can't get a girlfriend...

211
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,179
even though you're tall,

212
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
fit, and handsome.

213
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,279
Why?

214
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,480
Because you're really boring.

215
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,850
Hey, I...

216
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Hey.

217
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,505
When you say I'm boring, do you really mean it,

218
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,090
or are you just saying it to act cute?

219
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,360
Should I put a finger on my cheek?

220
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:00,960
What era are we in now?

221
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,405
Do you think this will make us feel romantic,

222
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,669
burst with joy,

223
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,669
and long for love?

224
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Maybe you're too old to understand.

225
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,710
So where did you park your scooter?

226
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,509
Over there.

227
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:13,909
Should've said it sooner.

228
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Hey, it's...

229
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,419
What does it mean to be romantic?

230
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,779
Haven't you seen Korean dramas?

231
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,919
If the mood is right,

232
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,320
grab and kiss her.

233
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:24,820
Grab her?

234
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:25,720
How?

235
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:26,860
Can you demonstrate?

236
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,090
Do I have to teach you?

237
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,289
Like this.

238
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,159
Yu Xiang Li!

239
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,429
I'm so sorry.

240
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,899
It hurts!

241
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,940
Do you have tissues?

242
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,110
No!

243
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,779
I don't have tissues on me.

244
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,760
- It hurts a lot. - Then maybe...

245
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,630
(Mori Market)

246
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,829
Take your time.

247
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,569
Thank you.

248
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,529
Do you have a map?

249
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,039
You can scan the QR code over there.

250
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,275
- Thank you. - Xiang Li, refill this for me.

251
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:45,970
Okay.

252
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,039
Thank you.

253
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:49,369
Thank you.

254
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,769
Thank you.

255
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,240
Thank you. Give me a second.

256
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,380
Here it is.

257
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,250
Here you go.

258
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,150
Thank you.

259
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,319
Give me a second.

260
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,549
Hey, Yu Xiang Li!

261
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:04,619
Thank you.

262
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:05,920
Are you exaggerating?

263
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,359
- Thank you. - Yu Xiang Li!

264
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Thank you.

265
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,259
Hello.

266
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,329
What are you doing here?

267
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,000
Are you a staff member too?

268
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,330
I'm just helping out a friend.

269
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,970
Do you get an employee discount?

270
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,210
It's just a QR code.

271
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,369
What QR code?

272
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,216
If you scan it, there's a map of the market.

273
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,609
There's also a brochure and a discount code.

274
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,009
I made it.

275
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Really?

276
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,019
Do it for me.

277
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,519
Okay, sure.

278
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,220
That's easy. Let's go.

279
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,049
When did Zhi Yin meet that guy?

280
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,690
He's so handsome.

281
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,490
Just scan it.

282
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,289
Thank you.

283
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,529
Thank you.

284
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,900
Thank you.

285
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:49,130
Thank you.

286
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,930
Here you go. Thank you.

287
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,569
Thank you.

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,009
Thank you.

289
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,140
Is that her?

290
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,140
Thank you.

291
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,210
- Who? - Thank you.

292
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,360
The one playing hard to get.

293
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,410
Thank you.

294
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,150
Thank you.

295
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,779
- Yes. - Thank you.

296
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,079
She's pretty.

297
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,819
Thank you.

298
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,420
- Yes. - Thank you.

299
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,920
Why don't you show her around?

300
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,049
Here, thank you.

301
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,819
- Okay. Then... - Thank you.

302
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,930
I'll go shopping with her.

303
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,160
Go ahead.

304
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,230
Thank you.

305
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,130
Thank you.

306
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:19,829
Here you go. Thank you.

307
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,299
I didn't know you could get jealous.

308
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,539
Thank you.

309
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:26,400
I'm here again.

310
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,470
Aren't you busy?

311
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,309
It's okay.

312
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,039
I'll show you guys around.

313
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,009
- Hey, I want to see that bag. - Sure.

314
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:33,509
Thank you.

315
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,480
Hey, help me out.

316
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,250
Hello?

317
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,150
Yes, Zhang Yi Jing speaking.

318
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,319
Let's go look at that bag.

319
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
Okay.

320
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,559
There are performances?

321
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,660
Yes.

322
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,539
Hey, I'm so hungry.

323
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,069
Let's get something to eat, okay?

324
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:02,940
- Let's go eat first. - Okay.

325
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:03,839
You're such a glutton.

326
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,380
- It's over there. - Really?

327
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,420
Hey, where are you going?

328
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,340
You guys look around. I'm going to look for my friend.

329
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:33,500
(Da Yu, Xiang Li)

330
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,660
These fans are free at the market today.

331
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,589
You can scan the QR code here.

332
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,329
Xiao Mao.

333
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,200
Have you seen Rebecca?

334
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,859
No, I haven't seen her today.

335
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,799
I see.

336
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,869
Thank you.

337
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:03,845
Those at the back, come this way.

338
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,970
You can get the fans here.

339
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:07,069
The fans are free today.

340
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,349
Yu Xiang Li.

341
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,779
Just tell her how you feel.

342
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,519
She'll just reject you.

343
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,979
You don't know anything so don't...

344
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,080
Why didn't you answer my calls or reply to my messages?

345
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,150
I'm busy.

346
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:36,289
Hey.

347
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,599
You're angry, aren't you?

348
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,630
I'm busy.

349
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,170
I think you're angry.

350
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,400
Why would I be angry?

351
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,020
I don't have feelings for her anymore.

352
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
It's none of my business.

353
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,109
I was just joking.

354
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
It's not funny at all.

355
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,150
See?

356
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
You're mad.

357
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,119
Yes.

358
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,289
I'm angry.

359
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,310
But it has nothing to do with you.

360
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,119
You mean nothing to me.

361
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,730
Leave me alone!

362
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,529
Yu Xiang Li.

363
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,719
Have you finished the model?

364
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,210
Hello?

365
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,509
It's due on Friday.

366
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,420
What are you doing?

367
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,799
I'll do it later.

368
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,180
(8:21pm, April 13, Thursday)

369
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,079
(Zhi Yin: What are you doing?)

370
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,940
(Do you want to get a drink?)

371
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Hey.

372
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:08,809
Have you clocked out?

373
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,849
Are you angry?

374
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:15,420
Don't be mad.

375
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,319
You're cute when you're mad.

376
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,829
Come on, dance with me.

377
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,740
Hey, are you mad?

378
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,799
Don't be mad.

379
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:34,970
Do you know why?

380
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,039
Because if you get mad like this,

381
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:39,440
I'll really like you.

382
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,849
You're so cute.

383
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,750
Don't be mad.

384
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:46,819
Are you drunk?

385
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,049
Yes.

386
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,250
I drank this much.

387
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Is that a lot?

388
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,119
Yu Xiang Li.

389
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,190
(Zhi Yin calling)

390
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,900
Yu Xiang Li.

391
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Darn it.

392
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,150
Am I pretty?

393
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,119
Yes.

394
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,789
Really?

395
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,680
Turn on the lights and take a closer look.

396
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:21,140
Look at me.

397
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,990
Do you like my breasts?

398
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,859
Very much.

399
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:39,599
What if...

400
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,829
they disappear...

401
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,200
and there's only a big scar left?

402
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,440
Would you still want to date me?

403
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,049
What scar?

404
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,690
I'll have them removed next Tuesday.

405
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,380
Have what removed?

406
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,450
Breast cancer.

407
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,029
Yu Xiang Li.

408
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,210
I really, truly...

409
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,339
want to be in a relationship with you.

410
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,150
Maybe it's because I love you.

411
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,519
Or maybe it's because I'm selfish.

412
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:41,390
I'm too scared.

413
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,059
That's why I want to hold on to you.

414
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,539
I'm really not sure.

415
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,369
Because I'm not in my right mind anymore.

416
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,240
So I'm sorry.

417
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,349
I have to let you choose.

418
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,130
Chemotherapy...

419
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,329
Because of the medication,

420
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,500
I might lose all my hair.

421
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,069
After electro-coagulation,

422
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,009
it'll look like it has been roasted.

423
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,309
I'll look really ugly...

424
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,980
and haggard.

425
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,150
It might even relapse.

426
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,329
Do you still want to date me?

427
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,470
Do you?

428
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:01,869
Do you?

429
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:13,819
Do you?

430
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,970
It's okay.

431
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,740
Think about it carefully.

432
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,519
You have to think it through.

433
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,420
Before my surgery,

434
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,059
I'll be waiting here for you.

435
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,829
If you still wish to love me,

436
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,029
come look for me.

437
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,710
And then what?

438
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,450
You...

439
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
didn't go?

440
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:39,599
I got it.

441
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,369
Sorry...

442
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,140
for taking up so much of your time.

443
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:02,789
I'm sorry.

444
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:04,930
But I still have something to say.

445
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,359
Don't you love her?

446
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,430
So,

447
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,230
what's there to choose?

448
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,339
You should have hugged her tightly then...

449
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,710
and given her courage.

450
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,520
You men don't know anything about how to love.

451
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,549
You're so selfish.

452
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:32,059
She has never ever...

453
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,759
begged anyone for love.

454
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,559
Can you imagine...

455
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,230
how fragile, helpless, and scared...

456
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,460
she was at that time?

457
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,500
- And then you... - What should I do if she dies?

458
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,640
What if I can't take it and give up halfway?

459
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,869
What should she do?

460
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,466
Yu Xiang Li, aren't you too mean?

461
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,595
Do you know how long I've been waiting here?

462
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,720
I could have left!

463
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Actually, I know why he fled.

464
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,569
But I can't forgive him.

465
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,410
Because in this story,

466
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,109
I'm the other entangled particle.

467
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,179
Ms. Zhang, I'll be back tomorrow.

468
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,340
(Zhi Yin calling)

469
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,210
Hello?

470
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,139
Why didn't you answer my calls or reply to my messages?

471
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,440
If you don't want to take responsibility, just say so.

472
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,410
Are you still waiting for me?

473
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,219
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:20,649
I'll finish my work and go to you.

475
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,130
You can skip work?

476
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,429
What day is it today?

477
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,800
Monday.

478
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:35,039
(Lease)

479
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,420
Rebe...

480
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,389
Excuse me.

481
00:35:57,929 --> 00:35:59,559
Excuse me.

482
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,429
Is Rebecca in the hospital?

483
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,969
Which hospital?

484
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,880
Could you please tell me?

485
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,019
My sister is so pretty.

486
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,219
She looked like a doll when she was born.

487
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:28,929
I even asked my mom,

488
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,559
"This is fake, right?"

489
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,800
"How can a doll be so pretty?"

490
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,520
She doesn't want anyone to know that she has no hair.

491
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,239
She likes to look pretty.

492
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:49,349
She must still be pretty even if she's bald, right?

493
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,650
I did come.

494
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:58,650
I really came.

495
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,820
But I didn't dare to come up here.

496
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,960
I didn't dare.

497
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,530
It's okay.

498
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:12,000
She'll get well.

499
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,840
She's such a pretty girl.

500
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,269
How could God not let her get well?

501
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,510
When she gets better,

502
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,489
I'll definitely tell her...

503
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,480
not to love you.

504
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,920
Cowards are a no-go.

505
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,780
Mr. Coward, excuse me.

506
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,550
After that day,

507
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,980
time suddenly slowed down.

508
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:06,889
I don't think "slow" is the right word.

509
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:08,820
It should be "deep."

510
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,300
Time is so deep...

511
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,030
that I could see the sun's movement.

512
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,800
I could hear the sound of bicycles from downstairs.

513
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,340
The sound of Bu Bu opening the door.

514
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:28,340
The sound of him coming to my room.

515
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,309
Mom, are you not feeling well?

516
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,449
Why didn't you wake me up?

517
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,230
I'm sorry.

518
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,099
He Bu Bu, are you done changing?

519
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,429
Life is still the same.

520
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,269
- Bye, Mom. - But I've changed.

521
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,670
Zhou Zhi Kang.

522
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,349
I've come to like the unchanged.

523
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,190
I've discovered...

524
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,190
the ever-changing in the unchanged.

525
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,199
In an instant,

526
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:25,400
my consciousness jumped into another universe.

527
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
There,

528
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:30,570
I finally understood that nothing is inevitable.

529
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,380
It's something to be grateful for.

530
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:39,849
So...

531
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,780
this is enlightenment.

532
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:52,230
(The Heart Sutra)

533
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,670
I'm fine.

534
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,610
Hey, Sunny.

535
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
What's up?

536
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,050
You have to be fine too.

537
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,920
(The blessings are for Zhang Yi Jing)

538
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Thank you.

539
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,219
Thank you so much.

540
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,289
Yes.

541
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:18,989
Go ahead.

542
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,379
Mr. He, I'll go over there first.

543
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:23,989
Bring some beverages over.

544
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:25,730
That's basic public relations.

545
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,675
But the finance department has been quite difficult lately...

546
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:28,760
I'll reimburse you.

547
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:29,989
All right. Thank you, Mr. He.

548
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,510
(Jian Qing Fen: I'm sorry. I took the car...)

549
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,710
I'm sorry.

550
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,579
I took the car.

551
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,219
I'll need it for the time being.

552
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,199
Bu Bu will go straight to English tutoring after school today.

553
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:00,760
The class ends at 6pm.

554
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:03,429
I'm very sorry...

555
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,730
for the inconvenience.

556
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:12,639
I'm not sure if you still need my answer.

557
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,210
But I'll still try to answer your question.

558
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,650
Taiping Road, Chenggong Town, Taitung County.

559
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,349
If you've already made up your mind,

560
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,719
please skip reading the following text.

561
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,500
That definitely wasn't done out of love.

562
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,440
But I have my needs.

563
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:46,079
I need someone to listen to me,

564
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,809
hug me tightly,

565
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,280
or even cry with me.

566
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,719
During that time,

567
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:57,989
if someone could tell me,

568
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,289
"Jian Qing Fen, you did well."

569
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,529
"Thank you for your hard work."

570
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,230
I would do anything.

571
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:15,539
Unfortunately,

572
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,639
that person can't be you,

573
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,809
nor can it be you.

574
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,949
Because I hate you.

575
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,159
I hate you for taking my love for granted.

576
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:38,559
So when you said thank you...

577
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
or good job,

578
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,329
it only made me believe all the more...

579
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,869
that there was only gratitude between us...

580
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,510
but not love.

581
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,610
From the day I married you,

582
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,480
I can't stop thinking about it.

583
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,989
What if it were Rebecca?

584
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,090
Turn right.

585
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,619
(Datong Hostel)

586
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,730
I've thought it through.

587
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,900
I can't feel inferior all my life.

588
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,929
So I'm going somewhere.

589
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,079
As for the divorce,

590
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,449
I only have one condition.

591
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,519
Shared custody of Bu Bu.

592
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:38,989
I think you'd agree with that.

593
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,360
After all,

594
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,929
you're a kind person.

595
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,900
Dad!

596
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,099
Is the class over?

597
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,199
Why are you picking me up?

598
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:54,699
Do you want to have dinner with me and Mom?

599
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:55,769
Where's your bag?

600
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,309
Go get it.

601
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,849
Bu Bu wants to eat ramen.

602
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,730
I'm sorry for troubling you.

603
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:09,449
Mom is busy.

604
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:11,920
Let's go eat ramen, okay?

605
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,590
Ramen!

606
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:15,590
Lastly...

607
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:16,690
Dad.

608
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,559
Thank you.

609
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,059
What is ramen in English?

610
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,360
In English?

611
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:22,869
Actually, it's noodles in English.

612
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:25,769
Thank you for all the cream cakes you've got me over the years.

613
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,150
You're 200 metres away.

614
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:46,960
Your destination is on your left.

615
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,929
This can't be right.

616
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:21,489
Excuse me.

617
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,210
Is it...

618
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:45,679
you?

619
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,739
Do you remember me?

620
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,340
Jian Qing Fen.

621
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:17,050
He Rui Zhi is not with me.

622
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,469
He Rui Zhi is divorcing me.

623
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,440
I cheated on him.

624
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,980
I did.

625
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:04,489
So...

626
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:09,000
Can you please take me in for a while?

627
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:12,969
Me?

628
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,769
I've been talking to someone in my heart all these years.

629
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:21,480
I thought that person was He Rui Zhi.

630
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,280
But then I realized...

631
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:29,920
that person was actually you.

632
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,489
I've told you so many things.

633
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,889
Like just now on the way here,

634
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I said...

635
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,300
I need an enemy.

636
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,440
So you have to live well.

637
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,750
Sunny.

638
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,019
She's an ex-colleague of mine.

639
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,260
Another coincidence between us.

640
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,230
I really have something to say to you in person.

641
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,250
I really have a lot to say to you.

642
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:42,559
Please?

643
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,730
Just two days.

644
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,900
Is your cooking good?

645
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,880
He Rui Zhi's mom picked on my cooking for 12 years.

646
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:08,519
What do you think?

647
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,630
I really want to eat a spicy hot pot.

648
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:19,940
Do you know how to make it?

649
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,030
Can you eat something so spicy?

650
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,110
It's already spreading.

651
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,460
I can make that.

652
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,130
I'll learn once I make it.
