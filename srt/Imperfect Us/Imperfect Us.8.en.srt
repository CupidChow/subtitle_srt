1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,270
Ginger.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,679
And garlic.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,810
And also star anise.

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,220
Cumin.

5
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,339
Why did you choose this place?

6
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,649
I like the smell of the harbor.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,649
It makes me feel at home.

8
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,520
I heard my dad was a sailor.

9
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,700
After my dad had an affair,

10
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,469
we seldom contacted him.

11
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,239
But he has been living with his mistress.

12
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:12,609
Cinnamon.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
Nutmeg.

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,890
Does it feel great to have an affair?

15
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,099
Maybe.

16
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,569
But mine doesn't.

17
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,780
Dried chili.

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Sichuan pepper.

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,750
How do you write "pepper"?

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
The radical on the left is "mu" for wood,

21
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,959
and the right is "shu" for uncle.

22
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,175
(Ginger, garlic, star anise, cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg, Sichuan pepper)

23
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,229
Nutmeg.

24
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,969
Is this enough?

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,639
Yes, thank you.

26
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,150
Hey, let me do it.

27
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,590
Why didn't you wait for me?

28
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,959
Are there not enough blankets?

29
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,979
Didn't you get up in the middle of the night to get your jacket?

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,430
Did I wake you?

31
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,330
I don't sleep well anyway.

32
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,960
Hey, your pot is bubbling.

33
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,990
Okay.

34
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,329
Have you tried Blue House Spicy Hot Pot?

35
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,120
I love Qiaotou.

36
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,220
The spicy and clear soups are good.

37
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,589
Qiao...

38
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,930
Tou?

39
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,270
As in "the other side of the bridge."

40
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,230
I see.

41
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,800
I've never heard of it.

42
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,540
I'll try it when I'm back in Taipei.

43
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:02,589
Chanchi Hot Pots Lab is good too.

44
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,410
Right.

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
I've had it once.

46
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,589
Hey, this hotpot is really...

47
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,519
Bad.

48
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,589
Really bad.

49
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,660
Do you have instant noodles?

50
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:25,329
Instant noodles?

51
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,899
It's a must.

52
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,699
Gosh, I bought some.

53
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,009
Don't make me feel bad.

54
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
Sleep in here if you want.

55
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,959
Hey.

56
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,059
Sit here and hold it down.

57
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,970
Housewives sure are something.

58
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,240
Thank you for the compliment.

59
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,189
Did you know I liked your post?

60
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,129
My efforts weren't in vain.

61
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,360
Actually, I made it public on purpose for you to see.

62
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,069
I've edited every post...

63
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,740
over and over again.

64
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
I was careful with every word.

65
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,569
I kept thinking,

66
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,879
how would she feel when she read this?

67
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,009
Why do I feel so good all of a sudden?

68
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,649
So, you care about me too.

69
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,990
I almost added you as a friend.

70
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,749
You wanted to know how I'm doing with He Rui Zhi?

71
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,129
I also wanted to know...

72
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,440
if he had any regrets.

73
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,279
He's not easy to get.

74
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,720
He gave me a hard time.

75
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,590
He even said...

76
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,889
he'd never give up on you.

77
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,070
And that turned into...

78
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Ghost.

79
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,970
That's right.

80
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,179
My life has been haunted.

81
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,149
It turns out...

82
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,889
that winning isn't all that great.

83
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,830
Can I tell you...

84
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,429
a secret?

85
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,350
Please take care of them for me while I'm away.

86
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,519
- Okay. - I mean it.

87
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,950
If I make any mistakes, you have to tell me directly.

88
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,919
Don't worry. I won't tell Rui Zhi.

89
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,190
- Thank you. - This is Ben.

90
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,259
He just joined our company.

91
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,990
(Mrs. He calling)

92
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,090
- Hello. - Hello.

93
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,730
I've worked at Yonghua before.

94
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,759
- Yonghua? - You look familiar.

95
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,899
I have an important call.

96
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,769
- I had dinner with the manager. - I see.

97
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,200
Mrs. He, you mean,

98
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,139
you want me to move in with you?

99
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,769
Is that a good idea?

100
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,679
Hey, don't be silly.

101
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,679
He Rui Zhi is so soft-hearted.

102
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,980
He's going to Shanghai.

103
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,625
If you keep me company and take care of me,

104
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,909
he'll surely be moved by you.

105
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,049
Right?

106
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,149
Besides,

107
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,019
if Rabacca hears about the rumors,

108
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,220
they'll never get back together.

109
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,360
Right?

110
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,230
So, I didn't win.

111
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,029
Maybe He Rui Zhi...

112
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,529
still hasn't given up on you.

113
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,269
Can't you be more forgiving?

114
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,470
Please? I'm sorry.

115
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,669
You have to pause and observe at the intersection.

116
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,745
Yes, that's what I should've done.

117
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,769
You're so pretty.

118
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,909
Drive slowly.

119
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,110
Okay, thank you.

120
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,240
Thank you.

121
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,009
Officer, I'm sorry.

122
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,086
I made you come all the way here.

123
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,779
It's okay.

124
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,895
That's right. You're so pretty.

125
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,779
Drive carefully.

126
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,850
Okay, you too.

127
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,350
Thank you.

128
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,690
Get in.

129
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,479
Aren't you going to ask He Rui Zhi to contact the insurance company?

130
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:32,830
It's okay.

131
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,000
It's just a bumper.

132
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,100
I didn't even ask him for alimony.

133
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,610
You're the one who cheated.

134
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,809
How dare you ask for alimony?

135
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,789
Because I'm shameless.

136
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,210
I'm going to cling to him forever.

137
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
You're so lame.

138
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,590
Lame is better than stupid.

139
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,610
Hyun Bin is so handsome.

140
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:19,809
Yes.

141
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,649
Especially his dimples.

142
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,320
He's so handsome.

143
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,789
He's a good actor too.

144
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,990
Kim Woo-sung is so cool too.

145
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,559
It's "Jung" Woo-sung.

146
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,860
It's "Kim" Woo-sung.

147
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,379
Okay.

148
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,490
You won again.

149
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,629
What's the use?

150
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,870
This tastes better.

151
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,199
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

152
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,130
Sichuan Spicy Boiled Fish.

153
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,299
Okay.

154
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,269
I'll cast a net later.

155
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,960
Here. You'll feel better with this.

156
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,200
No! Go away!

157
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,629
Just try it, okay?

158
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,070
You'll feel better this way.

159
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,970
You just want to see me die, don't you?

160
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,009
Get lost!

161
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,299
The nearest hospital.

162
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,299
Let me try again.

163
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,259
The nearest hospital to Chenggong.

164
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:01,370
The nearest clinic to your current location...

165
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,370
is already closed.

166
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,809
The nearest hospital to Chenggong.

167
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:56,789
I was thinking,

168
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,669
how can I retire...

169
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:07,340
if I can't save up to 18 million dollars...

170
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,710
(Rebecca. Zhang, 18,000,000)

171
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,610
before I hit 50 years old?

172
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,559
It's good that things turned out this way.

173
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,320
I can stop worrying about it.

174
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,389
Then I'm doomed.

175
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,059
I'm not great at making a living,

176
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,100
but I have to go on living.

177
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:36,929
You lost again.

178
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,799
Yes.

179
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,820
Are you sad?

180
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:55,919
No?

181
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,250
Are you that tough?

182
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,629
Yes.

183
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,630
I was going home, but...

184
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,769
I really want to spend more time with my friend.

185
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,599
She is a very important friend.

186
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,140
All right.

187
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,740
Be good and listen to your dad.

188
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,339
Okay.

189
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,609
Love you.

190
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,079
Okay, bye.

191
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:30,049
You hang up first.

192
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,019
Go on.

193
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,759
Because I'm your mom.

194
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,160
Okay.

195
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,559
Let's hang up together.

196
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,170
One.

197
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,369
Two.

198
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,430
Three.

199
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,190
Third floor.

200
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,289
Doors opening.

201
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,259
How many hours has it been?

202
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,759
Your Jian Qing Fen drives so slowly.

203
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:10,829
Hey, you said that.

204
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,259
If I said that,

205
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,660
Jian Qing Fen would have said,

206
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,900
"So Rebecca is a better driver than me?"

207
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,000
Jeez.

208
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:17,839
Where's Bu Bu?

209
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,400
He Bu Bu, look who's home.

210
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,799
Mom!

211
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:21,769
My goodness.

212
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,539
I've missed you so much.

213
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:24,880
I've missed you too.

214
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,309
Come, say hi to my friend.

215
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,809
Ma'am.

216
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:31,150
It's lady.

217
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,079
Do you remember me?

218
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,119
You said not to give up what you deserve...

219
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,250
so easily to others.

220
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,160
I always say what I can't do.

221
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,595
Dinner will be ready in half an hour.

222
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,690
Bu Bu, come and help.

223
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,190
Hey, get some rest first.

224
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:47,829
He Rui Zhi.

225
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,099
You're sleeping...

226
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
What's wrong?

227
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,549
Are you not feeling well again?

228
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,250
I had a dream.

229
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,190
I dreamed that He Rui Zhi came to pick you up.

230
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,059
You don't want me to leave?

231
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,970
Or did He Rui Zhi keep you awake?

232
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,980
I couldn't put on any makeup in time.

233
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,680
Have you ever regretted it?

234
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,150
Regret what?

235
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,519
Giving up on He Rui Zhi.

236
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,730
If I did, would it make you feel great?

237
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,299
Maybe.

238
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,021
If you love He Rui Zhi so much, why did you cheat on him?

239
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,039
Because he doesn't love me.

240
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,210
You're so selfish.

241
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,410
You only care about your own feelings.

242
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,686
If you really love He Rui Zhi,

243
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,950
it doesn't matter if he loves you or not.

244
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,119
So you love yourself.

245
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,619
Aren't you the same?

246
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,390
If you really loved He Rui Zhi,

247
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,769
what's the big deal about being disliked by his mom for life?

248
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,529
I want him to be a filial son.

249
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,029
Gosh.

250
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,170
You just wanted to be that smile in his heart forever.

251
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,380
You made my eyeline crooked.

252
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,130
Which one?

253
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,429
I'd still leave him if I had a chance to choose again.

254
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,839
I'd still regret it.

255
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,950
It's for the best.

256
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,220
Otherwise, He Rui Zhi has just lost his mom,

257
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:37,190
and then he's going to lose the woman his mom hated.

258
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,799
Isn't that too unlucky?

259
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:50,839
When I'm gone,

260
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,159
I want you to do my makeup.

261
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,319
I don't want mortuary makeup.

262
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,480
It's too tacky.

263
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,720
I want it to be like yours.

264
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,200
What about your outfit?

265
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,005
I bought a lot of clothes,

266
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,200
but I never got to wear them.

267
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,339
I don't know which to choose.

268
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,039
Help me choose them.

269
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,309
Sure.

270
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,180
Give me the rest.

271
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,990
No way.

272
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,819
Burn them all for me.

273
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,009
I hate it the most...

274
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,910
when he thanks me.

275
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,220
I hate it the most when he says,

276
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:46,720
"There must be a way to solve it."

277
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,630
Because I heard you telling Mrs. He not to cry.

278
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,270
And that you'll spend a lot of time with her.

279
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,440
So I thought,

280
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,349
you can make life easier for him.

281
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,079
Maybe that's a kind of happiness too.

282
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,390
I said that deliberately for you to listen.

283
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,329
I'm terrible, right?

284
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,200
Being terrible is better than being stupid.

285
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,589
I must reincarnate as a terrible person.

286
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,609
This is my brother.

287
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,309
Hello, sir.

288
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,849
I thought your "close friend" was a man.

289
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,350
Thank you for keeping my sister company.

290
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,150
Don't mention it.

291
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,490
It's what I should do.

292
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,619
That's right.

293
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,690
She owes me.

294
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,859
Hey, do you want to stay for dinner?

295
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,529
I'd love to.

296
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,200
But before I get off work,

297
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,369
I have to rush back to Taipei to report to my boss.

298
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,769
I see, okay.

299
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,910
It's all because Yi Jing said you like to watch TV.

300
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,279
She kept nagging me.

301
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,509
That's why I slipped away from work.

302
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,950
And picked up something big.

303
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,119
Hey, Jian Qing Fen.

304
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,750
What?

305
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,690
Okay.

306
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,490
I forgot to tell you.

307
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,160
Thank you for lending me your mom.

308
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,799
Hello?

309
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,869
How is it? How are you?

310
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:51,609
She said to braise it until the sauce thickens up.

311
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,809
At least two hours.

312
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:01,849
It does taste like her cooking.

313
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:04,589
Really?

314
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,730
Twelve years weren't in vain.

315
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:29,880
Back then, I really wanted her to die soon.

316
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,950
I thought...

317
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:34,525
even if it was to pay off my debt,

318
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:35,920
it should be enough.

319
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,329
But now that she's really gone,

320
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,430
I don't know what else I can do,

321
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:53,339
what else I should do,

322
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,170
and what else I am to do.

323
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,809
I even...

324
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,910
I actually miss her a lot.

325
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,019
I often sat in her sickbed at home and spaced out.

326
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,119
All morning...

327
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,089
And all afternoon.

328
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,289
Look at the time.

329
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,660
Why aren't you picking up Bu Bu?

330
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,369
Jian Qing Fen, it's raining.

331
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,599
Oh, no.

332
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:42,819
Help me.

333
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,210
On the day of getting confirmation whether I had breast cancer,

334
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,500
I thought I was mentally prepared for it.

335
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,170
But the moment I heard the answer from the doctor,

336
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,039
it still felt like I was struck by lightning.

337
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,079
I just kept walking.

338
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:09,509
I kept walking.

339
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,049
I don't know when I got on the subway.

340
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,690
My mind was filled with all sorts of thoughts.

341
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,089
It was all over the place.

342
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,359
Then I started counting...

343
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,829
how many people had seen,

344
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,839
caressed, and kissed...

345
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,640
those breasts...

346
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,940
that I was about to lose.

347
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:43,750
There are only 12 of them.

348
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,589
That's so few.

349
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,089
I should've led...

350
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,119
a more promiscuous life to make it all worthwhile.

351
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:58,529
Thank you.

352
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,829
This is a priority seat.

353
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,769
Sir, it's okay.

354
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,839
Thank you.

355
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,410
Miss.

356
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,009
Can't you see she's holding a baby?

357
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:18,489
- Right. - Please give up your seat.

358
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,380
Please give up your seat.

359
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,019
It's okay.

360
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,959
Can't you tell that I have breast cancer?

361
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:43,640
(I have breast cancer.)

362
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,680
Can I now prove that I'm too weak to stand up?

363
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,569
(Contacts)

364
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,410
After that, I started texting those 12 people.

365
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,549
"Do you miss my breasts?"

366
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,950
"Are they pretty?"

367
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,650
Seriously?

368
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,619
Yes.

369
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:37,759
Did they reply?

370
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,599
Most of them were foreigners.

371
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,799
"Are you in Paris?"

372
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:48,839
"Let me meet those breasts that I've missed tonight."

373
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,210
Men.

374
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:55,180
Men.

375
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,049
Right.

376
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,619
I even received a special reply.

377
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,369
That's harsh.

378
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:19,269
Who is it?

379
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,509
The general manager's wife.

380
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:25,509
The general manager?

381
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:28,240
Our general manager?

382
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,480
Goodness.

383
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:33,779
That's ridiculous.

384
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
But...

385
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,589
But why did you write to his wife?

386
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,990
I'm a mean person but I'm not crazy.

387
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,430
His wife definitely went through his phone.

388
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,569
I see.

389
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
That's right.

390
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,339
The general manager.

391
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,809
Did you send it to...

392
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
Ask away.

393
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,950
Ask what?

394
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,960
Ask me what you're thinking right now.

395
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,309
Did you?

396
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,050
And we even met up.

397
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
So I don't actually have to feel bad, right?

398
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,570
Yes.

399
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,780
Good night.

400
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,679
I think I'll sleep well since I got my revenge.

401
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,360
I thought so too.

402
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,449
I thought you left?

403
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,269
You can only ease your mind after you see me dead.

404
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,699
Look at you now.

405
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,670
What have I got to worry about?

406
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,949
You said you have something to tell me.

407
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,626
I think you just want to know...

408
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,170
if you can get any dirt on He Rui Zhi!

409
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
That's right.

410
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:56,389
That way, after you die,

411
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:58,250
I can go on living my life happily.

412
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,389
Get lost!

413
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,260
Enough with your crocodile tears!

414
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:04,030
Hypocrisy doesn't torment anyone.

415
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,175
At least I didn't make anyone waste their lives...

416
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,260
blaming themselves.

417
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:10,546
Hey, just because you're dying,

418
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,900
does that mean we all deserve it?

419
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,000
No one has wronged you.

420
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,239
You're the one who gave up, okay?

421
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:17,809
That Yu Xiang Li.

422
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,769
He's a decent boy,

423
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,179
but you turned him into a wreck.

424
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,409
What?

425
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:22,949
Do you feel accomplished?

426
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,480
"A smile in your heart"?

427
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,650
You're just a devil!

428
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,480
Don't pity me!

429
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,519
That's not pity!

430
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,210
It's jealousy.

431
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:59,710
He has never looked at me the way he used to look at you.

432
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,050
How did he look at me?

433
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
With a bit of pain,

434
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,179
a bit of indulgence,

435
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,150
and a bit...

436
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:11,989
of admiration.

437
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:16,130
He just likes whatever you do.

438
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,389
Good, they're coming to save us.

439
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,460
Hey.

440
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,960
Aren't you smart?

441
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,429
Why would you live for others?

442
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,940
Do you love Yu Xiang Li?

443
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,980
How...

444
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,750
How do you know Yu Xiang Li?

445
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,550
We have the same birthday.

446
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,789
We're the two forever entangled particles.

447
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,550
Jun-suk is going to the airport.

448
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,690
Don't worry.

449
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,559
He'll make it in time.

450
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,320
They'll be together.

451
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,630
It'll be a happy ending.

452
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,940
Not the same birthday...

453
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
What did you say?

454
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,710
What?

455
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,320
My mom...

456
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,920
She didn't want to have me.

457
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,989
It took her a long time to register my birth.

458
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,429
I don't even know...

459
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,429
when my real birthday is.

460
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,269
Hey.

461
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,010
He said he wants to visit you.

462
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,420
I guess...

463
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,750
you'll say no.

464
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:02,760
You'd want him to remember you at your prettiest.

465
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,690
Is that right?

466
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,039
I knew it.

467
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,130
What's wrong?

468
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,199
What is it?

469
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,099
I think it's time to leave.

470
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,099
Leave?

471
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,239
Leave...

472
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,099
Where...

473
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,280
I really don't want to leave.

474
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
But...

475
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,590
My parents are here to pick me up.

476
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,219
I feel bad to keep them waiting.

477
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,429
What am I supposed to do without you?

478
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,510
Of course,

479
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:27,239
you should just...

480
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,650
laugh out loud happily.

481
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,239
(Rebecca. Zhang, Yesterday)

482
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,146
(Hi, I know you came over. And I know what that means...)

483
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,170
Hi.

484
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,809
I know you came over.

485
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,380
And I know what that means...

486
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,320
That's enough for me.

487
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:18,929
It's a promise.

488
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,469
I'll be the smile in your heart.

489
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,170
Not the tears.

490
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:31,909
(Okay.)

491
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,039
Yi Jing!

492
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,280
You can buy pretty clothes with these!

493
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,789
If you have enough money,

494
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,460
remember to buy one for me.

495
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,070
I heard...

496
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,300
that consciousness has decided the answers for us...

497
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,510
and the universe we exist in.

498
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,480
So is this your consciousness or mine?

499
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:15,320
Am I living in your universe...

500
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:18,226
- or have you died in my universe? - I'm here.

501
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,559
Don't be scared!

502
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,530
Unfortunately,

503
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,500
I'm still not smart enough.

504
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,559
So I don't have an answer.

505
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,940
But I know,

506
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,599
in another universe,

507
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:37,769
you...

508
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,280
must have gotten everything you deserve.

509
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
One.

510
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Thank you.

511
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,400
Two.

512
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,769
I'm so glad you're here.

513
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,139
It has finally become less frightening.

514
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,210
Three.

515
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,980
After rollerblading class,

516
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,179
I saw He Rui Zhi picking up Bu Bu.

517
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,079
He's a bit older,

518
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,219
but he seems more charming now.

519
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,119
Four.

520
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,590
I only got He Rui Zhi's reply...

521
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,989
two days after I texted him.

522
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:38,820
Do you want to know what happened next?

523
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,389
The answer is on my phone.

524
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
Five.

525
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:30,840
I should be the one...

526
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,170
to feel jealous.

527
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,780
(I love my wife a lot.)

528
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,050
You really are the smile in our hearts.

529
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:33,539
(Head of Family)

530
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,599
Hello?

531
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:39,340
I'm on my way back.

532
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,980
Wait for me.

533
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:01,300
(Head of Family)

534
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,460
Drive safely.

535
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:05,900
I suddenly realized,

536
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:08,570
"Drive safely,"

537
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,539
can actually sound so sweet.

538
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,800
It has been a bumpy ride.

539
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,269
But the scenery...

540
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,670
is wonderful.

541
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:10,000
(Keep going, the imperfect us.)
