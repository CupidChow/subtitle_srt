1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,440
Have you heard of it?

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,910
The whole universe...

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,750
isn't actually a single entity.

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:15,150
Everything we see,

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,989
touch, and hear...

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,230
are just fragments of our fluttering consciousness.

7
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,460
In other words,

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,460
all our love,

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,629
and hatred,

10
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,870
are like fragments in a kaleidoscope.

11
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:30,769
They keep bewitching us.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,445
Hey, where's your mom's key?

13
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:33,829
I have the key to Mrs. He's house.

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,170
You have the key? Hurry up then.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,640
So our story...

16
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:39,979
is actually...

17
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,820
an empty bubble.

18
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,450
Bu Bu.

19
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,519
It's time to wake up.

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,030
He Bu Bu.

21
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,620
She doesn't eat fish.

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,949
Hey, Mom.

23
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,180
What do you need?

24
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:26,449
- Water. - Water?

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Yes.

26
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,090
Okay.

27
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,490
I'll do it.

28
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,210
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,680
I didn't want to wake you up, so...

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,689
Hey, I brought you a clean shirt.

31
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Here.

32
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,599
Thank you.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
I'll keep Mom company tonight.

34
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,840
There's no need.

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
She's my mom.

36
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,039
It's okay.

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,240
It's just a flutter of consciousness.

38
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,150
Good morning.

39
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
It's okay.

40
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,680
These are just conditioned dharmas.

41
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,750
Just empty bubbles.

42
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
He Rui Zhi!

43
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,550
Hey, He Rui Zhi!

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's okay.

45
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,870
The unseasoned fried egg...

46
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,409
is just another illusion.

47
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,819
I'm sorry, but you can't eat on the bus.

48
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,529
How could you make such a stupid mistake?

49
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:16,959
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,989
Is your mother-in-law the only one who gets sick?

51
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,230
I have parents and children too.

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,406
- This is all non-existent. - Who doesn't slave away?

53
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,670
- They're just... - I have to carry your sales quota.

54
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,180
- fragments of consciousness. - I have to clean up your mess.

55
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,310
I won't do it again.

56
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,069
Listen up.

57
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,910
- Work harder. - Yes.

58
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,680
Don't just clock in and wait to clock out.

59
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,649
Gosh.

60
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
Hello?

61
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,360
"There are many rumors about your mental state."

62
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,160
"Do you have anything to explain?"

63
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,459
Is this question on the outline?

64
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,259
What is your reporter doing?

65
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,230
Yes.

66
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,699
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,300
Okay, bye.

68
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,240
During the phone interview,

69
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,230
I should have been there to keep an eye on them.

70
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,750
Goodness.

71
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,889
Take care of your cold first, okay?

72
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,459
Gosh.

73
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,490
What are you going to do...

74
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,480
without Una at the opening day press conference?

75
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,060
Christine lost sponsorship too.

76
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,329
Well...

77
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,470
Well...

78
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,709
Hey, I heard that He Rui Zhi got promoted.

79
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,480
Do you want to make a call for me?

80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Be careful.

81
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,699
Rui Zhi, your mom must have slipped in the bathroom.

82
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,476
I listened to the sounds from my back porch for a while.

83
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,769
Wait, your house key.

84
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:35,569
Be careful.

85
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,129
(Rui)

86
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,110
(Answer your phone. I'm downstairs.)

87
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,590
You've never been disliked, have you?

88
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,629
So you don't know how it feels to be disliked, right?

89
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,980
When He Rui Zhi was five years old,

90
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,509
I became a widow.

91
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:58,920
I don't know how to do anything.

92
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,860
So I can only take care of other people's kids.

93
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:04,860
You're her son.

94
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,820
She'll forgive you sooner or later.

95
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,430
But she'll hate me forever.

96
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,769
And then?

97
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,000
After you moved out,

98
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,670
he didn't say a word to me.

99
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,279
He was such a good son.

100
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,939
How did he end up like this?

101
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,910
Mrs. He, you still have me.

102
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,950
I just don't like sweet-talking.

103
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,490
I don't like sucking up to people.

104
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,519
That's just who I am.

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,529
So why, from childhood to adulthood...

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
From my home...

107
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,139
to the schools,

108
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,210
and the office,

109
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,539
why do I have to be hated?

110
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,080
It's so annoying to be hated.

111
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,149
Do you know that?

112
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,789
How could he do this to me?

113
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,720
I'll come here often to keep you company.

114
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,600
How could he do this to me?

115
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,259
So don't be selfish.

116
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,830
Okay?

117
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,889
(5:30pm, All right.)

118
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,279
(How is your mom?)

119
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,860
(How is your mom?)

120
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,919
Hey, bad woman.

121
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,350
I've created a framework. Do you want to take a look?

122
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,169
You're here to save me, right?

123
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What?

124
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,610
(How is your mom?)

125
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:38,779
Thank you.

126
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,279
You're welcome.

127
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,549
Why are you so polite today?

128
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,519
Because you look handsome today.

129
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:02,799
This is the map of the market.

130
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,870
And then...

131
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:05,946
There are many zones you can choose from.

132
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,269
Let's say we're choosing Zone D.

133
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,539
Click on it.

134
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,269
Then you'll see the stalls in Zone D.

135
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,409
And then,

136
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,210
if you click...

137
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,879
on this,

138
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,879
you can see the vendors.

139
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,019
- And if you want... - You're trembling?

140
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,120
No, I'm not.

141
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,129
Yes, you are.

142
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,269
I can't sleep because of you.

143
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,399
Hey, Guan Liang, who is Huo Yi Jian?

144
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,840
Why can't you sleep?

145
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,399
I don't know.

146
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,139
His movie was nominated for a Golden Globe.

147
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,070
I was working on this.

148
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:42,169
Take a look.

149
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,580
Rebecca definitely knows a veteran actor.

150
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,785
But you really don't look like you slept well.

151
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,240
- Rebecca. - What?

152
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,850
Do you know Huo Yi Jian?

153
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,450
Huo Yi Jian?

154
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,250
I know him.

155
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,919
He used to be very famous.

156
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,320
But something happened, so he...

157
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,220
His movie was nominated for a Golden Globe.

158
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,559
That's amazing.

159
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Where is she going?

160
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,250
I know it's a bit late to talk about collaboration.

161
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,750
He's so busy now.

162
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,720
He's already scheduled for next year.

163
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:32,559
I know, but...

164
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,360
I know you guys are busy.

165
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,029
But can you take a look at the proposal first?

166
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,000
Then... We did collaborate once.

167
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,875
You're always leeching us off at the last minute.

168
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:40,629
We really can't make it.

169
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,230
No. You misunderstood, Ms. Jiao.

170
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,570
That's not what we meant.

171
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,700
It's really impossible.

172
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,216
He's playing an undercover cop this time.

173
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,710
He's in every scene.

174
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:48,610
His entire schedule is packed.

175
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,639
How can he make time?

176
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,840
It's really impossible.

177
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,110
Okay? Thank you.

178
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,379
Bye.

179
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,289
As a result,

180
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,960
I accidentally added an extra zero.

181
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,799
I'm so sorry. I'm getting old.

182
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,269
I've brought these donuts to apologize for that.

183
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,340
And...

184
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:25,309
I've circled the blank spaces that require your signature.

185
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:26,480
Thank you.

186
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,710
I think I'd better read it from start to finish.

187
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,459
So I don't have to make another trip here.

188
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,889
Yes.

189
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,950
Hello?

190
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,490
I'm at the school gate.

191
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,559
Where are you?

192
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:41,389
What?

193
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,259
Okay.

194
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,399
So I called Dad.

195
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,940
Didn't I tell you he's busy lately?

196
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,210
Don't bother him.

197
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,279
The teacher told me to call him.

198
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,309
She said I have a fever.

199
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,259
I'll make you a hot drink for your cold.

200
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,129
Drink it and go to bed.

201
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,365
Do your homework in the morning.

202
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,059
I don't want it.

203
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,830
It tastes awful.

204
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,669
It's just vitamin C.

205
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,269
It's sweet and sour.

206
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Dad.

207
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,570
Are you going to keep Grandma company again?

208
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,250
Take good care of yourself.

209
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,149
Don't make me worry.

210
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,419
I know.

211
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,580
Hey. Have you eaten?

212
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,720
I'll make two dishes in no time.

213
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:47,659
Would you like...

214
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,960
He Rui Zhi!

215
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,229
I'll take good care of myself.

216
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,370
Please take better care of Bu Bu.

217
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,299
Doors opening.

218
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,240
Going down.

219
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,210
Doors closing.

220
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,250
Hi.

221
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:09,179
Hi.

222
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,379
It's her annual leave.

223
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,720
- I see. - Let's go upstairs.

224
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,820
Did I keep you waiting?

225
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,419
Not really.

226
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,269
It's so heavy.

227
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,610
(Sorry, she's too tired. I'll treat you to a meal in Taipei.)

228
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,919
800 dollars.

229
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,090
Yes or no?

230
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,059
Okay or not?

231
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,100
You want more?

232
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,809
I'm only worth 800 dollars?

233
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,919
Do you...

234
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,759
think I'm only worth 800 dollars?

235
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,330
You...

236
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,000
What makes you think I'm only worth 800 dollars?

237
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,200
Who do you think you are?

238
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,470
What gives you the right to behave like this?

239
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,680
Why do you think this is all my fault?

240
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,150
What did I do wrong?

241
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,720
Didn't you buy the house?

242
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,495
If you didn't want to move out then,

243
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,920
why did you buy the house?

244
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,335
I'm very tired now. I don't want to talk...

245
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,640
What if you had married Zhang Yi Jing in the first place?

246
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,549
Why?

247
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,579
Well...

248
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,849
I want to take a break.

249
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,660
All right.

250
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,730
Rebecca is resigning as well.

251
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,900
That's what I'm most worried about.

252
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,269
I worked so hard to train her.

253
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,910
And she's finally doing so well.

254
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,009
We can't afford to lose you either.

255
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,480
You should keep Rebecca.

256
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,119
She said the same thing.

257
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,420
It sounds like you're both sorry.

258
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,289
She said she's going to wander around.

259
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,400
I understand that she wants to leave the place...

260
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,710
that upsets her at such a time.

261
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,830
Do you want to give it a try?

262
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,650
I'm thinking of expanding my business in Shanghai.

263
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,720
Think about it and let me know.

264
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:24,200
I got married when I was 28 years old.

265
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,769
My wife was my best friend.

266
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,839
But we fight all the time now.

267
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,650
Maybe one day, you'll be grateful for this regret.

268
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:52,700
Cough medicine...

269
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,130
and Seirogan.

270
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,430
It's good for bloating and diarrhea.

271
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,400
Here.

272
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,069
Don't confuse this with the camellia oil pills.

273
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:02,940
I can't fit them in.

274
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,279
These are so small, why won't they fit in?

275
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:08,680
Leave this to me. Go and get the door.

276
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,849
Why can't you fit these in?

277
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,410
Hey, you haven't set out to the airport yet?

278
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,220
Is it Qing Fen?

279
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,029
Yes, Mrs. He.

280
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,259
My goodness.

281
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,400
Qing Fen is so sweet.

282
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
She insisted on moving in with me.

283
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,700
That way, Mr. He can focus on his work.

284
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:32,640
I've tidied up the room upstairs that's next to Rui Zhi's.

285
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,640
It's as if no matter what,

286
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:36,809
it is all my fault.

287
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,410
It's my fault...

288
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,150
that you're unhappy.

289
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,750
It's also my fault...

290
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,789
that Qing Fen is unhappy.

291
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,759
And Zhang Yi Jing...

292
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,240
Do you know that she's the one...

293
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
who saved your life?

294
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,660
I've done everything...

295
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:27,960
you wanted me to do.

296
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,329
What else should I do?

297
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,799
What more do you want from me?

298
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,569
What more can I do?

299
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,779
Tell me, okay?

300
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,049
Just tell me, okay?

301
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,970
Why do you look so glum?

302
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,279
I've accomplished nothing today.

303
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,710
I couldn't get an endorsement deal.

304
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,680
I couldn't get a sponsor.

305
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,480
I couldn't find a house.

306
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,089
There's still tomorrow.

307
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,690
I still won't learn how to sweet-talk by tomorrow.

308
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,730
"Congratulations."

309
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:16,970
"Please?"

310
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,440
"Do me a favor."

311
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,069
I know those phrases.

312
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
But...

313
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,940
But I'm so tired.

314
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,480
I can't adapt to this society.

315
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,150
I really want to retire now.

316
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,559
Hang in there.

317
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,930
When you're done with work,

318
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,850
why don't I take you cycling around Taiwan?

319
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,670
Isn't that more exhausting?

320
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,900
Just take your girlfriend.

321
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
That's right.

322
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:58,180
I forgot to ask how things are going between you and her.

323
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,839
Zero progress.

324
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,220
Too busy?

325
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,759
Maybe I don't like her as much.

326
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,190
You men are all like that.

327
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,559
Like what?

328
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,730
Impatient.

329
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,970
Fickle.

330
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,500
Anyone easy will do.

331
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,839
That's sexist.

332
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,869
It's not discrimination.

333
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,839
It's how I can pretend I didn't lose.

334
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:37,910
So you lost?

335
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,980
Hey.

336
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,450
Yes?

337
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,420
Have you ever been an "easy catch"?

338
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:45,819
Never.

339
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,019
Even if we're not together,

340
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,289
I want to be the teardrop in his heart.

341
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,930
But...

342
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,799
What?

343
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,670
I'm old.

344
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,210
I've lost ambition.

345
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,740
I can't be proud of myself.

346
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,650
And I'm a bad woman.

347
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,850
So I don't think I'm good enough anymore.

348
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:39,740
Thanks.

349
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,710
Drive safely.

350
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,089
Hey.

351
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,039
It's nothing.

352
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,250
Go home and work all night.

353
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,119
Good night.

354
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,170
I think you're great.

355
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,480
You're not old at all.

356
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:54,950
And you have every right to be proud.

357
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,890
You're not a bad woman.

358
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
You...

359
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:20,980
(A true smile deep in the heart suits you better.)

360
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,009
(Huo Yi Jian Calling)

361
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Hi.

362
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,019
It has been a long time.

363
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,390
It's okay.

364
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,500
I know you've been busy with your movies lately.

365
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,839
I should be the one to feel bad.

366
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:27,180
So if we can adjust the schedule a bit,

367
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,280
he can endorse this event.

368
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,549
Really?

369
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,779
How is adjusting the schedule an issue?

370
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,150
- Right? - Wait, there's more.

371
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,619
Let me finish.

372
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,920
He just signed up for an endorsement.

373
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,589
It's a brand of pearl accessories.

374
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,259
It fits our theme perfectly.

375
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,160
So the souvenirs for this press conference...

376
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,759
Oh, my gosh.

377
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,559
Rebecca, I love you.

378
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,799
Rebecca, I love you too.

379
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,029
We all love you.

380
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,099
We love you so much.

381
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,000
Anyway, thank you so much.

382
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:54,769
You're so popular now.

383
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,369
I was afraid you'd think I was leeching you off.

384
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,609
But I really don't want to trouble you.

385
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,710
Why are you still so girlish?

386
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,426
I'm too old to be girlish. Isn't it more like immature?

387
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,950
You're very sincere.

388
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,450
Thank you.

389
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,339
Thank you for giving me a chance.

390
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,390
Thank you.

391
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:16,230
Why are you thanking me?

392
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,630
When I had that incident,

393
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,170
I heard your company didn't terminate my contract...

394
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,539
because of you.

395
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,970
Who told you that?

396
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,509
Once, at a friend's party,

397
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:34,680
I met someone from your previous company.

398
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,809
I think her name was...

399
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,210
Christine.

400
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,220
Christine?

401
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,279
Yes.

402
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,059
Thank you.

403
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,490
That helping hand meant a lot.

404
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,029
It really was.

405
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,599
It mattered a lot to me.

406
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,109
Thank you.

407
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,480
(That smile in his heart... I really love this role.)

408
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,789
(Rebecca. Zhang)

409
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:19,559
(That smile in his heart... I really love this role.)

410
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,069
(Is that He Rui Zhi?)

411
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,300
(Head of Family: I'm sorry.)

412
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:53,519
(I'm just venting at you out of my own guilt.)

413
00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:00,359
(Thanks for scolding me, for bringing me to my senses.)

414
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,835
There were so many press conferences today.

415
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:28,936
I rushed here for Huo Yi Jian.

416
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,730
I didn't even eat.

417
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:31,436
I know you were in a hurry. There are snacks inside.

418
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,035
- That's nice. - There's a gift in the bag.

419
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,029
These pearl necklaces are popular among men now.

420
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,976
How well funded is this film festival?

421
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,069
Every reporter gets one.

422
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,290
It's endorsed by Huo Yi Jian.

423
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,299
It seems nice.

424
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:42,210
Excuse me, everyone.

425
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,940
The press conference is about to start.

426
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:45,170
Why don't you chat inside?

427
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,555
It's almost time. The press conference is starting.

428
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,880
Hey, Rebecca.

429
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,985
- I was looking for you. - What's wrong?

430
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:50,779
My boss wants to watch Una's film too.

431
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:52,450
But I don't want to give him my ticket.

432
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,349
It's already sold out.

433
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,650
I know.

434
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,549
Please?

435
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,325
- Okay, I'll think of something. - Thank you.

436
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,160
Can you get two tickets?

437
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,890
Yes.

438
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,859
Go in or you'll be late.

439
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,059
I forgot to tell you.

440
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,490
Nice dress.

441
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,500
Excuse me, everyone.

442
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,676
The press conference is about to start.

443
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,130
Please enter this way.

444
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,269
Thank you. You can come this way.

445
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,069
Ladies and gentlemen, you can come in now.

446
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,069
Hello.

447
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,569
- This way. - Everyone.

448
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,640
Who should we thank right now?

449
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:20,210
- Thank you, Rebecca! - Thank you, Rebecca!

450
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,609
Cheers, bottoms up!

451
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,250
Who drinks champagne in one shot?

452
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,509
I don't care. Cheers.

453
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:25,519
All right.

454
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,119
I'd like to thank Rebecca too.

455
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,119
The Rebecca from 12 years ago.

456
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Because she made a decision that she can't regret.

457
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:39,329
So I think...

458
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,630
I hate her more...

459
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,740
than anyone who hates her.

460
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,730
Hey. Are you okay?

461
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,839
I'm fine.

462
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,869
I've never been better.

463
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,779
I'm very...

464
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,980
Very...

465
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,140
Very good.

466
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:30,109
You're drunk.

467
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,779
Yes, right.

468
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:34,880
I'm drunk.

469
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,289
That's why I'm so happy.

470
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,359
What?

471
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,230
Where are you going?

472
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,930
Hey, miss.

473
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,339
Do you speak Italian?

474
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,640
Do you understand Italian?

475
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:55,910
Where are you from?

476
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,869
Are you traveling or studying?

477
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,039
I can take you around...

478
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:01,949
Do you know where I can get oyster vermicelli?

479
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,549
What?

480
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,950
What?

481
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:08,989
I'm craving oyster vermicelli.

482
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,159
Did I say anything wrong?

483
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,400
I'm so sorry.

484
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:31,969
It's no problem. It's okay.

485
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,380
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

486
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,909
It's an old shirt anyway.

487
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,780
It's okay.

488
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:39,019
Let me buy you a drink.

489
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,849
It'll be fine.

490
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,730
I love you, Rebecca.

491
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,329
But I don't love you.

492
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,476
Yes, my love for you will never change.

493
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,800
It's easier to hate someone than to love them.

494
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:19,219
(Christine: I heard He Rui Zhi is living with Jian Qing Fen?)

495
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:22,019
(Winnie: Christine, you've sent it to the wrong group.)

496
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,030
- Bye. - Good night.

497
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Rebecca?

498
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:48,849
Rebecca!

499
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,059
It's really you.

500
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,260
What are you doing here?

501
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,739
Just when you're about to fall into a dark hole,

502
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,869
- the hand that reaches out... - Hey.

503
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,390
Is from the person that you least expected.

504
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
What happened?

505
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,679
What's wrong?

506
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,650
What is the cause?

507
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,949
What is the effect?

508
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,949
It's really hard to say.

509
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
What?

510
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,530
What did you just say?

511
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,559
Did I say something?

512
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,860
Rebecca.

513
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:37,530
Can I order steamed king prawns with minced garlic?

514
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,599
No.

515
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,269
I'm treating you to dinner.

516
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,039
Why can't he order that?

517
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,139
- That's right. - It's 800 dollars per prawn.

518
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,586
Have you forgotten you're preparing for retirement?

519
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,210
Don't worry. She's Rebecca.

520
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,610
She'll be marrying a billionaire.

521
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,619
So, we'll get one each?

522
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,750
I don't want one.

523
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,679
Three then.

524
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,719
Yes.

525
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,250
You can have mine.

526
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,619
Excuse me, we'd like to order.

527
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,770
How can you save up to 10 million dollars like this?

528
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,599
Because I've thought it through.

529
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,570
Paying rent is paying someone else's mortgage.

530
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,769
So why can't I just pay for it myself?

531
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,429
So I've decided to buy a house.

532
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,199
It doesn't matter if it's small.

533
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:48,469
At least I won't be homeless.

534
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,809
Then I'll buy a pension plan for myself.

535
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,885
I'll keep working hard until my fifties or sixties.

536
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,309
I can retire when I'm 60 years old.

537
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,280
What about dating?

538
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,260
Aren't you going to date anyone?

539
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,079
Sure, why not?

540
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,020
I will if I meet the right guy.

541
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,489
If we get along well,

542
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,889
and we keep each other company,

543
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,590
he can even pay half of my mortgage.

544
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:12,030
Preferably younger than you.

545
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,670
That way, when you're old,

546
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,130
he can help flip you around in bed.

547
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,780
Are you volunteering?

548
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Hey.

549
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,409
Am I not a good choice?

550
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,166
Don't you know that many love tragedies...

551
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,820
start with two "easy catches" cuddling out of sympathy?

552
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,789
The "hard to catch" has it just as bad, okay?

553
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:43,889
How can you feel proud...

554
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,760
to introduce me...

555
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:47,159
as your girlfriend if I get all wrinkly in my fifties?

556
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,900
Can't you get Botox or something?

557
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,239
What if a young and pretty girl steals you from me?

558
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,269
Wouldn't I be miserable?

559
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:56,539
You have a house and pension plan.

560
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,039
You're lucky that you even get...

561
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,110
to date someone as well.

562
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,610
You've convinced me.

563
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:06,880
Do you want to date me?

564
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,019
Sure.

565
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,750
Let's do it after I get my pension plan.

566
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,860
So you're getting ready?

567
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,960
When you get the pension plan,

568
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,030
we're all set?

569
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Hurry up and go home.

570
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,070
Bye.

571
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,250
(When are you getting the pension plan?)

572
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,550
Why are you still here?

573
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:22,159
(When are you getting the pension plan?)

574
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:22,929
(It's not that easy, okay?)

575
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:24,549
(I have to get a health checkup first.)

576
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:36,739
(Go do it tomorrow.)

577
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,239
(Or in two days.)

578
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:51,650
(The latest in three days.)

579
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,570
(Wait until I'm not busy.)

580
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,449
(Are you serious?)

581
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,519
Yes.

582
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:58,349
No way.

583
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:24,579
(Kanglin Institutional Nursing)

584
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,230
Take me...

585
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,570
You have to take me...

586
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,409
home.

587
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,019
Don't do this.

588
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,159
Please?

589
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,230
Don't.

590
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Please...

591
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,670
Take me home.

592
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,980
Tickets, this way, please.

593
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,610
What movie would you like to see?

594
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,550
Is there a comedy that's about to start?

595
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,159
Hey, Ya Qing, over here.

596
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:41,695
Wait for me. I need to use the bathroom.

597
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,719
Okay.

598
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,170
Hey, my boss is so happy.

599
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,405
He wants to make something special for...

600
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:53,739
I'm sorry.

601
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,670
I mistook you for someone else.

602
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:55,400
Because...

603
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,940
Because you have the same dress.

604
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,139
I'm sorry.

605
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:35,940
Are you okay?

606
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:36,949
Hey, do you have any tissues?

607
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,010
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,079
I'm really sorry.

609
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:39,820
Are you okay?

610
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,240
Let me wipe it for you. I'm sorry.

611
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,380
I'm sorry.

612
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:43,449
I'm sorry.

613
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:45,219
I'm sorry.

614
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:56,829
I'll do it.

615
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,170
I've had Mother discharged.

616
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,469
You had Mom discharged?

617
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,679
- When did we say... - I quit my job.

618
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,956
Because of the flutters of my consciousness,

619
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,809
I became He Rui Zhi's wife.

620
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,349
I became a dutiful daughter-in-law.

621
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,449
But I have a question.

622
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:18,920
Who can answer me?

623
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,860
In He Rui Zhi's consciousness,

624
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
am I,

625
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,829
Jian Qing Fen,

626
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,199
his destiny,

627
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
or...

628
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,130
love?

629
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:34,369
Mother.

630
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:35,699
Let's go home.

631
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,449
Thank you.
