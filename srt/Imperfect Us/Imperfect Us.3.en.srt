1
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,209
Hey.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,419
What's your next goal?

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,919
To reach that goal,

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,289
how much pain do you have to go through?

5
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,289
Have you calculated that?

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,100
So...

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,170
Is it possible that we misunderstood ourselves?

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,539
We think we're chasing happiness.

9
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:35,770
But actually,

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,509
what we really love might be the pain.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,979
- Thank you. - Thank you.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,820
Schrödinger.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,250
Is it a person?

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,079
(Schrodinger's Cat)

15
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,390
A scientist.

16
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,890
Is his cat famous?

17
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,359
It was an experiment.

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,929
What kind of experiment?

19
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,569
I've read about it, but I can't remember.

20
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,270
I think it's an experiment on quantum mechanics.

21
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,100
Didn't I say...

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,569
if you want to know something...

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,299
Look it up yourself.

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,370
Yes.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,609
In another universe,

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,939
cats are alive.

27
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,109
But what determines the universe we exist in?

28
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,180
Someone suggested it could be our consciousness.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Do you get it now?

30
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,719
So is Schrödinger's cat dead or not?

31
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:25,489
Why did they experiment on cats?

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,859
Don't worry.

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,730
This is just a hypothetical experiment.

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,829
So none of the cats died.

35
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:34,945
You can go brush your teeth, wash your face, and go to bed.

36
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,069
Okay?

37
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,129
All right.

38
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,870
What are you doing?

39
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,280
Look it up yourself if you want to know.

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,780
(Schrodinger's Cat)

41
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,049
Look it up myself?

42
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,260
Jian Qing Fen.

43
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,459
You're really sick.

44
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,039
Is it broken?

45
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,840
- I don't know. - Let me.

46
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,379
Thank you.

47
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,219
Restructuring?

48
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,020
Yes.

49
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,566
I heard that after the US company comes in,

50
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,960
there would be personnel cuts.

51
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,460
There will be big changes in management too.

52
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,330
The vice president might have to retire.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,069
Really?

54
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,740
So just in case,

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,909
it's best to spread the word online.

56
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:22,969
Sure.

57
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,439
No problem.

58
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,310
Yes.

59
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,580
Hey, have you noticed...

60
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,156
that Christine has been acting like she's got it in the bag lately?

61
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,349
It's on me.

62
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,419
How annoying.

63
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,719
Yes, that place is hard to book.

64
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,560
Ed was so upset.

65
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,260
He went to talk to the general manager...

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,729
and Christine found out about it.

67
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,635
I think if Christine really were to become the new vice president,

68
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,960
Ed wouldn't be able to stay.

69
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,030
Midlife career change can't be easy.

70
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,579
Especially in this economic downturn.

71
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:57,509
Did you go to work or shopping?

72
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,080
Don't you work to make money?

73
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,310
We make money so we can spend it.

74
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,419
Hey, what do you think?

75
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,060
Don't I look like someone?

76
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
Who?

77
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,470
Grandma Xu.

78
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,110
It's slippery here.

79
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,620
Dad, wait.

80
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,689
I saw a cool bug.

81
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,639
You can't smoke here.

82
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,250
Dad.

83
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,850
Do you have something on your mind?

84
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,589
Me?

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,620
No.

86
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:18,689
I see.

87
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,189
Why do you ask like that?

88
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,699
Because Mom said she only smokes when she has something on her mind.

89
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,959
Dad, I found it.

90
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,269
Dad, come and look at this.

91
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
It's so cool.

92
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,879
Siva stag beetle.

93
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,139
It's a common insect in low-altitude Taiwan.

94
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,579
We're home.

95
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,490
There's fried chicken.

96
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,420
Bu Bu, wash your hands first.

97
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,490
Okay.

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,470
I've washed my hands.

99
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,810
I'm going to eat fried chicken.

100
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,870
Okay.

101
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,660
Is this how you slice scallions?

102
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,519
How long have you been a mom?

103
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:28,109
You can't even slice scallions nicely.

104
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,360
Didn't you say they all taste the same?

105
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,899
When did I say that?

106
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,230
Appearance, aroma, and taste.

107
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,769
Appearance comes first.

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,310
Familiarity breeds contempt.

109
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,939
You'll always find fault with what you have.

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,750
What? What do you mean by that?

111
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,949
I don't understand.

112
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,819
I mean...

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,189
I'd better get out.

114
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,920
I don't want to cause you trouble.

115
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,329
You're right.

116
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,899
It's better to be dumb.

117
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,339
Me? I'm too smart.

118
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:18,009
Are you itching to pick a fight lately?

119
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:21,550
Mom.

120
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,810
What are you making?

121
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,819
Tomato scrambled eggs.

122
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,879
It's Bu Bu's favorite.

123
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,660
Go for it.

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,589
If you win 10 million, I'll take you on a world tour.

125
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,230
Do I need 10 million to go?

126
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,459
Traveling around the world is expensive, okay?

127
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:42,730
And you need to save up for your tuition.

128
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,300
I'll take you for five million.

129
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,839
Be more ambitious, okay?

130
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,509
Let me tell you.

131
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,310
Our consciousness determines our universe.

132
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,819
At 400 meters,

133
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,220
turn right.

134
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,230
Gosh. It has been 10 days.

135
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,610
Nothing.

136
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,779
(Rebecca. Zhang)

137
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,709
Your sister-in-law is so knowledgeable.

138
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:33,220
She even knows about such an out-of-this-world restaurant.

139
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,259
That way, her taste will stand out.

140
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:42,929
Turn right.

141
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,905
Bu Bu, stop playing the games.

142
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,129
You'll ruin your eyes.

143
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,070
- I have 11 left. - It's your turn.

144
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,899
It looks like it will continue to drop.

145
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,440
How much did you lose?

146
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,539
How could I lose?

147
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,980
I have your sister-in-law.

148
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,379
How could I lose money?

149
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,340
I've already sold it.

150
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,409
It's a small profit.

151
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,710
It's a small profit this time.

152
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,889
But there are lots of delisted stocks at home.

153
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,789
I'm going to the restroom.

154
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
Mom, I'll go with you.

155
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,929
It's okay.

156
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,529
I'll go with Mom and take a smoke break.

157
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,639
Your new hairstyle is really nice.

158
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,409
Hey, this restaurant is really nice.

159
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,950
I only get to enjoy good food...

160
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,720
when you treat us to lunch.

161
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,039
It must be expensive, right?

162
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,190
We're a family.

163
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:47,730
What's wrong with a good meal?

164
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,669
I read all the texts you sent to your brother.

165
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,139
He was going to call you back.

166
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,240
But I think it's better...

167
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,440
to talk about this in person.

168
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,179
We don't want to take the blame again.

169
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,480
Come on. Don't say that.

170
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:13,990
You make it sound so serious.

171
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,149
Because I feel really hurt.

172
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,059
Attie records...

173
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,489
Mother's blood pressure twice in the mornings and evenings.

174
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,370
Your brother and I...

175
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,605
followed the doctor's instructions to take care of Mother.

176
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,899
We watched her take her medicine and meals.

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
As long as it doesn't rain,

178
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,669
Attie would take Mother for a walk in the park.

179
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:38,240
Mother's blood pressure has never exceeded 170.

180
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,049
I thought your brother and I could discuss it ourselves.

181
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,620
But you misunderstood.

182
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,990
What's abnormal is Mother's memory.

183
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,429
What do you mean?

184
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,629
Last week,

185
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,429
she looked at your brother and called your dad's name.

186
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,269
And the week before that,

187
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,240
she said, Attie stole her bracelet.

188
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,809
That bracelet,

189
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,559
didn't she give it to you a long time ago?

190
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:14,850
I just felt something was wrong.

191
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,020
I forced your brother to take Mother to the doctor on Monday.

192
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
The doctor said...

193
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:21,850
she has early-stage dementia.

194
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,739
Shouldn't she see a few more doctors?

195
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,190
We can't rely on one diagnosis.

196
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:29,029
I will.

197
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,129
If you're worried,

198
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,910
you can take Mother to the doctor yourself.

199
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,629
What I'm trying to say is,

200
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,230
what if she really has dementia?

201
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,870
I've discussed it with your brother.

202
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,039
We think the best way...

203
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,909
is to send Mother...

204
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,940
to a professional nursing home.

205
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,480
How can we send her to a place like that?

206
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,950
I knew you'd react this way.

207
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:58,159
But you know your brother.

208
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,559
Your brother may be unambitious,

209
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,629
but he's not an unfilial son.

210
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:04,629
I'm so busy with work.

211
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,005
But I'm married into your family,

212
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,200
so I regard Mother as my responsibility.

213
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,970
However, being filial...

214
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,309
isn't enough to handle a dementia patient.

215
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,409
She needs someone to watch her and take care of her 24 hours a day.

216
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,509
We do have a helper,

217
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,120
but you can't force her to work 24 hours a day.

218
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,289
If something goes wrong,

219
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,630
I can't handle the consequences.

220
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,490
The best solution...

221
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,360
is to send Mother...

222
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:37,706
to a professional care facility.

223
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,600
- I... - I can pay for that.

224
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,659
I disagree.

225
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,570
Or I'll leave Mother with you.

226
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,210
- No, this... - Qing Fen.

227
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,610
Qing Fen.

228
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,590
Look.

229
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,490
The rooms are all the same.

230
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,220
How can I find you?

231
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:09,490
Jian Qing Hui went for a smoke again.

232
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,529
I don't see the servers either.

233
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Mom.

234
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,429
What's my phone number?

235
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,370
Look.

236
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,639
It's really beautiful here.

237
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,870
Do you hear me?

238
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,610
My cell phone. What's the number?

239
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,309
Your...

240
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,409
Your cell phone number?

241
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Yes.

242
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,340
Cell phone number...

243
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,279
I...

244
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,750
I saved it on my phone.

245
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,419
What about my landline?

246
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,519
Your...

247
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,950
landline?

248
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,659
It's saved on my phone too.

249
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,460
My birthday.

250
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,730
- Your birthday? - Mom.

251
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,059
Is Mother okay?

252
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,669
Your birthday...

253
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,769
Don't be so negative.

254
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,610
Just get a checkup first.

255
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:55,785
If her condition is confirmed,

256
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,929
she can take medicine to slow down the deterioration.

257
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,115
If your mom's condition is still bad by then,

258
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,409
we'll talk, okay?

259
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,450
What's wrong with Grandma?

260
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,850
I won't let my mom go to a nursing home.

261
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,889
Okay then.

262
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,620
We'll bring your mom back.

263
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:12,696
Who will take care of her?

264
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,820
Me.

265
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:14,730
And you.

266
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,460
Why don't we get a helper?

267
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,759
Do you think our home can fit a helper and my mom?

268
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,759
I think...

269
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,870
What's wrong with Grandma?

270
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,340
Don't interrupt when adults are talking.

271
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,870
Hey.

272
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,990
How about...

273
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,889
you quit your job?

274
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,799
Well, your insurance sales job doesn't make much anyway.

275
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,669
And you don't really like that job.

276
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,299
My salary should be enough.

277
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,070
I don't want to discuss it now.

278
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,649
Can I talk now?

279
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,759
Grandma is unwell.

280
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,330
What should we do?

281
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,889
We're not sure yet.

282
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,789
It should be fine.

283
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,960
Don't worry.

284
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,049
(Personnel Announcement)

285
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:49,220
(1. VP Guan Yi Xiong has applied to retire.)

286
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,049
(His last day will be on Feb 13, 2023.)

287
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,395
(2. Sales Manager He Rui Zhi will take over as the VP.)

288
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:53,739
(Please be informed of this. Sorry for any inconvenience.)

289
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,819
Why are you working overtime again?

290
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,880
Do you want me to turn off the lights?

291
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Zhang Yi Jing.

292
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,669
Should I turn it off for you?

293
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Sure.

294
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,419
Rebecca

295
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:58,019
Rebecca

296
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,990
My embrace is waiting for you

297
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:05,630
Rebecca

298
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,359
Rebe...

299
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,519
Thank you.

300
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,190
It's not worth wrecking your health for work.

301
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,479
You know what it means to take responsibility, right?

302
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,029
You should strive to be a manager in marketing.

303
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,470
I'll make an effort next time.

304
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:02,529
Why do you always want to be the good guy?

305
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:04,619
You don't fight for what you should.

306
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,899
If Christine ends up becoming a vice president,

307
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
I'll despise you.

308
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,130
I'm really a vice president now.

309
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,369
I really did it.

310
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,350
I've been to that restaurant before.

311
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:31,650
- Nice. - Let's go.

312
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,750
It's my treat, okay?

313
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:33,849
No.

314
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,420
I have to pick up my son later.

315
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,490
- Come on. - Join us.

316
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:37,890
Vice President.

317
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,519
Ed said it's his treat.

318
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,059
Don't be such a killjoy, okay?

319
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,930
Yes. Okay, fine.

320
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,990
Let me ask my wife.

321
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,230
- Okay. - Hurry up and ask.

322
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,329
Actually, I don't keep an eye on him.

323
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,900
Luckily, he studies hard enough.

324
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,339
So he's always in the top 10.

325
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,440
- Honey. - Yes?

326
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,789
They're going for another round.

327
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:58,640
Okay.

328
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,630
I'll drive to your mom's house to pick up Bu Bu.

329
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,410
Don't get too drunk.

330
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,079
- Don't worry. - Okay.

331
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,589
Look.

332
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,759
I don't even keep an eye on my husband.

333
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,819
You're good.

334
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,990
Gosh.

335
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,799
Thank you.

336
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,440
Why are you smoking here alone?

337
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,309
Just like you.

338
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,380
I came out for some air.

339
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,490
I thought it was me.

340
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,730
Me too.

341
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,940
I asked him just now.

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why?

343
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,710
He said because I'm a woman.

344
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,240
Bullshit.

345
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,509
I even got divorced for the sake of the company.

346
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,196
A few years ago, I got an offer from a headhunter.

347
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,460
An American company.

348
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,319
They offered me three million dollars a year.

349
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,099
I wanted to quit.

350
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,829
He told me to put up with it.

351
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,380
Just put up with it for two years until Guan Yi Xiong retires.

352
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,299
He even gave me a 10,000-dollar raise.

353
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,980
But I'm already over 50 years old.

354
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,150
There aren't any other opportunities.

355
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,210
But I'm still better off than Guan Yi Xiong.

356
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,359
He must be gutted...

357
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,619
to be forced into retiring.

358
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,630
That's why...

359
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,630
loyalty is worthless.

360
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,039
If there's a good opportunity,

361
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,740
you should seize it.

362
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,170
Okay?

363
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,249
Just a word of advice for your reference.

364
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:15,509
By the way,

365
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:18,750
do you know Rebecca had an affair with the general manager?

366
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,900
Yes.

367
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,970
I've asked around.

368
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,410
Okay, I got it.

369
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,055
Didn't I tell you not to get endorsements?

370
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,959
- Good morning. - Didn't I say no endorsements?

371
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,579
Okay, no problem.

372
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,380
Didn't I tell you not to get endorsements?

373
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,220
Video ads.

374
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,319
- Radio ads. Print ads. - I'll start the meeting.

375
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,466
I've already told the agency to withdraw the manuscript.

376
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,035
But it'll be too late for the ones scheduled today.

377
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,460
I'll reply to the reporters first.

378
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,636
We'll explain it to the public after the emergency meeting.

379
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,700
Where's our press release?

380
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,700
- I'll rush it. - Okay.

381
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,160
What did the lawyer say?

382
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,230
Right.

383
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,670
I've double-checked with Mr. Zhao.

384
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,170
He's drafting the statement now.

385
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,900
We're terminating the contract in the spirit of the contract.

386
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,085
As for the compensation for breach of contract,

387
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,616
it was stated to be double the amount.

388
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,009
Defamation is not included.

389
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,180
I'm sorry I'm a bit late today.

390
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,485
Hey, did you know Huo Yi Jian is in trouble?

391
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,950
- What? - Really?

392
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:25,819
What happened?

393
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,480
He was caught doing drugs last night.

394
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,265
I heard that his ex-girlfriend got back at him.

395
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,720
- That's harsh. - So unlucky.

396
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:31,990
What should we do now?

397
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,059
I don't know either.

398
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,829
We can only wait for the meeting.

399
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,890
I see.

400
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,960
I'm not Rebecca. She is busy.

401
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,730
I see.

402
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,799
Rebecca.

403
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:42,299
Rebecca.

404
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,329
How much longer for the press release?

405
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Five minutes.

406
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:45,970
She said five minutes.

407
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,039
(Zhang Zhi Hao Calling)

408
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:47,970
When the press release is out,

409
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:48,839
we'll explain it to the public.

410
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,710
It has been five minutes.

411
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,410
It's just a press release.

412
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,009
Where's Daniel?

413
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,785
The manager is flying to Shenzhen today.

414
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,009
I'm reporting on his behalf.

415
00:22:58,819 --> 00:22:59,926
As for the sales department,

416
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,990
I've contacted all the counters and selling points.

417
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,019
They'll help us remove the cut-outs,

418
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:05,119
the posters, the flyers,

419
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,359
and all promotional items.

420
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:07,789
After the meeting,

421
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,329
I'll also patrol the Taipei area.

422
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,430
If necessary,

423
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,075
we can also go down to the central and southern cities.

424
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,206
Reactions at the selling points.

425
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,529
Okay, I'll ask.

426
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,130
- Boss. - Yes?

427
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,500
Do you think we should give the consumers some offers?

428
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,200
- Offers again? - Come in for a second.

429
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,216
We can discuss this when the general manager arrives.

430
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,910
Wait, what does this say?

431
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,309
Strong work ethic during his endorsement?

432
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,880
He's highly cooperative?

433
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,380
Why are you still defending him?

434
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,819
I'm just stating the facts.

435
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,549
Besides, he's really...

436
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,680
Rebecca, why do you keep missing the point?

437
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,789
Here's what's important.

438
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,390
We need to protect the company and the product's image.

439
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,819
By kicking him when he's down?

440
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,890
What do you mean?

441
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,005
Can I really tell you what I mean?

442
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,089
- Hold on. - You think...

443
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,230
Actually, young people's opinions...

444
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,930
are worth listening to at times.

445
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:51,369
Okay.

446
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,839
Go ahead.

447
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,279
Every time something happens,

448
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,109
everyone wants to distance themselves.

449
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,650
But to the consumers,

450
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,609
distancing ourselves...

451
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,150
means nothing to them.

452
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,650
People might even think...

453
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,320
that we're taking advantage of the artists' negative perceptions.

454
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,089
So I think...

455
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,720
instead of terminating the contract,

456
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,669
we should turn this crisis into an opportunity.

457
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,805
This way, we can get more exposure for our products...

458
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:19,230
and have a positive image.

459
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:21,059
Turning a crisis into an opportunity.

460
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,670
That's not a bad idea.

461
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,400
What do you think?

462
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,670
Everyone makes mistakes.

463
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,869
Celebrities are human too.

464
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,815
That's why I think we shouldn't terminate his contract.

465
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,349
Instead, we should tell people...

466
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,849
People who make mistakes...

467
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,589
should be given a chance to take the right path.

468
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,289
We'll never give up on him until he gets back on his feet.

469
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,319
That's good.

470
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:58,700
Let's have a meeting in that direction.

471
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,039
Eric, let's put it on hold for now.

472
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,210
You can go.

473
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,210
What's your name?

474
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,150
Zhang Yi Jing.

475
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
She's in my department.

476
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,460
Stay for the meeting then.

477
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,230
Come here.

478
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,559
Come in, Rebecca.

479
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,630
Sir.

480
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,329
- This is today's press release. - Let's start the meeting.

481
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,869
Take a look at our draft.

482
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm actually protecting you.

483
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:34,670
You know?

484
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,440
So if you have any ideas, discuss them with me first.

485
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:40,839
Otherwise, these inexperienced ideas will expose your weaknesses.

486
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,450
At the same time,

487
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:44,180
I hope you can support me.

488
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,755
The vice president, Mr. Guan was parachuted in.

489
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,549
He has been tampering with HR.

490
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:51,859
So we have to be more united and cherish each other.

491
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,819
What is it?

492
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,720
The general manager is looking for you.

493
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,059
He's looking for Rebecca.

494
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,399
Is there anything you want to eat?

495
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,180
I'm fine with anything.

496
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,650
So everyone was wrong about you.

497
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,619
They told me you're very creative.

498
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,490
Can I have Subway then?

499
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,676
I've already contacted them.

500
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,539
That fast?

501
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,009
Call me Handy Helper.

502
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,170
Okay. Let's go.

503
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,339
I'll treat you to a meal.

504
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,740
That's nice.

505
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:48,609
Let's celebrate R defeating C.

506
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,319
Rebecca is really cool.

507
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
She is.

508
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,049
She just doesn't know it.

509
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,519
What do you mean?

510
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,720
Look.

511
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,660
She'll get scolded if things go wrong.

512
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,059
And Christine keeps rejecting her proposals.

513
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,660
So she's bound to doubt herself.

514
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:06,859
You're right.

515
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,299
But it's good that she has so many ideas.

516
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,599
It was such a pity.

517
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,109
But things will get better now.

518
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,410
Is that what you like about her?

519
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,579
That's what bothers me too.

520
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,680
It's a double-edged sword.

521
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,079
How so?

522
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:24,910
We don't seem...

523
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,420
to be in a relationship.

524
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,619
It's all about work.

525
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,660
What about you?

526
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
Are you passionate about work too?

527
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,230
Me?

528
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,660
I'm doing just fine.

529
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,829
To me,

530
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,400
it's just a way to make a living.

531
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,500
And I get to make more friends...

532
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,269
to liven up my life.

533
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,609
It's just a way to prevent social withdrawal.

534
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,009
So, I'll just do what I can.

535
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,009
No wonder.

536
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,049
No wonder what?

537
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,180
I mean,

538
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,990
you're a hard worker.

539
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,390
You're doing okay at what you're asked to do.

540
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,660
But it's a bit...

541
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,490
How should I put it?

542
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,559
You lack...

543
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,430
A bit of passion?

544
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:23,809
I see.

545
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,880
Why are you sitting there?

546
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
It's nothing.

547
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,359
I was just thinking.

548
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,359
Maybe one day,

549
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,829
I'll end up like Mr. Guan.

550
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,599
Actually, Mr. Guan is at the age where he should retire.

551
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,099
Voluntary retirement and forced retirement...

552
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,640
are very different, okay?

553
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,740
Self-esteem, get it?

554
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:00,680
The point is,

555
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,549
how much more are you getting paid?

556
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,349
I don't think it's a lot.

557
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,220
You still don't get it?

558
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,819
Mr. Guan's salary is too high.

559
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,065
They promoted me to take his place...

560
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,490
to save money.

561
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,730
These bosses.

562
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,599
Why do we slave away like dogs?

563
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,809
To make a living.

564
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,509
So,

565
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:36,049
I'll just be a dog.

566
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,220
As for you,

567
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,950
don't torture yourself over a bit of money.

568
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,660
We clock in every day just to clock out.

569
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,960
If your mom is really ill,

570
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,329
I mean it,

571
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,599
just quit your job.

572
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,539
Hey, why do you always look down on my job?

573
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,200
Look down?

574
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,515
You complain every day that you're tired and frustrated.

575
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,279
Didn't you say you work just to make friends...

576
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,309
and to prevent social withdrawal?

577
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,180
Technology is so advanced now.

578
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,726
With a laptop, you can have access to anything.

579
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,619
But I don't want to be trapped in this house day after day.

580
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,450
I also want to gossip with my colleagues.

581
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,490
I want to dress up to meet clients.

582
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,259
I also look forward...

583
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:24,565
to that joyful feeling of leaving the office on Fridays.

584
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,706
I also need to prove that I'm not just...

585
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,900
He Rui Zhi's wife,

586
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,700
He Yong Li's mom,

587
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,430
and Jian Qiu Mei Lan's daughter, okay?

588
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,400
I need me.

589
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,839
But you don't want your mom to go to a nursing home.

590
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,740
So what should we do?

591
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Even if I quit,

592
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,549
it should be because I want to.

593
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,420
Do you understand?

594
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
Self-esteem.

595
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,950
Hey.

596
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,160
Why is it always so hard to communicate with you?

597
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,609
So do you think...

598
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,220
it's good or bad to be less passionate?

599
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:21,380
What?

600
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,390
Didn't you say...

601
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,589
I'm less passionate about work?

602
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,390
So is it good or bad?

603
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,759
Tell me as a friend.

604
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:34,160
There's nothing good or bad about it.

605
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,529
To each their own.

606
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,970
(Zhang Yi Jing: Zhang Zhi Hao keeps calling me.)

607
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:43,710
Excuse me.

608
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:44,869
I need to make a call.

609
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,990
The last time I had a sandwich was about 10 years ago.

610
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,349
In Los Angeles.

611
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,660
What about you?

612
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,319
Two weeks ago.

613
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,829
Is it okay working under Christine?

614
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,170
Yes.

615
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Come on.

616
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,519
She has been doing...

617
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,119
what she thought you'd like.

618
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:30,750
You mean, she's very loyal?

619
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,859
Then why did you pay for a marketing manager?

620
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,430
Answer it. It's okay.

621
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:42,676
It's okay. Someone will take care of it for me.

622
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,829
He Rui Zhi?

623
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,740
Tell me it's not him.

624
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:50,869
Before I fire him.

625
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
He...

626
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,710
He's really capable.

627
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,019
You're a terrible liar.

628
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,650
It's true.

629
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
I like it.

630
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,400
Zero.

631
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,240
Nine.

632
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:20,440
Seven.

633
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,670
Hello?

634
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,150
We're not meant to be.

635
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,390
Who is it?

636
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:40,819
Hi, how are you?

637
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,759
Is Zhang Yi Jing here?

638
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,430
You've got the wrong house.

639
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,700
But Zhang Yi Jing gave me this address.

640
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:52,369
- Look. - Zhang Yi Jing?

641
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,740
Hello.

642
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,039
Zhang Zhi Hao.

643
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:03,579
(Changhua Prison)

644
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,950
Hey!

645
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,450
Get out of here or I'll call the police.

646
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,626
This is really addressed to me.

647
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,889
You've got the wrong house!

648
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,260
How could she give our address to that kind of person?

649
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,736
What do you mean by that kind of person?

650
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,960
Can you not talk like that all the time?

651
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,300
That's her brother.

652
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,030
You need to write a return address.

653
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,699
Then write the company's address.

654
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,969
It'll be awkward if she gets a reply in the office.

655
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:26,739
I see.

656
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,015
She doesn't want it to be awkward.

657
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,269
Aren't you afraid something might happen to your mom?

658
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,210
What if he barges in?

659
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,940
I'm just an old lady at home.

660
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,849
Not all ex-convicts are bad people.

661
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,909
Okay?

662
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,320
With that face,

663
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,219
you can tell he's up to no good.

664
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,449
I don't care. Tell her to move out.

665
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,595
If you don't want your mom to die,

666
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,690
tell her to move out.

667
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,300
That's not what my mom meant.

668
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,110
Don't think too much.

669
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,309
She's just shocked.

670
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,679
It'll be fine.

671
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,099
(Homes and apartments for rent)

672
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:35,269
Ms. Zhang.

673
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,309
Excuse me, Ms. Zhang.

674
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,009
The general manager wants to talk to you.

675
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:08,469
Hey.

676
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,010
How are you?

677
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
I'm doing pretty well.

678
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
I'm not okay.

679
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,920
Just now,

680
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:28,549
I drank too much at the farewell party.

681
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:30,860
Everyone came to raise a toast to me.

682
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,659
I really want them to shut up.

683
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,969
Mr. Guan is retiring.

684
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,099
Guess who I promoted?

685
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:43,940
Why should I care?

686
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,550
Do you not care about me or do you not care about He Rui Zhi?

687
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:53,579
Anyway,

688
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,079
I'm tired.

689
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:57,889
So I sold some shares.

690
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,559
I'd like to ask for your opinion.

691
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,040
It's not like I have anything nice to say.

692
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
That's right.

693
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,099
So you know.

694
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,639
That time you called me...

695
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,510
a mediocre boss.

696
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,739
What did you say?

697
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:23,909
That I only like listening to sweet talking.

698
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:25,980
I can't tell...

699
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,920
slander from remonstration.

700
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,150
There's more.

701
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:31,995
The reason the company has come this far...

702
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,360
is through sheer luck, not my ability.

703
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,489
You're not a good mistress.

704
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:46,840
You're my confidante.

705
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,880
Life is so lonely without a confidante.

706
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
Do you know that?

707
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,159
Everyone is lonely.

708
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,070
Maybe it's because loneliness is necessary.

709
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,599
It allows you to face yourself.

710
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,409
I hope you can still find him.

711
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,849
Your consciousness called me here, didn't it?

712
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:38,150
I can go up now.

713
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
What for?

714
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,469
So are you here...

715
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,220
for a confidante or a friend with benefits?

716
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,239
What about you?

717
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,610
What do you take me for?

718
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,920
Who have you been waiting for? He Rui Zhi?

719
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,389
He Rui Zhi loves his wife.

720
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,619
He won't divorce her!

721
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,320
You're free now.

722
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,429
Without Mrs. He's nagging and He Rui Zhi's watchful eyes,

723
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:51,489
it feels great, right?

724
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Yes.

725
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,070
You can't escape from me.

726
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,340
Hurry up and go home.

727
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,840
Give me a smile.

728
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,409
Hurry up and go.

729
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Hurry up.

730
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,369
I miss you already.

731
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,280
There's no answer to this.

732
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:50,449
It's too hard.

733
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,719
So let's not make it hard for ourselves.

734
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:15,469
That's right.

735
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,670
It's time to move.

736
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:35,619
Mom.

737
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:41,059
You're so late.

738
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,889
- I'm... - Why are you so late again?

739
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,960
Are we having takeaway again?

740
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:02,179
Is it from the place with the good drumsticks?

741
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,980
Yes.

742
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,420
I'll be mad if we have takeaway again tomorrow.

743
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,400
