1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,470
I heard...

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,309
that if we keep doing an action for 21 days in a row,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,449
our brain will get used to it as a habit.

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,100
But after so many periods of 21 days,

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,000
Mrs. He still fails to get used to my existence.

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,210
Just like me.

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,031
Although I tried my best to pretend not to hear a word...

8
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,950
or notice the obvious,

9
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,649
and I pretended to be comforted by you...

10
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,966
You can tell he's up to no good.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,335
I don't care. Tell her to move out.

12
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,289
The truth is, I can't get used...

13
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:55,189
to the fact that she doesn't like me.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,030
There's no answer to this.

15
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,469
It's too hard.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,400
That's why I gave up.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,409
Because I'll choose my brother no matter what.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,950
- Hey, what are you doing? - I've had enough of you!

19
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,409
What's wrong?

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,680
Give it back!

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,950
Even though he's not smart,

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
annoying,

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,590
and caused me so much trouble...

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,319
Hey, kid. You stole that bike.

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,590
I didn't steal it!

26
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,989
I just borrowed it.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,066
My sister is too tired to walk.

28
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,030
I'm taking her home.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,159
But I can't forget...

30
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,200
the days when it was just the two of us.

31
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,540
You shouldn't forget either.

32
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,810
So let's not make it hard for ourselves.

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
We'll get used to it...

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,489
after 21 days anyway.

35
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,129
Hey, it's time to eat.

36
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,199
Where are you going?

37
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,000
Where?

38
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,030
He Rui Zhi.

39
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,539
I'm talking to you!

40
00:02:58,979 --> 00:02:59,750
Qing Fen.

41
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,150
Hello, Mrs. He.

42
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,990
You can't reach Mr. He again?

43
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,490
Qing Fen.

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,659
Can you talk to He Rui Zhi for me?

45
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,699
He hasn't talked to me for days.

46
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,110
Can I have one too?

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
What?

48
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:37,960
I didn't know you smoke.

49
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,259
Sometimes.

50
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,870
What happened to your hand?

51
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,409
I got into a fight.

52
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,139
With who?

53
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,110
With a pig.

54
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,150
Don't say that about yourself.

55
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,750
Why aren't you working for the FBI yet?

56
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,159
Because I think...

57
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:16,089
I'm better suited to listening to confessions.

58
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,939
Mrs. He is very sad.

59
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,709
I know that.

60
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,350
Yes.

61
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,810
This is not right.

62
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,220
However,

63
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,990
as the son of a great mom,

64
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,290
don't I have the right to vent?

65
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,199
I'll buy you a drink tonight.

66
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,110
No, thank you.

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,949
Don't you want to vent?

68
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,050
At a time like this,

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,790
it's too easy to be misunderstood.

70
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,290
Thank you.

71
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,490
You haven't given up yet?

72
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,930
If I give up,

73
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,230
I'll have no chance of winning.

74
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,839
I'll go down first.

75
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,550
That's right.

76
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,110
If you give up,

77
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,750
you'll have no chance of winning.

78
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,889
However,

79
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,160
there are two types of not giving up.

80
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,930
One belongs to the protagonist.

81
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,230
It's usually praised as being tenacious,

82
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,129
loving,

83
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,569
and touching.

84
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,129
Hurry up, Rui Zhi has prepared a lot of good food.

85
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,286
The other belongs to the supporting role.

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,069
Excuse me. It's mine.

87
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,779
The audience will deem it as unfavorable,

88
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,680
and shameless.

89
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,949
So I'm sorry, Rebecca.

90
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,519
After all,

91
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,819
this is my universe.

92
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,850
It smells so good.

93
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,589
Be careful, it's hot.

94
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,476
I had a go at making Mrs. He's soy braised chicken yesterday.

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Try it and let me know.

96
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,069
I had a late breakfast.

97
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,139
I'm not hungry yet.

98
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,709
Hey, Kun.

99
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,740
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

100
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Qing Fen made it.

101
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,149
You're offering it to me?

102
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,750
That's nice.

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,089
It's soy braised chicken.

104
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,290
You're marriage material.

105
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,230
It smells so good.

106
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,040
(Can life be any better?)

107
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,810
It's not that serious.

108
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,519
The doctor just wants us to observe for signs of dementia.

109
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:29,050
So I had Mom do the Dementia Rating Scale.

110
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,819
She did have some memory loss,

111
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,620
but everything is normal now.

112
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,899
Didn't Mom look at your face and call Dad's name?

113
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,860
That was just a mistake.

114
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,069
Mom knows that too.

115
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,000
Then why did your wife tell me that?

116
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,000
It's because of your nasty text.

117
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,139
She has my phone password.

118
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,209
You know that.

119
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,910
I wrote that message just for her.

120
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,750
I can write even nastier ones.

121
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,279
Please, Jian Qing Fen.

122
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,149
Please.

123
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,019
Don't get me into more trouble, okay?

124
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't want much.

125
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,189
I just want...

126
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,790
a safe and peaceful life.

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
Okay?

128
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,490
That's the wife you wanted.

129
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,320
That's why I've started teaching Jian Bao...

130
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,529
not to get married unless it's absolutely necessary.

131
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:21,939
Here you go.

132
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,139
Another insurance?

133
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,379
I didn't do well in sales this month.

134
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,250
Maybe I should call your wife.

135
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,080
Gosh. You're using up my pocket money.

136
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,365
What insurance is it this time?

137
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,820
It's just a quarterly premium that's about 10,000 dollars.

138
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:37,820
Just pay for it.

139
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,059
Here. Sign it.

140
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,629
It's good to have a brother.

141
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,830
Luckily, Jian Bao doesn't have a sister.

142
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,240
(Zhang Zhi Hao calling)

143
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,009
They're all female directors.

144
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,110
Yes, women's issues.

145
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,179
Yes.

146
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,179
That's why it's called "Haohao."

147
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,610
The word "woman" is part of the Chinese character of "hao."

148
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:08,789
Right.

149
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,620
Yes.

150
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,820
I'm looking into it.

151
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,259
You know how well I pick out films.

152
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,159
Yes.

153
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,529
Yes, I'm looking into it.

154
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,860
Una.

155
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,360
Yes.

156
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,429
Yes.

157
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,230
Goodness.

158
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:23,870
Don't you know how I work?

159
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,870
One, two, three, four.

160
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,769
Five, six, seven, eight.

161
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,070
Two, two, three, four.

162
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,279
Five, six, seven, eight.

163
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,379
Three, two, three, four.

164
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,509
Five, six, seven, eight.

165
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,850
Four, two, three, four.

166
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,149
Five, six, seven, eight.

167
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,019
Very good.

168
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,120
This one.

169
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,919
Is this okay?

170
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,860
Yes.

171
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,289
It looks good.

172
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,289
Okay. Let's take a 10-minute break.

173
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,059
Then we'll dance again with the music.

174
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:53,129
Thank you, ma'am.

175
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Hey.

176
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,245
Hey, I always thought you were dating He Rui Zhi.

177
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,749
How did he end up with Jian Qing Fen?

178
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,480
You didn't know?

179
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,509
It's nothing.

180
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,586
I heard from Kun that they have been very close lately.

181
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,850
It's not a big deal, okay?

182
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,649
Just be happy.

183
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,690
Just now, when the instructor...

184
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,950
Do you want to eat anything later?

185
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,289
I know a good restaurant nearby.

186
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,799
What is it?

187
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,035
I got a 500,000-dollar sponsorship for the entire press conference.

188
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,929
They'll use our concept as the theme.

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,446
"Live in the moment and heal yourself."

190
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,470
Or do you want to use...

191
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,020
What about the effects of advertising?

192
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,009
Although it's a small film festival,

193
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,980
the target audience is very compatible with us.

194
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,980
And the opening day...

195
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,926
of the film festival is quite close to our launch date.

196
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,379
So it's like a free ride.

197
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,149
They're talking about the actress your daughter loves.

198
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,220
They want Una to endorse it.

199
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,519
I think she actually has a good image.

200
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,820
Eric.

201
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:51,990
What do you think?

202
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,230
Well...

203
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,529
I get what Christine is saying.

204
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,546
Women's mindfulness movement...

205
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,799
is quite a compatible theme for the film festival.

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,269
However,

207
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,610
it's a pity for our sales goal if we just go along with the theme.

208
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,610
Agreed.

209
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,549
Surprise me.

210
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,750
What?

211
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,419
Just because you're newly promoted,

212
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,730
you have to shoot down my idea?

213
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,929
Christine.

214
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,860
A clash of ideas can foster creativity.

215
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,369
Why would you see it as a rejection?

216
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,169
Okay.

217
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,230
That's a relief.

218
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,269
Vice President.

219
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,519
- What else? - I'll get more.

220
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,860
Gosh.

221
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,129
Jump.

222
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Hey.

223
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,669
Thank you.

224
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,809
Don't skip meals.

225
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,049
I really don't want to be homeless at 70.

226
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,480
That's why I'm working hard.

227
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,519
I'll pay you back next week...

228
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,120
It's because I'm all alone!

229
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,690
I don't even have a house.

230
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,059
I'll always get kicked out by landlords any time.

231
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,389
I can only depend on myself.

232
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,000
I have to fix my own closet.

233
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,429
Do you know how tiring it is to carry yourself?

234
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,700
I...

235
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,700
So can I ask you for a favor?

236
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,210
I'm really tired.

237
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,049
Rebecca, what's wrong?

238
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,250
It's nothing serious. I just forgot my keys.

239
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,289
So I climbed up their balcony.

240
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,860
Did you lose anything?

241
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,129
Did I break anything?

242
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,990
- Mr. Li. - I didn't.

243
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:09,860
I mean it.

244
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,929
You can't just rent your place to anyone.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,730
Why did you rent it to an ex-convict?

246
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,570
So what if I'm an ex-convict?

247
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,429
I just found out too.

248
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,740
Mr. Zhang, with your records,

249
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,115
you'll be in trouble if she sues you.

250
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,169
I just forgot my keys.

251
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,169
Come on, sir.

252
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,509
Ma'am, do you want to settle with them?

253
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,900
I don't want to get into trouble.

254
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,210
Well, if Mr. Li terminates the contract with them,

255
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,450
and asks them to move out,

256
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,525
I'll forget about it, okay?

257
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,379
Hey, we paid rent.

258
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,320
We signed a contract.

259
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,250
No, if an ex-convict lives next to you,

260
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,120
who will feel at ease?

261
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,519
It won't kill you to take a break.

262
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,279
Drink some water.

263
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,379
Then cry all you want.

264
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,279
When you're done crying,

265
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,510
I have something to tell you.

266
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,190
What is it?

267
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,330
When you're homeless,

268
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,600
I'll bring you lunchboxes.

269
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,840
If my wife is okay with it,

270
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,769
you can stay at my place.

271
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,950
For free.

272
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,980
Thank you for your foolhardiness.

273
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:20,059
Anyway,

274
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,460
from now on,

275
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,090
you can just be Rebecca.

276
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,230
Don't work too hard.

277
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,330
Don't be too frugal.

278
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:32,669
Well...

279
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,570
I'm here for you.

280
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,336
So what if I'm an ex-convict? Why implicate my sister?

281
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,029
She studied and worked hard.

282
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,605
Zhang Zhi Hao climbed up someone's balcony.

283
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:02,669
Now they want to sue him.

284
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,100
It's okay. I'm here for you.

285
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,309
I'm here for you.

286
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,399
My surname is Zhang.

287
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,470
Just one person.

288
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:38,899
I'm single.

289
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,145
(Three-bedroom apartment, 35,000 dollars per month)

290
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,470
I'm 40 years old.

291
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,509
I'm sorry, I just want to rent...

292
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,309
I'm single, not divorced.

293
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,250
I'm a freelancer.

294
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:57,690
I can definitely afford the rent with my income.

295
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,220
So may I ask when can I go for a viewing?

296
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:02,759
It's already rented?

297
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,290
Then why are you asking me so many questions?

298
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,529
Wow, quantum mechanics.

299
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,666
Seems like a lot of people are researching this lately.

300
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,400
Are you interested, Qing Fen?

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,120
I'm afraid I'll be outdated.

302
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,750
So I'm just checking it out.

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,470
Do you know a restaurant called Schrodinger's Cat?

304
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,970
My client said it's pretty good.

305
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,039
Your client?

306
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:51,640
Is it a woman?

307
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,180
Yes.

308
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:56,910
40 years old?

309
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
Single?

310
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,119
A woman in her fifties.

311
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,289
I'm visiting my clients.

312
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,289
Hey.

313
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,859
Do you think I'm looking for trouble?

314
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,829
Actually,

315
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,470
it's scientists...

316
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,829
who love looking for trouble.

317
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,740
For example,

318
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,710
in order to confirm that light is a particle...

319
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,910
Mom!

320
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,670
They conducted an experiment.

321
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,410
He Rui Zhi!

322
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
(Double-slit Experiment)

323
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:26,509
I'm coming.

324
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,509
If light is a particle,

325
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,519
then when light passes through two closely spaced narrow slits...

326
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:35,926
and forms an interference pattern on a screen,

327
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,049
it should look like this.

328
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,160
But you know what?

329
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,335
The result of the experiment...

330
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,369
showed that light was like waves of ripples.

331
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,569
Could it be...

332
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,410
that light is a wave?

333
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,940
The scientists were shocked.

334
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:03,480
So they decided to set up cameras...

335
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:06,450
before and behind the interference to observe the changes in light.

336
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,549
Then, something even more shocking happened.

337
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,390
When the cameras were turned on,

338
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,759
the light returned to its particle state.

339
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,730
When the cameras were turned off,

340
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,029
the light turned back into waves.

341
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,940
You heard that right.

342
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,069
Even the scientists were stunned.

343
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,539
Observational learning...

344
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,809
has altered the outcome.

345
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,650
Bu Bu, has it lit up?

346
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
- Yes. - It's lit.

347
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,119
All fixed.

348
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,319
And light,

349
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,660
how did it realize that it was being observed?

350
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:49,890
(Rebecca. Zhang)

351
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,859
She hasn't posted in two weeks.

352
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,099
It seems like...

353
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,829
her observer has been discovered.

354
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,309
Let me do it.

355
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,480
Thank you.

356
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,549
Here.

357
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,089
Do you want coffee?

358
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,450
I actually bought coffee.

359
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,289
There's also coffee?

360
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,119
Broad bean chips, dried mango, and cream puffs too.

361
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,930
Is this a field trip?

362
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,630
Here.

363
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Be careful.

364
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,230
We're on a business trip.

365
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,140
Still, we get to clock out too.

366
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,889
Actually, I did some research on some must-eat delicacies.

367
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,440
This seafood restaurant's sea urchin fried rice is amazing.

368
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:39,640
It's highly recommended.

369
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,650
Isn't sea urchin your favorite?

370
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,755
Or do you prefer to eat at Ruifeng Night Market?

371
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,119
Well...

372
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,580
Let's go for sea urchin fried rice.

373
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:47,619
It's on me.

374
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,519
It's expensive. Of course it's on you.

375
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:05,775
Here's yours, sir. Yours too, ma'am.

376
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,799
Thank you.

377
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,210
See you in half an hour then.

378
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,269
Okay.

379
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:22,549
Where are you?

380
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,599
Hi.

381
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,400
Hi.

382
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,769
It's her annual leave.

383
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:36,989
- I see. - Let's go upstairs.

384
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,099
Did I keep you waiting?

385
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,339
Not really.

386
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,369
It's so heavy.

387
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:53,079
How is your name saved in your husband's phone?

388
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,150
(Come home early today.)

389
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,626
(Let's have wagyu to celebrate your promotion!)

390
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,650
(That's nice!)

391
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,490
I guess he saved me as Qing Fen.

392
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,059
Or...

393
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,529
Jian Qing Fen.

394
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,269
He probably hasn't changed it since the first day...

395
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,170
he saved my number.

396
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:16,940
That means,

397
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,380
there has never been a moment...

398
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,640
when He Rui Zhi...

399
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,390
wanted to call me in any affectionate way.

400
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:25,450
For example...

401
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,750
Honey.

402
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,150
My wife.

403
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:29,950
My baby's mom.

404
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,890
Darling.

405
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:35,630
Zhou Zhi Kang said that Cai Pin Wei stole it,

406
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,759
but Cai Pin Wei said he didn't.

407
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:39,359
Then they got into a fight.

408
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,670
Zhou Zhi Kang shouldn't have done that.

409
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,730
Unless you have proof,

410
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,839
you can't just accuse people.

411
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:48,170
Fighting isn't good either.

412
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,569
Of course I know that.

413
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:51,980
Then you're good.

414
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,640
One time...

415
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,750
Of course.

416
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,809
I accidentally saw a phone number...

417
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,180
in He Rui Zhi's contact list...

418
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,089
that was saved as "The Forgotten."

419
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,089
I'll let you play for half an hour when you're done, okay?

420
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
Nice!

421
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,619
I guess it's Rebecca.

422
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,059
(Contacts, The Forgotten)

423
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,230
If I'm right,

424
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,799
that means even after they broke up,

425
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:15,869
she's still worthy...

426
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,170
of getting renamed by He Rui Zhi as "The Forgotten."

427
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,700
It's a scar on his body.

428
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,970
He always knows it is there.

429
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,609
And as his wife,

430
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,680
I can always feel it.

431
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,359
Why are you looking at my phone?

432
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Who is this?

433
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,049
Isn't it written there?

434
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,259
I forgot.

435
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,710
Maybe I didn't save it correctly back then.

436
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,140
I really hope I got it wrong.

437
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,039
I hope that "The Forgotten"...

438
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,670
is just someone he forgot.

439
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,420
(Contacts, The Forgotten, Mobile: 0900484131)

440
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:11,619

(Confirm)

444
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,019
Dear God.

445
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,299
Please let me undo my birthday wish.

446
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,730
What wish?

447
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:00,569
It's nothing.

448
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,240
It's just...

449
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,480
that I thought living like this was so boring without any troubles.

450
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,849
But my mom is fine.

451
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,250
That's great.

452
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,420
My brother was right.

453
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,960
It's good to be safe and sound.

454
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,130
If I don't have a goal, so be it.

455
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
What?

456
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,970
I'm not busy these days.

457
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Congratulations.

458
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,140
Should I be a stand-in?

459
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
For what?

460
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,269
Your assistant.

461
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,180
So you can go home early, right?

462
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,349
Let's have a hot pot, okay?

463
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,829
Listen.

464
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,470
I found a lot of interesting creative brands this time.

465
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,740
Although they're new in the market,

466
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,140
I think I can help them get more media exposure...

467
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,416
or collaborations with other businesses.

468
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,039
Hold on.

469
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,140
Do I have to start working already?

470
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,779
Should I say ready, set, go?

471
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,750
I see.

472
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,450
No wonder you don't have an assistant.

473
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,789
Let's go.

474
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:01,859
Let's talk while we eat.

475
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,089
All you do is work.

476
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,500
You don't even eat properly.

477
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,430
If you don't take care of yourself,

478
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,559
who will?

479
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,779
(Japanese Shabu-shabu)

480
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,779
(Welcome)

481
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,690
Thirteen times?

482
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,750
Yes.

483
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,160
There are a lot of strange places...

484
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,619
that you can't even call home.

485
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,730
I've lived in all of them.

486
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,130
For example,

487
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,630
rooms with partitions made of plywood.

488
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,200
Then you can hear what the person next to you is saying.

489
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,869
Or if he's in a good or bad mood.

490
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,400
It's really scary.

491
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,079
There's also this extra storage room in someone's house.

492
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,140
I lived in those places until I moved to He...

493
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,210
Where?

494
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
I'm full.

495
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,890
Let's go.

496
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,740
You don't want to talk about it.

497
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,660
Listen.

498
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,005
If you don't face your problems,

499
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,259
you can't put them behind you.

500
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Hey.

501
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,940
It's not much. I'll get it.

502
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:25,109
Sir.

503
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,579
- Hello, are you ready to pay? - Yes.

504
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,349
Okay, let me calculate it for you.

505
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,980
I know you'd like it.

506
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,089
It's about a 10-minute drive to my mom's house.

507
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:38,565
We'll have our own space and we can look out for each other.

508
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:40,019
And it has two rooms.

509
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,829
Zhang Zhi Hao can move in too.

510
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,400
The bank said we can get a loan of up to 80 percent.

511
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,230
I've almost saved up enough for the down payment.

512
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,769
The mortgage is about 50,000 dollars a month.

513
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,470
Do you want to help me?

514
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,210
How much should I pay?

515
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,740
How about half?

516
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,109
Half?

517
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,920
I only make 40,000 dollars a month.

518
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,420
I mean, half of your love.

519
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,119
The other half is love for yourself.

520
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,059
I can pay 15,000 dollars.

521
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,430
Okay.

522
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,305
You can pay for utilities and other miscellaneous expenses.

523
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,329
Deal.

524
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,430
I'd better not.

525
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:24,930
If we break up,

526
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,369
it's a hassle to move out.

527
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,740
So let's not break up for no reason.

528
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,920
Are you proposing to me?

529
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,460
We need to buy a house.

530
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,890
So I owe you the diamond ring.

531
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,059
I don't like diamonds.

532
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,470
What are you wearing?

533
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,799
The sleeves are so long.

534
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,519
This is your home.

535
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,460
You're not allowed to move again.

536
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,119
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,960
Yes?

538
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:00,029
I took a look around just now.

539
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:05,369
I think it's a bit too big for me because I live alone.

540
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,839
Ma'am.

541
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,910
The room dimensions are all written clearly in the details.

542
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,839
I'm sorry.

543
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,980
I don't know much about reading dimensions.

544
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:16,910
Since you sounded so urgent,

545
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,549
I took a taxi from Banqiao just for you.

546
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,049
I'm really sorry.

547
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:26,359
It's okay if you don't want to rent it,

548
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,029
but you have to pay for the taxi fare.

549
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,299
How much is it?

550
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,390
Mrs. He.

551
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,630
I'm Rabacca.

552
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,410
May I marry He Rui Zhi?

553
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,800
When He Rui Zhi was five years old,

554
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,400
I became a widow.

555
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,970
I don't know how to do anything.

556
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,680
So I can only take care of other people's kids.

557
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:04,880
I'd carry them until I couldn't even lift my arms.

558
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,420
But I had to keep doing it until He Rui Zhi graduated from college.

559
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,519
And then?

560
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,760
After you moved out,

561
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:21,800
he didn't say a word to me.

562
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,599
He was such a good son.

563
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,769
How did he end up like this?

564
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,610
That day,

565
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,650
he finally said...

566
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,579
he wanted to move out.

567
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,250
Forget it.

568
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:47,590
I don't want this son anymore.

569
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,190
I don't want him anymore.

570
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,159
Mrs. He.

571
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,599
Don't be sad.

572
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,639
Don't cry.

573
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,510
You still have me.

574
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,210
Okay?

575
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,719
How could he do this to me?

576
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:21,090
I'll come here often to keep you company, okay?

577
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,590
How could he do this to me?

578
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,760
Haven't I told you many times?

579
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:57,659
Before you answer,

580
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,500
you have to read the questions carefully.

581
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,559
I thought I did.

582
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,429
He Yong Li, you're very late today.

583
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
It's my mom who's late.

584
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,570
What?

585
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,175
From now on, you have to read the questions twice, okay?

586
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,909
Okay.

587
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,009
Change your shoes quickly.

588
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:12,186
Your dad will pick you up when you're done.

589
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,309
Are you Yong Li's mom?

590
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,710
Yes, I am.

591
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,679
I'm substituting for Mr. Xiao Yu.

592
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,610
He's busy today.

593
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,849
He's Mr. Da Yu.

594
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,489
Hello, Mr. Da Yu.

595
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,250
Just call me Da Yu.

596
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,920
Yong Li.

597
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:27,195
Come here after you change your shoes.

598
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,219
Okay.

599
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,889
All right, I'm going to a gathering now.

600
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,090
Kids!

601
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,429
Come here and warm up.

602
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Bye, Mom.

603
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,530
Bye.

604
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,039
Keep up.

605
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,269
Hurry up.

606
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:46,139
Come on, let's go.

607
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,409
Faster.

608
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:51,880
Hands behind your back!

609
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,820
Hurry up.

610
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:01,119
Faster.

611
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,066
(Yu Xiang Li shared a photo with Rebecca. Zhang)

612
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,460
Hands behind your back!

613
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,469
- I guess, - Hurry up.

614
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:14,570
- I can't undo my wish. - Speed up.

615
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:20,280
Just when I decided to go on with my mundane life,

616
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,579
the universe finally heard my call.

617
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,579
Hands behind your back!

618
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,090
Hands!

619
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,590
Hurry up.

620
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Hello?

621
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,599
Yes, I'm He Rui Zhi's wife.

622
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,840
You are...

623
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,599
I was standing on our balcony for a while.

624
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,245
Then I heard your mom screaming for help.

625
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,840
She must have slipped in the bathroom.

626
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:52,909
I'm at her place now.

627
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:54,440
Hurry up.

628
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,309
I rang the bell but no one answered.

629
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,510
And I don't have the key.

630
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,949
Hello?

631
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,420
We have a spare key but...

632
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,349
I don't know where He Rui Zhi put it.

633
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,420
Why didn't you lock the door or take out the key?

634
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:06,860
Hey, where's your mom's key?

635
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,559
- What? - The spare key to her house?

636
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,860
Do I have to go to the hospital with you later?

637
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,429
Be careful.

638
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,429
Rui Zhi.

639
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,175
Mrs. He must have slipped in the bathroom.

640
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:16,969
I heard it from the balcony.

641
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:17,800
Family members, come this way.

642
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:18,905
Get in from the side door.

643
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:19,699
Hey, Rui Zhi, wait!

644
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:20,769
Your house key.

645
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,610
Hurry up.

646
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,639
What happened?

647
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,460
We'll do intubation...

648
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,179
Take Bu Bu home first.

649
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,349
He has school tomorrow.

650
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,760
Will you be okay on your own?

651
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,000
I'll just wait.

652
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,769
She'll be fine.

653
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,519
Your sister-in-law is really annoying.

654
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,289
But at least,

655
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,519
she's willing to live with your mom.

656
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,570
I told you we should move back home.

657
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:01,769
I told you.

658
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,050
Yi Jing.

659
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,920
Hey, listen.

660
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,579
I didn't climb up the balcony.

661
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,650
It's true.

662
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,349
I took the key you hid.

663
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,035
I'll pay you back the 100,000 dollars...

664
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:55,219
I borrowed this time.

665
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,936
As for the 60,000 dollars I borrowed last time,

666
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,489
give me some more time, okay?

667
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,500
Don't be mad.

668
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,099
When I get the van,

669
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,199
I'll take you back to the beach at Chenggong.

670
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:04,969
I didn't steal it!

671
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,369
I just borrowed it.

672
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,239
My sister is too tired to walk.

673
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,440
I'm taking her home.

674
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,840
Where do you live?

675
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:12,070
We live in Chenggong.

676
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,110
This is Changbin.

677
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:16,480
I know.

678
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,880
Where are you from?

679
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:18,880
Changhua.

680
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:20,019
Changhua, Taichung?

681
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,480
Don't be mad.

682
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,480
Yi Jing.

683
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,789
I listened to you.

684
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,219
I'm working hard.

685
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:27,659
It's true.

686
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,829
If you're angry, food will taste bad.

687
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:31,630
Then you won't want to eat it.

688
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,760
That's why you keep losing weight.

689
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,929
Don't be angry.

690
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,369
All right?

691
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,179
You're her son.

692
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,090
She'll forgive you sooner or later.

693
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:33,190
But she'll hate me forever!

694
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,599
(The Forgotten)

695
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:12,630
(Jian Qing Fen)

696
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,240
I actually really forgot her number.
