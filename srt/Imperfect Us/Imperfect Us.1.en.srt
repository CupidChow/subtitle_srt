1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,910
Hey.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,080
What's your next goal?

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,449
To reach that goal,

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,250
how much pain do you have to go through?

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,859
Have you calculated that?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,789
What's the result of subtracting -8?

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,160
It's 22 plus 8.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,989
Yes.

9
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,829
So -15 plus 8 is...

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,059
It's equal to -7.

11
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,300
What did you say just now?

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:29,699
It's equal to -23.

13
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,339
Yes, then why did you do this?

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,640
And then you started planning for the next goal.

15
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,289
You started going through a lot of pain again.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,429
Finally, you achieved your goal.

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,929
But that happiness...

18
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,700
only lasts for a moment.

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,870
So have you realized?

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,709
"Happiness" is accumulated with "pain."

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,329
So...

22
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,299
Is it possible that we misunderstood ourselves?

23
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,236
I hope those whom I love and those who love me can all...

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,200
We think we're chasing happiness.

25
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,170
Be happy.

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,629
But actually,

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,469
what we really love might be the pain.

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,079
I hope this year will be...

29
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,010
very happy.

30
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,379
- Mom, can we have burgers today? - One!

31
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,120
- Don't talk to me now. - Two.

32
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,219
- I'm working. - Two!

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,020
- Okay, one. - One!

34
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,819
- Okay, two. - Two!

35
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,560
- Right. - One.

36
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,360
- I realized something recently. - One!

37
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,129
- Two. - Two!

38
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:14,900
It has been a long time since I felt really happy.

39
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,569
- One. - One!

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,669
It's probably because...

41
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,939
I don't know what else to pursue.

42
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,379
Let's go to the ER now.

43
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,319
Actually, everything is fine.

44
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,050
His wife can be a bit more annoying.

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,550
I'm just a little...

46
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,490
busy.

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,719
I'll be right there.

48
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,090
Why not?

49
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,360
It's up to 170 now.

50
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,259
I'm a little tired.

51
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,759
And a bit...

52
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:48,629
annoyed.

53
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,470
(Home, Missed call)

54
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,040
(Head of Family: I'll be late.)

55
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,740
He Bu Bu, stop fooling...

56
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,509
I'm really trying my best to amplify the small happiness.

57
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,079
But I know...

58
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,120
it's just the same.

59
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,120
Day after day.

60
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,399
So...

61
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,829
I think I should get my "day after day"...

62
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,139
a new goal to pursue.

63
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:34,009
Or maybe...

64
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:35,910
an imaginary enemy.

65
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:37,480
That's good too, right?

66
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,449
I must live a better life than her.

67
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,279
If I do that,

68
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,519
will I...

69
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,649
have a goal...

70
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,490
and pain?

71
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,089
And then...

72
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,029
will I be happy?

73
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,379
Rebecca

74
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,449
Every minute, every second

75
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,220
I look out the window

76
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,290
All through the night

77
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,329
Rebecca darling

78
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,829
I look out the window

79
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,300
All through the night

80
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:47,449
And then...

81
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,750
I thought of someone.

82
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,810
Does she have tattoos?

83
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,839
2019.

84
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,910
(Rebecca. Zhang, November 8, 2019, accomplished.)

85
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,830
Got you.

86
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,710
Hello.

87
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,450
I'm Jian Qing Fen reporting for duty.

88
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,549
Just a moment.

89
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,720
Thank you.

90
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,450
Hey.

91
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,090
A new colleague is reporting for duty.

92
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:21,769
What a coincidence.

93
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:28,909
I'll leave it on your desk.

94
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,210
Are you Jian Qing Fen?

95
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,450
That's me.

96
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,450
Hello.

97
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,519
I'm He Rui Zhi.

98
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,489
The manager assigned you to my team.

99
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,990
Hello, sir.

100
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,320
How about we go inside?

101
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:47,389
Okay.

102
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:48,730
Thank you.

103
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,309
The color of your hoodie is beautiful.

104
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,629
Let me show you the marketing and merchandising departments.

105
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Okay.

106
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,669
This is the manager's office.

107
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,139
They have the same birthday.

108
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,710
No wonder.

109
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,379
Sorry?

110
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,509
You have the same birthday...

111
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,300
as the lady who is dressed the same as you.

112
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,720
Exactly the same birthday?

113
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,750
No, Zhang Yi Jing is two years younger than you.

114
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,320
We all call her Rebecca.

115
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,829
She's from the marketing department.

116
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,460
There are two seats here.

117
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,559
Which one do you want?

118
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,289
Let me see.

119
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,529
(I like how it is now. Really. I don't miss being 20 or 30.)

120
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,309
(Back then... I was too dumb!)

121
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,639
So you knew.

122
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,690
(Back then... I was too dumb!)

123
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,535
Why haven't you gone to the site yet?

124
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,389
I'll be there soon.

125
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,830
Mr. You is there anyway.

126
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,100
Hey, we want to order Starbucks.

127
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,960
What do you want to drink?

128
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,830
We're not as lucky as you guys.

129
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,600
Why are you talking like that?

130
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,340
If you're worried, go there yourself.

131
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,716
Hey, Rebecca, you're still 50 dollars short.

132
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,570
I checked yesterday.

133
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,669
It's 150 dollars.

134
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
It's 200 dollars.

135
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:14,409
- Why? - Christine just said that.

136
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,710
- That's strange. - Hey.

137
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,120
Why haven't I received the press release yet?

138
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,789
Rebecca is in charge of that.

139
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,950
Give me half an hour.

140
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,460
Rebecca.

141
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,730
Hang on, you're all here.

142
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:28,929
So who is on the site?

143
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,000
Rebecca said she's going on her own.

144
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:32,799
Rebecca.

145
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,330
Why do you always do everything at the last minute?

146
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,840
What's wrong with you?

147
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,440
Winnie, go to the site.

148
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:47,809
Okay.

149
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,549
Jian Qing Fen.

150
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,379
What?

151
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,480
I'll get the car.

152
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:55,789
- Okay, I'm almost done. - This Rebecca.

153
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,120
She looks grumpy all day.

154
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,529
I'll get it from the merchandising department.

155
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,669
Get back to work, all right?

156
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,100
It's not like I haven't been scolded before.

157
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,080
Why should I act cute?

158
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,350
No, we're all colleagues.

159
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,179
Why do we have to act cute instead of communicating?

160
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,720
Why are you acting like this too?

161
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:41,899
Hi.

162
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,155
I just thought there are faster ways.

163
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,639
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

164
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,710
Okay, I'm too materialistic.

165
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,049
But you...

166
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,320
All right. What if...

167
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,720
How about this?

168
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:05,990
They owe me a favor.

169
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,259
I'll tell them directly.

170
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,460
I just think there are faster ways.

171
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,129
That's not what I mean.

172
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,176
I'm just worried that the merchandising department...

173
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,240
Hey.

174
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:22,710
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,769
It's okay.

176
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,080
It's not easy to date at work.

177
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,789
You...

178
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,760
You've only been here for less than a month, right?

179
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,320
How did you find out?

180
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,299
The day I joined the company.

181
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,029
Didn't you bump into Rebecca,

182
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,769
or rather, Rebecca bumped into you?

183
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,500
It doesn't matter.

184
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,240
Anyway, you didn't even apologize.

185
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,039
That means you're close.

186
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,269
Then I asked you...

187
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,039
if we had the exact same birthday.

188
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,956
You immediately said she's two years younger than me.

189
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,840
Isn't that...

190
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,539
You should work for the FBI.

191
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,580
Hey, I'm seriously considering studying psychology...

192
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,019
to become a psychotherapist or something.

193
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,889
Can you keep this a secret?

194
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,460
The higher-ups don't like this kind of relationship.

195
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,899
I see.

196
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,240
Sure.

197
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,299
No problem.

198
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,269
Can you do me a favor too?

199
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,139
What can I do for you?

200
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:37,620
Can you let me know what Rebecca will wear to work?

201
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,519
It's a bit embarrassing.

202
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,450
Right.

203
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,090
It's quite embarrassing.

204
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,459
Do you know where my car is parked?

205
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
The riverbank.

206
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,669
I'm all sweaty from walking.

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What a pity.

208
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,169
What's a pity?

209
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,909
You should just take a nice shower at your mistress' place.

210
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,625
You're the one who's up to something.

211
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,609
You turned off the computer as soon as I came in.

212
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:12,480
Here.

213
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:13,750
Take a look.

214
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Come on.

215
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,209
We haven't finished the cake?

216
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,460
Why did you buy such a big one?

217
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,559
It's because you like the bakery.

218
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,429
Who are you with?

219
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,000
Jealous?

220
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Not really.

221
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,330
I'm not okay with this at all.

222
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,439
This woman has curly hair.

223
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,940
Your wife has straight hair.

224
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
You're right.

225
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,710
Is Bu Bu in bed?

226
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,809
Of course.

227
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,889
I'll go wash off the smell of the mistress' perfume.

228
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,490
Yes.

229
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,129
You're not mistaken.

230
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,600
The one who ended up marrying He Rui Zhi...

231
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,830
was me.

232
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:06,269
But the story didn't end there.

233
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,879
Rebecca's days continued,

234
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
excitingly.

235
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,750
As for mine,

236
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,969
the usual day in and day out.

237
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,590
(Yu Xiang Li shared a photo with Rebecca. Zhang)

238
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:29,129
(Yu Xiang Li)

239
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,669
1993?

240
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:45,210
30 years old.

241
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,069
Why do you work so late again?

242
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,599
Give me a break.

243
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,200
I don't have the energy to go through all that crap again.

244
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,680
Hey.

245
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,250
What do you think if I get a tattoo?

246
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,819
Just a letter of the alphabet right here.

247
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,019
Go ahead.

248
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,160
You even got inflammation from ear piercing.

249
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,470
If you're not afraid, go ahead.

250
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,089
What are you doing?

251
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,220
What are you doing?

252
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,359
You scared me.

253
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,990
What are you doing?

254
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,430
Washing my hair. Why?

255
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,789
Let me help you.

256
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,930
Hey, what are you doing?

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,730
- Let me help you. - Stop it.

258
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,299
Bu Bu might hear you.

259
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,799
How do you usually deal with it then?

260
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,599
You jerk it off?

261
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,240
Jian Qing Fen, you're sick.

262
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,079
Go and see a doctor.

263
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,750
This is my married life with He Rui Zhi.

264
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,180
It's not bad.

265
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,049
It's just...

266
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,349
Too ordinary.

267
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,230
I just changed the bedsheet yesterday.

268
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,329
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
How about...

270
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,809
I change the bedsheet first before you continue?

271
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,380
Because...

272
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,049
It's actually...

273
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,119
a lot of work to wash bedsheets.

274
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,049
You know,

275
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,295
after it's dried in the dryer,

276
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,160
it has to be in the sun...

277
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,789
for it to be comfortable to sleep on.

278
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,329
After it's dried, it has to be ironed evenly.

279
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,930
And this bedspread has to be folded into squares.

280
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,529
It's really not an easy task.

281
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,240
There are elastic bands around the corners.

282
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,339
And then...

283
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,380
Every day, I have to be someone's...

284
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,210
wife,

285
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,079
mom,

286
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,609
daughter, daughter-in-law,

287
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,779
employee, and a good person who loves the earth.

288
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,750
I'm so tired.

289
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,690
You know what I mean, right?

290
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,440
Even the spring dreams that are so ordinary like day in and day out,

291
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,009
have begun again.

292
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,339
Why are you sleeping with a fanny pack?

293
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,849
I can clock in 30 minutes later today.

294
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,259
Do you want it?

295
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,930
Hurry up.

296
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,529
Bu Bu is waking up soon.

297
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,269
What time is it?

298
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,170
No one's up yet.

299
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,950
You forgot to lock the door again.

300
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,290
You're the one who forgot.

301
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,460
Who was the last one to come in yesterday?

302
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,089
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,539
It's all frozen food.

304
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,980
It's not nutritious at all.

305
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,849
Why are you up so early?

306
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,270
Ingredients are fresher at the market early in the morning.

307
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,950
Won't Bu Bu be late if he doesn't get up now?

308
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:37,589
He Yong Li.

309
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,359
It's time to get up.

310
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,630
Do you hear me?

311
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,190
It's so full.

312
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:46,059
What are you making for Bu Bu?

313
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:49,700
He likes to go to the breakfast shop to buy what he wants.

314
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,569
Then just make what he likes to eat.

315
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,039
The food out there is so dirty.

316
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:56,470
He should build up his immunity.

317
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,740
Mother, don't worry.

318
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,640
Bu Bu is my son. I won't kill him.

319
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,779
Besides, I've already told him.

320
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,159
Every Wednesday and Friday,

321
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,049
I'll let him eat out occasionally.

322
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,950
On other days,

323
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,750
I'll make him breakfast myself.

324
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:10,589
Bu Bu.

325
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,619
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

326
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,160
How about sandwiches?

327
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,900
I've already decided to have pork chop and omelet.

328
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,869
Watch your mouth.

329
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,970
Don't get me in trouble.

330
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Take it.

331
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,349
Bye, Grandma.

332
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,279
Listen to your teacher.

333
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:39,349
Okay.

334
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,619
He Yong Li.

335
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,690
Your water bottle.

336
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,990
Isn't Rui Zhi having breakfast?

337
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Mom.

338
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,289
I'm going to work.

339
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,906
Come on, just have breakfast before you go.

340
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,799
Actually, I should thank this old lady.

341
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:55,869
It's okay.

342
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,000
She always stirs up my will to fight.

343
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:01,470
Otherwise,

344
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:04,640
I might not even have anything to complain about in my life.

345
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,259
Alighting.

346
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,259
Alighting.

347
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,750
I'll ask Mr. He to contact you after his meeting.

348
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,250
Okay.

349
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,309
Yes.

350
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,250
Okay, no problem.

351
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,619
Okay, bye.

352
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,500
Hello?

353
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,069
No, I'm not Rebecca.

354
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,140
I am...

355
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,480
I'm sorry.

356
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,380
Mr. He is in a meeting right now.

357
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,910
What?

358
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,250
Maybe I should make him more approachable.

359
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,049
Hello.

360
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,720
Do you know where Rebecca is?

361
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,349
She's probably...

362
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,936
She's probably at the endorsement shoot today.

363
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,120
She's probably in the studio.

364
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,759
All right, thank you.

365
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,230
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,636
The point is, can this be resolved?

367
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,460
Can it be done before the anniversary sale?

368
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,269
Honestly, it's hard.

369
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:36,430
We've already guaranteed...

370
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,075
the shipping volume to the department store.

371
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,039
I'm really sorry.

372
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,940
What if we change it to pre-order?

373
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,339
What about the cost?

374
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,010
There's still the issue of compensation.

375
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,440
Hello, Mrs. He. I'm here.

376
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,750
Where are you?

377
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,380
Okay.

378
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,349
But I don't see you.

379
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,349
I'm here.

380
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,750
I'm waving. Can you see me?

381
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:54,880
I see you now.

382
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,720
She ran a red light.

383
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,025
Her motorcycle was carrying so much stuff.

384
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,960
It crashed right into us.

385
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,390
Mrs. He, are you okay?

386
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
Are you a family member?

387
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,730
No, I'm her son's colleague.

388
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,589
Where's He Rui Zhi?

389
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,859
He's still in a meeting.

390
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,259
What about Rabacca?

391
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,200
She's busy too.

392
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,630
Mrs. He, where are you hurt?

393
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,039
- She ran a red light. - It's just a fracture.

394
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,140
She just had an X-ray.

395
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,539
The doctor said I need surgery.

396
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,509
I'm scared of surgery.

397
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,339
Why isn't He Rui Zhi here yet?

398
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,210
Don't be scared.

399
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,609
We'll wait for him here.

400
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,880
I'll stay with you, okay?

401
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,349
She ran a red light.

402
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,720
Check the CCTV and you'll know if she ran a red light or not.

403
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,250
But can you be nicer?

404
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,190
What if she's your mom?

405
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,089
Be nicer to the elderly.

406
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Don't be scared.

407
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,859
Look. They put ice on it.

408
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,990
What's the point of raising a son?

409
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,829
You only see him after the surgery.

410
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,700
I was in a meeting.

411
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,700
You should thank Ms. Jian.

412
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,369
Ms. Jian.

413
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Thank you.

414
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,660
Thank you for your hard work.

415
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,009
It's nothing.

416
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:50,470
How about this?

417
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,710
Fine, whatever.

418
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,079
Mrs. He.

419
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,995
- She just had the surgery. - This pillow is very uncomfortable.

420
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,055
Okay, I'll adjust it for you.

421
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,390
Mom, Rebecca is here.

422
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,819
Please fix it.

423
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,190
Hello, Mrs. He.

424
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,460
Rui Zhi.

425
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,759
Make sure you remember this.

426
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:09,690
When I'm discharged,

427
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,059
you have to invite Ms. Jian over for dinner.

428
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,805
Okay, I'll make sure you get...

429
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,189
to show off your culinary skills when you get better, okay?

430
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,099
That's right.

431
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,400
I've often heard from Mr. He how good you are at cooking.

432
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,910
So, Mrs. He, you have to listen to the doctor and rest well.

433
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,440
That way, I can get to try your signature dish sooner.

434
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,509
But I've injured my muscles and bones.

435
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:31,480
It'll take at least a hundred days to heal.

436
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:32,650
But it's okay.

437
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,779
By then, I'll...

438
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,720
What's this smell?

439
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,619
I heard that having sea bass can heal wounds.

440
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,930
So I bought it from the market.

441
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,089
My mom doesn't eat fish.

442
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,599
It's so fishy.

443
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,400
Take it out.

444
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:50,630
My goodness.

445
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,170
Don't you know I don't eat fish?

446
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,116
The smell is making me puke.

447
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140
It smells so bad.

448
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,339
Help me open the window.

449
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,539
My goodness.

450
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,039
It smells so bad.

451
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:01,809
I'm almost throwing up.

452
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:05,920
Thank you.

453
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,049
Mother.

454
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,049
Yes?

455
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,420
Do you remember Rebecca?

456
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
I do.

457
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:45,160
It's Rabacca.

458
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:46,939
How many kids does she have?

459
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,930
She's not married yet.

460
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,900
And she has a boyfriend who is 10 years younger than her.

461
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:58,130
She's pretty.

462
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,269
She has a good figure and knows how to dress up.

463
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,710
Tell me.

464
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,079
Isn't human nature funny?

465
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,950
What you don't get...

466
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,650
is always more charming.

467
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,700
It is so for the irritating old woman.

468
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,099
And also for me.

469
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,079
What about He Rui Zhi?

470
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:42,849
Is it...

471
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,809
the same for him too?

472
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,910
Roast chicken.

473
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,479
We have to roast it on a high heat.

474
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,250
Mrs. He, please take a look.

475
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,559
Did I slice the scallions okay?

476
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,990
It's neat and tidy, but it's a bit fat.

477
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,690
Fat? What should I do?

478
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:58,089
It's okay.

479
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,230
It tastes the same anyway.

480
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,430
I see.

481
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,630
Okay, let me do it.

482
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
Mom.

483
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,689
I'll walk Rebecca to the station.

484
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,480
Hey, we're about to eat.

485
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,109
Don't make Ms. Jian wait.

486
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,480
It's just the MRT station.

487
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:16,380
We'll be back soon.

488
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,980
Mrs. He, I'll get going then.

489
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:19,689
Rebecca, aren't you going to eat with us?

490
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:21,119
She's visiting her older brother.

491
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,950
I see.

492
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:23,720
Bye.

493
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:24,789
Bye.

494
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,190
She should have left earlier.

495
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,899
Why did she drag it out until dinnertime?

496
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,859
How old is she? She's still so immature.

497
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,759
Qing Fen.

498
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,130
Yes?

499
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,269
I'll be right back.

500
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,599
Sure, no problem.

501
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,290
What's the matter with Rebecca's older brother?

502
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,380
He was raised by a dysfunctional family.

503
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,809
How can he be normal?

504
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,029
You've arrived?

505
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,759
Don't fight then.

506
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:08,829
Don't cry.

507
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,029
Okay.

508
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,369
Let me know what time you're taking the bus back.

509
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,240
Hey.

510
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,539
Don't forget to buy my mom's favorite pastries.

511
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,779
Be good.

512
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:26,849
Bye.

513
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,150
I'm sorry.

514
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,089
It's okay.

515
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,240
Sorry, it's a bit wet.

516
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,299
Leave that to me.

517
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
Thank you.

518
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:57,609
Excuse me.

519
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:06,990
It seems like...

520
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,690
you're having...

521
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,390
a hard time.

522
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,470
Well, Rebecca and Mrs. He.

523
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,299
Yes.

524
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:20,299
The two people I love the most don't get along.

525
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,009
But Rebecca doesn't seem bothered.

526
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,910
It's good that she's a bit slow in that sense.

527
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,079
Otherwise, my mom can sometimes be a bit too...

528
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:34,079
It's because she's insensitive, that's why...

529
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,549
She doesn't know...

530
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:37,059
I can't really find the right words.

531
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,190
How to interact with the elderly?

532
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:42,169
In that aspect, you're very different from her.

533
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:43,890
I'm two years older than her.

534
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,810
So two years ago, you were just as insensitive?

535
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,329
No.

536
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,400
But at least I won't forget that your mom doesn't eat fish.

537
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,509
That's right.

538
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Why?

539
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,539
How can she forget that?

540
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,349
Have you thought about what to do if you were to get married?

541
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,719
That's right.

542
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,019
What do I do?

543
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,659
What do I do?

544
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,329
Steal him from her.

545
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,500
Quit messing around.

546
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,615
That's right. He already has a girlfriend.

547
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,369
So what?

548
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,469
He's not married yet.

549
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:32,139
And his girlfriend doesn't sound okay.

550
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,940
What if he's your boyfriend?

551
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,110
Everyone is selfish.

552
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,210
Qing Fen, go get him. I'll cheer you on.

553
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,550
Don't incite her.

554
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,849
I can't.

555
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,590
He loves his girlfriend very much.

556
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,719
All the good men are taken.

557
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,789
Well, everyone.

558
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,580
Today is the birthday of our new colleague,

559
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,760
Jian Qing Fen.

560
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,630
Let's celebrate together.

561
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,269
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

562
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,199
Let us help you.

563
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:01,269
Are you an Aquarius?

564
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,385
Yes, my rising sign is Gemini and my moon sign is Capricorn.

565
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:04,440
Thank you, Qing Fen.

566
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,256
- I think it's your birthday too. - Is it chocolate?

567
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,510
- Is that right? - Cake!

568
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:09,825
- Let's celebrate together. - So cool!

569
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:10,750
It looks yummy!

570
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:11,809
Join us.

571
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:12,920
This cake looks so good.

572
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Hey, don't hold it so tilted. You might spill it.

573
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,166
- Let's order some coffee. - How about we...

574
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,449
Everyone, let's have some cake.

575
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,960
- Okay. - Sure.

576
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:20,920
Help me give those two.

577
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,829
So you and Rebecca have the same birthday.

578
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,580
It's just the same month and day.

579
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,660
The biggest piece is for you.

580
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,980
You like to relax here too.

581
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,059
Mr. He bought the cake.

582
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,599
He said you like this bakery.

583
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:17,409
It's so sunny.

584
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,519
The cream has melted.

585
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,150
I'm going downstairs.

586
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,719
Happy birthday.

587
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,849
Happy birthday.

588
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:50,579
Go to the back. This way.

589
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,849
Hurry up.

590
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Run.

591
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,320
Are the clothes still in the washing machine?

592
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,750
I'll be right there.

593
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,389
Right there my foot.

594
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:03,460
Mom is swearing.

595
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,900
No, not this way.

596
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,269
Just leave it. I'll do it later.

597
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,610
I died.

598
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,570
Let's play tomorrow.

599
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,039
Tidy up.

600
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,409
Or you'll get me in trouble.

601
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:21,909
Fine.

602
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,010
I'm coming.

603
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:27,579
So He Rui Zhi will hang up the laundry.

604
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,320
Do you want a trophy?

605
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,849
No, it's my honor.

606
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,599
I forgot to lock the door.

607
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:34,659
It's locked.

608
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,020
As expected of Jian Qing Fen.

609
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Hey.

610
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,099
Can you ask your mom for the spare key?

611
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,869
I feel so insecure.

612
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:52,409
I feel like when we go to work,

613
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,960
your mom definitely checks our rooms.

614
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,780
She's not that bored.

615
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,019
She just thought it'd be easier to drop in if anything happened.

616
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,920
I have my mom's spare key too.

617
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,420
She thinks this house is hers.

618
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
What?

619
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,230
I told you.

620
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,260
Soak the pot in water after you eat.

621
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,900
It's so hard to scrub the sukiyaki pot.

622
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,130
You scrub it.

623
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,699
That's great.

624
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:20,940
I love scrubbing pots.

625
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:09,920
(Rebecca. Zhang)

626
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:15,690
(There are surprises every day!)

627
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:21,589
Qing Fen, have you filled out the group purchase form?

628
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:23,429
Oh, right.

629
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,480
Sunny.

630
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,550
Yes?

631
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,550
What do you think...

632
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,949
about winning 18 million dollars...

633
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,700
and getting surprises every day?

634
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,329
18 million dollars?

635
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,360
I'll invest half of it first.

636
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,900
Money makes money.

637
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,530
Then,

638
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,630
you can buy whatever you want.

639
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,369
Buy whatever I want?

640
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,956
(There are surprises every day!)

641
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,010
That's great.

642
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:27,659
Okay.

643
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,829
Thanks.

644
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,900
Sure.

645
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,840
To possess 18 million dollars...

646
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,269
and every day that is full of surprises...

647
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,809
What kind of life is that, exactly?

648
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,750
Before yet another usual day ends,

649
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:49,650
I suddenly feel a bit frustrated.

650
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,559
That isn't my favorite bakery.

651
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,130
It was Rebecca's.

652
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,039
Are you looking for trouble because your days are too easy?

653
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,269
I've held it in for 12 years.

654
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,110
I finally feel better now.

655
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:33,969
Do you want fried chicken?

656
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Okay.

657
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,469
Beef curry with rice.

658
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
What else?

659
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,000
Okay, I know.

660
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:53,880
Why would I be angry?

661
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,380
I'm heading into the restaurant.

662
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:28,449
Bye.

663
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,710
Hi.
