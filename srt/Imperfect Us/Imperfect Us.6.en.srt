1
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:15,579
How are you?

2
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,450
Fine.

3
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,359
How is your mom?

4
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:30,979
Fortunately, you were there.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,239
It's just...

6
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,840
that when I saw those keys,

7
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,040
I didn't know what to do.

8
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,099
So...

9
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,109
Are you okay?

10
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,390
It is how it is.

11
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,890
I'm trying to satisfy...

12
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,159
all the people who love me.

13
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,689
That's good.

14
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,930
Those who are capable do more work.

15
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,419
You did the right thing by breaking up with me.

16
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,610
That was ages ago.

17
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,920
Are you still holding a grudge?

18
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:28,889
I mean,

19
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,460
by doing that, you'll always be the smile in my heart.

20
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,469
Hey, have you thought about it?

21
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,210
Where does consciousness come from?

22
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,379
Why is it always awake?

23
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,889
Buddhists say,

24
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,530
"Everything comes from the heart."

25
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,560
It's our hearts...

26
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:18,800
that remember everything.

27
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,280
And from that, everything is created.

28
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,750
Then,

29
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,879
what does Jian Qing Fen's heart...

30
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,319
remember?

31
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,629
It's Qing Fen,

32
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,529
she insisted on taking me to the movies.

33
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:55,600
That's so nice.

34
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,069
You even went to the movies.

35
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:57,870
What?

36
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,740
I couldn't understand the plot.

37
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,209
I even wore 3D glasses.

38
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,310
And the snow would fall down like this.

39
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,779
It looks so real.

40
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,709
Mrs. He, can you ask him if he got the estimate?

41
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,759
Why don't you ask him yourself?

42
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,930
Hey, did you get the estimate?

43
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,730
I got it.

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,899
Thank you.

45
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,329
Sure, you're welcome.

46
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:30,569
By the way,

47
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,199
do you know Daniel was headhunted?

48
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:35,310
Yes.

49
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,569
Kun told me.

50
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,310
Everyone says you'll definitely take over his position.

51
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,779
It looks like...

52
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,779
you'll be transferred back soon.

53
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,079
Really?

54
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,420
Or...

55
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,770
do you want to stay in Shanghai?

56
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,759
No.

57
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,136
I have to go back sooner or later.

58
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,320
If not, how will my mom cope?

59
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,959
Anyway, Kun has a girlfriend in Shanghai.

60
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:59,399
He wants to stay in Shanghai.

61
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,329
Really?

62
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Then...

63
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
What about you?

64
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Me?

65
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,910
No, I...

66
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,970
He Rui Zhi!

67
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,649
Did you learn to drive?

68
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,790
Yes. It's easier to get around if I drive.

69
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,949
I can take Mrs. He to the market...

70
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,396
or pick up medicine at the hospital.

71
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,189
Let me do it.

72
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,350
Hey, I was so nervous during the driving test.

73
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,120
Gosh, my hands were shaking when I held the steering wheel.

74
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:26,889
Do you want me to drive?

75
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,959
Thank you.

76
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
Thank you...

77
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,029
for everything.

78
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Why don't you drive then?

79
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,839
Like those two...

80
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,810
in the merchandising department,

81
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,625
they were fired when they were caught dating.

82
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,079
But you and He Rui Zhi are fine.

83
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,420
That was Xiao Xiang.

84
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,295
- I'm not his girlfriend! - Xiao Xiang was caught...

85
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:54,990
dating that guy.

86
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,326
You're not his girlfriend, but you're staying at his house?

87
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,089
I'm really not.

88
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,389
I'm just there to keep Mrs. He company.

89
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,459
So you're...

90
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,329
A domestic helper.

91
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,389
A domestic helper.

92
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,930
So are you or are you not?

93
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,069
Do you want another one?

94
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,850
(Resignation Application Form)

95
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,490
To avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

96
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,370
I remember all the painstaking efforts.

97
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,310
I remember the humiliation.

98
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,059
And from that, it created my consciousness.

99
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,180
My consciousness told me...

100
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,720
that I'm not his smile.

101
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,435
(That smile in his heart... I really love this role.)

102
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,759
I'm just his...

103
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
Thank you.

104
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,269
Good morning.

105
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:25,819
You're not staying with my mom?

106
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,289
Are you going to Shanghai again?

107
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,550
No.

108
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,220
Then you can stay with your mom.

109
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,990
If I continue to stay here,

110
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,596
even if you're not afraid of being misunderstood,

111
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,696
what if I can't get married?

112
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,889
Marry me then.

113
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,570
But we haven't even...

114
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,210
started dating yet.

115
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,539
Is it too soon?

116
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
Hey.

117
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,750
The box.

118
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,879
Right.

119
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,200
I don't think I need...

120
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,500
to do that awkward one-knee proposal, right?

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,769
I'm sorry. This is the right finger.

122
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,669
I think it's too small.

123
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,539
Hey.

124
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:08,909
Be careful.

125
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,679
It's too small.

126
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,519
You'll hurt your hand.

127
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,580
I can do it.

128
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,025
I'll exchange it for a bigger one.

129
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,590
I can really fit it in.

130
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,059
Be careful.

131
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,600
But I know...

132
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,070
I didn't win.

133
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:39,279
It's all because my enemy...

134
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,309
Forfeited.

Rebecca Zhang from Taiwan.

She's almost 40 years old,

149
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,740
but she claims to have the physique of a 25-year-old.

150
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,419
Goodness. Not bad.

151
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,259
Hey.

152
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,679
(Thank you, the Rebecca from 12 years ago.)

153
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,049
Should I thank Jian Qing Fen from 12 years ago?

Can we not have fast food again tomorrow?

160
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:52,710
I thought you liked it?

161
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:56,509
But I don't like having fast food every day.

162
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,149
Do you think I like bathing your grandma every day?

163
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,190
I want to eat scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

164

Bu Bu.

166
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,870
Grandma, do you want some chicken nuggets?

167
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,750
But I don't want to be trapped in this house day after day.

168
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,720
I also want to gossip with my colleagues.

169
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,519
I want to dress up to meet clients.

170
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,350
I also look forward...

171
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,659
to that joyful feeling of leaving the office on Fridays.

174

176
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,090
I will fall...

177
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,159
That's all I'm asking.

178
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,360
I will fall...

179
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,360
Can you put your hand here?

180
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,460
You can use this hand.

181
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,059
You can still move this hand, right?

182
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,000
Just hold on to it.

183
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,360
Don't pull me!

184
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,529
- I'll fall... - You're making a mess.

185
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,870
How am I supposed to wipe you?

186
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,169
I'm sorry...

187
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,539
Don't apologize to me.

188
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,610
Mom, don't scold Grandma.

189
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,509
Please, I'm begging you, okay?

190
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,679
Just hold on tight.

191
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,779
Don't move.

192
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,679
There's a mess on the wall.

193
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,950
Mom, what should I do?

194
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,779
- I think I stepped on poop. - I'm sorry.

195
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,149
Why are you crying?

196
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,519
I should be the one crying.

197
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,019
- I'm sorry... - Me!

198
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,019
Mom, I think I stepped on poop.

199
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:47,960
Don't pull me!

200
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,029
How can I...

201
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,070
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,139
In my utterly terrible...

203
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,850
and mundane life,

204
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,850
my enemy hasn't revealed...

205
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,549
a word about her life for some time.

206
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,320
So I can only look at her smile over and over again.

207
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:53,960
And her victory.

208
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,070
The current contestant is...

209
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,100
Rebecca Zhang from Taiwan.

210
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,940
She's almost 40 years old.

211
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,509
The current contestant is...

212
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,509
Rebecca Zhang from Taiwan.

213
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,149
She's almost 40 years old,

214
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,525
but she claims to have the physique of a 25-year-old.

215
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,549
Take one.

216
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,620
I'm not...

217
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:28,289
Take one.

218
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,789
Suddenly,

219
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,700
I understood a language I didn't know at all.

220
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,830
She said,

221
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,000
"How are you?"

222
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,409
"Can I give you a hug?"

223
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,379
Thank you.

224
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,330
(9:30am, follow-up checkup)

225
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,369
I'm going to the office for a meeting.

226
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,030
I should be able to pick you up in time.

227
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,839
Thank you.

228
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,099
Thank you for your hard work.

229
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,720
Mrs. He.

230
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:29,920
What's your name?

231
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,119
He Wei Shui Mei.

232
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,259
Okay.

233
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,430
Let's see.

234
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,910
Her lungs sound fine.

235
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Okay.

236
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,670
Come on.

237
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Raise your arms.

238
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,579
Okay, put it down.

239
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,750
Hold my hand.

240
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,849
Squeeze harder.

241
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,519
Okay.

242
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:08,690
Switch to your left hand.

243
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,190
Here.

244
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,730
Hold my hand.

245
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,230
Come on.

246
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:14,529
Harder.

247
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,400
Very good. You've improved.

248
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,369
Continue with the rehabilitation.

249
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,470
You've taken good care of Mrs. He.

250
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,249
She smells good whenever she's here.

251
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,720
You're really awesome.

252
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,869
To my beloved enemy.

253
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,940
Congratulate me.

254
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,910
I finally found a new goal...

255
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,009
for my trapped life.

256
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,549
Castella cake.

257
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,009
It's good.

258
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,180
It's really delicious.

259
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,150
Taste this.

260
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:13,890
Okay.

261
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,430
Is it good?

262
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Yes.

263
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,039
It's good.

264
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,539
Yes.

265
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:34,180
It's like the likes you collect on social media.

266
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,880
Even if it's just a passing compliment...

267
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,849
from a passerby,

268
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,650
that little bit of strength...

269
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,359
is enough for me to face tomorrow with courage.

270
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,990
Let's take a photo.

271
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,509
When I was bathing her yesterday,

272
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:04,210
I vaguely felt that her left hand touched me.

273
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,079
It was as if she was consciously trying to touch me.

274
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,910
Then I thought,

275
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,426
"Am I too tired? Am I seeing things?"

276
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,319
But as I continued to observe,

277
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,579
after giving her a bath...

278
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,856
- Mrs. He, here. - She really did touch me.

279
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,019
Come on, hold my hand.

280
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,089
Come on.

281
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,349
Harder.

282
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:18,390
Squeeze hard.

283
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,490
You can do it, Mother.

284
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,329
Come on, harder.

285
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,059
Yes.

286
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,490
- Do you see it? - Yes.

287
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,859
Yes, it's good. Look.

288
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,035
Helping Mrs. He with physical therapy every day...

289
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,000
Is Dr. Lu still busy?

290
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:28,900
He's just next door.

291
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,970
I see.

292
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,599
Hi, Dr. Lu.

293
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,869
Hi, how are you?

294
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,515
Sorry, I was just changing the dressing.

295
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:35,269
I see.

296
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:36,539
You look handsome today.

297
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:37,710
Do I?

298
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,240
How are you, Mrs. He?

299
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,809
Are you getting better?

300
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,579
Dr. Lu.

301
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,686
- Did you hear her? - Hello.

302
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,319
She's greeting you.

303
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,380
Hello, Mrs. He.

304
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,265
You're talking more energetically now.

305
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,049
Yes.

306
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,119
But...

307
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:52,819
You abandoned me.

308
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,960
(Rebecca. Zhang)

309
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,539
(This account no longer exists or you could have been blocked.)

310
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,400
That's so cruel.

311
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,599
Because having no enemies...

312
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,210
is lonelier...

313
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,380
than having no friends.

314
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:24,690
(164 days later)

315
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,390
After you disappeared for 164 days...

316
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm free.

317
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,289
He Rui Zhi.

318
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,630
Mother.

319
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
What's wrong?

320
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:21,609
Nothing.

321
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Everything's fine.

322
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,319
By the way,

323
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,660
Mom's death registration...

324
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,770
I'll handle that tomorrow.

325
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,430
Thank you.

326
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,730
(9:30am, follow-up checkup)

327
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,670
Number 68.

328
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,900
He Wei Shui Mei.

329
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:20,369
Please come in.

330
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,970
Mrs. He, long time no see.

331
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,269
Number 67, Zhang Xiu Lan.

332
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,099
Are you working hard on your rehabilitation?

333
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,789
I thought...

334
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,720
I should come and tell you.

335
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,590
My mother-in-law passed away peacefully.

336
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,660
Thank you for taking care of her.

337
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,430
Don't mention it.

338
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,769
It's what I should do.

339
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Thank you.

340
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:15,859
Mrs. He's family!

341
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,829
Mrs. He's family!

342
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,359
Mrs. He's...

343
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,109
Well...

344
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,519
Well...

345
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:47,289
After my wife...

346
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,329
survived a traffic accident,

347
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,606
I took care of her for eight years.

348
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,630
So...

349
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,099
If you think there are some things...

350
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,680
that no one understands...

351
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,460
I might understand.

352
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,720
(New Contact: One Like)

353
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,890
My conscious tells me,

354
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,890
she said,

355
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,430
"How are you?"

356
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,529
"Can I give you a hug?"

357
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,700
I said, "Thank you."

358
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,470
"I'm fine."

359
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,140
But you know what?

360
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,069
I recently found a good way to bathe them.

361
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,109
It's to find a big platform like this.

362
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,380
Then, remove the board on top and replace it with a net.

363
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,720
That way, it's convenient to give them a bath...

364
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,789
or wash their bottoms when they have diarrhea.

365
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,019
The water will drip down.

366
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,289
The point is,

367
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,589
the platform has to be about 40cm high.

368
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,420
Like this.

369
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,289
When they move from the wheelchair,

370
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,599
it'll be just the right height.

371
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
Wait.

372
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:09,900
It'll slide?

373
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,500
I forgot.

374
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,170
I forgot to add lever lock brakes.

375
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,779
Why am I so dumb?

376
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,009
I...

377
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
It's okay.

378
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,119
It's all right.

379
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,849
You've done enough.

380
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,049
Stop blaming yourself.

381
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Really?

382
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,230
But I had wanted to strangle her every day.

383
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,009
I get it.

384
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,980
I understand.

385
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,680
I ask myself hundreds of times every day.

386
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,660
"Why aren't you dead yet?"

387
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,390
I know.

388
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,930
I get it.

389
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,200
I ask myself every day.

390
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,579
"What if it's Rebecca?"

391
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,559
"Would it have been different?"

392
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:23,630
(Another 85 days later)

393
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:25,369
He Bu Bu.

394
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,500
Wake up.

395
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,079
Last time,

396
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,480
I saw Zhang Rui Di and his mom...

397
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,750
holding hands on his way to school.

398
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,519
And he was acting cute.

399
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,250
Our class president,

400
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,220
Zhou Yu Xin saw that and he said,

401
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,089
"Zhang Rui Di, are you a mama's boy?"

402
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,089
And Zhang Rui Di cried.

403
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,280
No wonder you only let me walk you to the traffic lights lately.

404
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,949
You're afraid of being called a mama's boy too, right?

405
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,359
That's right.

406
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:56,569
Hey.

407
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,700
Your dad is here.

408
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:58,769
Hurry up.

409
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,799
I'm not done yet.

410
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,440
Mom.

411
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:07,609
Who are you spending the weekend with?

412
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,950
Don't worry, I have a lot of friends.

413
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,119
I'll be happy without you.

414
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:13,549
Come on, hurry up.

415
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,720
Dad.

416
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:20,490
Where should we go first?

417
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:23,829
Have you eaten?

418
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,859
I did. I ate a lot.

419
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,299
Where do you want to go?

420
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,130
Let's go catch some bugs first.

421
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,299
Hey, He Rui Zhi.

422
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,339
What's up?

423
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,349
My sister-in-law is treating us to lunch this Sunday.

424
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,920
Can you join us?

425
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:55,390
Maybe not yet.

426
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
Sorry.

427
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,190
It's okay.

428
00:30:58,259 --> 00:30:59,329
I was just asking.

429
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,029
Bye, Bu Bu.

430
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:02,369
Bye, Mom.

431
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,339
Hurry up, Dad.

432
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm sorry.

433
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:53,680
Let me sit down for a while.

434
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,750
Don't mind me.

435
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Thank you.

436
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Thank you.

437
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,650
I slept with someone else.

438
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,970
Was it good?

439
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,250
I feel better now.

440
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:30,849
Dad.

441
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,049
What's wrong?

442
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,619
I have a question.

443
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,430
Is it math?

444
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,359
No.

445
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,430
Did you move to Grandma's house...

446
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,230
because Mom did something wrong?

447
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,710
Who said that?

448
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:02,309
Mom.

449
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,920
Maybe I...

450
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,320
was at fault too.

451
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,329
We all make mistakes.

452
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,860
But didn't you tell me...

453
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,429
that we can be forgiven if we admit our mistakes?

454
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,539
So will you forgive Mom?

455
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:40,679
Go play video games.

456
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,260
Hold a tall-kneeling posture.

457
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,260
Tall-kneeling.

458
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:34,300
Tall-kneeling posture.

459
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:35,570
And look forward.

460
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:37,909
Look forward.

461
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:39,309
Lift your right foot.

462
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,610
Right foot.

463
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,909
When you're stable,

464
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,340
put your hands on your right knee.

465
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,090
Then pull yourself up.

466
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,630
Thank you.

467
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,690
Thank you.

468
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,099
Yu Xiang Li?

469
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:09,909
I am...

470
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,280
He Yong Li's mom.

471
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,679
Your brother,

472
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,679
he's my son's coach.

473
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,155
Don't you come here often to fill in for him?

474
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,619
It's this place, right?

475
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,949
I think I've seen you before.

476
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:27,260
How's your girlfriend?

477
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,059
She's...

478
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,130
She's fine.

479
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Do you know each other?

480
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,530
Yes.

481
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:37,945
Yes, she's a friend from a long time ago.

482
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,969
But we don't keep in touch much lately.

483
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
She's fine, right?

484
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,170
Very well.

485
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,610
What a coincidence.

486
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,710
What a coincidence.

487
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:53,849
Then...

488
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,519
Be careful.

489
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,820
Sure, okay.

490
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:00,659
I'll get going.

491
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,260
Einstein said...

492
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,329
Bye.

493
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,760
"Coincidence is God's way of staying anonymous."

494
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,730
The New Age Movement says,

495
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,239
"Coincidence is the law of attraction."

496
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:18,510
And the Buddhists say,

497
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,739
"It's all in the mind."

498
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,550
I say,

499
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,679
"This is great."

500
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,820
"My enemy..."

501
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,289
"She is well."

502
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:38,549
It seems that Rui Zhi hasn't been to the gatherings for a long time.

503
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,829
There's an event at Bu Bu's school.

504
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,960
He has to attend it.

505
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,345
I asked Rui Zhi to take him there.

506
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,170
Otherwise, he'll want to come here.

507
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,230
When are we having cake?

508
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,940
Go to your dad for cake.

509
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,800
You're turning 15 years old.

510
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,340
Honey, go get the cake.

511
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:50,440
Okay.

512
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,940
I'll get the cake.

513
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,639
Why can't he take the day off?

514
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,820
I could have rescheduled it for yesterday if you told me.

515
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,150
Gosh.

516
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,019
It's my fault.

517
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,250
I got the dates wrong.

518
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,920
Rui Zhi scolded me for that.

519
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,860
Hey, is his old house still for sale?

520
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,219
Don't sell the old house.

521
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:08,760
They should sell their apartment.

522
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,860
There's more space in the old house.

523
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,976
- Yes, we've been discussing it. - Sir, the cake.

524
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,400
The cake is here.

525
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,329
Hooray! Let's eat the cake.

526
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,900
Happy birthday, my dear sister.

527
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:21,715
Why isn't it a Mille Crepe cake?

528
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:22,769
Hey, Mom. Give it to me.

529
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,739
Jian Bao, the candles.

530
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,610
Because Grandma said that your aunt likes this cake.

531
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,409
Yes.

532
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,639
I don't.

533
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,050
You really like cream cakes.

534
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,110
Don't you know?

535
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,150
One time, it was Jian Qing Hui's birthday.

536
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:37,889
His dad got him a cream cake and put it in the fridge.

537
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,190
When he came home from school and opened the fridge...

538
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,760
There was only an empty box.

539
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,860
It was such a big cream cake.

540
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:47,059
Your aunt ate it all.

541
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,570
That's right. I cried the whole night.

542
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,530
Dad, you cried too?

543
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,769
- Yes. - That's right.

544
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:56,010
Your dad was a crybaby when he was little.

545
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,909
Hey, Jian Qing Fen.

546
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,409
He Rui Zhi is a good husband.

547
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,409
After your brother told him about that story,

548
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,949
he kept laughing and laughing.

549
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,449
Then he told me that in the future,

550
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,820
whenever it's your birthday,

551
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,989
he'll prepare a cream cake for you.

552
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,989
That's right. He Rui Zhi treats you really well.

553
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,159
Here.

554
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,019
Hey.

555
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,130
Light the candles.

556
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,889
I need to record this. Wait a second.

557
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,500
Are you ready?

558
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,460
How do I press it?

559
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,530
Over here.

560
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,630
I'm lighting them.

561
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,199
Are you ready?

562
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:34,010
Isn't it amazing?

563
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,079
It's amazing.

564
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,480
Happy birthday, Qing Fen.

565
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,820
My consciousness...

566
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,059
made me gaze at my enemy on the other side...

567
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,130
while I focused on looking ahead on the runway.

568
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,130
That's why...

569
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,829
I tripped over myself.

570
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
I caught all the balls...

571
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:13,719
- that Dad threw at me. - Really?

572
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,920
Even a bouncing ball.

573
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,289
That's amazing.

574
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,489
Are you that excited to go out with your dad?

575
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,889
You're all sweaty. Go take a shower.

576
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,730
Can I bring my baseball mitt to school tomorrow?

577
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,860
Sure.

578
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:28,360
Hooray!

579
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:29,429
Gosh.

580
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,670
Can we talk?

581
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,119
If you want a divorce,

582
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,789
I'm fine with it.

583
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,000
But for Bu Bu's sake,

584
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,230
I hope...

585
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,099
If so, how could you do that?

586
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,269
If you ever thought about Bu Bu for a moment,

587
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:13,880
how could you possibly...

588
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:27,519
So you want a divorce?

589
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:32,429
You love him?

590
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,860
How is that love?

591
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:36,699
If that's not love, then what is it?

592
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,920
If you want a divorce,

593
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,059
then do it.

594
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,730
He Rui Zhi.

595
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,000
I just want an answer.

596
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:16,769
At that time,

597
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,079
was it because she gave up?

598
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
Who?

599
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:31,889
This.

600
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,190
Whose ring size was it?

601
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:47,599
My mom took the ring you left in the bathroom.

602
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,639
She said it was too big.

603
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,800
It always slipped out when you washed your hands.

604
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,739
Well, at that time,

605
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,170
I suddenly wanted to take a break.

606
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,380
Yes, I've been looking for a job lately.

607
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,079
Do you want to come back to work?

608
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,219
My performance was so bad.

609
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,679
So are we, okay?

610
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,019
Hi, I'm Sunny.

611
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,019
I get nagged all the time.

612
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,789
- Okay. - Anyway, I just think...

613
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,090
that I'll still get paid even though I'm nagged at.

614
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:42,989
- Yes. - That's right.

615
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:44,230
Just be thick-skinned.

616
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,829
How much bonus did you get last year?

617
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,760
Sunny got more.

618
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:48,960
She got six months' worth.

619
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,769
As for me...

620
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:50,829
Three months?

621
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:52,699
Yes. Only three months for me too.

622
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,940
Be content, ladies.

623
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,186
A lot of us don't even get a month's worth of bonus.

624
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,239
I'm very grateful.

625
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:58,940
Otherwise, why would I still be here?

626
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:01,510
My poor client.

627
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:02,750
She's only 40 years old.

628
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:04,925
She wanted to buy a pension plan from me.

629
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:05,610
But in the end,

630
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:06,825
after she got a health checkup...

631
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:07,849
Breast cancer.

632
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,179
What?

633
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,619
- Forty years old? - Yes.

634
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,765
Luckily, she bought medical insurance.

635
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:14,860
There are many people in this world named Zhang Yi Jing.

636
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,590
There must be plenty...

637
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,130
of 40-year-old Zhang Yi Jings.

638
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,199
Rebecca!

639
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,570
So she would never...

640
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,739
And she can't be...

641
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,539
My enemy on the other side.

642
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:43,789
Rebecca!
