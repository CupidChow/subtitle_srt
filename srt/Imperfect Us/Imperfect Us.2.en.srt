1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,779
(Trap a cat in the same box with poison.)

2
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:16,649
(If the cat eats the poison, it will die.)

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,820
(It's also likely that the cat doesn't eat the poison, )

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,989
(and it's still alive.)

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,199
(So before the box is opened, )

6
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,769
(the cat can be in a state of superposition, alive, or dead.)

7
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:35,909
(If "superposition" can be a metaphor...)

8
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,039
(for "parallel realities"...)

9
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:46,990
(What is it that got...)

10
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:54,990
(the current you here at this place now?)

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,060
Hi.

12
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,200
(What is it that got...)

13
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,060
(the current you here at this place now?)

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,810
My dearest Rebecca,

15
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,510
are you still in bed?

16
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,609
Hey, listen.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,980
Do you have time to come to my office today?

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,349
Let's have a chat.

19
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,409
I'm free all day.

20
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:18,950
Yi Jing.

21
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,120
I'm Si Wei.

22
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,859
If you can find someone to take over,

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,030
I want to quit my job.

24
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,989
Please don't quit.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,299
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,329
I'm just really stressed out.

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,000
Besides,

28
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:37,069
this really isn't the life I want.

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,939
What do you want then?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,010
Last night, my boyfriend and I had a big fight.

31
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,540
He said that if I keep going on like this,

32
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,739
he's going to break up with me.

33
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,609
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,079
I'll wrap up the proposal for the fashion show event,

35
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,250
the materials for the first location scouting,

36
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,825
and the brands that have signed up so far.

37
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,060
I'll sort them all out.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,219
By the way, earlier on...

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,400
Gosh.

40
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,500
What is it?

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,299
It's so early in the morning.

42
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,830
You're still not up?

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,740
What is it?

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Gosh.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
You're so lucky.

46
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,110
Here's the thing.

47
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,110
Let me tell you.

48
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,939
Just say it here.

49
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,039
Okay.

50
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,710
I'm telling you.

51
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,180
I can't rent this house to you in September.

52
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,999
What do you mean? Didn't we just renew the contract?

53
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,650
No.

54
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,090
It's because my youngest son's girlfriend...

55
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,765
is pregnant and they are getting married.

56
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,789
As you know,

57
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,060
my wife and I,

58
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,205
my daughter and my youngest son,

59
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,729
we all live downstairs together.

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,306
We are already fighting over the toilet.

61
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,346
And now, we have a daughter-in-law.

62
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,430
When I said I'd pay for the new paint and flooring,

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,060
why didn't you have toilet issues then?

64
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,469
How would I know that in three months, he got her...

65
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,216
Do you think I want to be a grandpa so soon?

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,340
All right, I get it.

67
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:51,409
I'm in a hurry to go out.

68
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,879
No, I need to explain this to you.

69
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,080
I know.

70
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,080
(There are issues every day)

71
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,560
(There are surprises every day!)

72
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,235
(Rebecca. Zhang, There are surprises every day!)

73
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,629
Hey.

74
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,360
What's your next goal?

75
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,400
(UUIN, finally done!!!)

76
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,960
To reach that goal,

77
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,000
how much pain do you have to go through?

78
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,770
Have you calculated that?

79
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,316
(Yu Xiang Li shared a photo with Rebecca. Zhang)

80
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,610
So...

81
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,770
Is it possible that we misunderstood ourselves?

82
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,439
He's breaching the contract, right?

83
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,509
We think we're chasing happiness.

84
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,080
But actually,

85
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,849
what we really love might be the pain.

86
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,889
I'm getting old soon, but I'm still so immature.

87
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,650
- Hurry up, everyone. - Hurry up.

88
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,120
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

89
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:39,189
I'll call you later.

90
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,229
Cream cake.

91
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,289
Right?

92
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,030
I'm very thoughtful.

93
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,599
My birthday was ages ago.

94
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,069
Gosh, I don't care.

95
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,439
This whole month is Rebecca's month, right?

96
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,569
- Yes. - Rebecca's month!

97
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,009
Gosh. Rebecca, I don't care!

98
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,139
You have to help me!

99
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,039
Please?

100
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,580
Please?

101
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,849
I'm begging you.

102
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,360
We just finished the fashion show and the market case is killing me.

103
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,536
- Hurry up. - Hey, give it to Rebecca.

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,129
Si Wei told me she was quitting.

105
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,160
Didn't you hire Su Hui?

106
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,899
That's why I said not to marry casually.

107
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
He has an affair?

108
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,370
I don't think so.

109
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,580
But her husband insisted on getting a divorce.

110
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:05,939
What did he say?

111
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,350
"You have to be responsible for your own future."

112
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,379
"Or it'll be too late later."

113
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,050
Something like that.

114
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Gosh.

115
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,790
Actually,

116
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,259
I think Su Hui's husband is gay.

117
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,529
You want everyone to be gay.

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Gosh.

119
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,529
Anyway, when you're alone,

120
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,730
you just need to handle loneliness.

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,930
When you're a couple,

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,870
you'll create a lot of problems.

123
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,069
I think you're better off,

124
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,310
carefree, and free from worries and burdens.

125
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,139
Besides,

126
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,579
you'll feel less lonely when you're busier.

127
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,689
My rates are pricey.

128
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,160
Rebecca is okay with the project!

129
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,560
No, I'm not!

130
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,230
She said yes!

131
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,860
- Yes! - Yes!

132
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,399
Let's get the information ready.

133
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,815
(Haohao Film Festival - Yong Xin: The film links are in your inbox.)

134
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,740
(Forgot to say I'm glad you joined, finally get to learn from you!)

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,516
(The Graphic Design Team asked to meet you, when are you free?)

136
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,769
(I've sent the itinerary to you too.)

137
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,680
(Can we get the draft for the creative park later?)

138
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,980
Si Wei, they are...

139
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,879
(Si Wei. Even if you're going to quit...)

140
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,079
Why are you so pretty today?

141
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,326
The more surprises there are, the prettier I get.

142
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,980
(Si Wei. Could we talk?)

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,500
Hey.

144
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,730
Rebecca.

145
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,759
Hi, Ms. Qin.

146
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,080
What have you been up to lately?

147
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,670
I'm working on the picnic market.

148
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
And I accidentally promised a friend just now...

149
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
that I'd help him promote the film festival.

150
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,239
Those who are capable do more work.

151
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,779
Hard work makes up for it.

152
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,226
I work here every day until the lights are out...

153
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,650
and then I work overtime from home.

154
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,949
You're so busy,

155
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,255
but you don't get any benefits.

156
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,665
Do you want to work full-time for me?

157
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,449
Me?

158
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,519
Yes.

159
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,389
I finally get to freelance.

160
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,759
Haven't you noticed that there's no freedom in freelancing?

161
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,639
But at least I get to choose not to work on what I don't like.

162
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,000
That's for now.

163
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,240
What will you do when you're 50 years old?

164
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,180
The younger generation will be replacing you.

165
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,180
Besides,

166
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,750
AI will take over the world in the future.

167
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,589
I think I should retire when I'm 50 years old.

168
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,389
You're retiring at 50 years old?

169
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,529
Have you thought about how long you might live?

170
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,360
70?

171
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,100
80?

172
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
90?

173
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,659
Have you saved enough money to live from 50 to 80 years old?

174
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,339
Listen.

175
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,339
At least 20 million dollars.

176
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:22,910
- 20 million? - Yes.

177
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,839
And life isn't a straight line.

178
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:27,709
With 20 million dollars,

179
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,680
you still need to make sure you don't get sick.

180
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,850
You might not get to travel.

181
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,779
For weddings and funerals,

182
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,049
you may not be able to give wedding or condolence money.

183
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,789
Moreover, with 20 million dollars,

184
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,759
it also depends on your lifestyle.

185
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,830
Is it enough?

186
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,059
This should be a new product.

187
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,370
But I don't have kids.

188
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,200
Then there's nothing to look forward to.

189
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,470
Are you sure you can save up to...

190
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,139
20 million dollars before you turn 50 and retire?

191
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,149
Let me remind you.

192
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,250
People will age.

193
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,350
Money will depreciate.

194
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,950
Think carefully about the suggestion I just made.

195
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,159
At 40, you don't have the right to think about what you like.

196
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,889
A 40-year-old can only think about saving up for a rainy day.

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,759
Hey, you've moved back here again?

198
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,830
Yes.

199
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,110
I'm doing the second site inspection in a few days.

200
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:32,940
I see.

201
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,049
And I'll check the traffic flow to get a feel for the place.

202
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,019
Yes, there are a few.

203
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,019
Hold on.

204
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:47,120
Creative Coffee Roaster.

205
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,090
It's okay.

206
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,700
I think we can look together for the trendy elements first.

207
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,730
What are the trendiest things?

208
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,629
That way, we can attract consumers...

209
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,399
by checking in on social media and leaving comments.

210
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,816
That's the best and cheapest way to promote.

211
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,539
Usually, consumers who come to this event...

212
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,080
have a high tolerance for mistakes.

213
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,710
So we can get their feedback and make some adjustments.

214
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,110
Then we'll officially launch it.

215
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,590
Excuse me, Rebecca.

216
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,966
The management asked me to remind you...

217
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,070
that they haven't received your rent for this month.

218
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,129
Si Wei hasn't paid it?

219
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,190
No.

220
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,806
I'll pay for it right away.

221
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,830
Thank you.

222
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,700
Wire transfer...

223
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,080
Hello?

224
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,149
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

225
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,779
I'm Lulu from the clothing store.

226
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,980
I adjusted the suit and pants for you.

227
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:46,950
Okay.

228
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,019
Then I'll...

229
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,389
You're coming over tomorrow?

230
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,820
(Balance: TWD 623,453)

231
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:56,789
Hello?

232
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:00,700
Hello?

233
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,399
- Hello? - I...

234
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,399
I realized that I have...

235
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,269
a similar suit and pants.

236
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,409
I see, but there's only one pair left in Taiwan.

237
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,980
And it happens to be your size.

238
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,750
It's 20 percent off now.

239
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,720
When it's 40 percent off,

240
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,720
I'll see if they are meant to be mine.

241
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,649
All right. I'll let you get back to work.

242
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,590
That's all for now.

243
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,919
- Bye. - Thank you. Bye.

244
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,110
(Balance: TWD 623,453)

245
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,909
For my post-50-year-old future.

246
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,299
Da Yu has clocked out?

247
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,740
Yes.

248
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,399
He has a date today.

249
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,669
Don't just be jealous.

250
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,240
Turn off the computer and face life.

251
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,509
Okay.

252
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,779
I'll turn off the computer after I finish this case.

253
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,009
Join me for dinner?

254
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,720
I should have held back earlier.

255
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
I'm going to have my first meal of the day.

256
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,720
- Bye. - Bye.

257
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,330
Rebecca is a bit old.

258
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,600
Otherwise, she's worth wooing.

259
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,659
I concur.

260
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:52,940
Are you all right?

261
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,179
Go ahead and scold me.

262
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,919
Who am I to scold you?

263
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,649
I'm the one who exploits you.

264
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,549
Don't say that.

265
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,590
You're the best boss I've ever had.

266
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,090
So you're not quitting because of my exploitation?

267
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,629
Is it because of your boyfriend?

268
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,529
Last long weekend,

269
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,230
we were supposed to go to Yilan.

270
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,605
But we had to go location scouting at the last minute.

271
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,029
He got really mad.

272
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,129
And I've been working overtime every day lately.

273
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,370
He said we're worse than roommates.

274
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:23,870
So do you think you two will get along just fine...

275
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,780
if you quit this low-paying and demanding job?

276
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,480
You can find someone to take over, right?

277
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,080
Don't worry about me.

278
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,519
But you need to think about it.

279
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,320
What kind of future do you want?

280
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,519
He actually said the same thing.

281
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,620
He said,

282
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,590
"Do you want to become like Rebecca?"

283
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,929
Become like Rebecca?

284
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,799
Is it bad?

285
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,600
No.

286
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:49,169
What I mean is...

287
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,740
Don't be mad if I tell you.

288
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Say it.

289
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,039
I think you're really great.

290
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,639
You're pretty and capable.

291
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,639
That's why all the guys are scared of you.

292
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,840
But sometimes,

293
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,980
I feel sorry for you.

294
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,720
Even if you can't get married,

295
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,450
you can still live an exciting life.

296
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,990
But you do everything alone.

297
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,966
You're alone when you're happy.

298
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,490
You're alone when you're sad.

299
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,120
You're alone when you're sick.

300
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,889
If Da Yu and I don't eat with you,

301
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,429
you don't even know what you want to eat, do you?

302
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,399
That kind of loneliness scares me.

303
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,070
You're...

304
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,500
You're not mad, are you?

305
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,710
Why would I be angry?

306
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,769
Thank you for being honest.

307
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,586
But I also remember when you first applied for this job,

308
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,580
you said you wanted to be independent-minded...

309
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,419
and have an independent future.

310
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,679
Yes.

311
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,620
I remember.

312
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,149
But at that time,

313
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,289
I wasn't seeing my boyfriend yet.

314
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,889
All right.

315
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,289
My phone is almost dying.

316
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,960
Why don't you take a couple of days off?

317
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,135
Then you can think about what kind of future you want.

318
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,299
Okay?

319
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,370
Okay.

320
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:57,639
Then,

321
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,440
is Da Yu eating with you today?

322
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,970
Yes.

323
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,216
I'm heading into the restaurant.

324
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Bye.

325
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,570
(If "superposition" can be a metaphor...)

326
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,799
(for "parallel realities"...)

327
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,080
(What is it that got...)

328
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:15,879
(the current you here at this place now?)

329
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,059
Hey.

330
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,460
There's a long queue today.

331
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,170
Let's have sukiyaki instead.

332
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,099
(Is the answer waiting for us ahead?)

333
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,900
(Or has our consciousness chosen our universe?)

334
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,069
(Schrodinger's Cat)

335
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,529
Hello.

336
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,630
How many persons?

337
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,799
Just me.

338
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,529
If so, you'll have to sit at the counter.

339
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,069
I'm starving so I'll eat a lot.

340
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,500
Definitely more than two servings.

341
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,700
Excuse me. This is our regulation.

342
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,740
None of the tables are taken.

343
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,309
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,339
This is our regulation.

345
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,779
Isn't that discrimination against single people?

346
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,680
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,579
This is our regulation.

348
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,720
Are you single?

349
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,289
Yes.

350
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,349
I won't make it difficult for you then.

351
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,750
I just want to tell you that I'm not angry.

352
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,660
But can I tell you how I feel about this?

353
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,265
One time, I was at a high-end hot pot restaurant in Tokyo.

354
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,589
I met a woman.

355
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,359
She looked like she had a busy day.

356
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,970
She took up a huge table all by herself.

357
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,075
She ordered a table full of quality ingredients and sake.

358
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,539
She was enjoying dinner elegantly.

359
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,539
When I saw that, I thought,

360
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,309
right,

361
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,480
why do I always have to share a table with others...

362
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,279
or hide in the corner of the restaurant...

363
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:37,250
to fill my stomach in the fastest way possible?

364
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,079
Why is it that I have to feel inferior...

365
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,190
and sorry for myself just because I'm single?

366
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,519
I'm working so hard.

367
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,089
I'm working alone.

368
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,490
No one even asked me how my day was.

369
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,359
I'm not opportunistic.

370
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,029
I'm so busy that I have no friends.

371
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,500
I just found out that my life is a bad example.

372
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,039
And I finally made up my mind to enjoy my dinner...

373
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,039
and go back to work afterward.

374
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,339
Why do I have to sit at the counter?

375
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,680
Why?

376
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:14,720
Lulu.

377
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,690
I'll take the pants and suit.

378
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,619
(Zhang Yi Jing)

379
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,240
- Una! - Una!

380
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,650
- Look at me! - Una!

381
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,920
Have you tried any food here in Taiwan?

382
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,690
Hey, look at me.

383
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,960
- Do you like Taiwan? - Una, do you like Taiwan?

384
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,535
How long will you be staying here, Una?

385
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,839
(Haohao Film Festival - Rebecca)

386
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,509
Lonely only.

387
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,400
Lonely only!

388
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,029
It's slippery here.

389
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,160
Yes, they want to do an interview with Una first.

390
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:44,329
Yes, video calls and phone interviews are okay.

391
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,099
I know it's difficult.

392
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,039
But you're good at negotiating, right?

393
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,880
And I think this will help our film festival's publicity a lot.

394
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:53,910
Dining time is two hours.

395
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,150
What do you want to order?

396
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:55,910
Anything.

397
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,650
Anything is fine.

398
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,980
I'll just order randomly then.

399
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,019
It'll be fine.

400
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,265
Don't you have her agent's number?

401
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:03,295
Just talk to him directly.

402
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,160
Don't call to discuss work during mealtime!

403
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,890
Hello?

404
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,059
It's the other table.

405
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,436
Even if I only spend 30,000 dollars a month,

406
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,575
I still need 10 million dollars.

407
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,299
I don't have a house and a husband.

408
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:17,369
If I get hired full-time,

409
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,339
I can save on the co-working space rent.

410
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:20,569
Yes.

411
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,109
I can also get my pension.

412
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:22,869
This way, I don't have to be on standby...

413
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,309
because I love my work.

414
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,710
- Right? - Of course not.

415
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,940
If you buy a house,

416
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:28,956
you'll spend all your savings with just the down payment.

417
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,710
You'll have to pay a 30-year mortgage.

418
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,279
If you get a husband,

419
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,549
the two of you will need 20 million dollars.

420
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,659
Okay, if you work as an employee and get a pension,

421
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,190
how much can you get?

422
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,589
Two million? Three million?

423
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,765
Okay, I'll make it five million.

424
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,305
You'll still have to save up another five million.

425
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,029
And this is the best-case scenario.

426
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,230
What if something unexpected happens to the company?

427
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,420
You might get fired before you get your pension.

428
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,569
You make life sound so meaningless.

429
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,400
That's not what I meant.

430
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,599
I mean,

431
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,015
why are you getting ahead of yourself?

432
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,670
Do you work hard just to retire?

433
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,539
What's important is to do what you like...

434
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,140
and be happy every day.

435
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,410
I'm turning 40 soon.

436
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,180
You're still pretty and very capable.

437
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,720
It's great to dream big.

438
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,549
At worst,

439
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,220
just retire when you're 70.

440
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:12,460
Forget it.

441
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,095
No matter how much I tell you, you won't understand...

442
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,239
how scary it is to feel like you're getting old soon.

443
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,400
I thought...

444
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,230
life really begins at 40.

445
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,219
Turns out we just worry about different matters.

446
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,539
What are you worried about?

447
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,109
Me?

448
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm really worried.

449
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,279
She's so hard to get.

450
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:36,779
I want to give up already.

451
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,519
Didn't you go on a date that day?

452
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,095
It's because of the photo you told me to post.

453
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,239
That's why she asked me out.

454
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,450
See?

455
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:46,289
What did you talk about?

456
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,690
Nothing much.

457
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,859
Just random stuff.

458
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,310
But she asked me about the photo.

459
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,099
Did you tell her?

460
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,569
Didn't you say you can't tell her?

461
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:00,869
Why can't I tell her?

462
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,569
To create a false idea.

463
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,910
Let's say when we go shopping and you find something...

464
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,579
that you think is not bad.

465
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,985
And when you're still considering it,

466
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,009
someone picks it up.

467
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,549
Doesn't that make you think it's even better?

468
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,119
What if I tell you there's only one left?

469
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,059
Does that make you feel like "I have to take it away"?

470
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,460
That's how despicable human nature is.

471
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,730
So we have to maintain a sense of mystery.

472
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,700
That way, people will feel as if they can't get a hold of you.

473
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,170
If you show them everything you've got,

474
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,869
it's impossible not to lose.

475
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:34,569
You...

476
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:35,940
You're so good at this.

477
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,309
I'm not.

478
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,079
That's why I'm still single.

479
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,910
Then you're just all talk.

480
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,220
I learned it the hard way from my enemy.

481
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:50,549
Really?

482
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,660
That sounds like a good story.

483
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,289
Can you teach me?

484
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,829
You? Just be yourself.

485
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,259
And when I turn 40,

486
00:25:58,329 --> 00:25:59,430
I'll still be alone.

487
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,559
Alone,

488
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,500
you'll only need 10 million dollars.

489
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,329
With a wife,

490
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,599
that's 20 million dollars.

491
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,069
Gosh.

492
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,640
Life is so meaningless.

493
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,461
I think your landlord is trying to take advantage of you.

494
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,150
Don't fall for it.

495
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,819
Contact the Fair Trade Commission.

496
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,220
Or tell your landlord that the feng shui here is bad.

497
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,119
They'll end up alone if they live here.

498
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,190
How about this?

499
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,759
Do you want to come to my place?

500
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,759
What?

501
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:33,229
But you have to wait for me to take care of a problem first.

502
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,759
What problem?

503
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:35,829
You can go up first.

504
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,329
Your boyfriend?

505
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,730
Yes.

506
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,569
Tell him to go home.

507
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,769
Why should I?

508
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,609
I want to go up.

509
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,726
Do you think this is a department store...

510
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,920
where anyone can come up?

511
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,390
It's not that I don't want to see you.

512
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,190
A while ago...

513
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:39,259
I know.

514
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,299
My subconscious stopped you from coming here.

515
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:50,869
What subconscious?

516
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,440
It's not that you didn't come.

517
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,279
I went to a universe without you.

518
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,519
You won't come here again.

519
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,619
Rebecca, don't do this. Come on.

520
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,850
I thought you were different.

521
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,930
Okay.

522
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,569
Boyfriend?

523
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,740
Hey, your lock is broken.

524
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,226
I have a friend who fixes locks 24 hours a day.

525
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,279
I'll call him.

526
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,599
Gosh, your house is so messy.

527
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,369
Don't women like to be clean?

528
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,599
You guys are such liars.

529
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,545
You make yourself look all pretty,

530
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,940
but your house is such a mess.

531
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,985
Hey, can I post this to my story?

532
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:01,309
You can go home now.

533
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,380
Who was that guy?

534
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:07,920
Don't ask.

535
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,220
Go home.

536
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,750
Why not?

537
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,920
Go home.

538
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,799
Why did you ask me to come up?

539
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,099
Go home.

540
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,045
You asked me to come and go.

541
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,079
Here.

542
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:53,869
That's why you asked me to tag you in that photo...

543
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,476
to make him feel like he has to have you.

544
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,060
Good night, NCTU's outstanding student!

545
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,750
That's why you asked me to tag you in that photo...

546
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:44,410
(Is the answer waiting for us ahead?)

547
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,579
(Or has our consciousness chosen our universe?)

548
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:53,750
(Thank you for the birthday gift you got me, my subconscious.)

549
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:56,819
(Is the answer waiting for us ahead?)

550
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,920
(Or has our consciousness chosen our universe?)

(Schrodinger's Cat)

552
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,829
(Likes: Si Wei, Jian Qing Fen)

553
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:31,220
(Jian Qing Fen)

554
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,900
(Jian Qing Fen)

555
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,730
Hey.

556
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:42,999
What are you wearing tomorrow?

557
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,129
Why do you care what I'll wear tomorrow?

558
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,470
It's not that.

559
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,170
The new girl, Jian Qing Fen...

560
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,200
is worried about dressing up just like you again.

561
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,740
As if I'll be that unlucky.

562
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,200
Why did you take my phone?

563
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,710
(Jian Qing Fen)

564
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,690

(Blue sweater jacket)

566
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,889
Hey, take a look at this.

567
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,019
I'm sleepy.

568
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,750

(System Notice: Qing Fen only shares her updates with friends! Add her.)

572
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,559
Hi.

573
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,030
Hi.

574
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,699
I want the green one.

575
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,210
What's up with you?

576
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,750
What do you mean?

577
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,849
Aren't you using that photo too?

578
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,289
Yes.

579
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,349
Me too.

580
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,099
But I think of you as a friend!

581
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,510
So I used the photo honorably.

582
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,239
But you didn't.

583
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:11,539
You did it secretly.

584
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,756
Because I'm just a meal pal...

585
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,986
when you don't know what to order, or find it awkward to eat alone,

586
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,409
or when you don't know what to eat all alone by yourself!

587
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,380
Also,

588
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:18,995
that guy yesterday wasn't a gift from your subconscious.

589
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,179
It was from me.

590
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,280
You're welcome.

591
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,230
Do you really think a few words are the whole story?

592
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
What?

593
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,699
I'm sorry, I can't take the cab.

594
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:36,869
I won't cancel the ride.

595
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:37,929
I'm sorry.

596
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,670
Why are you so angry?

597
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,259
Have you ever been used for no reason?

598
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,115
- It's like being hit by a hammer... - He can't see the photos anymore.

599
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,409
I've blocked him.

600
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,980
I'm breaking up with him.

601
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,360
Where are you going?

602
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,309
What are you looking at?

603
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,380
Well,

604
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,050
I want to know why you broke up with him.

605
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,250
It's none of your business.

606
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,490
I'm just concerned about my friend.

607
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:34,719
He has a wife.

608
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,530
I didn't know...

609
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,130
you were so bad.

610
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:45,800
That's right.

611
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,309
I accidentally turned into a legendary home wrecker.

612
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,809
Accidentally how?

613
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,780
You wouldn't understand anyway.

614
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:56,750
Try me.

615
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,090
Have you ever hiked a mountain?

616
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,000
When you're really tired,

617
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,500
if there's someone beside you,

618
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:22,909
for example, he'll tell you,

619
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:23,809
"It's slippery here."

620
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:24,969
"Be careful."

621
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:27,780
"We're almost there."

622
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,110
"Hang in there."

623
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,579
Actually, as long as I can hear him breathing,

624
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,190
I don't feel so tired.

625
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,960
Because I really...

626
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:47,400
just want someone by my side.

627
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:57,610
So...

628
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,480
I ended up...

629
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:08,949
It's slippery here.

630
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,920
It's really a bit slippery.

631
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,760
Are you scared?

632
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,630
It's okay that someone's here with me.

633
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:26,139
So, it's fine that someone's here with you,

634
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,960
or is it because I'm with you that you're not scared?

635
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,510
What?

636
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,110
Let me rephrase the question.

637
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:38,110
If...

638
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,949
If I'm always with you,

639
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,019
what do you think?

640
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,440
(He Rui Zhi)

641
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,780
Because I want to retire at 50.

642
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,289
That's tiring.

643
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,360
Even if I retire at 60,

644
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,860
what if I live past 80?

645
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:02,599
Isn't it self-inflicted profit-loss?

646
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:07,400
Doesn't that mean I might lose my retirement fund?

647
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,369
Fine, forget it. I'm a coward.

648
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,409
What should I prepare then?

649
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,340
Okay.

650
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:16,980
Okay.

651
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,250
And a health checkup.

652
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,750
But I'm busy this month.

653
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,320
Next month...

654
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,320
Sure.

655
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:25,289
Okay. Send me the information first.

656
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,159
Okay.

657
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:27,889
Thank you. Bye.

658
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,760
So the bad woman has decided to buy insurance now?

659
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,929
Where's my new assistant?

660
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,900
My friend is going to Australia next month.

661
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,730
What are you doing here?

662
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,070
I'm substituting for my brother.

663
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,070
Go on then.

664
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,970
Are you going to work until lights are out again?

665
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,809
I didn't get enough sleep.

666
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,380
I'll probably go home early.

667
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:52,796
Do you want to go to class with me?

668
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,820
No.

669
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,150
Come and work out. Sweating feels so good.

670
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,150
I'm going home to sleep.

671
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,760
As usual.

672
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,030
The winner gets a prize.

673
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:11,269
The loser has to sing.

674
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,739
I know you're all good at this.

675
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,769
So, you can't lose to that madam!

676
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,679
It's lady!

677
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,210
- Ma'am! - Ma'am!

678
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,579
- Lady! - Lady!

679
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,809
Okay! Let's do it!

680
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,780
Ready?

681
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:27,920
Go!

682
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,420
Hey, be a gentleman.

683
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,559
You can do it, ma'am.

684
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,329
How many did you get?

685
00:42:58,949 --> 00:42:59,980
You're so kind.

686
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,849
Because you got here first.

687
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,219
Thank you.

688
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:08,420
But don't give up what you deserve so easily to others again.

689
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,190
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

690
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:11,659
Okay.

691
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,030
He Yong Li!

692
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,869
He Yong Li!

693
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,139
He Yong Li, Dad is here to pick you up.

694
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,349
Goodbye, Mr. Da Yu.

695
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,179
We're done for the day.

696
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,989
- Thank you, Coach. - Thank you, Coach.

697
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,590
- Goodbye, Coach. - Goodbye, Coach.

698
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:41,619
Dad.

699
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,789
Hurry up.

700
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,099
Why are you so early?

701
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,540
Mom said that we're going out for dinner.

702
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:56,589
- Aren't you tired? - I almost got first place today.

703
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:57,869
That's amazing.

704
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,709
Hey, where's your water bottle?

705
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,750
It's under the railing.

706
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,599
If...

707
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,300
If I'm always with you,

708
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:25,829
what do you think?

709
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,949
Will it really make you less scared?

710
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:41,820
Try it.

711
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,360
Hurry up.

712
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,506
Mom said we're going to eat out.

713
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,630
All right.

714
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,760
Okay, I'll help you.

715
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:42,679
I'm sorry, ma'am.

716
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,949
Ma'am, are you okay?

717
00:45:58,289 --> 00:45:59,500
It hurts.

718
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,239
It hurts.

719
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,639
It hurts.
