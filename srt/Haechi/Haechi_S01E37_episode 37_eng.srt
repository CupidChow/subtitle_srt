1
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,510
You are here?

2
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,800
Did you sleep well?

3
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,820
Did you have breakfast?

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,490
Yes, you are here?

5
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,640
Hey, can you handle it?

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,250
Aigoo, leave it.

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,970
Aigoo, thank you.

8
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,830
What's wrong with you?  Are you ill?

9
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,670
Look here, are you ill?

10
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,340
Look here, are you okay?

11
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,710
Aigoo, help him!

12
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,310
Come to your senses, look here!

13
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,980
That thing must have broken out in the capital already.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,780
That means we have no time to fritter away.

15
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,400
Something broke out in the capital and we have no time?

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,740
Prince Milpoong.

17
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,360
Do you want to turn the world upside down?

18
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,170
If you want to turn the world upside down,

19
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,360
you first have to create chaos.

20
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:05,430
Because then that chaos will turn around

21
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,380
and question the king about his qualifications.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
 Did you say an epidemic started near Chungcheong Province?

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,320
That is the gist of the message that just arrived.

24
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,970
It is spreading quickly through Jeolla Province, too.

25
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,410
But this is not a season when an epidemic would break out easily.

26
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,890
That is why I told you it was a mysterious disease without a known cause.

27
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,730
Your Majesty!

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,690
I think you need to read this expeditiously.

29
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,240
It seems the number of patients suffering from a mysterious disease is suddenly multiplying in the capital.

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,550
In the capital?

31
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,780
The symptoms look the same.

32
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,460
How can this be?  How?

33
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,950
Summon all high officials above the third rank belonging to the Border Defense Council

34
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,930
as well as the mayor of Hanseong in charge of public security in the capital,

35
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,910
the police commissioner, and directors of the two medical authorities.

36
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,870
Everyone must be here within half an hour.

37
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,900

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,110
Please move out of the way.

40
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,550
Hurry and move the patients inside.  Hurry!

41
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,080
Doctor, the patients seem to be in serious condition.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,080
From where on earth did this disease break out all of a sudden?

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,320
Please here, here, here.

44
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,810
Go inside.

45
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,030
A disease that broke out from Chungcheong Province has reached the capital Hanyang already!

46
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,370
How! How can it spread so quickly?

47
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:19,380

48
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,380

49
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,680
And that led to the night falling and the moon rising,

50
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,980
and the newly appointed magistrate, like a man, undid So Hyang's blouse tie,

51
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,570
and at that moment, the most revealing...

52
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
That's it for today.

53
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,470
Hey, how can you end it right after undoing the blouse tie?  It's so titillating.

54
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,240
Are you curious about what comes next?

55
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,510
If you are curious, come back tomorrow.

56
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,580
I'm calling it a day now.  Hurry and be on your way.

57
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,320
Okay, okay, okay.  Goodbye.

58
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,560
So few people today.

59
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,930
Are my stories not fun nowadays?

60
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,320
Hyung-nim Storyteller.

61
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,840
Oh, Goon Tae.  Just in time.

62
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,410
Am I not that good nowadays?

63
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,870
Undoing blouse tie like a man!  Is this too much of a cliche?

64
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,530
It is not the time for you to be doing this.  Quickly.

65
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,340
What? Why?

66
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,200
Disband the subjects in the marketplace.  Hurry!

67
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,250
Yes.

68
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,650
They are from the Capital Bureau.  What is this?

69
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,840
Darn it, so it is a plague.

70
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,530
What?  A p-plague?

71
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,880
What is this kid saying right now?  What?

72
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,700
Hurry, we don't have time to loiter here.

73
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,510
Now, let's hurry and quarantine the kids.

74
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,420
Hurry.

75
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,190
Head Merchant!

76
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,760
Are there any children showing symptoms of the illness?

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,940
A couple are coughing but they don't seem to have the plague.

78
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,390
- Still, you never know how it will turn out.  Do not put them among others.
 - Yes.

79
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,810
- Give Plantago asiatica to the ones with the cough.  Go on.
 - Yes.

80
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,800
- Hyung-nim!
 - Head Merchant!

81
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,740
You are here.

82
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,610
I have heard from Goon Tae that there are signs of an epidemic in the capital.

83
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,080
It is not just the capital.  It first started in Chungcheong and Jeolla Provinces three days ago.

84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,560
What?  Within three days, it has spread to the capital?

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,100
The palace must be in turmoil as well.

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,720
His Majesty must be trying to come up with solutions.

87
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,670
We, too, must gather as much information as possible.  Do you understand?

88
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,740
Yes.

89
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,400
Let's go.

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,170
An epidemic as soon as the new king ascends the throne.

91
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,200
What a disaster.

92
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,760
No need to stand up.

93
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,370
Let's start the meeting right away.

94
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,570
Do we have time to waste?

95
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,640
Chief Royal Secretary, bring us the map of the nation.

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,260
According to the reports, the ground zero for the epidemic was Chungcheong Province.

98
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,480
After spreading to Jeolla Province, it even reached the capital.

99
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,620
But how can a regular epidemic spread so quickly?

100
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,370
I am sorry to say this, but a message just arrived

101
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,900
reporting the spread of the disease throughout the Three Southern Provinces  (Chungcheong, Jeolla and Gyeongsang) .

102
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,760
Is the whole country being devastated by the epidemic?

103
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,870
The most urgent task at hand is to stop the spread of the disease.

104
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,200
Uigeumbu, send three cho's  (military unit made of a hundred men)  lead by a lieutenant to each province

105
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,630
and control the movement of those infected with the disease.

106
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

107
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,330
What is the total number of patients at East and West Hwalinseo's  (City Medical Clinic) ?

108
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,410
We... are figuring that out right now.

109
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,350
What do you mean you are still trying to figure it out?

110
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,290
I am extremely sorry, Your Majesty.

111
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,880
Right State Councilor, create a database of the patients at the Hwalinseos

112
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,040
based on their age and gender and report back to me every half an hour.

113
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

114
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,670
Capital and Police Bureaus, oversee the public security in the capital.

115
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,780
Also, the living expenses will soar due to the plague.

116
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,920
Deputy Mayor, do all you can to stabilize the rice price through the Market Administration Agency.

117
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

118
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,400
How about sending a staff officer from the Ministry of Taxation to each province to oversee the efforts?

119
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,970
Take into consideration Left State Councilor's suggestion.

120
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,170
You must have all gone through a plague before

122
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,930
and are aware that we'll end up losing countless precious lives

123
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,340
if the government does not take quick measures.

124
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,140
I am determined to nip this misfortune in the bud.

125
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,530
So that this may happen, please, all of you, put all your efforts and hearts into this.

126
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,700
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

127
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,560
Now, old and young patients, go to the west ward.

128
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,470
All women, please go to the east ward.  Hurry, please.

129
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,770
The total number of patients so far is 58.

130
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,440
How can they tell us to report to the palace every half an hour?

131
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,200
Well, that's how it should have been done.  Until now, we've been just going through the motions.

132
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,110
Now, everyone, please make haste.

133
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,110
If you have symptoms of nausea, you cannot enter.

134
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,230
Go straight to the nearby hwalinseo.

135
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,110
What do you mean I can't go home when it's just around the corner?

136
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,170
Are you going to disobey the king's order?

137
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,860
Listen to me carefully.

138
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,500
From this moment on, anyone with the slightest sign of the illness

139
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,140
may not enter through the gate!

140
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,420
This is the king's order!

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,430
The epidemic becoming rampant so fast!

142
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,190
His Majesty must be very concerned.

143
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,560
Fortunately, the government is taking quick measures.

144
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,340
Please do not be worried, Your Highness.

145
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,460
 Your Highness, your lunch will be served now.

146
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,490
Lunch in the midst of all this...  Tell them to take it away.

147
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,690
No, Your Highness.  You should take particular care of your health at times like these.

148
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,140
Bring it in.

149
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,150
Just a moment, lady-in-waiting.

150
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,280
Are you, by any chance, not feeling well?

151
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,210
You were coughing earlier.

152
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,400
No, it is just a mild cold.

153
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,790
These are the preventive measures to be given to the capital and the outbreak areas?

154
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:11,020
Carrying out your order, the King's Physician's Office compiled it in a hurry based on the "New Methods to Ward off Epidemics."

155
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,390
But why isn't the Hangul version available?

156
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,020
Pardon?

157
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,850
How many subjects know Chinese characters?

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,930
So that the subjects can easily read and learn,

159
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,680
lose no time to make one in Hangul, too.

160
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

161
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,340
Please be seated.  I have something to tell you two in private, so I have separately asked you here.

162
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,860
Your Majesty, did you just say Prince Milpoong escaped his place of exile?

163
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,370

164
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,340
That is right.

165
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,090
It's a report that just arrived from Saheonbu Inspector Yoon Hyeok.

166
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,420
How could this happen?

167
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,180
How is this possible?

168
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,930
How can you be so lax in guarding an exiled criminal guilty of high treason?

169
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,400
I'm sorry, My Lord.

170
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,980
The one who first disappeared from his place of exile

171
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,710
was former Saheonbu Deputy Inspector General Wi Byeong Joo.

172
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,980
In the end, Prince Milpoong successfully escaped too.

173
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,770
They seemed to have aimed for this timing because now is the first unsettled days of a regime change

174
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,670
and the time of an epidemic outbreak.

175
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,660
What do you mean they aimed for the time of an outbreak of an epidemic?

176
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,330
Are you saying someone anticipated the outbreak of the disease?

177
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,340
This is the report from the provincial government of Cheongju that arrived 15 days ago.

178
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,260
At the time, numerous local people were infected with a mysterious disease but that was contained.

179
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,450
I, too, remember this matter.

180
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,210
Wasn't it put down by the fast response of the Mayor of Cheongju?

181
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,160
That is right.  Because that happened during my regency,

182
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,400
I, too, clearly remember it.

183
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,270
 It was a report about how numerous people in Cheongju were infected with the disease,

184
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:26,880
 but thanks to the local government's quick response, that was totally subdued in no time.

185
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,740

186
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,850

187
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,160
 That is a relief.

188
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,320
But why are you mentioning this?

189
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,580
Read the letter more closely, Right State Councilor.

190
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,270
Can't you feel something is strange?

191
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,900
The symptoms of the illness... are similar.

192
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,260
What do you mean similar?

193
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,450
This mysterious disease of Cheongju...

194
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:01,610
Are you thinking that it can be the same disease that is spreading now?

195
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,400
I am not positive, but the symptoms are too similar.

196
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,970
But a disease that was put down once is flaring up all over the country again?

197
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,610
It can mean its genesis was not natural.

198
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,540
That this scourge was caused by someone's ill intention,

199
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,110
I am speaking of that possibility right now.

200
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,330
Can it be... Prince Milpoong?!

201
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,370
Do you think this has to do with Prince Milpoong's escape?

202
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,500
Prince Milpoong?

203
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,000
Did His Majesty request your help, Your Excellency?

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,870
No, you can't.  He killed the predecessor king.

205
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,360
How can we possibly work with such a king—

206
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,940
Please be quiet for a while!

207
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,040
 Prince Milpoong?

208
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,400
 Your Majesty, if this mysterious disease was plotted—

209
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,640
 I know what confusion will come if this gets out.

210
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,340
 That is why I asked to see you two separately.

211
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,640
 I know you do not trust me, Right State Councilor.

212
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,140
 I also know that I cannot force you to trust me.

213
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,400
 However, the country is in a crisis right now

214
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,540
 without knowing what bigger wind storm might come bearing down on it.

215
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:46,210
 So won't you bury the old hatchet for the time being and be in this with me,

216
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,510
 so that I might borrow your wisdom?

217
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:55,330
 Not for my sake, but for the sake of the court and this country's subjects, I mean.

218
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,680
 At 7 AM,

219
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,980
 there were 45 patients at East Hwalinseo

220
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,640
 and 59 patients at West Hwalinseo.

221
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,260
 At 7:30 AM,

222
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,210
 there were 51 patients at East Hwalinseo

223
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,330
 and 64 patients at West Hwalinseo.

224
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,390
 At 7:45 AM...

225
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,630
How much longer do we have to go?

226
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,330
You dare to make me walk mountainous paths?

227
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,160
Without a horse...

228
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:44,170
That bastard, just who is he to act so high and mighty?

229
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,930
His name is Lee In Jwa.

230
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,730
He is a scion of an illustrious Namin family that fell during the reign of King Sukjong.

231
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,420
He is also a descendant of Grand Prince Imyeong  (fourth son of Great King Sejong) .

232
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,340
Ridiculous. He's a royal?

233
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,350
You are here, General.

234
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,510
Yes.

235
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,800
Who the heck are all those guys anyway?

236
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Have you all been well?  How about the mountain stronghold?

237
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,380
It is fine.  We will escort you.

238
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,590
General?

239
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,390
Mountain stronghold?

240
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,450
One.

241
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,730
Two.

242
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,610
Three.

243
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,740
Four.

244
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,590
One.

245
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,790
Two.

246
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,200
Three.

247
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,010
One.

248
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,880
Two.

249
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,540
General.

250
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,790
General.

251
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,900
Two.

252
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,500
Three.

253
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,690
General!

254
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,630
General.

255
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,240
One.

256
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,080
Two.

257
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,490
Two.

258
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,710
How about the propaganda?

259
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,890
It is all ready.

260
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,890
So that jerk has been preparing for a rebellion for a long time?

261
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:15,170
From the time right after the fall of the Namin faction, with all his family's wealth that he could muster.

262
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,500
However, I had no idea it would be to this extent.

263
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,370
With this kind of size and level of preparation...

264
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,500
You two over there, make some time and follow me.

265
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,700
I have something to show you.

266
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,480
Two.

267
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,680
Three.

268
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,480
Four.

269
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,940
One.

270
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:03,350
Movable metal type? Are you even making metal type here?

271
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,700
We need to confuse the people for our plan.

272
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,510
By now, not only the capital but the whole country is in chaos.

273
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,960
Now we need to make propaganda flyers and spread them to anger people.

274
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,530
What's the content?

275
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:24,390
Of course, it'll be about attacking the king, Lee Geum.

276
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,150
It's a warning not to make a rash movement.

277
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,810
At this mountain stronghold, no one can do anything without my order.

278
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,400
Your order? Warning?

279
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,920
Hey, how dare you babble to me about doing or not doing something?

280
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,200
- I am— 
- Right, you have committed treason,

281
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,940
and now you are demoted to the lowest caste and just a person of a royal family in the past.

282
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,310
What?

283
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,350
Listen carefully, Prince Milpoong.

284
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,090
Bringing you here despite that was for only one reason.

285
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,370
That face we need to put out for the plan. We only need a figurehead.

286
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,560
So you just stay quiet wiping that face.

287
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,520
I'll take care of everything myself.

288
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:45,380
I will happily obey whatever order you command, General Lee In Jwa.

289
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,400
If I can only ruin and take revenge on the king,

290
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,550
I'll put my whole life on the line.

291
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,220
You dare disregard me? A country bumpkin nobleman?

292
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,420
What are you doing?

293
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:29,270
Get lost. You just go and lick his foot like a dog.

294
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,570
Do you think I kneeled down because I like it?

295
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,730
You've heard of "wasinsangdam," right?

296
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,920
If I could go back to my position, do you think I wouldn't crawl between his legs?

297
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,470
You must do it, too!

298
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,310
We must use that power.

299
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,220
We must take back what they took from us,

300
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,160
unless you've given up the throne already.

301
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,450
The throne?

302
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,680
My...

303
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,670
throne?

304
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,190

305
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,940
- The well? 
- Yes.

306
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,640
Wait.

307
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,320
According to this info, the well in Tonginbang was strange.

308
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,380
The well?

309
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,870
Go check to see if other wells are alright.

310
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,800
Other places?

311
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,210
Here. Here it is.

312
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,610
It says Saeteo's well water tastes different now, too.

313
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,140
- The well in Saeteo, too?
 - Yes.

314
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,020
Seongjae Well in Samcheongdong, too.

315
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,290
Seongjae Well... isn't that the well the palace uses?

316
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,700
Yes, that's right.

317
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,060
Why are the wells suddenly...

318
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,940
- Storyteller. 
- Yes.

319
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,750
Go at once to find out the names of the sick people at the Hwalinseo.

320
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,050
Yes, I understand.

321
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,280
Do you think there's a problem with the wells?

322
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,570
Then it may not be a plague.

323
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,750
It's too early to presume.

324
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,900
We must inform the king after we confirm.

325
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,550
Yes.

326
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,390
By chance... have you heard that news yet?

327
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,640
Are you talking about Chae Yoon Yeong who'd disappeared?

328
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,930
I sent out inquiries to the peddlers who travel all over the country,

329
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,310
but I haven't heard anything yet.

330
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,380
- Okay, got it.
 - Okay.

331
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,680
Ma'am, give me one more bottle of booze!

332
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,010
Drink slowly. Are you leaving?

333
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll pay my tab. How much is it?

334
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,140
Two nyang.

335
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,020
Oh, excuse me.

336
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,560
What are you doing over there?

337
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,240
I was right. It was that woman.

338
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,340
What is right?

339
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,370
You know, a well-known thug in Hanyang

340
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,850
was passing out these facial composites looking for a woman. Remember?

341
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,380
I think I saw this woman.

342
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,400
- For real? 
- She just left this tavern.

343
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,420
Move quickly. You must not miss any place.

344
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,360
Yes.

345
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,370
Move quickly!

346
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,590
What are you doing over there?

347
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,990
Hey, run.

348
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,040

349
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,340
Who is doing this sort...

350
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,370
Honey, Honey. Take a look at this.

351
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,600
What is this?

352
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,330
- Is this true? 
- What is it saying?

353
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,910

354
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,240
Excuse me. There's something strange stuck on the palace wall.

355
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,320
 The reason for the plague spreading in this country

356
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,330
 is because of the previous king's bloody tears,

357
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:09,330
 because the king has killed the previous king and stolen the throne.

358
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,730
- I am sorry, Your Majesty. 
- I am sorry.

359
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,520
When these outrageous flyers came into the palace, let alone the capital,

360
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,220
just what were the royal guards and the police bureau doing?!

361
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,470
Please kill me.

362
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,240
I am sorry, but due to the lack of manpower, we couldn't patrol at night—

363
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,170
Is that your excuse?! Do you even have the right to wear the uniforms—

364
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,800
- Stop. Stop, Left State Councilor.
 - Your Majesty.

365
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,660
You two leave at once and control the chaotic capital and the palace.

366
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

367
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,460
You need to fire them right now.

368
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,740
If the hearts of the people start to betray you, then this situation gets worse.

369
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,950
As you say, if I change the military heads

370
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,440
when the people are in chaos, what do you think will happen?

371
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,730
But Your Majesty, take a look at the scale on the flyer.

372
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,300
There is an organized movement.

373
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,060
As you've said, an ill intention—

374
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,510
Left State Councilor, that is exactly why I am holding it in.

375
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:14,580
If the people in the capital even feel the signs of treason now, it'll be even bigger chaos.

376
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,410
Your Majesty.

377
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,260
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

378
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:32,020
There's an urgent message.  The Queen Dowager now...

379
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,310
Your Highness, are you awake?

380
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,610
You must hold on.

381
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,550
You must get your energy up.

382
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,400
Your Highness.

383
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,740
Your Highness.

384
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,580

385
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,840
- Royal Physician.
 - Your Majesty.

386
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,680
What do you mean the queen dowager shows signs of the plague?

387
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,540
I am sorry to say this, but you must not set your foot in here.

388
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,420
You must go back to your quarters.

389
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,330
Your Majesty.

390
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,380
Royal Physician. Royal Physician!

391
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,790
Yeo Ji.

392
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,490
Damo Cheon.

393
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,200
Why are you here?

394
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,030
Why are you...

395
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,450
Your Majesty.

396
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,720
Why did you come to the palace? I told you not to.

397
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,300
Once you become a palace lady,

398
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,440
your life as a normal woman will disappear.

399
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,780
I... didn't want that for you.

400
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,000
But I wanted it, Your Majesty.

401
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,670
Rather than living a normal woman's life,

402
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,110
I wanted to be with your cause in this palace.

403
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:36,380
- Yeo Ji. 
- And you probably have no idea how relieved I feel now.

404
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,060
Now, without Lord Moon Soo by your side,

405
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,350
I get to stay by your side, even though I may not be of much help.

406
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,710
Yeo Ji.

407
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,700
♫  I cannot erase  ♫
