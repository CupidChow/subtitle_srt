1
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,550

2
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,500
Everyone face His Majesty and mourn.

3
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,590
Bow down.

4
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,210
Your Majesty.

5
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,830

6
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,240
Has everyone gathered their will?

7
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,200
Yes.

8
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,520
Right now, the Soron court officials have?

9
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,160
Yes. It seems that they will come to the Queen Dowager's Palace soon.

10
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,370

11
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,840
My Lord, have you heard?

12
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,790
The Right State Councilor and a few other Soron court officials

13
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,210
are headed to the Queen Dowager's Palace!

14
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,620
The Queen Dowager's Palace? Why?!

15
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,600
Just what do you mean by that, Right State Councilor?!

16
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,900
I cannot ever allow it.

17
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,550
The preceding king has passed due to the crown prince's stubbornness and greed!

18
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,760
Stubbornness and greed?

19
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,440
The Crown Prince even cut his own finger

20
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,900
 Words I have heard countless times in the past...

21
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,420
 With what qualifications?  How can you?

22
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,510
 More like you don't qualify since your mother is a low-born.

23
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,370
 A royal prince with low-born blood flowing in him.

24
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,550
 It's embarrassing no matter what, no?

25
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,950
 That's why everyone finds you uncomfortable, Hyung-nim.

26
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,430
 Where does he think this place is, to come?

27
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,180
 What an occasion for me to see you too.

28
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,220
 What did you think you could do?

29
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,930
 You who don't have even a sliver of power to protect a mere inspector. What could you possibly do?

30
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,690
 I might have felt wronged by those words.

31
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,660
 I might have felt sad.

32
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,770
If we had prescribed and given the medicine correctly,

33
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,020
we would not have had today's tragedy.

34
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,160
Your Highness!

35
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:02,890
 So I might have embarked on this road

36
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,820
 simply to prove myself.

37
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,710
It's you, Crown Prince.

38
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,820
The reason why His Majesty passed

39
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,410
is all because of you.

40
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,300
You, who have done this,

41
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,610
do not have the right to become this nation's king.

42
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,420
Qualifications...

43
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,510
 However, they might have been right.

44
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,020
 I might have been wrong.

45
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,970
 I might not have

46
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,710
 the qualifications.

47
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,410

48
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,210

49
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,690
Out of the way!

50
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,990
Out of the way!

51
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,160
What herald is that?

52
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,370
His Majesty has passed away.

53
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,160
What?  His Majesty did?

54
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,810
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

55
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,840

56
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,560
My Lord, you have come.

57
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,940
Yes, where are the elders of the family?

58
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,400
They've already gathered.  This way, please.

59
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,950

60
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,540
The descendent of the predecessor king who had persecuted us, Namins, passed so meaninglessly.

61
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,980
Whom do we, once an illustrious and powerful family, owe this calamity short of annihilation?

62
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,200
The king was punished by heaven because of his father's sins.

63
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,090
However, are you aware of this?

64
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:31,080
There is a rumor that the crown prince let the king die on purpose.

65
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,660
- There's also a rumor of poisoning him to death.
 - What?

66
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,640
Did you just say poisoning to death?

67
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,130
The crown prince did the king in?

68
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,750
Yes. Even though the rumor has not spread throughout the capital yet,

69
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,890
the atmosphere inside the palace sure seemed serious.

70
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,620
How did this happen?  It hasn't been long since he ascended to the throne.

71
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,880
There have not been any talks of his illness.

72
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,080
That's what I am saying.  Just what happened?

73
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,910
Most Sorons including the Right State Councilor are objecting His Highness's enthronement?

74
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,470
Yes. They don't seem like they'll back down easily.

75
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,650
It is all my fault.

76
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,810
  The ones who face their ends are the king and the crown prince.

77
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,980
  The king will die.

78
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,270
  The crown prince will be charged with that crime.

79
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,510
  I've made it so that

80
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,390
 they can't discover anything.

81
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,580
Because of me...

82
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,730
 Yoon Bok Dan.

83
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,220
  How could you...

84
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,500
 If only I hadn't been shaken up...

85
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,370
 If only I could have let her go...

86
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,880
Hyung-nim Dal Moon...

87
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:14,780
How can we, your vassals, hold the state funeral like this?

88
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,590
His Majesty died a wrongful death.

89
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,960
Before we avenge this wrong,

90
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,550
we can never back down, Your Highness the Queen Dowager!

91
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:32,420
Please listen to our petition, Your Highness!

92
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,220
Right State Councilor Jo Tae Goo is objecting to the crown prince's enthronement?

93
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,590
How can they not doubt the crown prince since he stopped the King's Physician's Office

94
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,730
and gave the king his final medicine, aconite and ginseng?

95
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,070
Doubt?

96
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,220
Then, are they saying the crown prince let the king die on purpose?

97
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,350
- Th-that is...
- What's important right now is not that.

98
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,050
Whether it was by the crown prince's order or not,

99
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,620
the end result is that the Sorons are split in half

100
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,980
over the crown prince who's next in line to the throne.

101
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,380
Then, it's time that we too should decide on our next move.

102
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,820
Do we go with Right State Councilor Jo Tae Goo

103
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,890
or with Lee Gwang Jwa who's the crown prince's follower?

104
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,830
What do you plan to do, Your Excellency?

105
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,800
Dominance.

106
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,420
Whether we side with the Right State Councilor and strike down on the crown prince

107
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,930
or side with Lee Gwang Jwa and aid the crown prince,

108
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,830
we have to set it up so that we Norons can have dominance.

109
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,850
Yes, Your Excellency!

110
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,240
What is going on in the crown prince's palace?

111
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,880
You are here, Lord Inspector General.

112
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,890
I am here to see His Highness.  Please announce me.

113
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,920
I am here to see Assistant Officer of Uigeumbu Jo Hyeon Myeong.  Is he in?

114
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,010
Yes, My Lord.

115
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,040
Lord Moon Soo!

116
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,670
Yeo Ji!

117
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,080
Yeo Ji...

118
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,080
We run into each other here.

119
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,480
You're here to check on the atmosphere in Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau) , right?

120
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,890
The Queen Dowager's Palace also wants to know what is going on in Saheonbu and Uigeumbu.

121
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,270
So please give me some information...

122
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,070
Wait, hold on.

123
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,640
Queen Dowager's palace?  Why are you there?

124
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,540
Weren't you in Yangjoo?

125
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,980
So how can you be in the palace?

126
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,810
Lord, that is...

127
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,200
You can't possibly have...

128
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,390
Yeo Ji.

129
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,110
I've come to know it only now.

130
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,850
That they are right and I am wrong.

131
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,310
A prince with a low-born's blood.

132
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,400
So one who cannot be anything.

133
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,700
Simply because

134
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,700
I felt aggrieved by that reality

135
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,600
I've come this far.

136
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,860
I don't have the king's qualifications.

137
00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:00,520
I caused His Majesty's death.

138
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,520
Did you put poison in his medicine, Your Highness?

139
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,170
Did you stop the King's Physician's Office to hinder His Majesty's treatment?

140
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,820
- Teacher!
 - Did you

141
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,290
say we should use aconite and ginseng to assassinate His Majesty?

142
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,760
- Why are you acting like this?
 - I am asking whether Your Highness

143
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,230
did all this because you coveted the throne?

144
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,050
No qualifications?

145
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,180
You've sinned?

146
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,240
Those are lies made up by the ones who do not know the truth.

147
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,500
They are not true.

148
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,010
So why do even you blame yourself with those lies?

149
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,890
I know how painful these events are to a person like you.

150
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,550
You must think rather than living a cruelly misunderstood life,

151
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,460
it would be better to give up the throne.

152
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,910
However, this is how the king's road is.

153
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,790
It's as if you are carrying a yoke,

154
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,540
living among countless lies, misunderstandings, and humiliations.

155
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,490
It is not now, Your Highness,

156
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,260
but the moment you fall down on that road and run away,

157
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,220
your qualifications as the king are lost at that very moment.

158
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,710
Not now,

159
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,910
but the moment I run away...

160
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,750
Therefore, please choose, Your Highness,

161
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,650
to keep the qualifications of a king's or lose them.

162
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,600
Whether to avoid this pain as a human being,

163
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,710
or gladly become the king

164
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,010
and fight against all these humiliations.

165
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,940
Quickly move!

166
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,710
Yes!

167
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,930
Yeo Ji...

168
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,190
 Therefore, please choose, Your Highness,

169
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,740
 to keep the qualifications of a king's or lose them.

170
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,610
 The reason why His Majesty passed

171
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,970
 is all because of you.

172
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,800
Whether to avoid this pain as a human being...

173
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,260
 And... Geum...

174
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,560
 Please, at least you...

175
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,140
 for all of the people of this nation...

176
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,490
 become a good king.

177
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,890
 One I could not become.

178
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,020
 One... I dreamt of.

179
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,220
 That kind of a king.

180
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,230
...or gladly become the king

181
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:16,780
and fight against all these humiliations.

182
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,800
Oh! Commander of the Five Supreme Military Headquarters!

183
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,310
Were you looking for me, Right State Councilor?

184
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,300
How's the situation at the Five Supreme Military Headquarters?

185
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,820
In the event a regrettable but inevitable incident breaks out in the palace,

186
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,730
how much military manpower can be mobilized to stop the crown prince's enthronement?

187
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,370

188
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,800
Minister of Defense, what's the military status in your ministry?

189
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,400
How about the Capital Bureau and Police Bureau?

190
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,480
I have heard that there are alarming military movements inside and outside the palace.

191
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,410
That is right, the Ministry of Defense, Five Supreme Military Headquarters, Capital Bureau and even Police Bureau as well.

192
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,470
The head of each military unit is making moves.

193
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,380
Why on earth?  Why would they?

194
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,650
The Commander of the Five Supreme Military Headquarters must have been summoned by Right State Councilor Jo Tae Goo

195
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,790
and the Minister of Defense and heads of Capital and Police Bureaus

196
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,200
must have been summoned by Left State Councilor Min Jin Heon.

197
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,310
- Your Highness.
 - Your Highness the Crown Prince.

198
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,730
Both of them will try to use the military units under their influence

199
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,330
and do what they can during the remaining six days.

200
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,860
What do you mean by the remaining six days, Your Highness?

201
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,400
Can you possibly mean...

202
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,340
- Order all soldiers of Saheonbu to be on standby. 
- Yes.

203
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,010
I will carry out your order, My Lord.

204
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,480
Six days... from now.

205
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,290
The remaining time until a new king ascends the throne after the predecessor king's death...

206
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,160
Yes, six days are remaining.

207
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,630
Until then, the throne will be unoccupied.

208
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,930
Nobody knows what will transpire in the palace during those six days.

209
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,520
Whether the crown prince will smoothly ascend the throne

210
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,700
or if he will fall in the end as Right State Councilor Jo Tae Goo wants.

211
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,310
In any event, we Norons must be prepared for any exigency

212
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,280
so that we can stay on top.

213
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,310
Yes, Your Excellency.

214
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,360
As needed, we may hold the right state councilor's hand.

215
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,740
Your Excellency.

216
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,630
What is it?

217
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,400
 Your Highness, the crown prince is here to see you.

218
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,950
 What are the qualifications?

219
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,680
 Will I remain a human being or will I become a king?

220
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,180
What did you just say, Crown Prince?

221
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,160
Please allow you to hold the coronation ceremony as soon as possible?

222
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,630
Yes, Your Highness, that is correct.

223
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,980
The customary time between the predecessor king's demise and the new coronation ceremony is six days.

224
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,100
During that time, the throne is vacant,

225
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,260
and the queen dowager, the elder of the royal family, holds all political power.

226
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,720
Your decree must be handed down for me to succeed to the throne.

227
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,560
But you want that decree sooner even if by an hour.

228
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,260
Right now, there are alarming movements of the military in and out of the palace.

229
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,710
If the throne is left empty for as long as six days,

230
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,860
some disaster might break out in the palace.

231
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:59,770
I, too, have been worrying over that possibility, Crown Prince.

232
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,140
However, if that happens...

233
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,860
I know

234
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,190
that I will become a shameless king

235
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,820
who has killed the predecessor king

236
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,460
and expeditiously ascended the throne.

237
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,790
Yes, I am well aware of it, Your Highness,

238
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:28,500
what kind of misunderstanding and mortification will be associated with me.

239
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,510
Crown Prince...

240
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,390
So you have decided to endure all that,

241
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:46,450
to squarely face this road that you cannot avoid.

242
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,890
Are you out there, Court Lady Choi?

243
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,890
Yes, Your Highness.

244
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,080
Summon the Chief Royal Secretary from the Royal Secretariat right now.

245
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,380
Yes, Your Highness.

246
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,110
Chief Royal Secretary.

247
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,540
This is Queen Dowager's order in Hangul.

248
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,510
Summon all the officials of the Royal Secretariat.

249
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,620
Yes, Lord.

250
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,400
So you've met with His Excellency Min Jin Heon?

251
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,130
Right.

252
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,660
I am sorry for not asking your opinion first.

253
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,350
But if your opinion differs...

254
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,600
Of course not.

255
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,080
I can do it hundreds and thousands of times.

256
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,200
Assistant Officer!

257
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,750
With me...

258
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,070
you don't even need to confirm, Lord.

259
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,050
How can this be? What do you mean a coronation?

260
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,480
I heard the queen dowager ordered it last night preemptively.

261
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,880
The preparation for the coronation has already begun.

262
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,000
We must stop it!

263
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,550
Even if we must draw blood.

264
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,380
Right State Councilor!

265
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,980
Is it really true?

266
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,740
That preparations for the coronation are underway?

267
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,020
Yes. We saw what seems to be silk for the ceremonial costumes and musical instruments going into the palace.

268
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,430
It's certain, Head Merchant.

269
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,790
According to the information from the Office of Ceremonies of the Ministry of Rites,

270
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,670
it seems like the coronation will be held right away.

271
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,810
How could this be?

272
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,910
Dal Moon... Storyteller... Is that really true?

273
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,730
I am asking whether the rumor in town is true?

274
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,730
Tell me before I die from curiosity.

275
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,120
You are talking about the coronation, right?

276
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,970
Yes, it is true. I think it will happen right away!

277
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,490
- What? 
- Ah Bong.

278
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,720
Uncle, is His Highness finally becoming the king?

279
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,980
Storyteller!

280
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,590
- Goon Tae!
 - Hyung-nim Ah Bong!

281
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,590
His Majesty!  His Majesty!  His Majesty!

282
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,180
His Majesty!  His Majesty!  His Majesty!

283
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,590
His Majesty!  His Majesty!  His Majesty!

284
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
Why?

285
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,110
How could you back the crown prince?

286
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:50,330
You know this place has no eternal enemy nor eternal friend.

287
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,730
What's important is always... the need.

288
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,430
Left State Councilor.

289
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,340
You must know that merely with the troops of the Five Supreme Military Headquarters,

290
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,220
you cannot even take on the Ministry of Defense.

291
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,000
I am sure you are well aware of other political organizations supporting Norons as well.

292
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,380
Let's not shed unnecessary blood, Right State Councilor.

293
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,660
What did you get from the crown prince?

294
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,490
You must have made a political deal with him.

295
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,590
A deal...

296
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,610
I don't know if I can say this is that sort.

297
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,650
But there was one.

298
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,670
But not with the crown prince.

299
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,160
Something that I got

300
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,700
from some fools that I cannot understand...

301
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,110
There was one.

302
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,650
How do you think we'd have handled it if it was us?

303
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,120
Your Highness.

304
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,400
You all look tired.

305
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,910
It must've been a long night for everybody.

306
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,320
Not at all, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

307
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,860
Don't mention it, Your Highness.

308
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,010
This is the last time to address you as Your Highness.

309
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:17,730
I hope you become a sage king, Your Highness.

310
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:24,860
I will protect you in that path, to the end.

311
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,710
Do you want to try it, too?

312
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,980
Pardon me?

313
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,370
Let her see the king's ceremonial robe briefly.

314
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,110
Your Highness.

315
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,670
If you steam-treat it like this, it'll take the wrinkles out and

316
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,000
a nice scent will be absorbed.

317
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,190
Here. You give it a try.

318
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:48,300
♫  I turn past page one and page two  ♫

319
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:55,160
♫  Like that first day going farther and farther away  ♫

320
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,660
♫  We both loved each other a lot  ♫

321
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:04,270
 So please allow me to enter the crown prince's quarters.

322
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,640
 I want to protect you no matter what.

323
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,560
 You came.

324
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,560
 Your Highness.

325
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,950
 Before I'm a woman, I'm a damo (tea maid, female investigator).

326
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,530
 Before I'm the crown prince, what if I'm a man?

327
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,160
 Pardon?

328
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,700
 Yes.  Even if it is like this, it's nice.

329
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,840
 Feeling the same wind as you.

330
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:52,200
 I, too, like it even if it is like this.

331
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,650
 Being next to you...

332
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,700
 and able to do something for you.

333
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:14,650
♫  Now the gentle and gentler wind hurts too  ♫

334
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:20,500
♫  In the spirit we both loved  ♫

335
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:27,650
♫  The wind is saying we must let each other go  ♫

336
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:36,320
♫  That’s the story now told by the gentle wind  ♫
