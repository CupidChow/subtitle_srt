1
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:39,960

2
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,160

3
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,360
 In that case, what do you say you transfer boats for the time being?

4
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,130
 Wu and Yue in the same boat.

5
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,940
 How about cooperating with me to maneuver politics to our advantage?

6
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,800
 With you, Your Highness?

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,880
 Just like the people of Wu and Yue, who were enemies but shared the same boat during the Warring States Period,

8
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,040
 we can assist each other for the common interest.

9
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,770
 Isn't this the politics in which Your Excellency has a lot of expertise?

10
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,720
 His Majesty is coming!

11
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,500
 You'd rather kill me

12
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,490
 than come at me through made-up treason,

13
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,690
 leading this country and court into turmoil.

14
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,540
 Isn't that the kind of person you are, Min Jin Heon?

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,010
 Because at least you are a person who understands this level of politics.

16
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,540
 There was a time when I believed that was politics.

17
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,060
 If the officials in their places and the king in his place

18
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,990
 perform all their duties and are accountable for them, the county and court will be maintained.

19
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,420
 There was a time I believed that.

20
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:22,200
 However, if one stays in this world, one finds out not long after...

21
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,300
 that such beliefs are just fantasies.

22
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,890
 Hyung-nim!

23
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,310
 Your Highness the Queen!

24
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,240
 Your Highness the Queen!

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,760
 I shall depose the queen

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,910
 and put Royal Concubine Lady Jang in that seat.

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,710
 I name Prince Yoon (future King Gyeongjong) the crown prince.

28
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,420
 Hyung-nim.

29
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,960
 Losing power means imminent death.

30
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,900
 The one who denigrated and caused the expulsion of my sister Queen Inhyeon and the execution of my brothers was

31
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,600
 Royal Concubine Lady Jang, the current king's mother.

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
 Also, the one who brought about that Royal Concubine Lady Jang's death was

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,420
 Royal Concubine Lady Choi, the current crown prince's mother.

34
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,320
 Politics, like this, is not a conviction

35
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,370
 but simply a vicious circle of grudge and bloody revenge.

36
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,360
 However...

37
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,750
 However...

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,320
Crown Prince, do you truly not have anything to say?

39
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,930
Answer me!

40
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,490
If you confess your crime here, then I will at least save your life.

41
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,140
Your grace is immeasurable;

42
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,870
however, I have never thought of treason

43
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,380
nor planned a rebellion.

44
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,480
I cannot confess to a crime I did not commit

45
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,920
by any means, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,570
Then there is no other way.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,890
I will have to interrogate you myself.

48
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,020
Officers, start.

49
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,690
I will interrogate the criminals and the crown prince here.

50
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,380
I apologize, Your Majesty.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,120
But may I say one thing before the royal interrogation?

52
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:28,010
Unfortunately, I cannot agree

53
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,540
to this royal interrogation today.

54
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,610
It is because the crown prince

55
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,130
is not guilty of any charges.

56
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:59,160
I have known this truth since a long time ago, Your Majesty.

57
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,230
Left State Councilor, what are you doing right now?

58
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:16,510
Also, I am probably not the only person aware of that fact.

59
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,340
You know it too, Your Majesty.

60
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,410
Isn't this a familiar scene you have seen a lot from somewhere?

61
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,910
Isn't this an event that was repeated countless times?

62
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,780
The state of this country's court that has long eliminated one's political enemies

63
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,510
without any clear physical proof, but with just suspicion alone!

64
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,990
Both Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau, usually in charge of investigating treason cases)  and the Special Prosecutors

65
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,980
failed to obtain not only any evidence from the crown prince himself,

66
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,940
but also obtained no confession from others regarding any conspiracy among them.

67
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,100
Holding an interrogation at this juncture when even the charges are unclear?

68
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,100
This is not right, Your Majesty.

69
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,370
At this place where there is not even a sliver of evidence to prove the charges,

70
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,850
causing a bloodbath again,

71
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:29,180
I cannot accept it, Your Majesty.

72
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,340
What?

73
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,150
Has that guy Min Jin Heon gone crazy?

74
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,140

75
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,460
Cease the interrogation?  How can you do this without discussing it with me?

76
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,320
Moreover, it was to be conducted by His Majesty himself.

77
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,260
The one who objected to it was me, but the one who had the final say was His Majesty.

78
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,540
Isn't that because His Majesty also knows that he lacks cause?

79
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,560
It must be the same with you as well.

80
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,020
All right, I smelled the unpleasant smell you mentioned, too.

81
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,860
The crown prince may be innocent.

82
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,810
However, at times, for the monarch's dignity,

83
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,210
other things should be sacrificed.

84
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,120
Without the crown prince's sacrifice, the king's authority cannot be upheld.

85
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:09,580
Really?  Am I the one in the wrong?  Do you think so, too?

86
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,520
- Your Majesty.
 - Answer me!

87
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,530
I am asking whether you think I am persecuting my brother as a political enemy when he's innocent?

88
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,830

89
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,060
The interrogation has been stopped because the left state councilor stepped in?

90
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,980
But how come His Excellency Min Jin Heon...

91
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,680
Yes, the crown prince has gained a chance to prove the charges against him are wrong.

92
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,110
Queen Dowager, this is all thanks to you.

93
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,030
Don't mention it.  If the crown prince is innocent,

94
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,480
that fact will become known for all to see.

95
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,170
I am sorry, Your Highness, but I will take my leave of you now.

96
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,360
It was just the last venture at the edge of a cliff.

97
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,950
I really did not know you would hold my hand for me.

98
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,580
I simply did not want a trashy machination to degrade politics.

99
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,850
I never meant to help you, Your Highness.

100
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,540
Still, words of thanks are due.

101
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,880
You'd better not say them,

102
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,550
because your path and mine will never converge, by any means.

103
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,130
Of course, I know that too, very well.

104
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,760
However, on a same boat,

105
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,960
let us, for now, try to overcome this wave.

106
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,890
Afterward, like you said,

107
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,760
I will again try to push you off the boat.

108
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,370
You look flustered.

109
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,080
Of course. Why wouldn't you?

110
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,310
Your interrogation is stopped but we still have the traitors we captured.

111
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,180
- You are done if they confess.
 - Is that right?

112
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,470
What are you doing? Go right ahead and get their confessions.

113
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,540
Shall we try and see?

114
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,460
Whether you'll do it or I'll do it.

115
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,530
Do it with all your might, Deputy Inspector General Wi.

116
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,850
Your... life depends on it.

117
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,710
Are you really going out of the palace?

118
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,210
Why bring danger on your own when your interrogation is stopped?

119
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,450
Still, the state tribunal is ongoing.

120
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,750
I must find out where this fabricated treason started.

121
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,220
- Why would you do that—
 - It must be to catch Prince Milpoong.

122
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:17,230
Also, he must punish those who got blinded by greed and tried to beguile His Majesty.

123
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,600
Ultimately they'll go into the grave they dug.

124
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,770
Prince Milpoong and Wi Byeong Joo...

125
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,690
I won't let them get away this time.

126
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,240
I am positive.

127
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,380
The coroner has testified that he was ordered by Wi Byeong Joo.

128
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,130
Kang Soo Chang, who was the inspector on duty that day also testified that Wi Byeong Joo was inside Saheonbu at the time.

129
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,870
Lest that might come to light, he transferred Kang Soo Chang out of Saheonbu.

130
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,670
We'll catch Wi Byeong Joo on this.

131
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,610
I am positive he's responsible for Hyung-nim Jeong Seok's death.

132
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,630
Your Highness.

133
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,280
We have heard that the interrogation is placed on hold for now.

134
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,610
That's why we don't have much time.

135
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,890
Before the captives start to succumb to torture and make false testimonies,

136
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,740
we must find out who is behind this.

137
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,250
Yes. We'll catch Wi Byeong Joo. Yeo Ji is in pursuit as well.

138
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,740
Then, I need to see that person, Dal Moon.

139
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,800
Dal Moon?

140
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,550
There must be a reason why he left a message in the tabloid sheets.

141
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,490
He may be secretly digging up dirt on Prince Milpoong.

142
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,100
It may be so, but if Dal Moon had to deceive all of us, don't you think he had his reasons?

143
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,500
If it is to evade Prince Milpoong's suspicion and to deceive the bastard completely...

144
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,300
That is why I should help him.

145
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,880
- I must help Dal Moon.
 - Pardon?

146
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,070
So that his plan becomes even more perfect.

147
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,880
In a way that is most useful to Dal Moon right now.

148
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,990
- I will be back in a short while.
 - Okay.

149
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,180
This is what's going on in Uigeumbu.

150
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,960
For now, this is what's going on in the state tribunal.

151
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,270
Please keep it coming.

152
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,020
Is this all that's going on in the palace?

153
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,450
They are pieces of information from the king's quarters, Queen Dowager's quarters, Uigeumbu, and state tribunal.

154
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,550
Since this is an emergency, collect more information for all timelines.

155
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,600
Yes.

156
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,530
But, by the way, Goon Tae is nowhere to be seen.

157
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,900
I've given a separate task to Goon Tae.

158
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,100
Don't worry about it and you can leave now.

159
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,840
Yes.

160
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,940
 I found him. I got him.

161
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,960
 As you ordered, I followed any transfer of Prince Milpoong's assets,

162
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,650
 and recently a man received land and two houses.

163
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:07,240
 It must be a reward for doing Prince Milpoong's bidding.  Tail him closely.

164
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,890
 Yes.

165
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,540
Wait, wait, hold it there.  Is this a new dress?

166
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,320
You've done your hair very prettily.

167
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,920
 This petition is written very well.

168
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,650
Are you ready to have fun today?

169
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,520
Why is it always that bastard Lee Geum?

170
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,990
Why can't I get him no matter what I do?

171
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,750
Don't do this.  Calm down.

172
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,830
Unhand me!  I don't need you either.

173
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,650
He always looked down on me

174
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,110
when I'm the legitimate heir of Crown Prince Sohyeon!

175
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,950
He looked down on me because I grew up in the countryside like a bumpkin

176
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,900
when he has lowly blood running in his body!

177
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,180
You have a big inferiority complex.

178
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,470
What?

179
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,970
Inferiority complex?

180
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,670
- As far as I know...
 - Stop it!

181
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,190
the crown prince does not discriminate against people based on their origin,

182
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,490
so it must be an inferiority complex.

183
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,350
- What?
 - Isn't that why you hate him even more?

184
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,960
Because a nobody keeps exacerbating your inferiority complex.

185
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,070
Try blabbering that again.

186
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,160
Inferiority complex?

187
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:44,260
Just because you can collect these pieces of paper, do you think you're somebody?

188
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,470
Get lost before I kill you.

189
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,320
- Even without a beggar bastard like you—
 - You'll be in trouble

190
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,940
because now is the time when you have an absolute need for information.

191
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,370
I know the crown prince and I know Min Jin Heon well, too.

192
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,290
How they move.

193
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:14,140
So how about you get proper use out of me?

194
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,750
The beginning and end of this matter,

195
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,120
if I know the entire matter,

196
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,460
I may be able to help you, Your Highness.

197
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,240
Inform you

198
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,540
of the entire matter?

199
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,980
You'll help me?

200
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,330
What's this?

201
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,880
This impertinent son of a bitch...

202
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,070
Why would he...

203
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,230
 What are you doing?

204
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,520
 Announce to Prince Milpoong that I'm here to see him.

205
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,740
Your Highness, please stay back.

206
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,670
Are you daring to unsheath your swords before the crown prince?

207
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,780
The dogs working under him take after their master and have big livers  (audacious) .

208
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,450
Lee Geum!  Where do you think you are?

209
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,680
So I run into you here, Dal Moon.

210
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,590
Your Highness.

211
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,740
Tell your men to put away their swords first.  They are fearful.

212
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,950
In the end, they won't be able to slay the crown prince.

213
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,240
Useless things!  After all the money I paid them...

214
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,600
Human beings cannot always live by money and power.

215
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,410
Oh, of course, there are exceptions.

216
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,160
You used to be Min Jin Heon's dog, and sided with me too,

217
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,490
and now you're Prince Milpoong's hunting dog.

218
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:44,150
Didn't you say once that all you needed was the power to safeguard your family?

219
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,950
Why?

220
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,100
Did you think I would just crumble like this?

221
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,100
I don't think you should be doing this right now, Crown Prince.

222
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,110
Why don't you go back and try to save your own ass?

223
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,950
No way, Tan.  Now the one pressed for time is you,

224
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,910
because I am going to catch and imprison you as the mastermind behind the treason case.

225
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,490
You kindly warned me of a headwind.

226
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,080
Thanks to that, I was prepared.

227
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,250
Don't make me laugh.  When you don't even have any evidence, how can you—

228
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:29,050
If I don't, why do you think Min Jin Heon sided with me?

229
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,100
What?  How would you get evidence?

230
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,470
Royal Concubine Lady Choi,

231
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Bi Geum Yi Mil.

232
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,610
That humiliating tabloid sheet claiming that I am not the predecessor king's son.

233
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:53,450
You couldn't have dared to do such a thing without giving up on your life.

234
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,900
Of course, it was a risk undertaken with my life on the line.

235
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,920
And by the side of Prince Milpoong,

236
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,970
I am attaining my goals.

237
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,650
You have the confidence?

238
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,990
To some extent, since you're reacting this way.

239
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,630
As for me, I have no other way but to bet even more on Prince Milpoong.

240
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,250
Okay.

241
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:41,610
If that is your choice,  I shall make you see the end of it

242
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,200
beside Prince Milpoong, no matter what,

243
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,650
Dal Moon.

244
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,460
Royal Concubine Lady Choi. Bi Geum Yi Mil.

245
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:17,880
That crazy bastard can't possibly have something.  No way...

246
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,610
How can you be sure of it?

247
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,670
The crown prince is a formidable person.

248
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,760
Isn't it true that Min Jin Heon sided with him?

249
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,030
Now that it has come to this, we have no place to retreat, Your Highness.

250
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,600
You have to live so that I and my family can also live.

251
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
Don't you see?

252
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,960
When you give me no information, what can I do?!

253
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,400
Your Highness Prince Milpoong!

254
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,280
Have you seen Head Merchant Dal Moon?

255
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,420
As I have guessed, he was with Tan.

256
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,370
Do you think he understood your intention?

257
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,600
Clearly.  Moreover, Dal Moon is getting close to the details of Prince Milpoong's crime.

258
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,670
Go back to Saheonbu and let Moon Soo know about this.

259
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,670
I have to return to the palace and do something.

260
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,950
I got it.

261
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,110
The crown prince knows.

262
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,040
As expected, he did find the hidden meaning in the tabloid sheets.

263
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,450
Really?

264
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,800
Excuse me? The crown prince knows what?  What do you mean by the meaning of the tabloid sheets?

265
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,360
I am sorry for not telling you earlier.

266
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,800
Hyung-nim did not betray the crown prince.

267
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,430
Of course, our hyung-nim is not someone who'd do that.

268
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,450
What?  Then, purposefully...

269
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,380
Since Prince Milpoong was going to spy on me, I had no other way.

270
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,400
Until he completely trusted me, I could not tell anyone including the crown prince.

271
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,650
Head Merchant.

272
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,890
I am sorry.

273
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,200
Prince Milpoong has given me his information.

274
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,650
He got intimidated by the crown prince's assertion that he had evidence in his hands.

275
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,960
From now on, we will hunt down

276
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,540
Prince Milpoong with this.

277
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,550

278
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,980
Maybe Saheonbu will get finished off this way?

279
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,970
What is this?  This strange atmosphere surrounding the Saheonbu?

280
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:09,110

281
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,290
Are you really going to charge Deputy Inspector General Wi?

282
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,530
He is a criminal who killed a fellow inspector.  If we won't charge him, then who would?

283
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,280
But this is like washing our organization's dirty linen in the public.

284
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,740
If you are ashamed of that sort of thing, you can stay out of this.

285
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,600
If you feel more comfortable with hiding it, that is.

286
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,070
But remember this one thing.

287
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,490
Anyone can suffer the same fate.

288
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,200
But if we keep our mouths shut now, if the same thing repeats in the future,

289
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,040
nobody will come forward to address it...

290
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,330
Because you'd be too used to silence.

291
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,140
What is this scene about?

292
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,460
Why has the inspectors' room gone to the dogs?

293
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,690
Everyone, let's move.

294
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,330
- Where are you going?
 - We're going to stage a yadasi.

295
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,880

296
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,120
Yadasi?

297
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,590
Yadasi?!

298
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,750
We have to kick out Deputy Inspector General Wi quickly.

299
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,670
If he can't expose anything at the state tribunal,

300
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,920
in the end, Saheonbu will get blamed for it.

301
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,570
Since he's committed corruption, too, should we disrobe him of the official uniform?

302
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:46,290
However, then, Saheonbu will end up helping out the crown prince.

303
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,750
If the crown prince solidifies his position,

304
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,050
in the end, our Saheonbu will be in even more danger.

305
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,090
Can't do this, can't do that!

306
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,800
Wi Byeong Joo!

307
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,370
What a sorry shape we are in because of that slippery eel-like Namin, Wi Byeong Joo!

308
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,780
My Lord Inspector General, there is huge trouble.

309
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,400
It's a yadasi again.

310
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,910
The inspectors are about to roll it out again!

311
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,320
What?!

312
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,160
Won't you stop it right now!

313
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,370
Yes, I have gotten the report about Deputy Inspector General Wi.

314
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,250
It is a huge problem. I was shocked as well.

315
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,380
But what do you have to gain by a yadasi?

316
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,300
The Saheonbu is already on fire, so to speak, and now you're going to add fuel to it?

317
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,100
A high-ranking Saheonbu official murdering his colleague?

318
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,200
If this gets out, we are—

319
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,750
At the time of that incident, you were the deputy inspector general, weren't you, Lord Inspector General?

320
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,910
You two were still the head and chief inspectors at the time.

321
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,460
You were all colleagues and bosses to the late Lord Han Jeong Seok,

322
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,980
but you turned a blind eye

323
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,750
even though there definitely were suspicions.

324
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,550
- Look here, Inspector Park.  That was—
 - You're right, I am trying to add fuel to Saheonbu.

325
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,150
The flame will have to spread to its body

326
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,230
for you to feel the heat at least a little bit.

327
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,160
Let's go!

328
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,020
Look here!  Stop right there!  Stop!

329
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,980
Are you disobeying me?!

330
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,290
But these punks...

331
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,330
- Th-That!
 - My Lord, if this becomes known publicly,

332
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,020
we won't be able to escape responsibility.

333
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,570
The proof Inspector Park found is too evident.

334
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:57,920
Those guys, are they saying we should all die together or what?!

335
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,940
Why is my fate so rough?  Why are there yadasi's only when I am the lead inspector?

336
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,800

337
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,260

338
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,920
 Passed in first place...

339
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,700
 Yes, that is how I've come all the way here.

340
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,120
 You are not even a Soron, but you're a Namin?

341
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,600
 Wow, this is my first time seeing a Namin in an important government position.

342
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,840
 All they had was the Noron origin and family.

343
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,780
 Everyone, let's call it a day.

344
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,450
 It is a case report.

345
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,550
 You did well.  Put it there and leave.

346
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,200
 Yes.

347
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,170
 Among those dirty and incompetent jerks...

348
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,060
 - Why don't we go have a drink?
 - Let's.

349
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,550
 without even one person to shield me...

350
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,220
 Gosh, seriously.

351
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,890
 the one who has come all this way just by virtue of my ability was me.

352
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:38,030
So why do I have to fall to the bottom again?

353
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,260
 A dog, watching over the powerful's yard,

354
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,240
 that barks and bites at their command?!

355
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:04,950
 Yes, what I did once... why can't I do it for the second time?

356
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,450
Deputy Inspector General Wi.

357
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,370
Just in time.  Relay this message to Saheonbu.

358
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,910
There is a possibility that this treason was fabricated.

359
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,950
And behind it seems to be Prince Milpoong.

360
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,910
What?  Fabricated?  Prince Milpoong?

361
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,190
I will take care of things here, so Saheonbu should help me with...

362
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,930
If even this gets stopped,

363
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,640
you really won't have any way out.

364
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,900
I'm saying there seems to be no way out for you, Lord.
