1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:09,520

2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,960
Allow me to pour you a drink.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,770
Sure.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,150
My greetings have been delayed. I thank you for your help.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,280
I've simply confessed my crime, no more no less.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,330
I've heard about what happened in the king's palace.

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,030
That you volunteered to be exiled.

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,390
They don't seem to know about it, so let's keep that quiet.

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,390
I don't want to kill your excitement.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,560
I am a lout with no future, so it doesn't matter how I live.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,480
But what about you? You are a progeny of a noble family of the Noron faction.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,850
Why take on such a laborious job?

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,800
No.

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:07,030
The truth is that I chose this path because it is easiest for me.

15
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,100
Why would anyone choose the more difficult path?

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,920
After all, didn't you do the same, Your Highness?

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,150
Rather than retreat and pretend not to know, facing it was easier.

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,970
Lord, it is your turn. Hurry now.

19
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,310
Let's play together. You know how to play the "Seung Gyeong Do" game  (a fantasy promotion board game) , right?

20
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,530
No, I'm fine. You guys...

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,200
Ah Bong, what are you doing?

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,160
Come on, His Highness will play with us. Give him the game piece.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,790
No thanks.

24
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,040
Come on, go ahead and throw it.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,020
Now I will acknowledge you as one of us too, Your Highness.

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,100
Shall I be grateful?

27
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,360
How about this?

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,550
He is beginning late in the game, but he did receive the highest score on the exam in real life.

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,700
So shall we say that he already passed the civil service exam?

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,420
Yes, that's right.

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,990
He took the test for another, but he did get the highest score.

32
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,280
You scored the highest, and you are also of royal lineage, so why don't you begin from the senior third rank.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,510
No, that's cheating.

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,550
Never mind. Hurry and throw it.

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,460
Everyone is waiting.

36
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,740
Everyone prepare yourselves. I am the master of sundry skills and tricks.

37
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,710
Aigoo, is someone trying to throw the game piece with his mouth?

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,870
Three.

39
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,770
- You are the king.
 - What?

40
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,680
Hold on. One, two, three...

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,100

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,980
That's right.

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,790
You are really the king.

44
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,860
What are you saying? There are no kings in the "Seung Gyeong Do" game.

45
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,390
We drew in a king's throne ourselves for fun.

46
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,850
How blasphemous.

47
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,080
It appears that this was just a joke.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,070
Yes. We made that up, but it was supposed to be impossible.

49
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,580
Hey, but since it's happened, give it a try.

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,140
After all, it's a game. Isn't that true, Hyung-nim?

51
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,910
What?

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,440
Alright.

53
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,010
A king can do anything he wants to.

54
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,460
Just give the royal command.

55
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,970
Yes, as you said, it is just a game.

56
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,910
So I am the king.

57
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,990
You two are loyal and diligent,

58
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,910
so I'd like you two to be in charge of the Capital Bureau and protect Hanyang.

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,390

60
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,190
- Us?
 - Wow! Us?

61
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,330
They do not suit those positions, though.

62
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,510
You have conviction and you are fair, so you are the prime minister.

63
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,960
 (Prime Minister: the highest government position of State Council)

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,740
Your Excellency Prime Minister!

65
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,490
Hyung-nim, you are the prime minister!

66
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,620
You are so meticulous that you are tiresome, but you know the rules and principles.

67
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,120
You are the commissioner of the police bureau.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,290
- Me?
 - Police commissioner. Wow.

69
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,640
- Commissioner Cheon!
 - My pal, Police Commissioner.

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,230
And you who believe that equality is the true way of this world,

71
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,350
you are the Inspector General of the Saheonbu which enforces the laws of our nation.

72
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,720

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,950
Whoa. I-Inspector general?

74
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,810
Me? I am really the inspector general heading the Saheonbu?

75
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,730
So how about it? Am I a playing the game properly as the king?

76
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,590
Your Majesty! Your grace is immeasurable!

77
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,820
Your grace is immeasurable!

78
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,970
I'm the inspector general, punk!

79
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,630
But I think the king might be too handsome.

80
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,990
Arrest him!

81
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,090

82
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,310
Of course, he should have done better.

83
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,510
To give a great position to one who is unworthy

84
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:42,530
was to expect him to perform during that one moment in need.

85
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,160
But it turned out, there was a nail sticking out

86
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,290
in a spot where we did not expect.

87
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,510
But political currents constantly change and we have been victors for a long time,

88
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,540
and we know how to always win, do we not?

89
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,160
Older Brother, Prince Yeoning.

90
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,530
Hwon.

91
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,860

92
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,290
Please give Hwon dry clothing to change into, and bring him something warm to eat.

93
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,660
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't bother yourself. I apologize for waking you so late at night.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,160
Please don't say such things, Your Highness.

96
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm really fine. Hey...

97
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,270
Hyung-nim, please retract your request to volunteer for exile.

98
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,470
It isn't too late.

99
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,300
I don't intend to do that.

100
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,560
- I will leave for Tamra in three days as planned. 
- Hyung-nim!

101
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,240
Do you know why I confidently asked for an exile?

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,280
Because you will become the next king.

103
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,660
And because I know you, as the future king, will never release me from the exile out of personal feelings.

104
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,960
That is the sort of king you will become.

105
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,470
A just king without self-interest.

106
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,630
As you did for me,

107
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,190
you will embrace even those most lowly subjects that everyone else shuns.

108
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,160
A king like that.

109
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,020
No.

110
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,500
Please don't do this.

111
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,450
Hwon, the people of this nation...

112
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,520
don't they at least once deserve to have a king like that, boy?

113
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,850
I also want to live in a Joseon in which you are the king.

114
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,750
Older Brother.

115
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,830
So you must not come to see me again.

116
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,360
They will definitely mount a counterattack.

117
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,200
Don't lose to them, Hwon.

118
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,640
This is regarding Inspector Han Jeong Seok.

119
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Can I entrust you with it?

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,630
The day I passed my exam and became an inspector of the Saheonbu,

121
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,840
I set fire to the straw-roofed house that I had been living in.

122
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,210
I was determined to never return to such a lowly house.

123
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,880
Indeed, the nights of Hanyang seem to be in your grasp, Your Excellency.

124
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,150
So how can I not envy those hands of yours?

125
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,150
I know who that is, too, Your Excellency.

126
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,990
I wouldn't have come if I didn't have the confidence.

127
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,800
Let us not shed blood.

128
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,530
Stop. Retreat.

129
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,590
Indeed, he doesn't even feel pain.

130
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,590
What a great hunting dog you have there.

131
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,150
So who are you? What brings you here?

132
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,420
I am a useless cad.

133
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,690
Originally, I was a beggar from the neighborhood of the Gwangtong Bridge.

134
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,140
Wow, these are nice.

135
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,420
Wow, is this white porcelain?

136
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,260
A lowly beggar could not recognize such things.

137
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,350
I imagine that you are more curious about how I found this place.

138
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,920
A lowly beggar like me.

139
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,660
Recently, there was a whirlwind of rumors about Prince Milpoong tearing through the capital city.

140
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,890
"So fast. The rumors spread so fast that they could not be controlled."

141
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:07,270
Didn't you think that, Lord?

142
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,580
What is it that you want to say?

143
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,130
I am the one who did that.

144
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,800
And I came here to brag to you about what I did.

145
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,520
What is this?  Weren't we to meet at Mapo Port?

146
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,010
Why are you so slow? What time is it already?

147
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,200
Hey, Yeo Ji, why are you—

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,820
Looks like you received a note, too.

149
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,390
Let's hurry. We are in a rush.

150
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,180
Hold on, Your Highness. Looks like we need to clarify some things.

151
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,990
- Clarify?
 - Look, it's not as if I am your mutt.

152
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,440
You just issue orders like this and expect me to go wherever you tell me? That isn't right.

153
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,360
I have to study and I am quite busy—

154
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,700
Undo this rope, and give up on studying.

155
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,140
- It's over for you already.
 - What?

156
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,210
In this world, there are people who just can't do something, no matter how they try.

157
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,510
It's not as if just anyone can get the highest score, as I did, after making a minor effort.

158
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,280
Look here, Your Highness. How can you speak harshly like that?

159
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,730
Well, if you're ever in the mood,

160
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,850
perhaps I can take the exam for you?

161
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,530
Whoa, Your Highness. Are you picking a fight with me?

162
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,540
Just because you are a prince, you think it is alright...

163
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,740
Stop grumbling and just go.

164
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,180
Oh, geez.

165
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,040
You heard what he said, right? What a rude guy.

166
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,270
Yes, he is arrogant and hopeless.

167
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,740
- He is very full of himself.
 - Right?

168
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,660
Yes, he doesn't consider others' feelings and only speaks the truth.

169
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,080
That's what I... hey, wait a minute.

170
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,360
But it appears that he is not a bad person.

171
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,750
So please go and don't make a fuss.

172
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,170
He will be leaving us soon.

173
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,650
Leaving us? What are you saying? Where is he going?

174
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,530
Your Majesty, please allow me to escort you.

175
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,200
These are the results of profiling Prince Milpoong.

176
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,810
It contains everything since his days in Ganghwa Island  (Prince Milpoong's birth place and childhood home) .

177
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,760
The reason I sought you out rather than the director of the Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau)

178
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,050
is that I know that the classified information

179
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,280
is ultimately in your hands.

180
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,420
All higher-ups leave the Uigeumbu  (investigative agency under the direct control of the king)  at some point.

181
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,160
But not an agent like you who actually performs the day-to-day duties.

182
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,160
You are the talents keeping the Uigeumbu strong all your lives.

183
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,810
I am highly flattered, Your Majesty.

184
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:11,390
You must know the reason I summoned you here rather than to the palace, right?

185
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,450
The Uigeumbu is under your direct control.

186
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,720
Not a word will be leaked outside.

187
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
Raise your head.

188
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,560
His Majesty must have asked you for classified information on Prince Milpoong.

189
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,240
I belong to the Uigeumbu, Your Excellency.

190
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,030
If you ask me an unanswerable question, that will get me in trouble.

191
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,830
Of course you will pretend ignorance

192
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,750
as to how much information was given the king.

193
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,720
But you must have a present for me too, right?

194
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,360
Of course.  Because even though the Uigeumbu is under the direct control of the king,

195
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,230
that kingship is not a permanent position either.

196
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,570
But I must know how you are going to use it.

197
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,200
I have to watch out for myself, too.

198
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,300
Under no circumstance, will you suffer any harm

199
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,840
because I secured the services of a rather useful beggar.

200
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,870

201
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,260
- Make the rumors as dirty as possible.
 - Yes.

202
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,200
They must spread through the capital before the end of the day.

203
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,970
Just trust my skills.

204
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,190
Now you are going to swallow up Gae Dol's gisaeng house

205
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,020
and get some rich and powerful sponsors too?

206
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,450
Like your dream, is the day coming when beggars like us

207
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,690
can stop crouching and live it up too?

208
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:56,910
That's right.  The political intrigues among the high and powerful are none of my business.

209
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,980
We take what we need. That's all.

210
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,420
This is all Prince Milpoong's land?

211
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:16,590
So from o...ver there all the way to here?

212
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,000
Take bragging out of him and Prince Milpoong might as well be a corpse.

213
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,480
His itchy mouth couldn't hold it in and spilled it to me a while ago,

214
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,640
saying that beside this plot, he had plenty all over the eight provinces of Joseon.

215
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,890
So bragging runs in the royal blood.

216
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,670
He must hold them all under different names.

217
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,150
If you steal them all, they should come in handy.

218
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:42,390
Report this too to the Saheonbu.

219
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,630
There should be a gisaeng house nearby.  Do you want to go and wet your throat?

220
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,390
Do you know this neighborhood?

221
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,630
Didn't you say this was your first visit here?

222
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,040
There is no way Prince Milpoong frequents neighborhoods without gisaeng houses.

223
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,640
The ways royalty play are pretty predictable.

224
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,360
Follow me.

225
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,730
Indeed, the players know the rules of the game.

226
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,170
Come in.

227
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,760
Here, first accept a cup from me.

228
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,350
I suggested a nice place.  Why a tavern?

229
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,810
It's okay to drink at any place.

230
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,470
Drink sparingly.  To go on a long trip, you need a fat purse.

231
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,570
Thank you, Your Highness.

232
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,120
Of all the men I've seen,

233
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,070
Your Highness is truly the manliest.

234
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,700
What hogwash I'm hearing from you.  Drink up.

235
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,920
Speaking of which,

236
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,340
shall we become pledged brothers?

237
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,860
Aigoo, gross, seriously...

238
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,290
What?  Pledged brothers?

239
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,560
I mistook you, Your Highness.

240
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,820
Because you have a gigolo's face, I didn't know you were a real man.

241
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,060
Look here, scoot over there.

242
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,600
- Go back to your seat.
 - How old are you?

243
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,080
We have to figure out who's the hyung (older brother) and who's the dongsaeng (younger sibling).

244
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,220
Let me see your ID stick.  Where is it?

245
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,530
Where do you think you're fumbling?

246
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,060
That's right!  Let's allow Yeo Ji in, too.

247
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,990
She's actually a tremendous macho man.

248
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,740
Three brothers! Three brothers would be just perfect!

249
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,370
All right, no biggie.  I'll let you become the eldest brother, Your Highness.

250
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,610
Okay, Hyung-nim, let's have a drink. Here.

251
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,790
To our eldest brother...

252
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,100
Speaking of the devil, where did you send our youngest Yeo Ji?

253
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,990
Really?  Prince Yeoning is so infamous?

254
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,870
Don't even get me started.

255
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,010
He is widely known in gisaeng houses and at gambling tables.

256
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,970
Aigoo, he practically lives at archery ranges where rakes gather.

257
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,590
That's right!

258
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,180
Indeed, Prince Yeoning the rake.

259
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:16,680
Still, Prince Yeoning is not a bad person by nature.

260
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,010
What did you say, Elder?

261
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:24,170
Right, there was a time during the last year's drought,

262
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,960
when piles of rice sacks suddenly appeared at night in front of the town hall?

263
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,810
Oh, you mean when the rice subsidized by the government ran out?

264
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,450
There is a rumor that the one who provided that was Prince Yeoning.

265
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,800
- Is that true?
 - That's what I'm saying.

266
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,520
Because his mother is from the lowest class,

267
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,560
he understands how the have-nots feel.

268
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,390
He understands what the highborn royalty wouldn't understand,

269
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,560
even if they died and came back to life.

270
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,000
Everyone's here.

271
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,040
There is quite a hubbub in the streets and everywhere!

272
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,420
Gambling and womanizing are not all.

273
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,120
He stole several thousand houses from the common people.

274
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,310
Acting the part of a sorry prince that he is,

275
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,350
the money he looted from the national coffer

276
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,920
is as much as 500 thousand nyang!

277
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,720
How much?  500 thousand nyang!

278
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,120
This darned rotten bastard!

279
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,110
How much did I say?  That's right!

280
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,730
Is that really true?

281
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,560
There is a rumor spreading about how he hid silver bullion underground.

282
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,940
Prince Yeoning's been playing around with so many married women.

283
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,290
Really?

284
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,890
So the rumor was true?

285
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,460
Hey, look. What the heck are you...

286
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,230
But this is...

287
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,130
 Yes, this is too rapid considering these are the outskirts of the capital.

288
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,690
 The talks about me are spreading too fast.

289
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,420
What?  Rumors about Prince Yeoning are spreading?

290
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,910
His Highness expected this to happen.

291
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,550
That they might call the credibility of his testimony into question through attacks upon his character.

292
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,830
He asked me to come up with a solution.

293
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,090
They will undermine Prince Yeoning's moral character

294
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,220
and even shake up the truth of his words?

295
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,340
Have you heard?

296
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,840
Then, was Prince Milpoong also...

297
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,360
Halt for a second.

298
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,630
He's always had a bad reputation.

299
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,590
He has done stealing, womanizing,

300
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,780
and everything else that's bad.

301
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,550
He's done all sorts of bad things.

302
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,080
It's because Prince Yeoning comes from the lowest class.

303
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,090
That is—

304
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,270
It's time to wrap this up now.

305
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,100
A letter from His Excellency, Minister of the Interior.

306
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,250
Over here.

307
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,040
How did it go?

308
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,660
I've made arrangements for you to meet Prince Milpoong.

309
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,730
Since you're the prime minister's mistress,

310
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,550
did he send you to look in on him?

311
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,690
He says to deliver these words for him.

312
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,340
For you to do your work properly.

313
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,620
Yoon Yeong! Yoon Yeong!

314
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,990
Please calm down, Your Highness.

315
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,030
I'm so scared.

316
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,060
I want to go home, Yoon Yeong.

317
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,370
Get a hold of yourself, I said!

318
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,810
It's not the time for you to be whining.

319
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,260
Prince Yeoning is suffering that plight then?

320
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,820
After making me like this, he's getting his retribution!

321
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,530
You'll come out soon since Prince Yeoning's testimony will fall apart.

322
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,540
Then, it's no issue for me to become king, right?

323
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,700
That's what we need.

324
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,660
But right now, your current reputation...

325
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,990
I'm going to have to eat oxtail soup first thing after I get out.

326
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,250
These things! I asked for oxtail soup!

327
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,630
But they gave me radish leaf soup and rice!

328
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,980
Your Royal Prince, this isn't the time to sing about food—

329
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,870
Wait.

330
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,760
They gave you soup rice?

331
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,580
They did, I said. Yesterday they gave me what I wanted though.

332
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,290
No need to feed the dog that is useless?

333
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,330
Can't be, Minister of the Interior. He...

334
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,590
Come on in.

335
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,530
This is my private study.

336
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,460
What are you all doing at my home at such a late hour?

337
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,270
What did you just say, Minister of the Interior?

338
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,700
Bipartisanship.

339
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,170
It means we are prepared to go together with Prince Yeonryeong.

340
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,920
Do you mean you will enthrone Prince Yeonryeong?

341
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,070
Then what about Prince Milpoong?

342
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,440
Cracked fine porcelain is even less useful than crude crockery.

343
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,400
And cheap broken woodware, even less.

344
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,670
Prince Milpoong cannot be king.

345
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,450
The next king set forth by Noron is Prince Yeonryeong.

346
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,860
However, in order for that, there's something for you to do.

347
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,000
Inspector General.

348
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,040
Why did you seek me out at this hour, Chief Royal Secretary?

349
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,190
Your Majesty. Inspector General, Lord Lee Yi Gyeom, is here.

350
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,510
Have him come in.

351
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:01,090
Your Majesty, for what reason did you want to see me at such an hour?

352
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,890
Be seated.

353
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,450
This is something that no one can know.

354
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,090
A secret solely between you and me.

355
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,160
 However, in order for that, there's something for you to do.

356
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,660
Your Majesty, what did you just say?

357
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,090
Did you say you wish to seat Prince Yeoning on the royal throne?

358
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,460
That's right.

359
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:45,390
Not Prince Yeonryeong, but Prince Yeoning. I believe he must be the one to become king.

360
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,750
 Something I need to do? What is it?

361
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,920
 With that, the Noron Faction will truly protect Prince Yeonryeong?

362
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,170
 I speak no falsehood.

363
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:12,440
 This matter should already be settled with Prince Yeonryeong too.

364
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,420
 Speak then. I will do whatever it is.

365
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,200
 Whatever it is?

366
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,840
 Well, it's not a difficult task.

367
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,620
 Retract your testimony, Your Highness.

368
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,800
 You just need to state that you lied as an informant.

369
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,340
 That it was all a scheme plotted by Inspector Han Jeong Seok.

370
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,970
 What?

371
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,110
 Retract my testimony and frame Inspector Han?

372
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,880
 Why? For what exactly?

373
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,600
 No. I can't do that. I can never do that.

374
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,930
 Then will you abandon Prince Yeonryeong?

375
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,210
 If the prince mentioned to be the next king cannot become the king, what will happen to him?

376
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:13,800
 If you open the door and leave, Prince Yeonryeong will die.

377
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,340
 Why?

378
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,200
 Why do you have to go to that extent?

379
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,370
 You are going to abandon Prince Milpoong anyway. So why? For what?

380
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,770
 That is how we win, Prince Yeoning!

381
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,120
Yeo Ji.

382
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,530
Yes, My Lord.

383
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,100
I need you to make a trip to home.

384
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,420
 Shall I tell you how we've been prevailing so far?

385
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,330
 We need to plant fear into everyone.

386
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,540
What happened?

387
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,280
 What happens when you resist and how it ends.

388
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,330

389
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,680
 If everyone in the world sees that,

390
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,020
 then no one will ever dare to come forward easily.

391
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,790
 That is always the way to win, Prince Yeoning.

392
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:23,540
 To trample on them and traumatize them with fear so they will never stand up again.

393
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,040
Your Highness!

394
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,240
Your Highness, what brings you here?

395
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,530

396
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:03,070

397
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,110
 - Drag him away.
 - Shove this dog crap right away!

398
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,760
 Don't touch Inspector Han who is innocent!

399
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,430
 The one who lured him into a trap was not me but you, Your Highness

400
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,890
 Why is this so messed up?

401
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,590
 We almost won it all!

402
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,220
 Will it suffice to only trade all this solely for Prince Yeoning?

403
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,410
 Don't abandon me.

404
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,480
 I will do anything you tell me to do, so please!

405
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,190
 He won't just leave Hyung-nim Jeong Seok in this state.

406
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,660
 It's not too late yet, Your Highness.

407
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,370
 I will leave a lifetime scar on Lee Geum's heart.

408
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,880
 What did you think you could do?

409
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,220
 The prince I approve and choose to lead after me is...

410
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,440
 There may still be something I can attempt with you two.
