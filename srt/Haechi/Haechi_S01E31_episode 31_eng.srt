1
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,100
Comb through this place.

2
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:55,000

3
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,320
What... did I do so wrong?

4
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,060
 I am sorry!

5
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,060
 I am sorry, Father.

6
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,560
 I am sorry.

7
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,620
 I did wrong, Father.

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,490
 How can you not even read Elementary Learning at that age?

9
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,990
 I am asking whether you'll be able to take the throne at this rate.

10
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,760
 I did wrong.

11
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,230
 I did wrong, Father.

12
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,710
 I am a royal descendant.

13
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,180
 I shouldn't live like this.

14
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,220
 This country belongs not to the current king,

15
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,960
 but to my grandfather, my father, and me!

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,880
 I keep that in my mind.

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,060
 I am aware of it.

18
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,180
 Such a punk can amount to only this?

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,900
 How can I trust a fool like you?

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,940
 Who will consider you king material?!

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,140
 I did wrong!

22
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,020
 I did wrong.  I am sorry, Father.

23
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,010
 I did wrong.  I am sorry, Father.

24
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,960
 I did wrong.  I am sorry, Father.

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,610
 What did I do so wrong

26
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,520
 to such an extent?

27
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,710
What more...

28
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,270
what should I have done?

29
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,920
What should I have...

30
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,930
Who is there?!

31
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,430
 (Reciting Heart Sutra)

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,070

33
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,990
Oh, forget this.

34
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,200
Then, is Tan inside the palace now?

35
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,930
There hasn't been any report of him leaving the palace.

36
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,760
That means he's definitely still here.

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,650
Why on earth?  To do what?

38
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,440
Sound the bell to summon all the soldiers to the palace now!

39
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,470
Call back all Royal Guards outside the palace

40
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,000
and order the remaining soldiers to guard the king, queen, and queen dowager.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,580
Yes, Your Highness.

42
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,930

43
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,260
What is this?

44
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,960
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,940
A bell summoning soldiers at this hour?  What calamity has befallen?

46
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,470
How about His Majesty?  Is the crown prince all right?

47
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,590
Stop the search.  We are returning to the palace now!

48
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,710
- Everyone, hurry!
 - Return to the palace!

49
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,020
Return to the palace!

50
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,990
Return to the palace!

51
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,390
He is dead.  He seems to have been stabbed multiple times by a small dagger.

52
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,110
- Your Highness. 
- This is Prince Milpoong's doing.

53
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,140
I must hurry to the king's quarters now!

54
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,020
Prince Milpoong is currently within the palace walls?

55
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,940
Every soldier within the palace is looking for him.

56
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,390
However, just in case, it would be better if Your Majesty took shelterâ€”

57
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,720
Prince Milpoong.

58
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,210
Protect His Majesty and Her Highness the Queen now!

59
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,170
Your Majesty, please stay behind.

60
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,700
Tan!

61
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,510
What the heck are you doing?

62
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,020
How dare you!

63
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,810
You are here.

64
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:07,000
I knew you'd come find me.

65
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,880
I am not here to see His Majesty.

66
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,130
I am going to go with you, Crown Prince.

67
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,680
Do you I think I will die alone?

68
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,440
No!

69
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,410
When I like you so much, Hyung-nim...

70
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,440
Prince Milpoong.

71
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,280
I'm going to go with you.

72
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,450
Even after death, I'm going to take you with me.

73
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,490

74
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,340
Open the door! Open the door!

75
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,840
The one who'll die is me.  It's my choice!

76
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,090
If Prince Milpoong cannot be king,

77
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,510
my life ends too.

78
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,610
Hyung-nim...

79
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,140
Do me this favor, Goon Tae.

80
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,010
Just for a short while,

81
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,360
keep her here.

82
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,490
I cannot go back to becoming Yoon Bok Dan again.

83
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:24,300
Dal Moon, rather than returning to the past,

84
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,320
I'll choose death.

85
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,740
- Come along!
 - When I get out, you're dead.  Unhand me.

86
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,530
What did I do wrong?

87
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,580
I'm asking what I did wrong, sons of bitches.

88
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,630
Let me go.

89
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,890
Let go of me! Let go!

90
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,060
Sons of bitches...

91
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,350
Hey, moron bastard!

92
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,090
Let go!

93
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,020
Lord moron.

94
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,270
Hey, you freaking moron!

95
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,650
You couldn't even take care of one thing, so see what sorry shape I'm in?

96
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,360
Huh?!

97
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,020
Where do you think you are to act up like this, ass*ole?

98
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,570
Drag him away.

99
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,460
Yes.

100
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,900
Come.

101
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,010
I'm not coming!  Let go of me!

102
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,430
- Let go of me.
 - Stay still.

103
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,530
Now you get looked down on even by a base thug.

104
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,990
So you should've lived properly while you had the chance.

105
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,170
Drag away the criminal to the interrogation room.

106
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,950
Yes!

107
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,650

108
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,600

109
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,740
 I am the direct descendant of Crown Prince Sohyeon!

110
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,340
 The royal throne was supposed to be my father's and mine!

111
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,760
 I am going to become the king, Prince Yeoning.

112
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,970
 That's why I came back.

113
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,700
 No.  Don't you think you'll die by my hands before that?!

114
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:37,000
 Remember, you're dying because of your older brother.

115
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,960
 Hwon. Hwon!

116
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,210
 No!

117
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,750
 Why would you show up here?

118
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,830
 You are not the kind of human being who'd show up at events like this.

119
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,870
 What if it's for the throne?

120
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,730
 What if I also want to become a king?

121
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,180
You really don't know?

122
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,420
We don't know.  We really don't know.

123
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,680
These things...

124
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,990
Hyung-nim.

125
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,890
How is she?

126
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,970
Thankfully, I think she has calmed down a little.

127
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,070
But, Hyung-nim, by the way...

128
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,730
Head Merchant!

129
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,680
Prince Milpoong's house is turned upside down.

130
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,650
He is finally completely done for, right?

131
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,000
Weren't the soldiers, by any chance, looking for anyone else?

132
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,630
Who?

133
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,380
Oh, you mean that femme fatale bi*ch Prince Milpoong had with him? Right?

134
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,230
The one who used to be Kim Chang Joong's concubine and then got involved with Prince Milpoong...

135
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,710
Watch your words, please.

136
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,490
Why do you keep using coarse language?

137
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,010
Wh-What?

138
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,440
It's not like I made this up.

139
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,740
That femme fatale!  That mistress!

140
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,800
So it was because of that woman,

141
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,950
Chae Yoon Yeong, Prince Milpoong's woman.

142
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:01,120
I can't understand you being like this toward such a woman.

143
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,340
But until it becomes safe, I will keep an eye on her.

144
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,660
I know I am doing something wrong,

145
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,590
that she, too, has to pay for her sin.

146
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,630
That's right.

147
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,060
A femme fatale,

148
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,590
a mistress,

149
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,760
that is her.

150
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,990
A woman who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.

151
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,590
Also, she encouraged Prince Milpoong to commit all his evil deeds from behind him.

152
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,970
But had she been allowed many things from birth,

153
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,260
she might not have made those choices either.

154
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,810
I...

155
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,320
- If I could have given her what she wanted...
 - Hyung-nim!

156
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,550
So at the very least, I couldn't watch her die, when I couldn't give her much.

157
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,330
I couldn't bear to see her lose her life before my eyes.

158
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,440

159
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,710
Your Highness.

160
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,000
Are you certain that there are no signs of other rebels raising an army to invade the palace?

161
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,090
Prince Milpoong alone violated the palace last night, Your Highness.

162
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,000
There were no other military movements.

163
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,490
What are the Royal Guards on duty and the Ministry of Defense doing?

164
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,120
All Royal Guards on duty are closely watching over His Majesty from the Supreme Military Headquarters.

165
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,110
The Ministry of Defense is fortifying the palace security by controlling the traffic through the palace gates.

166
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,190
What are the statuses at the Capital Bureau and Police Bureau?

167
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,300
I have relayed the royal command to take all measures to guard the capital.

168
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,060
Until everything comes to light clearly, you cannot lower your guard.

169
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,030
Since a state of emergency has been declared,

170
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,720
concentrate on the capital's security so that the citizens will not be unduly agitated.

171
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,200
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,540
I heard that Saheonbu is interrogating Wi Byeong Joo and Do Ji Gwang.

173
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,460
The investigation will be wrapped up pretty soon.

174
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,640
We will work together closely and reveal the mastermind behind this matter.

175
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,340
Has Prince Milpoong confessed to his crime?

176
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,360
Please enter, Your Highness.

177
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,620
Do you admit to all the above-mentioned crimes?

178
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,760
Would you have behaved differently

179
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,270
if you were in my shoes?

180
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,630
An upstanding and just official.

181
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,930
How long do you think you can maintain that?

182
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,840
Even if the crown prince falls,

183
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,870
even if your connection becomes useless, do you think you can maintain it?

184
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,490
Connection?

185
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,940
Till the very end, you...

186
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,020
You just haven't had the chance to show your worst side yet.

187
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,930
If only I could've had my ability acknowledged,

188
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,850
I wouldn't have come to this.

189
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,320
I could have been like you.

190
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,230
Prince Yeonryeong.

191
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:41,220
It's probably you who killed Hwon at that time, Prince Milpoong.

192
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,150
Because you were about to lose the throne to Hwon,

193
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,920
you wanted to take revenge, didn't you?

194
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,130
Me? No.

195
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,690
No.

196
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,960
"Remember, you're dying because of your older brother."

197
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,950
You are wrong, Hyung-nim.

198
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,590
The person who killed Prince Yeonryeong is you.

199
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,360
If you hadn't interfered, poor Hwon

200
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,730
wouldn't have died.

201
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,510
Prince Milpoong!

202
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,370
Your Highness!

203
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,210
Why is it you and not me?

204
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,700
Just how am I different from you?

205
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,310
The position even a lowly one like you can have,

206
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,260
why can't I have it?!

207
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,470
For sure!

208
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,630
I'll make you pay for your crimes.

209
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:16,490
No matter what... to the end.

210
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,690
Do it please. I'll look forward to it.

211
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,220
Please calm down, Your Highness.

212
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,900
Prince Milpoong will be judged by the law.

213
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:12,890
Are you really curious why His Highness was chosen and not you?

214
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:24,940
For no other reason than that the choices he made were different from yours.

215
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:32,100
Whoever it is, what makes up a human being's presence

216
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,620
is the result of all the choices he has made.

217
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:44,800
If you cannot understand what I am saying, you are helpless.

218
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:07,070
It was not for me to come forward like that.  Please forgive my impertinence.

219
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:12,280
The choices were different...  May I ask what you meant by that?

220
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,790
Do not tell me you do not know

221
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,380
that to reach this position, you have always been making choices, not for your own sake,

222
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,330
but for the sake of an even bigger cause.

223
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,340
And that is also the reason why I and Assistant Officer Jo Hyeon Myeong

224
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,120
have chosen you as our future sovereign.

225
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,570
Isn't that right, Assistant Officer?

226
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,700
Deputy Minister of Taxation!

227
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,920
Assistant Officer of Uigeumbu.

228
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,790
You have cleared yourself of all charges.

229
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,030
The rest of it is our job to take care of.

230
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,510
Now stand tall and return to the Crown Prince's Palace.

231
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,870
Your Highness.

232
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,380
So what is going to happen?

233
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,720
 Here comes His Majesty!

234
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,420
Today, I, the king, am handing down my dispositive decree regarding the scholar treason matter.

235
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,450
Investigation of the subject treason matter showed the following result:

236
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,830
a part of the evidence against the crown prince

237
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,840
was manipulated with an ignoble ulterior motive to denigrate the crown prince.

238
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,080
However, there are definite evidence and witnesses backing up the treason charges

239
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,640
of the involved scholars including Kim Seon Hyeong and Lee Gi Jin.

240
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,940
Accordingly, they are all exiled to remote areas.

241
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,010
Also, the former prime minister, Kim Chang Joong, and former minister of the interior, Lee Yi Gyeom, were found

242
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,230
to have plotted against me while I was the crown prince.

243
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,390
Exacting a stern price for their crimes is necessary.

244
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,280
Those who viciously framed the crown prince through the instant conspiracy

245
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,880
shall be exiled and then put to death by poison to strictly pay for

246
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,630
their current and all other related crimes in the past.

247
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:53,520
Also, Prince Milpoong Lee Tan, who masterminded this case and caused confusion in the court,

248
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,580
shall be confined within a thorn hedged house and then quartered to death.

249
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
Your Excellency.

250
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,270
In this world, whose end

251
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,140
will be materially different from the ends of you two?

252
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,220
Please go without holding a big grudge.

253
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,050
When he was executed during the reign of the predecessor king,

254
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,950
my father's dying words

255
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,120
were to never to go on to become a court official.

256
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,710
My brothers obeyed his word.

257
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,300
But I alone embarked on this hellish road.

258
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,580
And in the end...

259
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,230
I am faced with these consequences.

260
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:26,430
I will keep an eye on any opportunity for your families to continue on  (to be reinstated)

261
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:32,560
because you two were a big branch off of the Noron tree.

262
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,950
Even just for that, I am grateful.

263
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,620
Please take care of them for me, Left State Councilor.

264
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,400
Thank you.

265
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,620
I, too, am grateful to you, Left State Councilor.

266
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,710
They say no power lasts more than a decade.

267
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,070
Nor does a flower stay red for longer than a fortnight.

268
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,870
However, even after we disappear like this,

269
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,060
no one in this palace will realize the truth

270
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,620
and will spend the same kind of time the way we did.

271
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,370
Including you, Left State Councilor.

272
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,140
It will be like that, probably.

273
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,570
No power lasts more than a decade. No flower stays red for longer than a fortnight.

274
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:27,050
How can anyone who is afraid of the saying practice politics?

275
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,880
In this place, everyone lives to possess

276
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,900
that power even if just for a day.

277
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,900

278
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:22,910
 (Gate leading to Injeongjeon, Benevolent Administration Hall, where kings with their ministers governed Joseon)
