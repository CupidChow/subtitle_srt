1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,460
At this time, they should already be back.

2
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,460
Why did it have to be a woman?

3
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,460
Your Highness.

4
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,910
Why are you here, Your Highness?

5
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,490
No, I...

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,290
I was just passing by.

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,830
But... why... are you here?

8
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,150
What's with this look?

9
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,990
Oh, this?

10
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,730
This...

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,730
- Your Highness the Crown Prince!
 - Your Highness.

12
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,660
- Your Highness.
 - Moon Soo.

13
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,880
It's been a while, everyone.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,320
How have you been—

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,370
Hyung-nim! It's been one month and five days, Your Highness.

16
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,340
I really, really missed you, Your Highness!

17
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,760
My hyung-nim!

18
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,120
Okay, hug me to your heart's content.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,760
Aigoo, aigoo, Our Highness.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,610
An undercover investigation? Human trafficking involving the Chinese?

21
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,550
Is that what's happening?

22
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,660
Yes. As you know, the country is a mess from the war and even the plagues.

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,570
The people's lives are tough so they sell their kids.

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,080
And those kids... are being sold to Qing Dynasty as well.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,240
Right, the current world can put a price on a person.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,940
But I didn't know they were being sold to Qing Dynasty as well.

27
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,290
If there is an illegal transaction by Qing people, we'll catch them for sure, Your Highness.

28
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,720
Is there anything I can help you with? It seems dangerous with just you guys.

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,890
No, not at all, Your Highness.

30
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,520
It is you who are walking on thin ice.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,590
Right. You must stay out of this.

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,750
But the thing is, is this the only way?

33
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,150
Pardon me?

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,880
What I am saying...

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,120
Must she wear that sort of clothes?

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,560
Yeo Ji's clothes?

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,220
Ah, that looks uncomfortable.

38
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,910
But Yeo Ji is the only person who can speak the Qing language.

39
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,190
What? Uncomfortable?

40
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,120
I am fine, Your Highness. This is nothing.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,970
- It feels alright? 
- Yes.

42
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,440
- But... but that's not what I am saying now, is it? 
- What?

43
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,850
It seems those two didn't understand what His Highness meant at all.

44
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,090
- What's does he mean? 
- Why does he care what Yeo Ji wears?

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,470
No way...

46
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,380
No, that can't be. No, no.

47
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,520
What?

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,580
No. No matter how much I think about it, I don't think this is a good method.

49
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,120
I think we need to find a way, so she doesn't have to wear that sort of clothes.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,430
- Pardon me? 
- Why is that?

51
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,090
You are right. In order to keep an eye on Qing people,

52
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,100
we need to wear Japanese clothes and not Qing's clothes. So that's what you meant.

53
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,950
Right, that's what I meant.

54
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,660
Would Qing people have a secretive talk in the presence of other Qings?

55
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,830
So that's why you objected to Qing's women clothes.

56
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,480
These Japanese clothes will work better.

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,790
Of course, Your Highness. How did you come up with that bright idea?

58
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,440
I know, right?

59
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,370
I am flustered with myself for having come up with that idea.

60
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,000
Isn't it a bit strange?

61
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,890
Wow. Yeo Ji, you...

62
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,410
Don't I look awkward?

63
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,280
Do I look like a Japanese person?

64
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,390
Yes, totally.

65
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,690
Hey, you even look like a woman.

66
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,450
- Me? 
- Yes.

67
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,460
Your Highness, do you think so, too?

68
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,280
Your Highness.

69
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,990
Do I look like a woman?

70
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,340
Your Highness, are you listening?

71
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,490
Please look at me. Your Highness.

72
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,920
Ah! That's right!

73
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,270
Of course, you are a woman. Are you a man?

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,450
Just be careful, I am saying. If you get hurt like before...

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,390
- Do you understand? 
- Yeah? Yes...

76
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:46,270
Ah, you too, Moon Soo! Protect Yeo Ji well. Darn...

77
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,100
For some reason, doesn't he seem to be angry?

78
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,300
I know, right?

79
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,760
What does she mean whether she looks like a woman?

80
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,840
How... can she ask me things like that?

81
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,350
 Do I need to go to the palace like this?

82
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,610
 Alone, leaving them behind?

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,530
Oh, Hyung-nim! You came.

84
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,700
I want to check on the kid I brought yesterday.

85
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,350
- The doctor came by. He said she will be okay. 
- Really?

86
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,760
Go Mi is guarding her, so don't worry about her.

87
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,410
When you say Go Mi, do you mean the girl who got kicked out from the prime minister's house?

88
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,350
Yes. She was dying from the beating when we took her in.

89
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,660
Okay.

90
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,720
But... what's with the clothes?

91
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,140
Ta-da! We are going to the new gisaeng house in Nakseonbang to gather information.

92
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,960
That place? I heard the boss came from the north.

93
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,210
Right. Whoever it is, he is pretty good at business.

94
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,890
I heard not only the nobles but Qings and Japanese are flocking there.

95
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,640
We'd get the intelligence.

96
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,020
Be cautious.

97
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,240
Don't make a useless scene.

98
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,480
Got it.

99
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,290
I heard she almost got sold to Qing.

100
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,450
Still, I think heaven helped her as it helped me.

101
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,050
Because she ended up here.

102
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,190
Your leg...

103
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,360
I got punished by the madam I used to serve.

104
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,220
I am not limping that badly.

105
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,160
Chae... Yoon Yeong.

106
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,710
The madam you used to serve

107
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,780
was that person?

108
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,760
 - Again. 
- I don't understand this.

109
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,390
She was the prime minister's concubine.

110
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,820
And right now, she's the mistress of Prince Milpoong Tan?

111
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,920
Do you know... my madam?

112
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,120
How do you know her?

113
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,600
A murder case of a noble family?

114
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,940
This is bothering me. Look into it further.

115
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,320
I will look into it.

116
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,720
I thought you would help my brother.

117
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,840
I am sorry. But with today's incident,

118
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,890
I'd think your brother understood his position and place.

119
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,040
Is that why you volunteered to be his teacher?

120
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,330
To isolate my brother?

121
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,070
I can't trust your brother, Your Majesty.

122
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,630
There is only a 6-year age gap between you and your brother.

123
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,530
What if he has a change of heart—

124
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,440
Are you saying he'd kill me?

125
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,550
Okay, I don't trust that kid either.

126
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:44,540
Of course, he has ambition, because the palace is a place where even castrated ambition re-grows.

127
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,640
How do I know, you ask? Because that's how it was with me.

128
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,320
That's how it was with me.

129
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,380
That's why I can't trust my brother's ambition either.

130
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:05,000
But at least I should give him a chance, give him the benefit of the doubt.

131
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,880

132
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,680
It's a murder case of a noble family, you said?

133
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,550
Yes, the police are investigating right now,

134
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,210
and they've asked for Saheonbu's collaboration.

135
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,710
So, about the inspector hazing,

136
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,230
you're going to come too, right? The new gisaeng house—

137
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,290
You guys go ahead. I need to wrap up the rest of the records.

138
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,980
Okay.

139
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,120
Here are the requested files from Saheonbu.

140
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,680
You've become the mayor of Hanseong  (capital)  now,

141
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,740
so why are you asking for Saheonbu's files?

142
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,940
You mean to say why am I interfering when I've lost my central position and was demoted?

143
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,960
I'll be on my way then.

144
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,050
As expected, you've become arrogant.

145
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,590
I'm a deputy inspector general, Your Excellency.

146
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,910
Coming and going each time you ask is troublesome.

147
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,820
There are always those who mistakenly think that tomorrow will be the same as today

148
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
when the time is changing even as we speak.

149
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,770
It must be that I know how to read the flow of time, too.

150
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,960
Otherwise, would I have been able to gain this position?

151
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,810
This case.

152
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,440
How the noblemen are being murdered.

153
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,360
I think this will lead me back to the royal court.

154
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,350
Will your thought be the same then?

155
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,560
What do you mean?

156
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,040
Do you know that I used to be the inspector general of Saheonbu?

157
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,180
It means that I am used to investigating cases.

158
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,380
Did you not notice after reading through the files?

159
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,590
This is not a simple case. They are homicides by an organization.

160
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,510
This is another world.

161
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,290
Which of these is the criminal?

162
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,500
- My Lord!
 - My Lord! Have you come?

163
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,710
Here! This is the new gisaeng house!

164
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,210
I will specially kill you all here tonight.

165
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,670
He says he'll kill you all here tonight!

166
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,660
- Let's go.
 - Come in.

167
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,650
Excuse me.  (in Japanese)

168
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,740
Hey, wait there a second.

169
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,300
Are you talking to me?  (in Japanese)

170
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,950
I've never seen your face before. Who are you?

171
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,530
I'm the owner here.

172
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,490
How could I not know you?

173
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,100
I am Asako.  (in Japanese)

174
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,650
I came here yesterday, so I wasn't able to greet you yet.  (in Japanese)

175
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:42,150
But a Japanese girl understands Korean?

176
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,170
I learned to entertain Joseon guests.  (in Japanese)

177
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,600
I understand a little bit.  (in Japanese)

178
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,530
Hey there, you have to host the guest here.  (in Japanese)

179
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,450
Then, I'll be going.  (in Japanese)

180
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,890
Her face is pretty so it seems that she'll be useful.

181
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,660
Hey! Hey, Do Ji Gwang!

182
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,690
Do Ji Gwang!

183
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,150
Come, come.

184
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,940
Hey, look at this ledger. Our gisaeng house is doing amazingly right now.

185
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,860
As you said, it's a really good thing that we decorated it to have a Chinese atmosphere.

186
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,920
Are you happy?

187
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,360
You're so happy that you must sleep really well.

188
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,660
Of course! Thanks to you, I'm able to stretch my legs and sleep deeply.

189
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,900
You fool. You're that happy?

190
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,270
He says he can sleep.

191
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,030
Why...

192
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,450
Why are you being like this?

193
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,600
He lost something yesterday, so he's not in a good mood.

194
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,510
Gosh, I thought it was something serious.

195
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,730
A man shouldn't be upset over such things.

196
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,000
I mean, during work, one mig—

197
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,580
Hey you f-ing bastard.

198
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,190
Do you know how people like you get ruined?

199
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,850
After you've been ripped off, you are able to sleep. That's why you get ruined.

200
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,130
Even after someone takes what belongs to you, you're able to stretch both legs!

201
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,730
I'll tell you one thing so listen carefully.

202
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,680
If you don't know when the back of your head is prickly,

203
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,030
then you'll be stabbed with a knife and die.

204
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,380
That's how it is here.

205
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,470
By bastards like them.

206
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,910
What happened to Goon Tae and the storyteller?

207
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,730
- It seems that they were found out while spying.
 - Then...

208
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,390
They will definitely come to warn us.

209
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,180
Call everyone immediately and—

210
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,880
Auntie.

211
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,230
Goon Tae.

212
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,150
You f-ing bastards!

213
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,720
Okay... Attack!

214
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,300
- It'll be good to stop.
 - Boss!

215
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,430
I think my sword will slice your neck before they get me.

216
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,560
Who are you?

217
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,980
Your clothes look quite fancy in this cave of beggars.

218
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,180
Shut up! Just who are you that—

219
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,280
Stop.

220
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,920
You can't cause trouble.

221
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:36,440
Okay, okay. We've acquainted ourselves of each other's faces, so should we stop here?

222
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,690
You're Dal Moon, huh?

223
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,470
Do you like my gift?

224
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,160
Remember well. If guys like these linger around my territory again,

225
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,060
then only their heads will return.

226
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,750
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

227
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,380
Hey.

228
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,300
Hyung-nim. Gae Dol was with him, Hyung-nim.

229
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,730
They're like wild animals.

230
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,090
They're crazy!

231
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,190
Move them quickly. Call the doctor.

232
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,400
Yes!

233
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,030
Who is he?

234
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,000
He's the owner of the new gisaeng house in Nakseonbang.

235
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,940
- These two went to check out what it's like—
 - Wait.

236
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,610
New gisaeng house? The one even Qing and Japanese visitors frequent?

237
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,790
How did Your Highness know about that?

238
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,650
Your Highness. Your Highness! You can't do this.

239
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,260
Do Ji Gwang. It's that person's gisaeng house. That's where Yeo Ji and Moon Soo went.

240
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,230
However, we're looking for a Chinese. He is not related to this.

241
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,570
Even so, I cannot leave Moon Soo and Yeo Ji to such a dangerous place.

242
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,260
Boss!

243
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,020
This kid has something to tell you.

244
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:22,840
It's that person! That person is the one who was trafficking.

245
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,850
It's okay. What did you say?

246
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,860
The person who tried to sell me off to China.

247
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,870
The person with a scar on his face.

248
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,040
I clearly saw him.

249
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,350
Your Highness!

250
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,660
You're quite pretty.  (in Chinese)

251
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,430
How much would one night cost?  (in Chinese)

252
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,990
I'm fuming with anger. Go home.  (in Japanese)

253
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,600
What are you mumbling about?  (in Chinese)

254
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,960
- If you're drunk, just go home.
 - My Lord.

255
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,160
Who are you?  (in Chinese)

256
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,000
Are you her lover?  (in Chinese)

257
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,910
He said something like who are you to step up. Right?

258
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,080
Yes, you jerk. I don't know what you said but I am!

259
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,450
"Qingren"? What are you going to do about it?

260
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,080

261
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,520
Get lost if you don't want to get beaten up.

262
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,040
What's so special about this gisaeng?  (in Chinese)

263
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,070
You fool.  (in Chinese)

264
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,620
Apologize? You're saying you apologize? 
 ("Sha gua" = fool in Chinese, "sa gwa" = to apologize in Korean)

265
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,470
What was that just now?

266
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,730
If I wasn't quick enough, he would have been pummeled to death by you. It would have been pitiful.

267
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,750
Do you even know what he said that you acted that way?

268
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,360
Oh "qingren"? What is that?

269
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,490
Never mind. Did you learn anything?

270
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,050
Lower your voice.

271
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,710
No. How about you?

272
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,100
According to Inspector Yoon, he had information that said that

273
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,830
this is definitely the base for the traffickers to secretly act.

274
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,450
Maybe it's wrong information. It might be a trap.

275
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,300
Lord Yoon Hyeok said that it was information from his long-time friend who is at border control.

276
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,570
Just who are they!

277
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll be back after using the restroom.

278
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,040
Okay.

279
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,260
Gosh, gosh.

280
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,720
Be careful.

281
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,700
But you guys can't go to the restroom! Drink on!

282
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,050
Your Highness!

283
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,240
Let's go together. I can't send you alone either.

284
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,380
Then look around near the rear door.

285
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,440
Be careful.

286
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,530
May I help you?  (in Japanese)

287
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,630
Excuse me.

288
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,830
Your Highness!

289
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,840
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

290
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,870
Where's Yeo Ji? Where is she right now?

291
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,550
Pardon?

292
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,230
Four days later at Gwangnaroo,  (in Chinese)

293
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,010
I'll send twenty young girls to you, okay?  (in Chinese)

294
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,820
It's not the Chinese.

295
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,130
The person you must find is not Chinese.

296
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,940
What do you mean, Your Highness?

297
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,720
Each head is worth 30 nyang.  (in Chinese)

298
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,210
I can't give it for any less, not even one nyang.  (in Chinese)

299
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,780
Be sure to bring the money. Understand?  (in Chinese)

300
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,470
That man is that owner from earlier.

301
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,080
What are you doing over here?

302
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,820
What is it?

303
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,830
This girl was secretly listening to the conversation.

304
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,610
Who is this?  (in Chinese)

305
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,070
You're that girl from earlier.

306
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,920
Where is she?

307
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,750
I'll go towards the garden in the back.

308
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,780
When you find Yeo Ji, you must flee first.

309
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,380
This is Do Ji Gwang's headquarters. You two won't be able to handle it.

310
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,480
Yes. You should be careful too, Your Highness.

311
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,850
I thought it was weird.

312
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:11,530
There is no way I wouldn't know a gisaeng here. Right?

313
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,540
Tell me. Who are you?

314
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,870
Who sent you?

315
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,080
Yeo Ji!

316
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,250
- Are you okay?
 - My Lord.

317
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,460
Kill them. Kill them all!

318
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,440
Yeo Ji?

319
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,710
What are you doing?

320
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,730
You are... from earlier...

321
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,850
Yeo Ji, no!

322
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,140
Who are you? Tell me!

323
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,190
Let go! I said let go!

324
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,300
Who are you?

325
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,640

326
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,470
"Master-killer"?

327
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,500
You will kill your master? What does that mean...

328
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,360
Just kill me.

329
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,460
You're a girl?

330
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,130
Hey! Are you okay?

331
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,920
Hey!

332
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,510
Is anyone there?

333
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,810
Is no one here?

334
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,800
Hey!

335
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,160
Hey there. Come to your senses.

336
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,030
This...

337
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,850
What is this, Your Highness?

338
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,210
It's dangerous, Yeo Ji.

339
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,760
This is...

340
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:12,410

341
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,120

342
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,600
♫  You whom I love  ♫

343
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,720
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

344
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,540
 Master-killer?  Did you just say the master-killer band?

345
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,000
 You saw the culprit!

346
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,520
 If you are not the culprit, that is!

347
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,260
 We must locate her first.

348
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,990
 If we cannot try his crime just because he's the crown prince, then we ought to discard these inspectors' robes!

349
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,450
 You want the crown prince?

350
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,720
 My family member has died, so how violently I will act...

351
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,020
 If you want to set a new game, shouldn't you trust me?

352
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,630
 Your Highness will become the culprit.

353
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,890
 Your Highness, this time, it's your turn to trust us.

354
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,130
 There are only three days. Your Highness must prove your own innocence

355
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,320
 and reveal the truth about this case.

356
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,690
♫  So I would have to remember you even in my dreams  ♫
