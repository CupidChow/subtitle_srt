1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:00,500
Through whom and where did you use it?

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,980
I don't care whether I die by poison or sword.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,280
Do you think I'm scared?

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,380
What?

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,140
Hey you, listen carefully.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,970

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,180
It's not because I'm scared of the sword.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm telling you because I'm so excited, okay?

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,560
What? It's poison without an antidote?

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,550
Yes, Your Highness.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,480
Do Ji Gwang said that if Prince Milpoong used the poison, there won't be any antidote.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,660
 The crown prince, that jerk, found out that I went to the King's Physician's Office.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,170
Tan.

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,990
Right?

15
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,380
So he forbade medicine, right?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,500
How do you know that?

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,780
I... I told the crown prince to do that.

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,450
What?

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,370
I couldn't give my throne to the crown prince even if it meant my death.

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,160
His Majesty who screwed me over needed to be punished too.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,500
 What do I do about this? I can't be the only one who suffers.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,420
 Gosh, what do I do? Then!

23
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,530
 I should use poison.

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,730
So I purposely left my trace at the King's Physician's Office,

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,970
so that everyone could notice that I'd been there.

26
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,280
Why, you ask?

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,500
Because it's obvious that the crown prince would throw a fit if I did that.

28
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,530
He would suspect me and stop the King's Physician's Office and forbid the medicine.

29
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,130
Then the crown prince will become the one who kills His Majesty.

30
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,470
I... knew about all of this.

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,320
Stop your bullshit.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,300
The one who used poison is you.

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,280
You cannot place the guilt on the crown prince.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,390
What about evidence?

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,810
Do you have any?

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,030
Should I return the favor as I have received it?

37
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,260
The evidence that you guys love so much...

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,370
The evidence that I used poison...

39
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,610
where is it?

40
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,450
How dare!

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,060
His Majesty will die soon.

42
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,780
With that poison, he might already be dead.

43
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,500
Then the crown prince will become the person who sinned against heaven, killing His Majesty by forbidding medicine.

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,610
Would a person like that safely become a king?

45
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,350
No way.

46
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,790
The throne I cannot have, Lee Geum cannot have it either.

47
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,680
Your Majesty!

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,270
Your Majesty!

49
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,660
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

50
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,400
No...

51
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,440
No!

52
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,570
You're the same as the crown prince.

53
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:14,420
I... knew you wouldn't be able to either.

54
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,510
What about the prescription?

55
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,730
Were you able to prescribe medicine for His Majesty?

56
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,640
I apologize, Your Highness.

57
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,760
There is nothing more that we can do as human beings.

58
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,090
There is nothing we can do?

59
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,140
The King's Physician's Office said the same.

60
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,110
That there is nothing more they can do.

61
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,490
Are you saying that all these medical documents have no use?

62
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,710
How could we, with all of these doctors and medicine, not save His Majesty?

63
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,520
Your Highness, we are not out of methods yet.

64
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,680
There is a last method that we could try that, as far as I know, is dangerous but possible.

65
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,340
Dangerous but possible? What is it?

66
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,890
Inspector General! Tell me immediately.

67
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,470
What? What medicine are they trying to use? Chinese aconite?

68
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,080
Chinese aconite? Chinese aconite and ginseng?

69
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,240

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,300
Yes, Your Highness.

71
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,660
However, Chinese aconite is a poisonous medicine that is used for death penalty drink, isn't it?

72
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,250
It is.

73
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,070
However because of that strong toxicity,

74
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,600
the poison inside of the body could be removed.

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,580
There was definitely a case where a hopeless paraplegic patient

76
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,580
had Chinese aconite as a last resort to save his life.

77
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,790
And by using ginseng with Chinese aconite, you want to counter the poison.

78
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,230
That is right, Your Highness.

79
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,740
However, Chinese aconite's toxicity is already too strong on its own.

80
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,650
On top of that, the medicine that His Majesty has been drinking in the meantime

81
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,370
has black false hellebore, which is incompatible with ginseng.

82
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,380
Then are you saying we shouldn't do anything?

83
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,060
Who here can prescribe something

84
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,450
other than Chinese aconite and ginseng?

85
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,860
Serve him the medicine as we have discussed immediately.

86
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,420
Your Highness, if we use Chinese aconite and it becomes harmful,

87
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,540
- then Your Highness will face trouble, too!
 - Don't you hear me?!

88
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,960
There is no time for delay. Order the prescription now!

89
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,370
Make the medicine as prescribed here.

90
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,430
What?

91
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,950
Ginseng and Chinese aconite?

92
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,140
Yes.

93
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,060
It's the last prescription that His Highness allowed.

94
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,590
Isn't this medicine that the medical community has shunned for a long time?

95
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,810
If this... goes wrong like this...

96
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,120
Everything is my responsibility, Your Highness.

97
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,350
If it goes wrong, I will take responsibility for the outcome.

98
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,780
No. You are wrong, Teacher.

99
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,780
The responsibility can be taken only by one who is suited for it.

100
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,250
It's what His Majesty told me.

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,060
I am the one who made this decision.

102
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,400
As His Majesty has done, I won't avoid my responsibility either.

103
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,790
I heard that His Majesty is deathly ill.

104
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,200
If His Majesty dies like this, what should we do?

105
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,100
This is how people's lives are.

106
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,460
You can never tell what will happen.

107
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,460
Did you look into it? How is it in the king's palace?

108
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,510
Is it this or that?

109
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,660
I'm a Saheonbu inspector. I need to enter the palace quickly.

110
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,120
Yes, go on in.

111
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,110
Inspector Park.

112
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,510
My Lord.

113
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,660
Are you coming back from Prince Milpoong's house of exile?

114
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,790
There is an urgent matter.

115
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,840
I have to tell the crown prince about what is going on behind the scenes immediately.

116
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,650
Just what is going on that you're like this?

117
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,850
Wi Byeong Joo didn't seem to know anything.

118
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,030
This is a trap.

119
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,720
This is a trap that Prince Milpoong laid to tie the crown prince and His Majesty.

120
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,980
You weren't followed, right?

121
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,210
That's absurd.

122
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,280
It's the half that I promised. It's half of Prince Milpoong's wealth.

123
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,290
You know that this is nothing compared to what I have done for you, right?

124
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,640
What I have planned will be carried out without any problems, right?

125
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,280
The crown prince is struggling to save him, but it won't matter,

126
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,250
because no medicine can ever counteract that poison.

127
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,350
I can finally take a breather now.

128
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,560
I want to drink tea, but do you have any teacups?

129
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,140
Tea?

130
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,510
It's refreshing chrysanthemum tea.

131
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,470
How about it? Will you drink some, too?

132
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,610
Moon Soo!

133
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,190
Your Highness.

134
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,580
What did you say just now? What do you mean that this is all

135
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,840
a scheme targeting not only His Majesty but also me?

136
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,730
He knew how you would react when you discovered that poison was used.

137
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,470
- Prince Milpoong was going for this.
 - What?

138
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,160
Your Highness, even now you have to stop everything.

139
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,080
I apologize, but there is no way to save His Majesty.

140
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,480
Even if it's just you, you at least have to come out of this pit.

141
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,520
No, I can't.

142
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,750
Even if what Prince Milpoong said is true,

143
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,410
I have to do everything I can.

144
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,380
And what if even you get hurt in doing so?

145
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,910
Your Highness, I also don't want to be telling you this.

146
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,400
I don't want to tell you to become cowardly, but!

147
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,130
I also have to do everything

148
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,440
to protect you.

149
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,750
Moon Soo.

150
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,250
Your Highness! Your Highness the crown prince!

151
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,350
You have to go quickly, immediately.

152
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,450
Your Highness. Your Highness the Queen Dowager.

153
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,740
What about His Majesty? How is he?

154
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,430
Your Majesty, have you regained your senses?

155
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,560
Can you see me?

156
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,000
Can you hear me, Your Majesty?

157
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,340
Crown Prince.

158
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,570
Da-Dal Moon.

159
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,700
This must be the house of the King's Physician's Office's head nurse.

160
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,410
Yes.

161
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,490
As expected, you haven't given up anything.

162
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,120
You only pretended to have.

163
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,430
S-Stop. It's too late. You cannot stop me!

164
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,510
Was this what Prince Milpoong commanded?

165
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,960
To use poison to kill the king?

166
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,200
What good is that?

167
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,670
It's already over for Prince Milpoong!

168
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,460
With whose permission is it over?!

169
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,700
I haven't ended anything yet!

170
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,940
Yoon Bok Dan!

171
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,120
Come here! Is anyone outside? Is anyone there?

172
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,940
Tell Doctor Choi Seong Jo and Lee Gwang Jwa to come

173
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,510
so that they can feel His Majesty's pulse. Quickly!

174
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,460
Yes, Your Highness.

175
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,610
Your Majesty, please brace yourself.

176
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,120
You have to endure no matter what.

177
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,340
I will save you.

178
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,780
The ones who face their ends are the king and the crown prince.

179
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,650
The king will die.

180
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,900
The crown prince will be charged with that crime.

181
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,010
I've made it so that

182
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,440
they can't discover anything.

183
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,080
What?

184
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,370
What do you mean by that?

185
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,650
No way.

186
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,380
Yoon Bok Dan.

187
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,450
How could you...

188
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,270
Hey there, come to your senses.

189
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,580
Hey there!

190
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,020
Crown Prince.

191
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,780
Now...

192
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,610
stop trying your best.

193
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,690
It will be...

194
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,970
too difficult for me.

195
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,740
No, Your Majesty.

196
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,340
It is not so. You have opened your eyes.

197
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,840
You can recover.

198
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,820
Forgive me, Crown Prince.

199
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:34,670
Me, who took this position away from you.

200
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,490
Actually...

201
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,450
the throne that was yours...

202
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,010
Me... for taking it instead.

203
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,710
Your Majesty, please.

204
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,810
Do not say such words.

205
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,370
Right now, don't say anything.

206
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,430
And...

207
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,210
Geum...

208
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,460
Please, at least you...

209
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,850
for all of the people of this nation...

210
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,430
become a good king.

211
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,960
One I could not become.

212
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,880
One... I dreamt of.

213
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,410
That kind of a king.

214
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,970
No.

215
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,670
Your Majesty! Older Brother!

216
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,890
No. You can't.

217
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,680
You have to open your eyes. Please.

218
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,610
Your Majesty!

219
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,420
Your Majesty!

220
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,870
Your Highness, Your Highness, Your Highness!

221
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,810
You cannot cut your finger! It's dangerous for you as well!

222
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,360
Stand back. Let go of me!

223
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,950
Your Highness.

224
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,040
Your Majesty, please.

225
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,780
- You cannot pass away.
 - Please...

226
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,390
Stop, Your Highness.

227
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,460
Older Brother!

228
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,260
Older Brother.

229
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,360
Older Brother!

230
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,600
Older Brother.

231
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,530
Older Brother!

232
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,510
- Queen Dowager.
 - His Majesty is now—

233
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,330
 Your Majesty!

234
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,550
 No, Your Majesty!

235
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,700
No, this cannot be.

236
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,810
Your Highness!

237
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,530
Your Majesty!

238
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,100
Your Majesty!

239
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,940
Your Majesty!

240
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,290
Your Majesty!

241
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,130
Your Majesty!

242
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,770
Your Majesty!

243
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,380
Your Majesty!

244
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,390
Your Majesty.

245
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,230
Your Majesty.

246
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,420
Your Majesty.

247
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,440
Your Majesty.

248
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,470
Your Majesty!

249
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,420
Your Majesty!

250
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,420
Your Majesty!

251
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,000
Your Majesty!

252
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,020
Your Highness.

253
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,240
Your Majesty.

254
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,400
Your Majesty.

255
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,900
Your Majesty.

256
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,210
Your Majesty.

257
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,470
Your Majesty.

258
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,500
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

259
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,520
Your Majesty!

260
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,100
Your Majesty!

261
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,430
Your Majesty!

262
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,700
Your Majesty!

263
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,810
Everyone face His Majesty and mourn.

264
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,070
Bow down.

265
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,030
Bow again.

266
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,450
Has everyone gathered their will?

267
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,510
Yes.

268
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,560
Right now, the Soron court officials have?

269
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,330
Yes. It seems that they will come to the Queen Dowager's Palace soon.

270
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,050
My Lord, have you heard?

271
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,960
The Right State Councilor and a few other Soron court officials

272
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,390
are headed to the Queen Dowager's Palace!

273
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,920
The Queen Dowager's Palace? Why?!

274
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,800
Just what do you mean by that, Right State Councilor?!

275
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,100
I cannot ever allow it.

276
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,860
The preceding king has passed due to the crown prince's stubbornness and greed!

277
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,130
Stubbornness and greed?

278
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,130
The crown prince even cut his own finger

279
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,500
and tried to save His Majesty until the end!

280
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,860
No! If we had prescribed and given the medicine correctly,

281
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,110
we would not have had today's tragedy.

282
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,510
Your Highness!

283
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,170
Your Highness, the crown prince is here.

284
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,010
It's you, Crown Prince.

285
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,060
The reason why His Majesty passed

286
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,620
is all because of you.

287
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:03,830
You, who have done this,

288
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:09,120
do not have the right to become this nation's king.

289
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:35,770

290
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,200

291
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,060
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫

292
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:50,060
♫  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  ♫

293
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,130
♫  Now the gentle and gentler wind hurts too  ♫

294
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,400
 The remaining time until a new king ascends the throne after the predecessor king's death...

295
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,700
 Six days are remaining.

296
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,850
 Until then, the throne will be unoccupied.

297
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,220
 This is the last time to address you as Your Highness.

298
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,790
 Please become a sage king, Your Highness.

299
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,980
 I have no thought of accepting your deal.

300
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,160
 Being able to sacrifice even innocent ones,

301
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,410
 that's another aspect of the king's position.

302
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,450
 Please allow you to hold the coronation ceremony as soon as possible?

303
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,220
 In the event a regrettable but inevitable incident breaks out in the palace,

304
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,060
 how much military manpower can be mobilized to stop the crown prince's enthronement?

305
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,370
 Whether to avoid this pain as a human being...

306
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,540
 or gladly become the king and fight against all these humiliations.
