1
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,220

2
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,950
Everything is here.

3
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,230
All the preparation to behead that bastard, Crown Prince Lee Geum.

4
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,190
- Your Highness!
 - It's information exposing a treasonous plot in order to enthrone the crown prince.

5
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,350
Evidence?

6
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,290
As you can see, it's all in there.

7
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,880
Your Highness!  With this, you can immediately blow—

8
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,400
No.

9
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,730
Not today.

10
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,120
Maybe around tomorrow?

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,450
At least through tonight, the crown prince should stay before the king's quarters.

12
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,320
This thing called seokgodaejwoe  (prostrating oneself on a straw mat and awaiting the king's disposition) ,

13
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,280
I hear undergoing it just for an hour will bring pain that seems to break down your whole being

14
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,920
to the point that you would rather cut off your own limbs.

15
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,340
Lee Geum will have to experience true blood-boiling pain

16
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,320
for that bastard to also realize the final truth.

17
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,270
King?

18
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,780
Not in a million years.

19
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,280
He should know he's nothing but a lowly critter.

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,960
 Older Brother.

21
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,500
 Older Brother.

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Hwon.

23
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,010

24
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,610
Hwon.

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,660
 It's you again, Older Brother.

26
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,850
 And you fell again?

27
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,130
 Because you help me up every time, I fell knowingly.

28
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,190
 Next time, I'll help you up.

29
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,490
 When will that time come?

30
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,620
 You can't even hold the sword properly.

31
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,840
 Is that right?

32
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,280
 No. This hand like so.

33
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,320
 And this hand like this, punk.

34
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,840
Hwon?

35
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,570
Endure this, Older Brother.

36
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,580
By the hands of the cowards,

37
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,420
you must not collapse.

38
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,180
You have to endure this, Hyung-nim.

39
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,450
You have to get chased out by me in a humiliating way.

40
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,990
But what am I going to do if, before that, you go and die on me?

41
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,190
Why don't you worry about yourself first?

42
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,200
So that you won't feel disappointed,

43
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,260
I will for sure

44
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,010
do you the favor of killing you.

45
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,090
 Here comes His Majesty!

46
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,590
Your Majesty.

47
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,820
Still, I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt.

48
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:41,650
That you might not be my political enemy but be my younger brother.

49
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,090

50
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,660
However, you tried to point a sword at me!

51
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,680
In the end, coveting the throne, you planned treason!

52
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,240

53
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,200
Today, a treasonous plot involving

54
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,520
scholars Kim Seon Hyeong, Lee Gi Jin, and twelve others

55
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,740
has been uncovered.

56
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,490
Since the above-mentioned ones attempted to assassinate the king and usurp the throne,

57
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,920
I, the king, command the installment of a special prosecuting unit,

58
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,730
the State Tribunal, in order to expose every detail of this heinous crime.

59
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,310
State Tribunal?

60
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,600
You... Just what the heck are you doing?

61
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,210
Prime Minister Kim Chang Joong's grandson and Minister of the Interior Lee Yi Gyeom's eldest son

62
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,630
recruited rebels and plotted treason to assassinate the king.

63
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,050
Who do you think these people were trying to put on the throne?

64
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,130
- Wi Byeong Joo—
 - No, that's wrong.

65
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,290
You should call me Lord Deputy Inspector General, Park Moon Soo.

66
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,120
You'd better start calling me that again.

67
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,860
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

68
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,930
It feels like you are concerned about me.

69
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,740
But don't worry about me.

70
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,350
How far I can go...

71
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,200
I'll definitely...

72
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,770
prove.

73
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,850

74
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,050

75
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,410

76
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,360
Before Sookjeong Gate, a state tribunal is being set up right now.

77
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,090
To appoint the special judge and special prosecutors to preside over the tribunal,

78
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,490
shouldn't they get Noron's consent?

79
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,740
Right State Councillor!

80
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,050
Don't we have something to say to each other?

81
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,270
We ought to discuss it.

82
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,470
What do you want?

83
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,570
A state tribunal for the treason case?

84
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,860
- Is it your will or His Majesty's will?
 - What do you mean will?

85
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,780
What's the reason your side is suddenly striking down the crown prince?

86
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,420
It's a clear case of treason with a tip-off and evidence.

87
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,070
Are you saying there's another intention or controller?

88
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,780
Of course, you are not the type.

89
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,770
I am more curious about you.

90
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,580
What is the reason you've stayed away from all this since the time of the regency petition?

91
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,020
This is about the crown prince you guard against to the utmost degree.  So why?

92
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,670
You just stuff yourself with anything and you'll get a stomachache.

93
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,120
No matter how much I want to drag down the crown prince,

94
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,550
steering the national affairs this way is not my preferred mode of operation.

95
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,230
Can that mean perhaps—

96
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,170
You, who guard against the crown prince, might not want to concede this.

97
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,120
From somewhere...

98
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,180
you must smell something fishy.

99
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,030
- Left State Councilor! 
- Ha Gok  (Jo Tae Goo's pen name) !

100
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,050
Give it some careful thought.

101
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,510
 Since the state tribunal has been set up, you must need special prosecutors to lead the hearing!

102
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,500
No conclusion from in there yet?

103
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,710
Cries breaking out and what a total mess.

104
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,700
How long has it been since the tables were turned because of the new personnel policy,

105
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,050
and today it's about the crown prince's treason?!

106
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,050
Who do they want me to side with?

107
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,720
Should I go find myself a good fortuneteller?

108
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,810
 I am not going to repeat myself!

109
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,350
I am telling you to recommend me.

110
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,450
I am asking you to put me in there instead of you, Inspector General.

111
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,590
So why you?  What qualifications do you have?

112
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,630
Because this treason is a case I brought.

113
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,180
But you are under suspicion of corruption...

114
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,350
If not, will you do it personally?

115
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,650
What are you going to do if you lose to the crown prince?

116
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,120
Do you even have the guts to open your mouth in the state tribunal?

117
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,550
Look here, Deputy Inspector General Wi!

118
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,300
How dare you talk to the lord...

119
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,740
If not,

120
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,090
will you do it?

121
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,980
Risking your own life?

122
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,050
In the end, nobody will come forward anyway.

123
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,000
I, the scapegoat, should be taking on these duties,

124
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,220
because I am a Namin who's not even a Noron.

125
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,290
Recommend me as a special prosecutor, Lord.

126
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,510
I will catch the crown prince and find my own way to survive.

127
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,390
Ah Bong and Jang Dal, it's not the time for us to be doing this.  We have to see His Highness this moment.

128
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,490
Just a moment, Lord.

129
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,950
Before that, you should take a look at this.

130
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,250
We found it from Wi Byeong Joo's past case files.

131
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,110
These are the original findings regarding the accidental death of the late Inspector Han Jeong Seok.

132
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,030
That is right.

133
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,340
The one we saw a while ago was a tampered one.

134
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,630

135
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,350
Tampered?

136
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,700
Here, do you see the report on the corpse examination?

137
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,670
There is an opinion stating a blunt force injury may be seen on the back of the head.

138
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,690
That means a wound from being hit by something.

139
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,300
This is the original file?

140
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,350
- Yes.
 - Yes.

141
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,570
Wi Byeong Joo...

142
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,870
In the end, this was why?

143
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,940
 There is nothing suspicious about Inspector Han's death.

144
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,430
 How can the likes of you act up at a time like this?

145
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,350
The reason he tried

146
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,100
to cover up Hyung-nim Jeong Seok's death

147
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,810
before anyone else!

148
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,730
Lord, that he falsified it this way

149
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,840
means there's a secret regarding Hyung-nim Jeong Seok's death that must be concealed.

150
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,980
And the bastard knew about it.

151
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,490
Can it possibly mean

152
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,190
Deputy Inspector General Wi to my lord Inspector Han?

153
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,440
Wi Byeong Joo!

154
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,120
You tampered with Hyung-nim Jeong Seok's case.

155
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,620
And this time to my other Hyung-nim with a charge of treason...

156
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,830
You dare to attack the crown prince?!

157
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:43,230
Ah Bong, let's catch and kill that bastard.

158
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,080
Let's go, Lord Moon Soo.

159
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,500
We can't just let him ruin His Highness as well.

160
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,540

161
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,850

162
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,720
I am Deputy Inspector General of Saheonbu, Wi Byeong Joo,

163
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,390
here as a special prosecutor to question the criminals.

164
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,220
Why is the interrogation room empty?

165
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,560
Where is the crown prince?

166
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,010
Your Highness!

167
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,830
Please escort him inside.

168
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,940
- Hurry.
 - Yes.

169
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,160
 What on earth are you saying?

170
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,970
The crown prince returned to his quarters?

171
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,720
I made that decision as the Assistant Officer of the Uigeumbu    .

172
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,260
He was not in a condition to undergo an interrogation.

173
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,710
Assistant Officer, does that make any sense?

174
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,820
The crown prince is in very poor condition due to the seokgodaejwae  (prostrating on a straw mat and awaiting the king's disposition) .

175
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,490
Even if just to show some courtesy to the crown prince, it was necessary.

176
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,360
What do you mean courtesy?

177
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,520
The crown prince is charged with treason.

178
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,150
Yes!

179
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,500
Literally, it is just a charge, yet unproven.

180
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,520
Don't be so unreasonable.

181
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,360
Then, what is this tip-off?

182
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,370
Tip-off, this thing that you claim to have found?

183
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,560
But where in this

184
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,240
does it say that the traitors colluded with the crown prince?

185
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,920
I read it several times, but I could not find it.

186
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,360
Not only the suspects but also the crown prince is denying any involvement in this matter.

187
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,070
Here is

188
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,960
only testimony about an attempt to poison the king,

189
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,630
but not a testimony that the crown prince joined them.

190
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,070
This kingdom's future depends on this.

191
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,240
We must take the utmost care.

192
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,820
Your Highness.

193
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,130
Moving around in your condition is overdoing it.

194
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,320
Then, do you want me to just sit around waiting for my death?

195
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,100
Your Highness.

196
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:47,400
I can't let things work out the way Prince Milpoong planned it when he is Hwon's killer.

197
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,910
This fight that he picked with me...

198
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,250
I am going to win it no matter what, Ja Dong.

199
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,350
I think that crown prince bastard is going to throw the last fits.

200
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,560
A few of the Sorons seem to side with him...

201
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,830
Just a minute.  That person is here.

202
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,560
Dal Moon.

203
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,310
Yoon Yeong, you assured me that you could bring him to me.

204
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,000
But you really got it done.

205
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,330
Go on.  You said you needed him.

206
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,060
Yoon Yeong is very capable.

207
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,960
After all, with that face and tongue of hers, she even bewitched me.

208
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,740
A beggar like you would be a piece of cake.

209
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,080
What do you say?

210
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,400
Seeing the crown prince in that mix-up, your mind changed, too, right?

211
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,900
You looked rather anxious.

212
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,560
How about you tell me what you want quickly?

213
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,150
The beggar that you are, you'll act stiff toward me even if you can die at this moment?

214
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,670
Oh, so you want ass-kissing

215
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,990
rather than ability from me?

216
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,060
I like that.

217
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,420
You're better than that hungry ghost-like bastard who sings about money every time he opens his mouth.

218
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,910
You came just in time when I needed you the most.

219
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,270
I've got to see those exceptional skills of yours now.

220
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,110
What are you trying to do?

221
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,810
We have to turn the capital upside down, right away,

222
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,770
and set up a new game board as I want.

223
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,290
What did you talk about with Prince Milpoong?

224
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,750
About what I do well.

225
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,900
That's what he wanted.

226
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,030
Can you... do it?

227
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:40,250
Ridiculously, I had to save you...

228
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,120
Even though you abandoned me.

229
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,410
Don't worry.

230
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:56,030
I will get it done even better than what Prince Milpoong wants.

231
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,690
You are here.

232
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,640
Here.

233
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,700
We have no time to lose.  Spread them as they are, all over the capital, right now.

234
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,090
Head Merchant!  Do you mean this?

235
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,570
Really spread this?!

236
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,030
Market places and ferry docks are a given.

237
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,730
Distribute these tabloid sheets in every corner of the capital.

238
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,210
- Hyung-nim!
 - Don't question me about anything!

239
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,780
Do as I tell you.

240
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,490
I will take all the responsibility.

241
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,320
There was an inspector who was on duty at the time of Hyung-nim Jeong Seok's accident.

242
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,680
I have to see him.

243
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,550
Then, I will go see the coroner at the morgue.

244
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,000
Wait a second.

245
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,020
But why are the people here...

246
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,900
What on earth does it mean?

247
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,360
The crown prince is not the predecessor king's son?

248
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,850
Why not?  There have been talks about it though.

249
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,190
The crown prince is, in reality, a seed that the water maid Choi got from another man,

250
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,920
that he is not from the king's bloodline.

251
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,460
What?

252
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,080
Lord!

253
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,960
Get out of the way!  Get out of the way!

254
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,020

255
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,000

256
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,320
Water Maid Choi already had another man's seed in her womb.

257
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,970
She converted that into a prince.

258
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,120
What brotherly affection could that kind of crown prince have had toward His Majesty?

259
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,890
When they are not even of the same bloodline,

260
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,500
how big of a deal could it have been to him to snatch away the throne?

261
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,370
What the heck do you think you are doing?

262
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,380
- Are you crazy?
 - Assistant Investigator.

263
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,060
His Highness not being the predecessor king's son!

264
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,930
What kind of dog noises are you barking?

265
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,830
I couldn't help it myself.  Really.

266
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,250
Why are you doing this?  We were on the same side.

267
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,790
And how can you backstab the crown prince at a time like this?

268
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,620
I'm not doing this because I want to, either!

269
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,250
I don't know what Hyung-nim Dal Moon is thinking myself.

270
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,380
What?

271
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,150
Dal Moon!

272
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,700
- Hyung-nim! 
- Don't butt in!

273
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,960
Tell me.  You must have a reason.

274
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,460
When you f__k up like this, there must be a reason.

275
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,470
I'm simply transferring to another line because the one I grabbed turned out rotten.

276
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,570
What other reason can there be?

277
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,460
What?

278
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,070
A rotten line?

279
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,130
How can a human being act like this?

280
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,720
When His Highness trusted you so much...

281
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,910
Aish... how naive.

282
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:09,000
Lord, to begin with, there is nothing that a human being can not do.  Okay?

283
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,630
Even this kind of rage is wasted on a bastard like you.

284
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,610
Still, since we used to be comrades,

285
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,520
I cannot bring myself to beat you.

286
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,900
Okay, leave.  Get lost.

287
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,540
That strong line,

288
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,640
hold on to it tight.

289
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,970
Well, you say we were once comrades.

290
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,050
Can I offer you a piece of advice as well?

291
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:15,620
If you are so worried, go to the crown prince and find a way to get out of this alive, huh?

292
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,610
Well, I guess you should just read the tabloid sheets posted all over the capital.

293
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,550
I don't see you coming up with a better solution.

294
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,450

295
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,810
Lord!

296
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,550
Lord, how did it go?

297
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,800
Did Head Merchant Dal Moon really betray us?

298
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,440
- How's the situation in the capital?
 - Don't even make me start.

299
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,680
Here and there, everywhere is plastered with these scandalous bulletins.

300
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:09,380
Let's go.  All His Highness has left now is us.

301
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,610

302
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,600
I confirmed through our spy.

303
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,860
An inspector, the crown prince's lackey, came and raised hell, it seems.

304
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,020
That son of a bitch called Park Moon Soo?

305
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,040
Wow, Dal Moon is the master ropewalker.

306
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,900
That as*hole turns out to be not a man but a traitor son of a bitch.

307
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,380
The bottom-feeding thugs that use their fists are all like that anyway.

308
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,460
They are nothing but animals in human clothing.

309
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,760
That fist you are speaking of, I use it too.

310
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,980
When even the popular opinion is in a whirlwind,

311
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,600
can the crown prince still hang on?

312
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,580
When even the pro called "popular opinion" is leaning in favor of the king now...
