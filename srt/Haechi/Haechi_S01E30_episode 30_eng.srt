1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,080

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,150
Hyung-nim Jeong Seok...

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,690
Won't you stop, this very moment!

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,980
Park Moon Soo, you had to ruin my future!

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,000
Come to your senses.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,290
Who's ruining whom?

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,520
You ruined your own future.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,200
Your choice and your crime did.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,870
Park Moon Soo!

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,590
You think this will make any difference?!

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,510
You're inspectors and you don't know Saheonbu?

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,590
Saheonbu never digs its own grave.

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,430
Well, it seems to be half-bent on digging one this time.

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,850
I am sorry, but we have to take you in our custody.

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,000
Head Inspector!

16
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,420
Then, I will place Saheonbu Deputy Inspector General Wi Byeong Joo

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,190
under arrest for the murder of his colleague Inspector Han Jeong Seok.

18
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,900
What are you waiting for?  Tie up the criminal now.

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,870
Yes!

20
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,280
Unhand me!  You think you'll be okay after doing this to me?!  Let go of me!

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,840
Park Moon Soo!

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,550
Let go of me!

23
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,120
Move over.  There isn't enough space.

24
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,930
You're going to stand here now?

25
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:16,770
Wow, your skill of grabbing onto the last life-saving rope is amazing, just amazing.

26
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,310
Let me see what's going on.

27
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,950
Isn't that a Saheonbu official?

28
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,810
Saheonbu arrested its own official?

29
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,510
What's going on?  What crime has he committed?

30
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,730
The deputy inspector general of Saheonbu turns out to be

31
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,850
a psychopath killer who murdered his own colleague.

32
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,570
Saheonbu deputy inspector general committing a murder?

33
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,020
But isn't that guy the one who dragged away the crown prince the last time?

34
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,260
Hey, why don't you hold up your head?

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,920
We didn't hang our heads like you.  Here.

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,600
You're familiar with this road, right?

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,220
It's the same road where innocent Crown Prince and Lord Moon Soo

38
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,090
suffered humiliation because of you.

39
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,610
How could a Saheonbu official?

40
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,840
What a rascal!

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,180
How could he do that?

42
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,130
 They say the crown prince is involved with the master-killer band.

43
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,660
 Still, how can they arrest the crown prince?

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,900
 Crown Prince!

45
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,470
 Your Highness!

46
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,670
 Let go of me.

47
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,780
 My Lord!

48
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,990
A Saheonbu official doing such a thing!

49
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,610
Worse than an animal!

50
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,310
You nasty thing!

51
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,650
Son of a bitch!

52
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,860
Just drink this feces water!

53
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,520
Aigoo, it got on me!

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,310
You deserve to die!

55
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,270
Disgusting!

56
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,290
Is His Majesty still in his room?

57
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,050
Yes.

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,930
He should be devising a plan just about now.

59
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,200
What is he going to do?

60
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,470
Why don't you give him some space for now?

61
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,180
Maybe he knows that he should be looking back on his actions

62
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,690
rather than devising a plan right now.

63
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,020
 Answer me!

64
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,820
 I am asking whether you think I am persecuting my brother as a political enemy when he's innocent?

65
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,790
 If you truly want honest counsel stemming from my loyalty,

66
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,670
 Your Majesty, you are definitely persecuting the crown prince.

67
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,020
 Your Majesty, whom I have been serving, you are not a person whose judgment gets clouded easily.

68
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,980
 However, with regency and treason,

69
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,050
 at the tawdry petition and tip-off, as if you had been waiting for them, you...

70
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,880
 Enough!  Enough already!

71
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,220
 Is that what you think, too, Assistant Officer?

72
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,020
 I am extremely sorry, Your Majesty.

73
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:06,220
As if I was waiting for them!  I... I behaved like that?

74
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,900
Your Majesty, I have an urgent message.

75
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,920
What?  The crown prince?

76
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,020
He says he will not leave until you grant him an audience.

78
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,880
Your Highness, it has been more than half an hour.

79
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,770
The weather is still cold.  How about you return to your quarters?

80
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,170
- Your Highness. 
- What did he say?

81
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,570
Please go inside.

82
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,850
His Majesty gave his permission.

83
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,070
Be seated.

84
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,270
Do you want a cup?

85
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,390
There is no wavering

86
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,020
to your hands and your gaze.

87
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,680
When my hands tremble so

88
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
and my glance is unsteady...

89
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,220
That's probably because I am the one in the wrong, right?

90
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,080
Your Majesty.

91
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,690
Lee Gwang Jwa is probably correct.

92
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,800
I cornered you as if I was waiting for the moment.

93
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,180
It was you, Brother.

94
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,940
The one whom Father selected as this nation's king.

95
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,360
It wasn't me or the dead Hwon, but you.

96
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,040
The real owner of the throne who should be in the king's seat.

97
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,900
Father

98
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,750
named me?

99
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,040
So I put you in the crown prince's seat,

100
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,410
but maybe that's why I hoped

101
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,220
that you would fail in the end.

102
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,360
Is this His Majesty's will?

103
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,190
He ordered the soldiers belonging to the Royal Guards to deploy.

104
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,180
Lord Deputy Minister!

105
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,870
Is Prince Milpoong behind this?

106
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,620
Did you know about it?

107
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,190
Not from the beginning.

108
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,520
I didn't want to acknowledge it even after I started to feel suspicious.

109
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,950
I will give you the Royal Guard soldiers.

110
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:14,000
Do away with this sickening politics of revenge.

111
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:21,640
If it's you, you might succeed where I failed.

112
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,320
Your Majesty.

113
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,320
Your Highness.

114
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,610
Do you know about His Majesty deploying the Royal Guards?

115
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,280
Yes.

116
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,870
He ordered me to find

117
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,060
the evidence that will end this all.

118
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,290
Head Merchant.

119
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,230
Have you heard about how that bastard Wi Byeong Joo is finished?

120
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,200
Yes, he was arrested by the Saheonbu.

121
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,780
Hey, why is everything f___ed up, ugh!

122
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,420
Let's bolt.  Pack up all the money

123
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,970
and we're going back to Hamgyeong Province.

124
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,490
Yes.

125
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,710
Move, everyone.

126
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,450
Are they the ones who handed over to Prince Milpoong

127
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,600
the poison that became the evidence of treason?

128
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,100
Hurry up!

129
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,410
Hey, pick up all the coins.

130
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,230
It's you again?

131
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,420
No getting away for the second time.

132
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,890
Because I think I will really lose sleep if I fail to nab you again this time.

133
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,580
Go ahead, you motherf___er.

134
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,340
Strike!

135
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,970
Let's go!

136
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,030
Load it quickly! 
 (in Chinese)

137
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,270
Why are you so slow? 
 (in Chinese)

138
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,200
You! Who are you? 
 (in Chinese)

139
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,020
What the?  Are you alone? 
 (in Chinese)

140
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,900
- You must catch them all!
 - Yes!

141
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,960
You!  You're dead meat!

142
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,520
What are you waiting for?  Slay them. 
 (in Chinese)

143
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,940
Don't lose a single one and catch them all!

144
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,610
Everyone, stop! 
 (in Chinese)

145
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,300
What on earth do you want?

146
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,200
Now you are talking.

147
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,380
Your deal with Prince Milpoong and your testimony.

148
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,160
What are you waiting for? Come here.

149
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,590
Do Ji Gwang!

150
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,440
Bring it on.

151
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,200
You, f___ing ass*ole.

152
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,080
Your Highness!

153
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,640
Hurry and arrest all of these rascals!

154
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,310
Yes!

155
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,340
Are you okay?

156
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,950
You hit the target again in this dark.

157
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,610
Because I shoot a little.

158
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,420
You know you're late again this time?

159
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,770
Now...

160
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,060
We'll have to get Prince Milpoong.

161
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,280
 (Reciting Heart Sutra)

162
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,870
 (Reciting Heart Sutra)

163
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,330
 (Reciting Heart Sutra)

164
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,140
Your Highness!  Your Highness!

165
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,920
Where on earth are you going?

166
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,870
Wi Byeong Joo was taken into custody, and I can't get in touch with Do Ji Gwang or Dal Moon.

167
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,380
I have to know what's going on.

168
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,930
- No, it's dangerous.  You should instead— 
- It was almost a done deal.

169
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,220
I cannot collapse here.

170
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,120
It is all over.

171
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,170
Give up already.

172
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,130
Why are you here only now?  Do you know how much Prince Milpoong waited for you?

173
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,990
Enough, Yoon Bok Dan.

174
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,080
I'm saying Prince Milpoong is finished.

175
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,180
At least you'll have to find a way to get out of this alive.

176
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,320
Y-You can't have...

177
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,950
You?

178
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,790
We have to go now, okay?

179
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,480
Before the soldiers come barging in.

180
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,900
You won't be okay if you stay here.

181
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,070
That's right.  I could not turn my back on

182
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,860
either you or the crown prince.

183
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,540
Did you deceive me?

184
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,510
You did?!

185
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,030
No, I can't end it like this.

186
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,010
If Prince Milpoong gets caught, it's the end for me as well!

187
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,470
Bok Dan, please!

188
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,560
Do you know how I endured it all until today!

189
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,800
The things I did to get here!

190
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,270
Who are you?

191
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,050
What are you to stop me?

192
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,760
Why are you removing the torture devices?

193
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,510
The state tribunal is not over yet.  So why?

194
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,420
There's been a royal command to close the state tribunal.

195
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,810
What?

196
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,580
I guess you are the only one who didn't know

197
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,910
what impasse you are facing.

198
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,550
The crown prince has deployed the Royal Guards to catch you.

199
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,860
You'll get into trouble, staying here like this.

200
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,960
That doesn't make any sense.

201
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,820
Why me?  The treason case was pointing at the crown prince.  So why?

202
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,420
Because there was no proof.

203
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,950
Let's just say that you came up with a good strategy, so unlike yourself.

204
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:07,080
It was just a tiny bit, tiny bit lacking.

205
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,270
My great-grandmother Royal Consort Lady Kang...

206
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,150
Don't you know how she died?

207
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,100
She got killed for the suspicion of poisoning King Injo.

208
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,370

209
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,160
Without any evidence, simply because of that suspicion...

210
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,290
Even Crown Prince Sohyun passed away.

211
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,600
My family, who are the true owners of this kingdom,

212
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,120
all got slaughtered!

213
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,780
- Your Highness.
- So why?!

214
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,650
Why can't it work now?

215
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,690
Why do some die even without any proof,

216
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,800
and why do some survive because of no proof?

217
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,500
By whose will?  Why just that bastard Lee Geum?!

218
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,160
Why?  Why?!

219
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,990
Snap out of it, Your Highness!  Your Highness!

220
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,320
Come to your senses

221
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,730
and just look for a way to save yourself,

222
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,500
if you feel so wronged.

223
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,910
I don't want you to be caught either,

224
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,880
because I don't want to go out of my way to catch you

225
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,890
and end up gifting the crown prince with a pair of wings  (help him out) .

226
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,890
Just preserve yourself.

227
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,150
- How about Prince Milpoong? 
- He's not here.

228
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,270
That wench Chae Yoon Yeong seems to have run away as well.

229
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,370
What...

230
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,460
did I do so wrong?

231
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,570
Who is there?!

232
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,000
Mobilize the soldiers and block off all gates of the capital now!

233
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,460
Leave just the absolute minimum to guard the palace.

234
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,110
Your Highness!  Your Highness the Crown Prince.

235
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,490
Your Highness, I have an urgent report to give you.

236
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,940
This person is a clerk working for the state tribunal, and half an hour ago,

237
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,200
he saw Prince Milpoong inside the palace.

238
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,240
What?

239
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,110
 (Reciting Heart Sutra)

240
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,190
Oh, forget this.

241
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,340
Then, Tan... Prince Milpoong is inside the palace right now?

242
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,140
Why?

243
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,940
Why?

244
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,670
Prince Milpoong is currently within the palace walls?

245
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,360
Every soldier within the palace is looking for him.

246
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,970
However, just in case, it would be better if Your Majesty took a shelter—

247
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,470
Prince Milpoong!

248
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,130
Tan!

249
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:30,930

250
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,700

251
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,590
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫

252
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:45,330
♫  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  ♫

253
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,310
 I knew you'd come find me.

254
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,350
 Even though Prince Milpoong had plenty of time to escape,

255
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,060
 he remained within the palace.  But why?

256
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,290
 There will be a decree sent out stating that the crown prince will have regency.

257
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,250
 I think Saheonbu will become a more interesting place now.

258
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,890
 A certain blood mark appeared.

259
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,900
 How come something like this is in the King's Physician's Office?

260
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,370
 Gather every piece of intelligence.

261
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,530
 What is it, Tan?

262
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,200
 Remember, you're dying because of your older brother.

263
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,150
 For sure! I'll make you pay for your crimes.

264
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,500
 Do it please. I'll look forward to it.
