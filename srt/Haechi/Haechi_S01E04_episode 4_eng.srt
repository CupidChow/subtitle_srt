1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,630
Then the substitute test-taker whom Moon Soo mentioned was Prince Yeoning?

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,620
Yes, and Noh Tae Pyeong was the maternal uncle of the dead Yoon Yeo Ok.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,400
Why I didn't know it?

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,860
I remembered Noh Tae Pyeong's name from the case hearing.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,190
I didn't report it because he wasn't an important person for the case.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,570
But Noh Tae Pyeong disappeared and cannot be found anywhere.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,250
Anyway, Prince Yeoning must be an important clue.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,660
But it's hard to investigate Prince Yeoning with that.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,670
How can we dare to investigate a royal family member without evidence?

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,200
That's why Lord Moon Soo is working on it, My Lord.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,220
What?  Moon Soo?

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,860
If I had known that you were a prince, I wouldn't have gone through a lot for nothing.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,180
If you want to apologize because of yesterday's case, you don't need to.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,500
I won't make an issue out of it.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,470
What are you saying?  Why should I apologize when someone else committed the crime?

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,930
What?

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,640
It seems I must make a special issue out of you, Your Highness.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,470
Until when are you going to follow me?

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,750
Until the truth is revealed and justice flows like a river.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,600
There must be a way for you to live a more useful life.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,220
What do you mean?  I've never had something more worthwhile to do than this.

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,900
Think about it.  If a regular subject had done this, he would've already been dragged off.

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,480
But someone is just fine even though he broke a law.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,600
The world should not be unfair like this, should it?

25
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,310
You don't have any flexibility at all. The world is originally like that.

26
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,670
The world is like that to someone who is in a high rank like you, Your Highness.

27
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,390
But the world in my head is a little different from that.

28
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,150
In the just world, people who commit crimes must get punished accordingly,

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,400
regardless who they are.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,390
You're stupid, inflexible, and even dangerous.

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,820
You're peculiar in many ways so it makes you interesting.

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,000
But I can't agree with you.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,860
You, too, are about to find out that unfairness is the real way of this world.

34
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,440
Your Highness!

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
If you want to follow me, you may.

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,190
Giddy up!

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,410
Hey, look! Your Highness!

38
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,330
Horse! Give me a horse! Hurry!

39
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,340
You should pay me first.

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,380
Here.

41
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,650
Over there!  That could work fine.

42
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,320
A donkey?

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,980
Even if it's this one, give it to me!  Hurry!

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,890
Prince Milpoong told you to kill me?

45
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,280
How could he have known that you are that substitute test-taker?

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,490
He probably ordered that thinking the substitute was just some unknown illegitimate guy.

47
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,440
How about Noh Tae Pyeong?  I heard he disappeared.

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,040
Prince Milpoong also killed him?

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,180
Please, don't try to know everything!  I don't even want to know either.

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,710
Just go far away for a while.

51
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,310
I'll find a ship by today.

52
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,890
You're saying I should hide until everything has calmed down.

53
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,560
I'll tidy up everything here by taking a dead beggar's corpse to him.

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,380
I beg you to please do that.

55
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,720
Just until things quiet down.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,140
Until things quiet down?

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,620
Will things quiet down?

58
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,290
Today, I stop here.

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,230
Go now.

60
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,030
Now, now, go.

61
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,890
Disband.

62
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,640
But suddenly?

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,940
Go on.

64
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,740
Are you done telling your tales today?

65
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,410
Come at the hour of snake (9 - 11 AM) tomorrow.

66
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,230
I'll have a great romance story about a young gisaeng and the newly appointed magistrate.

67
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,340
- If it's about gisaengs, my story is better.
 - What?

68
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,550
Pure love, illicit affair, blind passion.

69
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,320
I've got one for each category.

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,590
What?

71
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,960
Enough of that.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,840
I do have a fun story that's so good it will make your body ache.

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,100
Do you want to hear it?

74
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,030
Did you tell him?

75
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,790
Yes, exactly as you said.  Maybe it was so scary that the storyteller's mouth dropped wide open.

76
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,530
This? Some woman conveyed this to you?

77
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,930
Yes.

78
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,700
It was the first time I've seen that face in the market.

79
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,320
I think it's best to fold on this, right?

80
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,190
If I wag about a story like this...

81
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,760
No. Tell it as it is.

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,340
The whole content. Without skipping anything.

83
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,230
I'll pull you outside of the capital if something happens, so don't worry.

84
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,080
Take this story to all the markets, wells, laundry places,

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,720
and the docks too,

86
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,950
so as many capital residents as possible can wag their tongues about this story.

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,950
Yes. I understand.

88
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,750
A young widow gets pregnant, so how can there not be gossip?

89
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,430
And then this prince kills the woman

90
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,750
and made it look like it was suicide.

91
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,200
But this isn't the end of it.

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,590
Oh my, that pitiful thing.

93
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,090
But she had a kin, a maternal uncle.

94
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,170
And that's the man that placed first on the last state exam.

95
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,800
So he killed him too, and that's why he's not showing up.

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
And that's really Prince Milpoong? They say he kills people and it's true?

97
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,920
And a scum like that is about to be our king. This is the state of our nation.

98
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,200
What do you think? It makes you tremble, right?

99
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,980
Not just the widow but even the maternal uncle got finished off.

100
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,090
Did you hear, Minister of the Interior? There is an uproar in the capital right now.

101
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,570
Tell Prince Milpoong to come. Right away.

102
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,450
Report the whole story in detail to me.

103
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,700
Do not miss a thing.

104
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

105
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,870
And tonight, summon Prince Yeoning into the palace.

106
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,550
What? Not Prince Yeonryeong but Prince Yeoning?

107
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,030
Yes. Prince Yeoning. Geum.

108
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,260
What is up with you? Why are you here?

109
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,400
I was passing by. And for this.

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,800
Even a dog will give its feeder a tail wag before eating, so I should say thanks too.

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,460
I'll put it to good use when I play.

112
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,420
And a thing like this is a prince?

113
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,130
You're the royal family's shame.

114
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,840
What are you talking about? Another prince is hotter nowadays.

115
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,660
You, I mean.

116
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,810
Did you hear the rumor going around the capital?

117
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,220
That's your story, right?

118
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,930
What is he yakking about?

119
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,660
Did you dispose of the corpses well?

120
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,820
You better be careful, Tan.

121
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,270
Should it go awry and a corpse comes out, forget about the throne.

122
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,060
You could end up at the execution ground, you know.

123
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,940
Stop blowing rubbish. What the hell are you?

124
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,370
Everyone's crawling with trepidation around me but what's got you acting like such a brat?

125
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,420
Since I've got nothing to lose.

126
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,790
Also, you... are very laughable.

127
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:50,760
When I become king, I'll pull your limbs apart and kill you first.

128
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,920
My, so scary.

129
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm looking forward to it.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,390
Hey, you bastard!

131
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,420
Wait. Wait.

132
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,540
Coward!

133
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,040
It's spread all over the capital, not only in the marketplaces but also the water wells and laundry places.

134
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,410
It's very similar to the story of Prince Milpoong.

135
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,750
There's more to the story.

136
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,030
It says the disappeared Noh Tae Pyeong is dead.

137
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,100
The source seems to be a storyteller at a market but he's skipped out of the capital already, My Lord.

138
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,800
Do you think Noh Tae Pyeong was murdered too?

139
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,820
If it's the Prince Milpoong we know, he would do that and then some.

140
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,140
If that's the case, we need to find the corpse,

141
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,360
so we can pull Prince Milpoong down.

142
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,290
Father.

143
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,590
Please have some food first.

144
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,530
Let me get that, please, Madam.

145
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,330
You're working them too hard on a day off.

146
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,810
Have some of this first and we can finish the rest tomorrow.

147
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,970
Really? Yes.

148
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,910
No. We need to finish what we need to do today so—

149
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,810
Yeo Ji, you and I have something to do though.

150
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,650
Is Noh Tae Pyeong really dead?

151
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,310
If it's by Prince Milpoong's order,

152
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,230
how did they dispose the corpse?

153
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,950
In the river? In the mountain?

154
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,440
Or did they burn it?

155
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,090
Or did they cut it up into little pieces?

156
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,830
Hey, come on! A kid is listening, so watch your words.

157
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,240
Hey! Water! Water!

158
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,320
Oh no. What do I do?

159
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,070
You should've told me sooner, Joon Jae.

160
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,790
She cherishes these flowers, saying they only come from Hadong.

161
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,130
If they die, I'm dead too. What do I...

162
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,210
Flowers that only come from Hadong?

163
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,900

164
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,590
 She hung herself from this three-flowered maple tree.

165
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,690
 It's a tree that only grows here.

166
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,200
 That day, somehow it seemed eerily redder than usual.

167
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,260
Prince Milpoong, this crazy bastard.

168
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,000
These were his trophies. That was why he treasured them.

169
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,010
This one isn't fully dried yet.

170
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,550
Then could it be...

171
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Shh!

172
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,320
Let's go. There's no time to waste.

173
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,650
- You startled me! 
 - Looking for this?

174
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,680
- You—
 - Shh!

175
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,560
I'm pretty good at mimicking animal noises, aren't I?

176
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,310
Isn't it exactly the same?

177
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,290
What are you doing here?

178
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,420
You told me to follow you if I could.

179
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,290
I'm not one to back down from a challenge, you know.

180
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:30,270
Now then. It looks like I've won this round, so you should give me some answers now.

181
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,880
What were you just trying to do?

182
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,020
And why are you tailing those men?

183
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,020
Why don't you try following me more?

184
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:42,080
Who knows? You might just come across what you've been searching so hard for.

185
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,890
What was that about?

186
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,390
Oh, that guy, really...

187
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,410
Move faster. We need to finish this before day breaks.

188
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,170
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,840
What's up with those guys?

190
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,130
Why would they be shoveling in the middle of the night?

191
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,190
It looks like they're moving the body.

192
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,260
Body?! Whose?

193
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,150
Y-You don't mean... Noh Tae Pyeong?!

194
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,950
Do you mind giving me some space? And lower your voice.

195
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:31,340
I mean, is that really Noh Tae Pyeong?

196
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,120
Are you crazy? Why are you blowing air into my ear?

197
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,370
You wanted me to speak softer!

198
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,470
You're really a weird man. What is it?

199
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,270
What's that over there?

200
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,730
I think someone's coming!

201
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,120
Move out, everyone! Hurry!

202
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,900
Strike! Strike her down!

203
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,710
Yeo ji!

204
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,280
- Are you okay?
 - Lord Moon Soo.

205
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,890
He hit the target in this pitch black night?

206
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,280
Retreat! Retreat now!

207
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,080
You scoundrels! Where do you think you're going!

208
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,290
Stop right there! Stop!

209
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,300
Are you okay?

210
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,130
This is...

211
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,330
Drat, I lost them.

212
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,150
I can't tell where they've run off to since it's nighttime—

213
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,410
- Noh Tae Pyeong?
 - Noh Tae Pyeong.

214
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,550
Ja Dong! Ja Dong!

215
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,220
Your Highness! Why are you so late?

216
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,610
Chief Royal Secretary? Why are you—

217
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,420
You're here.

218
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,010
Noh Tae Pyeong's corpse was discovered.

219
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,910
Hurry and alert Lord Min Jin Heon.

220
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:44,690
I must see now how useful you are, Inspector Wi.

221
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:11,310
Seeing how you've  only just arrived now, you must have been out drinking all night again.

222
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,800
You know where this is, don't you?

223
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,210
I had no idea that you would summon me to Bogyeongdang of all places, Your Majesty.

224
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:27,090
Have I hurt your feelings by summoning you to your mother's old quarters?

225
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,070
I apologize.

226
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,190
You didn't cry.

227
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,490
On the day you were born here in Bogyeongdang, you didn't cry.

228
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,690
Because of that, your mother and the court physician's faces went white with fear,

229
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:48,860
but I thought to myself that it would be best if you just died like that.

230
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,300
It would have been better had you been born a girl.

231
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:00,290
I wondered if a prince born from a low-class mother could ever live up to his name.

232
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:05,890
Who in this world would willingly call you a prince?

233
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,610
What is it that you want me to say?

234
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,670
"I'm sorry for not dying" or—

235
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,020
So are you happy?

236
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,090
I am asking whether you're happy to have ruined yourself just as this father of yours had sneered?

237
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,360
You could have proven me wrong by living differently.

238
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,330
No matter how much lowly blood flows through half of you,

239
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,890
you could have lived a decent life had you wanted to.

240
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,620
So then why are you living like this?

241
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,520
Why is this all that you've let yourself amount to?

242
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,680
I guess it was because I was born too great.

243
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,640
You want to know why I live like this?

244
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,020
Fine. I was born so high and mighty that this is the only way I can live, Your Majesty!

245
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,260
Even if I wanted to try to do something, there's nothing I could ever do,

246
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,630
so I figured I might as well try to become a good-for-nothing.

247
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,450
Indeed. That's how you were, Prince Yeoning.

248
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,120
Extremely quick-witted and exceptionally gifted.

249
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,460
That's what made my heart hurt even more

250
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,700
every time I saw the makings of a king in you.

251
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,720
Why are you being like this?

252
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,920
If it's because of my insolent jest—

253
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,810
I'm dying soon, Prince Yeoning.

254
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,730
Before that happens,

255
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:41,660
won't you reveal to the world the side of you that I know?

256
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:49,040
I am asking whether you can't restrain yourself just a little more

257
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,750
and show the rest of the world that worthy and respectable side of you.

258
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,330
Your Majesty.

259
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,150
 That's what made my heart hurt even more

260
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,930
 every time I saw the makings of a king in you.

261
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:15,600
 I'm dying soon, Prince Yeoning.

262
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,140
Father.

263
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,610
Is that true? You're going to be a lead inspector?

264
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,300
That's right. I'm going to be officially appointed tomorrow.

265
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,620
That's great!

266
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,310
You'll be a huge help!

267
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,570
Of course, I'll strive to be so.

268
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,610
But what's happening with that other matter?

269
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,960
The connection between Prince Milpoong and the deceased Noh Tae Pyeong,

270
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,160
will you be able to prove that it exists?

271
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,700
Your Highness.

272
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,630
Can you do this for us?

273
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,370
If you testify that you were ordered to be a substitute test-taker by Prince Milpoong,

274
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,770
we'll be able to bring him into the Saheonbu for investigation.

275
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,740
And if I can't? What are you going to do if I say I won't do it?

276
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,500
Weren't you chasing after Prince Milpoong

277
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,720
because you already knew about his crime?

278
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,010
A person like that is trying to become our nation's king!

279
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,960
What does that have to do with me?

280
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,340
How naive you are.

281
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,720
What reason do I have to make that known?

282
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,360
I'm the only person whose crimes will increase by doing  so.

283
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,680
But if that's true, then why—

284
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,250
Did I get involved in the first place?

285
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,930
Just for fun? That's it.

286
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,870
I just wanted to give him some trouble. That's all.

287
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,300
How did it go?

288
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,100
Close the gate.

289
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,150
Let's go.

290
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,280
Your Highness! Come out here!

291
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
What kind of behavior is this?

292
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,620
What reason could you have to back out at this point?

293
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,510
There's no use in picking a fight with him.

294
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,590
We'll just handle this ourselves. Let's go.

295
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,780
To think I actually considered you rather manly earlier!

296
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,120
It figures that all of you are on the same side!

297
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,190
Of course, a puppy will side with dogs.

298
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,710
A story so old that cows will yawn and dogs will laugh at it when hearing it!

299
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,910
What kind of person is Han Jeong Seok?

300
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,210
He's indeed an inspector with a strong sense of justice.

301
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,470
Even though he comes from a Noron family, he's at odds with his own kind.

302
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,950
Even so, it's the Saheonbu we're talking about.

303
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,910
When the Saheonbu is already under the Noron Faction's thumb,

304
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,200
what can a single low-ranked inspector accomplish?

305
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,010
There's one more person though.

306
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,570
Who?

307
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,490
This lowly, powerless prince?

308
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,760
You're futilely dreaming quite the idealist's dream.

309
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,590
That's why I want you to end it as just a dream.

310
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,010
I hope you won't hold such a futile dream in your heart.

311
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,740
What do you mean you're firing me from the lead inspector position?

312
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,140
Why is it that Wi Byeong Joo is taking my place?

313
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,020
Inspector General!

314
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,890
Come in. You should leave now.

315
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,270
Inspector General...

316
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,180
Are you disobeying my orders right now?

317
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,240
Do I have to deal with you per Saheonbu's code of conduct?

318
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,980
The Minister of the Interior asked me to put you in this position

319
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,240
to see if you can talk sense into Han Jeong Seok since you're close to him.

320
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,980
Inspector Han isn't one to be dissuaded with such a tactic.

321
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,730
You should do something more direct.

322
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,130
Direct?

323
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,240
I will open a jejwa

324
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,860
to examine Prince Milpoong's crimes, My Lord.

325
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,340
O-open what? A jejwa hearing?

326
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,990
Have you lost your mind?

327
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,300
Are you suggesting that we drag down Prince Milpoong?!

328
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,080
The opposite will happen.

329
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,740
Inspector Han's argument will be destroyed when he has no proof to validate it.

330
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,360
It will make him unable to raise the matter ever again.

331
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,970
For a jejwa hearing, not just the inspectors,

332
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,960
but all the higher-ups above the chief inspector level will gather

333
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,490
to discuss the charge, won't they?

334
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,780
It looks like Inspector Wi is trying to help us.

335
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,730
But is this really going to help us?

336
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,320
If we can't prove our case in the hearing,

337
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,120
it may instead end up putting you, Inspector Han, at a disadvantage.

338
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,160
No. We still need to try everything that we can.

339
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,860
You haven't even drunk one glass.

340
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,460
Weren't you trying to get drunk?

341
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,850
I'm trying to decide whether I want to get drunk on liquor or drunk on dreams.

342
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,770
Here. Go on and decide which one already.

343
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,390
Get that decision out of the way and come have some fun with me, as you've always done.

344
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:19,420
 I am asking whether you can't restrain yourself just a little more

345
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,040
 and show the rest of the world that worthy and respectable side of you.

346
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,960
Prince Milpoong was being threatened by Noh Tae Pyeong,

347
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,130
a maternal uncle of the deceased Yoon Yeo Ok.

348
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,440
It's a more than sufficient reason to murder Noh Tae Pyeong.

349
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,050
So where is the evidence that Prince Milpoong was threatened by him?

350
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,400
Prince Milpoong says he doesn't even know who he is!

351
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,270
There is a person that was ordered by Prince Milpoong

352
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,160
to be the substitute test-taker for Noh Tae Pyeong's civil service examination.

353
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,250
That person can speak to the truth of this matter as a direct informant.

354
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,020
An informant? There's really an informant?

355
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,480
Who exactly is that person?

356
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,350
How could you ask me that Inspector General?

357
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,610
Saheonbu officials don't disclose their informants.

358
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,750
And on top of that, no one can pressure us to do so!

359
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,560
That's the unwritten law upheld by the Saheonbu.

360
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,790
Are you a senior officer?!

361
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,510
How dare a mere inspector try to lecture me!

362
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,110
My Lord, don't try to protect Prince Milpoong any longer!

363
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,000
Did you all really not know?

364
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,530
You all knew about it.

365
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,570
About Prince Milpoong's crimes.

366
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,050
- Your Highness!
 - At one point in time,

367
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,370
- Saheonbu's officials were referred to as haechi.
 - Your Highness!

368
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,750
- We were called that because
 - Please come out!

369
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,220
we were trusted to be able to judge good from evil and uphold justice no matter whom we were dealing with.

370
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,050
But what are we like now?

371
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,190
For the sake of your own well-being,

372
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,510
you all are turning a blind eye to the truth.

373
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,790
The reckless brandishing of a sword by one with power has killed a feeble citizen.

374
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,860
Even in times like these, the people still look to us, the Saheonbu.

375
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,670
Even in times like these,

376
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,780
the people are still desperately looking at us to take their side.

377
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,510
They hope that we, the Saheonbu, will do our jobs properly!

378
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,610
Don't defame Saheonbu's name!

379
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,710
All you are doing is fabricating a crime so that you can arrest Prince Milpoong!

380
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,020
My Lord.

381
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,750
If not, then bring that so-called informant here.

382
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,640
Then we'll let you have Prince Milpoong as you want.

383
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,300
Where is this wretched informant, whose source nobody knows?!

384
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,460
Have you nothing more to say for yourself?

385
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,280
If there's really an informant, bring him here!

386
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,010
There's nothing more for us to hear from you.

387
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,580
If you can't reveal who your informant is,

388
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,560
then this must clearly be a false accusation!

389
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,740
Inspector Han deserves punishment!

390
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,980
Oh dear. What to do?

391
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,080
That wretched informant

392
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,400
is right here.

393
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,520

394
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:18,810

395
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,510
 If on top of one informant, I give you another?

396
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,030
 That is why I propose that we arrest Prince Milpoong and investigate the matters!

397
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,990
 Hey, you lunatics!

398
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,860
 My Lord, slay him!  Don't mind me!

399
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,340
 You will lay out the future government yourself?

400
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,250
 Shall I tell you how we've been prevailing so far?

401
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,920
 Everyone, stop!

402
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,930
 - Head Inspector!
 - My Lord!

403
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,630
 We need to plant fear into everyone.

404
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,510
 Can't be, Minister of the Interior.

405
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,980
 What happens when you resist and how it ends.

406
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,970
 To trample on them and traumatize them with fear so they will never stand up again.

407
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,930
 If I can catch him, I will give you even my all.

408
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,390
 That is why I voluntarily request to be exiled, Your Majesty.
