1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,760
Where have you seen these criminals as tenacious as snakes?

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,560
Step aside.

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,470
You habitually made such vicious and lawless comments

4
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,930
as "His Majesty is the real traitor for not begetting an heir."

5
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,100
I have never said such a thing!

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,110
Shut up.  There are witnesses who've heard you.

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,030
 How can an impotent one be called a king?

8
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,220
 Of course, in that sense His Majesty is the real traitor.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,190
That's not all!

10
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,860
You carried out a detailed plan to assassinate the king.

11
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,230
Look clearly at this.  This is the poison we discovered at your houses.

12
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,550
You planned to carry out the treason and usurp the throne with this poison.

13
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,090
Even if you ask me a hundred times, I don't know about that.

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,140
For whose sake are you saying we plotted treason?

15
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,500
Of course, that must be the crown prince, because you intend to rebel and place the crown prince on the throne.

16
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,010
The head of the treasonous bunch is the crown prince!

17
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,270
- Until that name comes out, keep torturing them!
 - Yes!

18
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,130
The apprehended traitors have not named the crown prince yet.

19
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,140
Isn't that because they know the moment they make the confession, they are dead.

20
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,190
However, they will not be able to last in the end.

21
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,320
W-We really didn't do it.

22
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,830
Left State Councilor!  This is a setup.

23
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,470
But information about how you two tried to kill

24
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,800
His Majesty when he was the crown prince is also there.

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,100
Th-That is...

26
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:16,240
Yes, we did talk about that briefly.

27
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,800
But it was just a passing remark, and it was for the sake of Noron.

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,360
If you really think about Noron, you shouldn't have provided the excuse.

29
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,610
I've been going against you, not knowing my proper place.

30
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,560
I am begging you like this.

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,080
If not me, at least please release my grandson.

32
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,030
He is the eldest son of my family.

33
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,270
I, too, ask you for this favor.  Please at least spare my son.

34
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:03,080
It really is not true that we tried to put the crown prince on the throne, Your Excellency.

35
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,840
- Left State Councilor.
 - Your Excellency!

36
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,010
Look here, Left State Councilor.

37
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,530
- Left State Councilor. 
- Your Highness.

38
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,070
What brings you here?

39
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,800
Is it strange that I should come to the State Tribunal when I am suspected of treason?

40
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,810
The ones who want to drag me down are you.

41
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,890
I guess voluntarily presenting myself can become a problem, too.

42
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,780
I am here to diligently respond to the State Prosecutors.

43
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,930
However, before that, I have something I'd like to discuss with you in private, Left State Councilor.

44
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,280
The crown prince personally before the State Prosecutors!

45
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,820
And he is having a private meeting with His Excellency Min Jin Heon?

46
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,780
Yes, what do you think is going on?

47
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,460
We were trying to be courteous to him until the involved ones confessed his name.

48
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,300
But why purposefully at this night...

49
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,040
You have always moved unexpectedly, but today, you are even more so than usual.

50
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,750
Why volunteer to come to the State Tribunal?  And on top of it, meet with me in private...

51
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,840
At this moment, who must be the most elated one?

52
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,000
Wouldn't it be you, Your Excellency, who always considered me a pain in the neck?

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,590
So, maybe, I was curious about your facial expression.

54
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,160
You are acting too debonaire at a moment like this.

55
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,910
It's only when you get bitten by a tiger for the first time that you feel fear.

56
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,570
If you get bitten a few more times,

57
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,150
it's natural to consider that fear as your life companion.

58
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:53,140
But now I've begun to think that I should beat down that animal

59
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,700
because I can't take it anymore.

60
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,210
Beat down the animal?

61
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,040
I know you are keeping a strange distance from this matter.

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,140
Why would it be?

63
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,630
What's the reason you don't jump on this golden opportunity to strike me down?

64
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,840
Isn't it because you know

65
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,570
that behind this dirty contemptible scheme is Prince Milpoong?

66
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,960
Just in case you board the same boat and end up suffering a miserable fate,

67
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,390
you must be taking precautions.

68
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,630
I am sorry but I do not really know what you are talking about.

69
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,280
You ought to listen to more of what I am saying, Left State Councilor.

70
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,590
Because here comes the real part of what I am trying to say.

71
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,000
In that case, what do you say you transfer boats for the time being?

72
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,520
Wu and Yue in the same boat.

73
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,170
How about cooperating with me to maneuver politics to our advantage?

74
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,970
With you, Your Highness?

75
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,110
Just like the people of Wu and Yue, who were enemies but shared the same boat during the Warring States Period,

76
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,530
we can assist each other for the common interest.

77
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,240
Isn't this the politics in which Your Excellency has a lot of expertise?

78
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,130
Wu and Yue in the same boat, you say.

79
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,760
It is surprising that you've come to the point of making such a suggestion to me.

80
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,690
But you are wrong, Your Highness.

81
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:41,360
In the world of my politics, this is the time for borrowing another's sword to eliminate the enemy.

82
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,160
I do not want you to succeed to the throne.

83
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,170
And now I am able to finish you off without putting in my own effort, why would I bother?

84
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:56,000
Why would I practice politics that are not my kind but yours?

85
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,790
At least, you are

86
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,640
a person who thinks about this country.

87
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,570
Isn't that so?  You'd rather kill me

88
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:15,790
than come at me through made-up treason, leading this country and court into turmoil.

89
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,070
Isn't that the kind of person you are, Min Jin Heon?

90
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,710
- Your Highness.
 - That's why tonight, we can at least stand together, face to face,

91
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,600
because even if we have different paths to travel, we can share the same goals.

92
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,340
Because at least you are a person who understands this level of politics.

93
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,070
So what do you say?

94
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,350
Are you going to watch the throne going over to the uncontrollable Prince Milpoong,

95
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,500
or will you board my boat for the time being

96
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,610
and try to push me off that boat later?

97
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,980
What is it, Left State Councilor?  What did the crown prince want?

98
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,940
Until when do we just have to look on?

99
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,700
Grown up to this extent.  Crown Prince, you...

100
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,410
Your Highness!

101
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,270
What happened? Will Left State Councilor take your side?

102
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,280
It is a venture with a rare chance of succeeding.

103
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,460
Because, like Min Jin Heon said, now is his chance

104
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,640
to cut me off through the hands of others.

105
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,480
 No, nobody can enter the crown prince's quarters.

106
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,170
I don't care.  Just let me go in.

107
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,090
I'm telling you, you can arrest me as a traitor too later.

108
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,680
Would that work?

109
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,500
Can I see His Highness if I do that?

110
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Moon Soo!

111
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,920
Your Highness!  Your Highness...

112
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,680
Why are you here?

113
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,930
Don't you know this is not the right time for you to come looking for me?

114
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:22,730
No.  This is  the  moment that I should come looking for you.

115
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,570
Because I am your younger brother.

116
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,740
Tabloid sheet...

117
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,210
I've seen it too.

118
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,040
I heard that the capital was plastered with these things today.

119
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,910
And this is... Dal Moon's doing.

120
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:09,470
I don't know... what to say to you.

121
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,670
"The crown prince is the not the predecessor king's son."

122
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:21,550
"He is the seed of another, from outside the palace, by whom Water Maid Choi got impregnated."

123
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,020
Oh, you are here.

124
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,390
I've enjoyed seeing your skills.  They were as good as I heard.

125
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,230
Somehow, I will have to compete with a beggar now for a bigger pie.

126
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,940
Sit down.

127
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,760
Do you even eat off of the same table as a beggar now?

128
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
Just give me a cup of drink.

129
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,340
Sure.

130
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,820
However, like yours, my heart cannot simply blame him.

131
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:19,020
As usual, we simply have different responsibilities to shoulder.

132
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,900
Do not give up like this, Your Highness.

133
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,700
We got a clue as to how Wi Byeong Joo falsified the case file of Inspector Han Jeong Seok's death.

134
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,410
Somehow we'll uncover it

135
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,570
and try to invalidate Wi Byeong Joo's treason charge.

136
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,020
To be on my side at a time like this...

137
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,300
I guess you are not very talented with line choosing  (joining the side that will ultimately help one's career) , either.

138
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,880
A person has to live as he is born.

139
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,250
I will bid you good night now.

140
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,640
I will take these with me and burn them.

141
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,560
No, wait...

142
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,550
Wait a second, Moon Soo.

143
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:18,290
- P-pardon?
 - I'd better take another look at these tabloid sheets.

144
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,690
Your Highness, they are full of vile words.  Why would you read such things...

145
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,780
The characters are different.

146
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,630
Here the "Choi" characters

147
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,370
and here the "Mil" characters...

148
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,150
What do you mean, Your Highness?

149
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,240
Can't you see?  These characters on the tabloid sheets.

150
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,300
On each sheet is written a different Chinese character.

151
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,230
Court Lady Ha!  Cho Hong!

152
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,560
What is the matter, Your Highness?

153
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,430
Summon Ja Dong now. Hurry!

154
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,000
Pardon?

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,340
Yes, I got it.

156
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,450
Each tabloid sheet has one different character.

157
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,820
There must be a reason to this,

158
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,140
to why Dal Moon, who is literate, wrote characters with wrong meanings.

159
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,730
"Can I offer you a piece of advice..."

160
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,640
 Can I offer you a piece of advice as well?

161
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,670
 Well, I guess you should just read the tabloid sheets posted all over the capital.

162
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,570
 I don't see you coming up with a better solution.

163
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,210
That's what Dal Moon definitely said.

164
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,170
Tabloid sheets. Read tabloid sheets was what he said.

165
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,800
This is the payment for becoming my man.  Open it.

166
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,230
Put that away.  I didn't do it for money.

167
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,590
It wasn't for money?

168
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,800
Then, what is it that you want?

169
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,290
You couldn't possibly have worked without wanting anything in return?

170
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,190
How can that be?

171
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,330
I do want something... earnestly.

172
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,890
Okay, tell me.

173
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,010
Whatever it is.

174
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,990
They are here.

175
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,480
Wait here.

176
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,120
That thing you want, I will hear it out when I return.

177
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,010
The poison I gave you before, you can't use it haphazardly.
 (in Chinese)

178
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,380
There is no antidote for it.
  (in Chinese)

179
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,860
None, none.
  (in Chinese)

180
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,820
What are they saying?

181
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:13,570
They say the poison you bought is a very strong one.

182
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,410
Okay, okay.
  (in Chinese)

183
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,550
Good.
  (in Chinese)

184
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,510
Hey, that rat bastard left behind keeps getting on my nerves.

185
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,650
Now, why don't you change this location?

186
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,600
Change?  Why?

187
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,730
Goon Tae.

188
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,670
Hurry back, Hyung-nim.  This is a trap.

189
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,180
That Do Ji Gwang rascal has already caught on.

190
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,540
- What?
 - I believed that surely, surely you must have some other reason.

191
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:30,640
There is no way my hyung-nim would have betrayed the crown prince for no reason.

192
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,110
Aish, what are you waiting for?  Do Ji Gwang's underling has gone back.  Quickly!

193
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,360
What is it?

194
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,730
I'm positive.  Each sheet has one character with a different meaning.

195
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,470
Here, too.

196
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,760
Different "bi"s.

197
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,160
Here, "sook." The "sook" characters are different.

198
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,320
Bin Bi

199
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,390
Choi Sil Jin Sook Geum Mil Bi

200
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,740
What on earth does this mean?

201
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,860
Royal Concubine Lady Choi.

202
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,880
Truth.

203
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,740
Bi Geum Yi Mil?

204
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,500
Royal Concubine Lady Choi Truth Bi Geum Yi Mil.

205
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,620
The original meaning should be...

206
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,570
My mother's secret.

207
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,630
The truth that I am not the king's natural son.

208
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:47,570
However, if it is read using the other characters,

209
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,630
the meaning becomes...

210
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,700
Sook Bin Choi Sil...

211
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,030
Defeat someone and

212
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,350
the break "Choi" means...

213
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,210
That truth is...

214
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,790
That's right! Not Geum but Mil.

215
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,730

216
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,960
It signifies Prince Milpoong!

217
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,370
In that case, Your Highness, isn't this a secretive message that Dal Moon is sending you?

218
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,140
Dal Moon did not betray me.

219
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,550
It means he is doing something for me right now.

220
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,330
No one is going to confess? Okay.

221
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,590
Keep going. Keep going!

222
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,870
He was an inspector and then served as a section chief in the Ministry of Defense, but he lives in a shabby place like this?

223
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,950
I know, right?

224
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,000
Who are you?

225
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,280
Yes, it's correct. I wrote both of those death certificates.

226
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,100
Why did you write  two back then?

227
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,450
I remember that a Saheonbu inspector requested them.

228
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,880
By chance, was that inspector someone named Wi Byeong Joo?

229
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,750
The one who moved you to the Ministry of Defense

230
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,410
was Wi Byeong Joo who was the lead inspector back then?

231
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,170
I don't know the reason, but yes.

232
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,100
Afterward, you weren't able to meet him.

233
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,800
I had a problem at the Ministry of Defense, so I went to meet him.

234
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,560
But he ignored me, so I became like this.

235
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,070
Do you remember Inspector Han Jeong Seok whom you worked with back then?

236
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,660
Jeong Seok?

237
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,540
You mean him?

238
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,230
On the night that Inspector Han died, I know that you were on duty.

239
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,200
That night at that place, who else was there?

240
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
The rebels aren't yielding.

241
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,470
We have to call the crown prince to the Inquisition Hall and cross-examine him.

242
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,690
We can't. We haven't found any evidence that the crown prince is involved.

243
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,420
However, there is circumstantial evidence that the rebels met to try to poison the king!

244
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,240
Can you say that it is related to the crown prince?

245
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,660
If it actually happened, who would benefit the most?

246
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,980
It's certainly the crown prince.

247
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,960
Chief Censor, that kind of statement is dangerous.

248
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,190
Everyone except Deputy Minister of Taxation and Assistant Officer of Uigeumbu

249
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,020
will agree that we should bring the crown prince to the Inquisition Hall.

250
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,600
What do you think, Left State Councilor?

251
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,450
 At least, you are a person who thinks about this country.

252
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,710
 Isn't that so?

253
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:23,410
 You'd rather kill me than come at me through made-up treason,

254
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,910
 leading this country and court into turmoil.

255
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,180
 Isn't that the kind of person you are, Min Jin Heon?

256
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,240
It's meaningless to stall for more time.

257
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,530
I also think that bringing the crown prince

258
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,330
to the Inquisition Hall is the right choice.

259
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,830
His Majesty will come.

260
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,000
He will interrogate the crown prince personally.

261
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,530
He should,

262
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,880
because he needs to clearly reveal the crown prince's crimes.

263
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,230
I didn't think you would sling your bow until the end.

264
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,710
This caused turmoil in our court.

265
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,630
I can't sit and watch.

266
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,790

267
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,100
In this troubled time,

268
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,840
there is nothing I can do for you,

269
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,960
so this is a small gift.

270
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,260
Your Highness, this is...

271
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,310
It's the late king's item.

272
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,420
How could you bring such a thing to me?

273
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,590
To whom else but the son would I give his father's possession?

274
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,990
It's rightfully yours, Crown Prince, so accept it.

275
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,240
That the bad rumor that is going around the streets is a cruel lie,

276
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,430
I know best of anyone.

277
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:40,960
So if this is a false accusation, Crown Prince,

278
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,260
confidently clear yourself from the charge and return to your palace.

279
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,760
Queen Dowager.

280
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,430
Crown Prince.

281
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,050
In the end, you are going to stand at the Inquisition Hall.

282
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,030
Will you give us space for a moment?

283
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:26,380
It seems that my persuasion did not work on you in the end.

284
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,920
What do you mean persuasion?

285
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,270
If persuasion works in politics,

286
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:37,920
then why would there always be the same bloodbath in court?

287
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,850
Politics is about revenge, Your Highness.

288
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,380
Blood calls to blood. It never ends.

289
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,290
A continuous cycle of revenge.

290
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,700
That's politics.

291
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,610
 His Majesty is coming!

292
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,330
 Your Highness, wait.

293
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,650
Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim!

294
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,700
I found him. I caught him.

295
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,290
Bring the criminals.

296
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,580
Crown Prince.

297
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,160
We are wronged.

298
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,260
We have never planned treason.

299
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,860
What are you doing? Make those criminals kneel right now!

300
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,960
Crown Prince, do you truly not have anything to say?

301
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,670
Answer me!

302
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:06,730
If you confess your crime here, then I will at least save your life.

303
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,510
Your grace is immeasurable;

304
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,560
however, I have never thought of treason

305
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,100
nor planned a rebellion.

306
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:26,160
I cannot confess to a crime I did not commit

307
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,930
by any means, Your Majesty.

308
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,650
Then there is no other way.

309
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,990
I will have to interrogate you myself.

310
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,650
Officers, start.

311
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:59,140
I will interrogate the criminals and the crown prince here.

312
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,750
I apologize, Your Majesty.

313
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:12,360
But may I say one thing before the royal interrogation?

314
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:23,800
Unfortunately, I cannot agree

315
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,360
to this royal interrogation today.

316
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,400
It is because the crown prince

317
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,210
is not guilty of any charges.

318
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:56,990
I have known this truth since a long time ago, Your Majesty.

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:14,120

00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,630
♫  You whom I love  ♫

321
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:26,550
♫  Become the moon light  ♫
