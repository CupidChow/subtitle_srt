1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,150
What did you say?  The Saheonbu... in the palace?!

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,190
Something like that happened?

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,730
The reason I kept silent after witnessing all those events

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,610
was that the killer was a young girl.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,610
If Saheonbu gets involved with this, the whole country like in the past...

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,970
Your Highness, even so—

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,900
I know!  The crown prince, not the king, cannot participate in government.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,980
He must not do anything related to government.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,490
Because all related matters fall into the king's jurisdiction,

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:43,990
if he does so, that is as good as coveting the king's authority.

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,730
If you want me to pay the price for this, I will gladly do so.

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,760
However, even so, the reason I acted this way

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,550
is that I wanted to know

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,190
why such a young girl had no choice but to commit a murder.

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,310
You wanted to know why?

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,470
Maybe it was because I couldn't help

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,310
the lowly blood running in my veins.

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,400
What hurt her so much!

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,580
For what reason did she have to hold that dagger in her hand!

20
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,410
Before making her pay for her crime,

21
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,050
I wanted to know that first.

22
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,250
 Your Majesty!  There is big trouble.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,080

24
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,670
Officials of the Saheonbu, rise.

25
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,670
I, the king, will not allow you to turn in your resignation letters.

26
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,590
In that case, please transfer the crown prince's case to Saheonbu, Your Majesty!

27
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,850
We cannot trust the investigation results from Uigeumbu that covers for the royal family!

28
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,780
- Inspector General!
 - We have all come to an agreement.

29
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,100
If we cannot be guaranteed of a fair outcome of this case,

30
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,560
all of us will resign from our posts.

31
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,460
Please grant our request, Your Majesty!

32
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,900
Please grant our request!

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,250
You want the crown prince?

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,420
All right, will you be satisfied if I do so?

35
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,410
If I give you the crown prince?

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,830
Your Majesty!

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,540
Your Highness Queen Dowager, you are the only one who can save the crown prince right now!

38
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,730
Crown Princess Consort, wait until the results come out.  Right now...

39
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,150
Even if you are unfamiliar with the palace etiquette, how can you be so rude?

40
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,740
- You show off your ignorance this way?
 - Excuse me?

41
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,520
Queen, you are one to talk.

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,670
Your Highness, I merely meant...

43
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,550
 Your Highness, this is Court Lady Jeong.

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,180
Your Highness, an urgent development.

45
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,390
His Majesty just announced that he would give the crown prince's case to the Saheonbu.

46
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,030
What?  Back to them?!

47
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,250
Your Highness Queen Dowager!

48
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,860
Is this king's order for real?

49
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:01,000
That is so.  However, His Majesty said he would give you time.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,970
Before giving Saheonbu the right to investigate this case,

51
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,430
that was the condition His Majesty attached.

52
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,960
Your Majesty!

53
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,380
Within that time, you must prove your own innocence

54
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,690
and reveal the truth behind the case, Your Highness,

55
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,300
because you will go in front of the Saheonbu's jejwacheong  (supreme tribunal).

56
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,920
 Three days.  Three days' time.

57
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,350
Please take it back, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,390
This will be a burden on you as well.

59
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,950
One in ten thousand, if something goes wrong...

60
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,700
I, too, will have to bear the brunt of Saheonbu and Noron's attacks.

61
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,840
- Your Majesty!
 - However, my brother said he would like to know.

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,480
He is trying to understand how the people feel before punishing them for their crimes.

63
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,180
If I am the king, Deputy Minister,

64
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,280
shouldn't I also know that?

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,730
Who did you say croaked? Jipyeong  (chief inspector, fourth highest official in Saheonbu) ? Who is Jipyeong?

66
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,320
What a sh*tty name that is!

67
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,970
It's not a name, but a job title belonging to Saheonbu.

68
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,440
Whatever the heck it is,

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,800
why did the son of a bitch have to get stabbed in someone else's gisaeng house

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,680
and cause a freaking mess for me?

71
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,970
Still, thanks to him, I think the Saheonbu's movement to investigate us stopped.

72
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,460
But, still, how about going into hiding for the time being?

73
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,010
Telling me to hide?  Hey.

74
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,280
I am Do Ji Gwang.

75
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,180
How can they keep barging in when the business is closed!

76
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,380
I don't know!  They want alcohol now!

77
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,930
I-I had n-no idea I'd meet you again, Your Highness...

78
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,820
I'll say. If you opened a gisaeng house in Hanyang  (capital) ...

79
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,470
Aigoo, please spare me!

80
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,660
you should have informed me

81
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,330
when you are my connection as well.

82
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:18,260
Excuse me?  D-D-Didn't you come to kill me?

83
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,120
My bad, my bad.

84
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,420
When everything was because of my karma, why would I kill you?

85
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,710
Here.  Let me pour you a cup.

86
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,960
Y-Y-Yes.

87
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,530
Which bastard is ordering me to open or close the gisaeng house?!

88
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,010
Is that you?  Your liver must be bloated  (means audacious) .

89
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,410
You even brought an outside wench to my gisaeng house.

90
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,490
This guy accrues bad karma with his mouth.

91
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,690
Sit down.  I will pour you a cup, too.

92
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,250
And what is this wench blabbering?

93
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,860
H-H-Hey, calm down.  This person is...

94
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,800
You f_king loser!

95
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,880
The bitch and bastard couple have accursed, freaking bloated livers.

96
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,990
Hurry and clear out of here, all you f**king bastards!

97
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,710
In the past, I would've gouged out your eyeballs by now.

98
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,100
"Abstain from taking life."

99
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,770
Thanks to that precept, you still have good use of your freaking eyeballs.

100
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,020
- Head Merchant!
 - Stay put.

101
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,860
This freaking dude

102
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,370
is really something.

103
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,280
Put that down and talk.

104
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,340
I think you two share plenty in common.

105
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,420
Dear me, I'm sorry!

106
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,100
Were you scared a lot?  You're Do Ji Gwang, right?

107
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,380
Don't worry.  I am here to help you.

108
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,820

109
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,210
Saheonbu used the bridge-burning tactic  (to make soldiers more fierce by affording no retreat) .

110
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,420
So are you asking for my help now?

111
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,960
I am not here to ask for your help.

112
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,380
Procedurally, I came to request your cooperation.

113
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,390
You want to save your face and get practical gains too.  And you can't undo the arrogance you exhibited before.

114
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,470
This is Chief Inspector Oh's murder case file.

115
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,010
I request official cooperation from the Capital Bureau as well.

116
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,530
His Majesty says he will give you the crown prince in three days.

117
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,950
But why three days?

118
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,730
I think it's a move to gain time.

119
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,980
Not only to pacify Uigeumbu,

120
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,070
but also to give the crown prince more time.

121
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,580
You are pretty good.

122
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,120
What? Are you in the know?  By what you said a while ago...

123
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,950
Before that, you need to give me the information in your hand.

124
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,220
- That is— 
- If you want to set a new game, shouldn't you trust me, Deputy Inspector General Wi?

125
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,080
If the crown prince is an uncomfortable presence for you, too.

126
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,700
Your Highness.

127
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,860
There are about ten posting stations in Hanyang and its outlying parts.

128
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,390
And in the past, the master-killer band secretly operated out of these posting stations as their bases.

129
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,860
But it's different this time.

130
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,340
We could not find anything suspicious at any of the posting stations.

131
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,500
Thank you.  Work hard.

132
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,750
Have you heard of the master-killers?

133
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,640
I am not sure.

134
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
That's not the only strange thing.

135
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,970
There was no trace of pillaging either.

136
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,170
Ordinarily, the master-killer band had pillage as one of their objectives.

137
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,430
And there is more, Your Highness.

138
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,930
There is a common, but incomprehensible thread connecting all noblemen murder cases of late.

139
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,820
Common but incomprehensible?

140
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,780
It wasn't just Chief Inspector Oh.

141
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,830
All the murdered noblemen were too drunk to even control their bodies at the time.

142
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,990
It means they were defenseless at the time.

143
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,360
However, even then, the killers could not deal a single mortal thrust to their victims.

144
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,170
That's perhaps why they tried numerous times...

145
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,440
Even until their own hands were wounded,

146
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,030
they had to muster all the strength they had.

147
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,460
That means...

148
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:04,720
Yes, it means the killers were weak individuals, Your Highness.

149
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,120
Not only that girl, but also other killers were perhaps...

150
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,250
little children perpetrating the acts.

151
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,020
Children?

152
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Why?  How?

153
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,050
Hey, there, hurry up.  You have to go back.

154
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,060
Okay, I'm coming.

155
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,770
 I will find their base.

156
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,750
 Why don't you look for that girl together with lady damo, Your Highness?

157
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:14,260
Such a small hand.

158
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,400
What I saw that day.

159
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,490
Even if it is just to find out her story, we must locate her first.

160
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,980
But, Your Highness, about this dagger.

161
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,270
Are you sure this is the right one?

162
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,170
The one that you saw, I mean.

163
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,850
Since they say the smoke flue here is the problem, sweep it well.

164
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,530
If His Majesty catches a cold, that will be a huge problem.

165
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,640
If you want to earn even a coin, sweep it well.

166
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,890
Yes.

167
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,560
Gosh, so cold...

168
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,790
Children must have been summoned because of the problem with the heated floor of Your Majesty's bedroom.

169
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,780
On a cold day like this, it must be a hard labor.

170
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,880
I looked into this at Aekjeongseo.

171
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,770
However, the letter...

172
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,990

173
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,280
Probably the letter "Aek" was worn out.

174
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,430
And that's why even the Saheonbu did not catch on.

175
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,640
Where is this dagger used?

176
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,460
This Haeminseo is also a place where homeless children end up in.

177
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,650

178
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,740
Make sure not to skip a single temple where they give out alms to the poor and scan them all.

179
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,020
Yes, Hyung-nim.

180
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,100
What are you doing?

181
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,110
Too many places use the same type of dagger.  We can't find it at this rate.

182
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,300
How about asking for Uigeumbu's help?

183
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,810
By the way, who are those children?

184
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,430
They are children who clean the heated floor flue systems.

185
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,790
- They are not public slaves, but...
 - Flue system?

186
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,820
Yes.

187
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,660
Can't be...

188
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,430
Black ash.

189
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,300
Lord, have you found out anything?

190
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
Nothing from Haeminseo.  How about you?

191
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,540
I think we'll have to check out the temples on the outskirts as well.

192
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,800
Lord, I'm afraid we can't ride that boat.

193
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
We can't?  Why not?

194
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,830
I don't know.  The boat is almost empty but they said no even to my offer of twice the fare.

195
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,760
There is another ferry dock over this hill.

196
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,970
Let's go and see.

197
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,310
- This way, Lord.
 - Wait.

198
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,280
That boat. Something seems strange with it.

199
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,000
They are boarding only children.  Why?

200
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,350
Why refuse twice the fare

201
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,890
and board only children who seem penniless?

202
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,790
It was you, indeed.

203
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,750
Wait.  I am not trying to hurt you.

204
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,620
Let me go!  Let go of me!

205
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,230
I'm trying to help you!

206
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,260
Do you understand?

207
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,070
Why did you do that... I want to help you.

208
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,760
What do you mean you'll help me?

209
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:33,660
Yes, I saw you killing a nobleman.

210
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,350
I also saw that scary word "master-killer" etched on your body.

211
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,370
But before catching you and punishing you,

212
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,370
I wanted to find out the reason why you had no choice but to do that.

213
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,570
Do you understand?

214
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,670
So that I can help you.

215
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,850
Help me?

216
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,140
How can you, Lord?

217
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,600
You're a nobleman yourself.

218
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,660
You are of the same class.

219
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,470
So how can you help me when we came to this because of you people?

220
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,890
If it weren't for the rent money,

221
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,500
my older sister would not have been sold off to Qing.

222
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,990
Had the master given us just a bit more time,

223
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,640
my father would not have tried to sell me too.

224
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,770
Even if we had nothing to eat but the dirt,

225
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,120
I just wanted to live here.

226
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,800
Even if this is a lousy land,

227
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,360
I just wanted to live here with my family.

228
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,120
Getting sold off?  What do you mean?

229
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,330
Are you saying

230
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,360
someone tried to drag you off to the Qing Dynasty?

231
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,930
Who is there?

232
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,610
Your Highness, I think guards are coming.

233
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,690
- What do you want to do with this child?
- Hide now!

234
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,000
- Pardon?
- Before the guards get here, hurry.

235
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,660
What is it?

236
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,360
Your Highness, I am sorry.  We heard strange noises, so...

237
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,690
It was nothing.  So don't worry yourselves and go on your way now.

238
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,870
Yes, Your Highness.

239
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,100
Your Highness.

240
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,390
We are hungry.

241
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,760
Wait just for a bit.

242
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,660
- We are hungry.
 - Wait just for a bit.

243
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,420
This is the master-killer band's base?

244
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,820

245
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,440
Those children are killers?

246
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,380
How can this be?  How can something like this happen?

247
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,420
Who are you?

248
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,230

249
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,830
Oops, sorry, I didn't know you were there.

250
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,870
Don't you think you're too petty?

251
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,140
What did you say, bastard?  Petty?

252
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,120
Hey, are you done talking?

253
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,100
Lord Yoon Hyeok!

254
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,900
Please see me for a second.

255
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,960
I have something to tell you regarding the human trafficking case.

256
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,510
Hey, who do we have here?

257
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,670
If this isn't our newbie, Park Moon Soo?

258
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,930
- Please let go of this.
 - Let go of this?

259
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,160
Hey, hey, see how cheeky our newbie is.

260
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,330
- At this rate, he'll punch me too!
 - Yes.

261
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,450
Before I throw you one, unhand me now.

262
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,990
Hey, you, Park Moon Soo!  Do you want to die that bad?

263
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,510
Hey, bastard, you are a newbie.

264
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,200
The lowest-ranking officer that is even inferior to an animal.

265
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,340
If your sunbaes tell you to bark like a dog,

266
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,630
then the newbies ought to bark!

267
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:29,670
Ah... Newbie. That stupid hazing.

268
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,600
Fine, the dog bark.

269
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,670
Okay, I'll bark to your heart's content.

270
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,640
Do you know why the world is sh*tty?

271
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,790
People like dogs don't realize they are like dogs and

272
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,480
act like dogs while getting paid by the government.

273
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,350
The people are getting sold like dogs and dying like dogs,

274
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,290
yet you are trying to guard your own doggy food bowls

275
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,010
and just act freaking dogs!

276
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,970
You are exactly like trashy dogs, dog-shit!

277
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,750
Because of sons of bitches...

278
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,580
Did I bark enough for you?

279
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,920
Lord Yoon Hyeok, please come see me for a minute.

280
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,360
Oh, okay.

281
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,740
Hey, is he really crazy? Is he really insane?

282
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:37,270
Not sure. I don't think that is it, but it is better than barking.

283
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,440
Out of all the new inspectors,

284
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,220
I believe it was the most creative dog bark.

285
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,830
What did you say, bastard?

286
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,740
Let's go together.

287
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,530
So that's what the child said?

288
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,890
That instead of being sold, all she wanted was

289
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,360
to live in Joseon with her family?

290
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,220
The crimes of the children who committed murders

291
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,960
cannot be overlooked, Your Majesty.

292
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:29,480
However before that, please also redress this nation's evils

293
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,040
that caused the children to hold a knife.

294
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:48,270
I see... that this is the kind of place I'm sitting at, Crown Prince.

295
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:54,160
I, who couldn't even protect my people who are being sold,

296
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,050
am sitting in this warm room,

297
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,230
fixed by those small hands.

298
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,740
Deputy Minister of Taxation.

299
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,060
- Queen Dowager. 
- It's been a while.

300
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,210
Is it okay to act as if we are close friends?

301
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,380
When I was young, I saw you often at my home.

302
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,650
I learned from your late father.

303
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,080
I heard that the crown prince is inside of the king's palace.

304
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:53,340
So how is the crown prince in your perspective?

305
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,810
- Pardon?
 - You act as if you don't know.

306
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,820
You know what I am asking.

307
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,370
I'm not sure about what kind of person His Highness is yet.

308
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,360
However one thing, if we're talking about the ability to rule,

309
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,600
the kind of ability that this nation will need in the future,

310
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,710
he just might have it.

311
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,050

312
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,560
Are you sure? The crown prince insisted on it?

313
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,470
Yes!

314
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,350
Your Highness.

315
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,260
- Is it ready?
 - Don't worry.

316
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,750
It will be taken care of soon.

317
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,160
I apologize for making you come all this way, Your Highness.

318
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,760
However, the law is law.

319
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,410
So the Saheonbu is only trying to do its duties completely.

320
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,000
That Saheonbu is fighting to keep the law,

321
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,880
I am more aware of it than anyone else.

322
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,390
Who that law is for is but another matter.

323
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,990
I'll take you to the Jejwa Hearing Room, Your Highness.

324
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,030
- Break down the door!
 - Yes, Sir!

325
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,400
The crown prince has arrived.

326
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,080
We will follow this order.

327
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,520
You know how Saheonbu's hearing process goes, right? You've been here before.

328
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,610
What a nice walk-through. I'm thankful.

329
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,780
It seems a bit early for those words

330
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,410
if you think about the trouble you will go through soon.

331
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,740
Ah, do you remember what you've said before?

332
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,210
You said that when you learned what happens to those falling out of favor with the powerful,

333
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,500
you grew up.

334
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,430
- What?
  - That's when I acted up, not knowing anything about this world.

335
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,720
 But when I learned what happens to those falling out of favor with the powerful, I grew up.

336
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,890
It would have been nice if you'd truly had a revelation back then.

337
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:04,450
Then you wouldn't have acted rashly again.

338
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,460
- What are you doing?
- Come here!

339
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,480
Where's your boss?!

340
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,200
Hey!

341
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,100
What is this? Who are you all?!

342
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,420
Are you Do Ji Gwang?

343
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,990
Let's go obediently when we're using words.

344
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,470
You're under arrest for illegal human trafficking to the Qing.

345
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,800
No, wait!

346
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,420
- Your Excellency Min Jin Heon.
 - Before you hold a jejwa hearing,

347
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,650
there is something you must see.

348
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,930
Min Jin Heon.

349
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,780
Bring the criminal.

350
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:22,440
How could the nation's Saheonbu treat their people this way?

351
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,890
That person is...

352
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,860
That child is...

353
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,370
How is that child...

354
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:05,370

355
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,550

356
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,830
♫  You whom I love  ♫

357
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:22,620
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

358
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,030
♫  You whom I love  ♫

359
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,080
 It's them! You must not lose a single one!

360
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,310
 Are you going to say this is politics, too?

361
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,010
 This is not politics but logic.

362
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,190
 Help the crown prince, Your Highness.

363
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,050
 Joseon is not the king's nation. It's the noblemen who govern the nation.

364
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,030
 So are you saying we should abandon the crown prince?!

365
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,730
 Does that mean you support the master-killer band, too, Your Majesty?

366
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,100
 As requested by your council, dethrone me.

367
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,660
 What are they doing not stopping the subjects?

368
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,630
 They are all subjects stepping forward with their names on the line.

369
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,170
 This is the real public opinion that nobody in the world can manipulate.

370
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,470
 You will trust the people's opinion that can turn away in an instant as well...

371
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,610
 Show them that you are still going strong as the crown prince.

372
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,400
♫  I become tears  ♫
