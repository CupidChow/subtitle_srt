1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,800
Was I a bit too much?

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,490
You were.  But will you be alright after only half an hour?

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,350
Of course.  Since I am the king, I can stay seated on the throne.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,000
This is why it's nice to be the king.

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,170
How many days on earth has it been already?

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,350
Regular audience, good morning audience,

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,720
morning seminar, afternoon seminar, evening seminar...

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,170
how many times in a day mouthing "Ministry of the Interior's section chief" and "Saheonbu"...

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,910
I even lost my voice now.

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,000
But we must hang in there, Lord.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,570
What His Majesty wants is to wear us out.

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,650
Then, you need to say something, too, don't you?

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,450
Are you all mute with your lips glued shut with honey?!!!

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,750
It's a joint petition signed by the incumbent and past inspectors of Saheonbu.

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,360
The names supporting the reform number several hundred.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,410
Everyone was waiting with bated breath,

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,310
but in fact, there were a lot of people wishing for this moment.

18
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,070
I've heard that His Majesty, too, is trying very hard day and night.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,370
Just maybe this time, I think Saheonbu might

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,340
realize the reform that's been long overdue.

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,180
It should be. It must be so.

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,840
Your Majesty, this is...

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,860
What do you mean by a public audience  (when the king openly communicates with the people) ?

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,300
Are you saying you will really hold this audience?

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,040
Yes.  A public audience.

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,760
I intend to leave the palace and listen to the people's stories.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,560
- However, Your Majesty...
- Thus far, the rulers of this country

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,800
regarded the people only as the subjects of their rule

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,420
but never lent an ear to their stories.

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,390
They viewed the people only as objects on the other side,

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,910
who work and provide free labor and taxes.

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,070
I know what you are trying to say.

33
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,310
However, a king personally facing the public is not an easy task.

34
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:14,290
I've lived among the people way longer than the time I spent in the palace.

35
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,180
A king with lowly blood flowing through half of his veins.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,260
What monarch would be able to handle this matter better than a king such as I?

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,150
- What is this about? 
- What is it?

38
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,500
Public audience?  What on earth is this?

39
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,650
Hyung-nim, are you illiterate?

40
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,690
It's written right over here.

41
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,410
It says right here.

42
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,500
"The king will come out and listen to the people."

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,790
So I am asking why will the king listen to us?

44
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,350
- I know, right?
 - Is it a good thing?

45
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,760
His Majesty will come out to the streets?

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
To listen to what the people say about the military service tax?

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes, there is quite a hubbub in the capital.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,070
The king listening to the people?  What earth-shattering event is this?

49
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,470
At this rate, am I going to lose my livelihood?

50
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,220
If His Majesty attracts all the people in the market, what am I to do?

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,770
It is such a confident unfaltering move, so like His Majesty.

52
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,230
Is the king of the palace  (gwol in Korean)

53
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,290
trying to become the king of the streets  (geori)  as well?

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,110
Exhausting one issue after another, now even matters relating to the land taxes and uniform taxation.

55
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,870
Why do we have to listen to the subjects about these matters?

56
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,340
That is what we are saying!

57
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,370
But the ones who pay the taxes are the people.

58
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,180
Isn't it a given that we should listen to them?

59
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,290
But what do they know?

60
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,430
They are just simpletons who farm.

61
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,860
Yes, we are just simpletons who farm.

62
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,000
But we know all that we should know about.

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,950
The ones who pay the military service taxes are us.

64
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,600
So if not us, who knows better about the system?

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,900
That is right.

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:24,300
Today's occasion is for the purpose of listening to the people's voices.

67
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,950
Regardless of the high and low of your class and status, anybody may speak.

68
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:35,940
Without hesitation, tell me all about your hardships.

69
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,770
Until this hour?  It's been four hours already.

70
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,090
It's still not over?

71
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,850
The debate between the commoners and noblemen grew to the point

72
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,600
where no end can be predicted.

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,970
Really?  How can this happen?

74
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,510
Please make haste.  The public audience session got drawn out so food to feed the people is needed.

75
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,340
Yes, we are doing our best, but we are short of helping hands.

76
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,430
Excuse me, where should I put this?

77
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,020
Palace Maid Cheon.

78
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,180
You can put it over there.

79
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,110
What is going on?  Why are you here?

80
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,490
I heard that they needed more help here.

81
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,820
Even though I am a terrible cook, I am a mighty girl.

82
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,690
I came to help even if it's just doing chores.

83
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:38,250
Oh dear!  I was wondering where you were all day long and look who is here.

84
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,590
Queen Dowager.

85
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,090
I should have known!  This kid, Palace Maid Cheon.

86
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,760
Every time, she's caught helping His Majesty, I hear?

87
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,530
No, Your Highness, that's what I intended but—

88
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,200
Court Lady Ha, now you can take this kid Yeo Ji to the king's palace.

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,020
I always take a back seat, and she puts His Majesty's needs before anyone else's.

90
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,110
So what use do I have of her?

91
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,090
If you can't get any more use out of her, should I?

92
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,100
N-No, Your Highness, that is really not what I intended.

93
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,390
I was just kidding.  How flustered you are.

94
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,350
From the beginning, I intended to send you

95
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,970
to His Majesty's side when the right time came.

96
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,260
- Pardon?
 - I had told her about His Majesty's feelings toward you.

97
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,800
If not me, who would understand his needs?

98
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,570
Court Lady Ha.

99
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,660
By the way, the palace kitchen seems to be very busy.

100
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,960
Let's help out too.

101
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,980
The court lady and maids of the queen dowager's palace?

102
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,630
But I'm going to help, too.

103
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,190
You might not think it, but I was quite a good cook when I was still a young girl in my parents' house.

104
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,120
Now, let me see...

105
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,670
So the biggest burden comes down to military service tax?

106
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,840
That is correct, Your Majesty.

107
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,590
Other taxes can be paid if we farm to death,

108
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,360
but there has to be available manpower to farm!

109
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,900
How can he be so indefatigable inside and outside the palace?

110
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,430
It will soon be 11 PM.

111
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,390
It can't be that we have to pass the night standing on the street like this?

112
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,640
I see.  I will not fail to take that into consideration.

113
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,760
However, Your Majesty, this is impermissible and nonsensical.

114
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,000
What do you mean by reducing the people's military service tax by half

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,310
and asking the noblemen to supplement the deficiency?

116
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,890
Why is it impermissible and nonsensical

117
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,510
to suggest that the landowner pay taxes for the land he owns?

118
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,610
If all landowners pay 2  du's*  of rice  (* approx. 36 liters)  per 30 plots of rice paddies they own,

119
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,010
the deficiency, after reducing the military service tax, will be canceled out.

120
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,720
Is the military service tax really getting reduced by half?

121
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,090
So the landowners will get taxed instead?

122
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,460
- That is unacceptable!
 - How can you tax the noble class?

123
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,200
That is not allowed, Your Majesty!

124
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,590
Preposterous!

125
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:41,480
Your Majesty, I am sorry to point this out, but this public audience is improper.

126
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,730
Right now, you are trying to piggyback onto the support of the people and implement an unlawful policy.

127
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,020
Piggybacking onto the support of the people?  Me?

128
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,790
Okay, let's say that's what I am doing.

129
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,110
- But why is that improper? 
- Pardon?

130
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,220
How can the country exist without the people?

131
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,720
Shouldn't kings and ministers, of all people, keep in close contact with their people

132
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,760
and embrace their best interests through piggybacking or what not?

133
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,990
Therefore, I shall listen to the opinion of each and every subject.

134
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,530
Now, those of you who have gathered here, make up your own minds.

135
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,830
Those who agree to the new military service tax law shall head toward the South Gate

136
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,850
and those in disagreement shall head toward the North Gate.

137
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,670
You shall do so.

138
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,360
I will follow the majority rule.

139
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,450
Now, everyone, let your opinion be known.

140
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,940
What are you waiting for?  Soldiers, maintain order to facilitate the people's movements.

141
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,980
Yes.

142
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,220
Let's go!  Of course, we should head to the South Gate!

143
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,700
Right on!

144
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,450
The military service tax getting halved!  What a dream come true this is!

145
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,420
Let's hurry on!

146
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,310
Let's go!

147
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,950
Long live the king!

148
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,230

149
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,130

150
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:10,980

151
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,150
That hanging board reflects the king's edict he personally bestowed on the people!

152
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,450
What does it mean?

153
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,930
What is written there?

154
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,300
- Gyun Gong Ae Min Jeol Yong Chuk Ryeok. 
- Huh?

155
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,080
Love the people with fair  taxation

156
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,130
and build strength with frugal spending.

157
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,650
Love the people through fair taxation?

158
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,830
Yes, that is right. That is precisely that is what our king said.

159
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,530
That's right!

160
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,260
I feel so frustrated!

161
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,880
I want to read what's written there myself.

162
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,230
What an illiterate you are.

163
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,280
At any rate, the military service tax will get halved, right?

164
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,320
That is right!

165
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,870
Long live the king!

166
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,950
Long live the king!

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,040
♫ The paupers of the yesteryear have returned without dying.

168
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,880

169
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,530
♫ Here I come.

170
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,570
♫ The world goes around.

171
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,600
I have clearly seen it.

172
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,640
Really?  Really?  Here, here, have one of these.

173
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,880
Everyone, have one.

174
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,670
Here you go.

175
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,050
Here.

176
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,550
Here, here.

177
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,230
Keep on talking.

178
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,120
Did Magistrate Choi's servants really sneak out rice from the local government storage?

179
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,410
Are you doubting my vision right now?

180
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,780
No, I am not doubting...

181
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,320
But why do you keep talking down to me?

182
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,010
A pauper may forget about the hand that fed him,

183
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,240
but, as a rule, he cannot forget the hand that slapped him.

184
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,320
So will I be able to forget the hand that stole the rice or not?

185
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,920
That's right.  I saw it too.

186
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,590
Five-hundred sacks from Yangjoo and 300 sacks from Seobinggo...

187
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,990
 So that Magistrate Choi jerk is

188
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,270
 gobbling up the state grains one sack after another like one would with a string of dried persimmons.

189
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,840
In that case, would busting them today would be the right thing?

190
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,920
The taffy is really sweet.  Sweet.

191
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,140
Would you like to eat my taffy, too?

192
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,750
Somehow, your face is familiar.

193
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,930
But how long do I have to keep this up?

194
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,700
Just eat taffy.
  ("Eat taffy" can mean "fu*k you.")

195
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,710
Shoo!  Shoo!  Shoo!

196
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,630
Now, now, now, scoot over.

197
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,890
Jang Dal. Ah Bong.

198
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,880
Aigo, do you feel so wronged and aggrieved?

199
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,130
When Our Majesty insists on doing away with discrimination so much,

200
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,110
how can you pettily eliminate only yourself from the pauper disguise?

201
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,450
Thanks to the great boss I was assigned to,

202
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:52,880
this is the most mortifying disguise I ever had to wear in all my fifty years.

203
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,570
Hey, but look here. Think.

204
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,730
Even if I besmirch this milky toned face,

205
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,000
who would believe that it's the face of a pauper?

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,130
This is a strategy and tactic.

207
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,400
Huh?  Still, our strategy worked, right?

208
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,700
Here, Jang Dal, clink clink.

209
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,440
So when are you going to bust Magistrate Choi who stole the state grains?

210
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,580
Now that the alcohol has fully brewed, I should grind it up and down in one shot.

211
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,600
This is it, Your Majesty.

212
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,080
He's been keeping to this place lately.

213
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,960
Now I will omit the usual comment about how I am indebted to you.

214
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,020
I've heard that you will hold another public audience in a few days.

215
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,570
How many times has it been already?

216
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,060
Why?  Are you wary of me?

217
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,800
That I might encroach on your streets at this rate?

218
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,990
Just be satisfied with your palace.

219
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,380
I have already told you that I am the king of the streets.

220
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,660
Just look at this guy, daring to use the word "king" to the king's face.

221
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,500
In the past and now, you are really a beggar who grew up without manners.

222
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,610
I apologize.

223
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,940
Thank you.

224
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,050
Let's go.

225
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,440
It's been a while, Your Excellency.

226
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,130
All the way to this humble place...  Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

227
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,000
Unable to hear any word about you, I hired a private eye to look for you.

228
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,600
As you know, I have a very capable informer at my disposal.

229
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,810
You must be talking about that person, Dal Moon.

230
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,390
You've kept him by your side for such a long time.

231
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,390
That is what I want to do with you, too.

232
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,080
Why do you keep turning down the call of the court?

233
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,210
It is because I have carried out all my duties.

234
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,550
You have a lot of young and talented people around you, Your Majesty.

235
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,040
- However, Your Excellency— 
- There was a time

236
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,810
in the past when I

237
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,330
spoke of Saheonbu's haechi in this place.

238
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:08,680
Haechi. I mean the legendary animal that can distinguish good and evil.

239
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,590
 But do you know why that animal only exists in legends?

240
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,530
 It's because, in reality, it's impossible to judge good and evil.

241
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,960
 That is so, Your Majesty.

242
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,410
 In reality, it's impossible to judge good and evil.

243
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,180
 No matter how much one dreams about it.

244
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,800
 Therefore, I gave up on that dream a long time ago.

245
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,740
 At one time, I thought in reality only the victorious and defeated,

246
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,880
 the winner and loser exist

247
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,810
 and that losing power meant defeat

248
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,070
 and imminent death.

249
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:01,610
 Because I got weary fast and despaired.

250
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,860
 When, in truth, life and politics are

251
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,960
 all about making tedious progress

252
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,020
 while dreaming that dream of impossibility.

253
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,040
 Your Excellency.

254
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,610
 Someday, the time might come for you too,

255
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,690
 Your Majesty, to grow so weary and despairing.

256
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,670
 For you too, a day when you might have to retreat.

257
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:36,000
 All I can do is to wish, with all the loyalty in my heart,

258
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,930
 that day will come for you ever so slowly, ever so tardily.

259
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,430
 With you, I believe it will be possible, Your Majesty.

260
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,160
 Because you are not alone.

261
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,460
 Because you have friends who share your dream.

262
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,720
- Who the heck are you guys?
 - Me?

263
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,390
Wait...

264
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,840
Here.

265
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,970
- Secret Royal Inspector!
 - Park Moon Soo!

266
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,270
Crack down!

267
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,970
You know what I am about to say.

268
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,150
You are all dead!

269
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,830
Everyone, collect information for His Majesty's next project.

270
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,360
Get to the bottom of it.

271
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,440
- Yes, Hyung-nim.
 - Yes.

272
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,190
Now, now, here we go!

273
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,230
Yes.

274
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,200
Therefore, on this road,

275
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,500
not getting weary too easily, not despairing—

276
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,380
Your Majesty.

277
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,480
Day in and day out, governing and studying...

278
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,010
and you even secretly inspect the people's lives every other day.

279
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,640
Isn't it hard for you?

280
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,830
To have it hard is the king's way.

281
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,640
What can I do about it?

282
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,550
Just consider it your beau's destiny.

283
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,500
What?

284
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,660
Your Majesty.

285
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,880
And I have to come out like this so I can hold your hand once in a while.

286
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,030
This is what you call killing two birds with one stone.

287
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,200
Still, you cannot do this here.  What if someone sees us?

288
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,310
What's wrong with this?  Who's here anyway?

289
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,260
Your Majesty.

290
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,760
Aigoo, curse this

291
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,650
slow-witted, silly old man.

292
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,260
Please continue on with what you've been doing.

293
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,810
No, Ja Dong!  What do you mean what I've been doing?

294
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,240
That is why I said no.

295
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,280
That is...

296
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,480
This bridge seems to be full of problems.  It seems to be in need of reinforcement.

297
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,900
Reinforcement?  Do you mean rebuild it?

298
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,540
This place sees a lot of traffic.

299
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,610
But it's rickety as if it will collapse any moment now.

300
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,480
But there are lower class people living under this bridge.

301
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,220
What happens to them if the bridge is rebuilt?

302
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,430
Then I should ask them about their opinion.

303
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,020
What they think about rebuilding the bridge.

304
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,490
What?  Right now, you mean?

305
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,110
- Your Majesty!  No, you can't!
 - Your Majesty.

306
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,220
You can't go by yourself like that!

307
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,700
Please call the royal guards now.  Hurry.

308
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,680
Yes.

309
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,860
Your Majesty, it's dangerous. Let's go together.

310
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,980
May I ask you a question?  Is there any inconvenience in using that bridge?

311
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,350
Please let me ask you a question.  When you use that bridge...

312
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,030
 Thank you to our channel manager: 
 Asiane

313
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,010
 Thank you to our English moderators:

319
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,940
 Thank you to our English editors: 
SignsofSerendipity (chief), baritaggie, joysprite

320
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,030

321
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,430
 Therefore, on this road, may I

322
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,560
 not get weary too easily or despair...

323
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,080
 Because life and politics are

324
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,450
 all about going forward

325
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,470
 ever so gradually.

326
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:40,190

327
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:46,240
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫

328
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:53,350
♫  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  ♫

329
00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:04,190
♫  Now the gentle and gentler wind hurts too  ♫

330
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:10,180
♫  In the spirit we both loved  ♫

331
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:17,320
♫  The wind is saying we must let each other go  ♫

332
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:25,090
♫  That’s the story now told by the gentle wind  ♫

333
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:34,680
♫  A gentle wind blows  ♫

334
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:41,710
♫  I turn past the memory of what was read  ♫

335
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,670
♫  In the next story which is blank  ♫

336
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:55,190
♫  What should I be longing for?  ♫

337
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,600
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫
