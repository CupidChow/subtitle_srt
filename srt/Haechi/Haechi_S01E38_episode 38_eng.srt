1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,020
Hyungnim, have you seen this?

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,620
You saw it, too?

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,820
Even if they are half brothers and he coveted the throne, how could the younger brother kill his hyung?

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,490
That's what I am saying.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,810
So he used that harsh aconite on the previous king. Is that right?

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,170
No wonder this country is on the downhill.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,070
Did you see the poster?

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,130
It said all the people in the capital will die.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,110
Because of the king, it's punishment from heaven.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,130
Hyung-nim, what do you mean heaven's punishment? Is it true?

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,410
- It's true. 
- Heaven's punishment?

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,920
It's heaven's punishment!

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,490
Put that away!

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,100
I am taking my father and leaving.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,590
Do you not know a plague patient can't leave!

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,540
Then he needs to die here?!

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,200
The king even killed his own brother,

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,330
so who can say he didn't put aconite in this medicine?!

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,590
Why do you think this horrible disease is spreading?

20
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,970
It's because it's heaven's punishment for the king's sin!

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,190
Do you know even then what the king is doing?

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,070
Because the queen dowager got sick,

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,620
he's planning to run away to his vacation palace.

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,900
The king is abandoning his people to save his own neck!

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,790
Just whose fault is this?

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,670
Why did we get this disease?!

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,380
Save me!

28
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,550
Save me, My Lord!

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,030
My Lord!

30
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,010
Get away.

31
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,380
Get out of the way.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,360
So the patients are refusing the medicine now?

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,130
They want to leave the Hwalinseo  (city medical clinics) ?

34
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,510
I am sorry.

35
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,700
All the medical officials are doing their best but...

36
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,200
On the third day since the breakout in the capital, at 9:30 AM,

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,660
there were 94 patients at East Hwalinseo

38
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,440
and 102 patients at West Hwalinseo.

39
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,600
If you can't control the disease here, it'll be the end of the capital. Do you not realize it?

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,270
It's the third day since the breakout.

41
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,720
If you can't control the plague here,

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,230
the capital will be in total chaos.

43
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,320
You all stand back!

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,930
Do you not hear me saying stand back?!

45
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,680
Step away! We need to live, too!

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
We can't die staying in the capital!

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,270
Get out of the way!

48
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,510
We want to go out!

49
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,740
What do you mean you don't have any rice? You were selling it yesterday!

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,760
Well, I don't have it!

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,480
People rushed in and bought it all!

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,030
So what are we going to do?

53
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,900
Just sell us a little bit.

54
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,970
Just share some!

55
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,300
I don't have any!

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,820
Sell us some!

57
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,490
Share the rice!

58
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,430
General, this is the news of capital.

59
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,170
How is the mood in the capital?

60
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,520
Are you curious?

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,400
They won't find a way.

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,860
There's no easier and stronger weapon than fear.

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,850
At this rate, three days or four at the most.

64
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,890
The king won't be able to withstand the public opinion.

65
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,220
That's the time... to start the rebellion.

66
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,540
The very moment it'll crumble with just a push.

67
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,060
What should I do?

68
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,380
What can you do?

69
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,040
Pardon me?

70
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,420
You just watch and enjoy the show.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,020
I only gave you a spot for being in the same Namin party.

72
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,990
But I also need to—

73
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,010
Just watch you said?

74
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,930
That won't do.

75
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,270
I have to have my stake in this play

76
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,060
so I'll have a bigger piece of pie to eat.

77
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,760
 Cheongju Area

78
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,780
It said he used aconite, which is in the poison to execute criminals, to kill the previous king.

79
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,620
Is that a person? He's a beast in a human form.

80
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,880
That sort is playing the king's role

81
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
with a swagger in this land of Hanyang!

82
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,470
Stop it now. You don't know anything.

83
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,530
What is this? Were you saying that to us?

84
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,350
So I am saying not to babble rashly.

85
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,640
His Majesty tried so hard to save the previous king.

86
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,150
Just what do you know about it?

87
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,330
He's so scary.

88
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,010

89
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,620
Wi Byeong Joo?

90
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,040
Why is that man...

91
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,530
Assistant Officer of Uigeumbu! Assistant Officer of Uigeumbu!

92
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,140
Assistant Officer of Uigeumbu.

93
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,430
Inspector Park, what are you doing here?

94
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,980
Glad you are here. How about Lord Inspector General?

95
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,710
Are you sure it was Wi Byeong Joo?

96
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,800
I saw it with my own two eyes.

97
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,120
I came running remembering you two retired to the nearby Oksan Confucian Academy.

98
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,380
How could someone who should be dead by now be alive?

99
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,460
Hold on. Then by chance, Prince Milpoong, too?

100
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,350
- What?
 - Prince Milpoong...

101
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,810
Just what kind of a situation is His Majesty in right now?

102
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,490
Do you know what's happening now

103
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,660
in the three southern provinces, including Chungcheong, and in the capital?

104
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,670
Of course. The plague and even the horrible posters slandering His Majesty.

105
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,270
We were losing sleep over it here, too.

106
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,980
For sure these things show strange signs.

107
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,960
It's possible His Majesty...

108
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,990
will be in huge trouble.

109
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,010
What is the current status of the capital?

110
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,910
I am sorry, but the baseless rumor is added, so the situation is grave.

111
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,920
What do you mean by baseless rumor?

112
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,760
I am sorry to tell you,

113
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,800
the rumor says Your Majesty will leave the palace to avoid the plague

114
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,730
and go to your vacation palace.

115
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,780
- What? 
- I am sorry, Your Majesty.

116
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,070
The priority is to calm the capital.

117
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,230
As soon as the day breaks,

118
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,960
tell them this is a baseless rumor through the morning paper.

119
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,720
Yes, will do.

120
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,760
You two may leave.

121
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,520
The morning paper is the official paper in the palace and only read by the noblemen.

122
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,660
Do you think that will take care of public opinion?

123
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,870
But with the current status,

124
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,980
what more can you do?

125
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:58,070
I think it'll be better for us to mobilize more military power and get ready for a riot just in case.

126
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,050
Your Majesty.

127
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,020
I have something to tell you urgently.

128
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,070
Are you saying this came from Dal Moon now?

129
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,970
Yes. He said he'd like to see you as soon as possible.

130
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,780
Dal Moon, tell me.

131
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,430
What do you mean the wells in the capital?

132
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,170
What is it that you want to tell me?

133
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,010
Take a look.

134
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,340
Tonginbang.

135
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,500
Saeteo.

136
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,540
Samcheongdong.

137
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,310
Plus other wells in various areas.

138
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,960
To be more certain, Goon Tae, Storyteller, Jang Dal, Ah Bong looked into this.

139
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,000
This isn't just a few houses.

140
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,280

141
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,440
This is the name list?

142
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,970
Thanks.

143
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,600
Excuse me.

144
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,240
Let me ask you something.

145
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,200
Do you know of any people who got sick after drinking this water?

146
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,570
I am positive. Most of the patients taken to the hwalinseos

147
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,510
are the people who used these wells for their drinking water.

148
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,440
Seongjae Well of Samcheongdong means...

149
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,260
Yes. It's the well the palace kitchen uses sometimes.

150
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,460
We confirmed the kitchen took the water from that well a few days ago.

151
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,180
No way. That's why the queen dowager is...

152
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,200
Your Majesty, this may not be a plague.

153
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,310
- Perhaps someone— 
- Into the wells...

154
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,060
they put in the poison.

155
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:15,790
No way. Someone, a political power to shake me down,

156
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,940
is using the people.

157
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,070
Don't worry about it.

158
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,930
We checked if you were tailed.

159
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,200
Welcome, Deputy Minister of Works.

160
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,880
I brought General Lee In Jwa's message.

161
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,090
Please come in, Deputy Minister of Defense.

162
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,010

163
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,160
The secret will be kept til the end, right?

164
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,580
Of course.

165
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,810
General Lee In Jwa is very happy that you joined the plan.

166
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,540
As you've said, this is the sign of poison, Your Majesty.

167
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,160
I'll never forgive them,

168
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,590
those who dared to harm my people

169
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,320
through such a method.

170
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,410
Never.

171
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,810

172
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,770
All gathered?

173
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,230
In response to the emergency situation happening in the capital,

174
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,110
all inspectors and assistant investigators will be divided into teams

175
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,010
and dispatched to the Capital and Police Bureaus.

176
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,570
I got horrible chills from yesterday.

177
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,790
What did he say?

178
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,770
"Oh my, I got horrible chills from yesterday," he said.

179
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,880
You have horrible chills?

180
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
So what?

181
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,720
Cough, cough, cough.

182
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,130
He's the only son in his family for the fifth consecutive generation.

183
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,360
If I am sick,

184
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,470
my aging mother will be horribly worried.

185
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,170
You really are making me worry horribly.

186
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,210
How did you understand this?

187
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,830
In my neighborhood, someone talks just like this idio—

188
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,020
I mean friend.

189
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,760
- Let's go! 
- Yes!

190
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,510
I wonder where our Lord Moon Soo is at a time like this.

191
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,120
I know, right?

192
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,150
He'd walk on fire for His Majesty.

193
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,650
He must be feeling bad.

194
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,340
- Let's go.
 - Yes.

195
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,070
 There must be something.

196
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,620
 Wi Byeong Joo, who should be dead by now, is still alive.

197
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,730
 And the plague is spreading suddenly.

198
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,320
 Even the posters are being distributed in an organized way.

199
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,330
 You are thinking there's a plot to harm His Majesty.

200
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,410
 I'll find out what it is.

201
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,240
 I'll follow Wi Byeong Joo.

202
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,680
 You two go to the capital and tell His Majesty of this fact.

203
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,820

204
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,440
Make way!

205
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,310
Damn it. More people are gathering.

206
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,680
At least let the children go.

207
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,580
Let us go!

208
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,150
What if this leads to a rebellion?

209
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,520
We will block them.

210
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,710
Back off!

211
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,020
Back off! Back off!

212
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,240
If you all have eyes, you must have seen

213
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,860
what kind of chaos is happening at the capital!

214
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,930
In the end, whose fault is this?

215
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,610
It's His Majesty's! It's because he murdered the preceding king

216
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,900
and lost the hearts of the people!

217
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,230
Everyone! Will you really just stand still and watch?

218
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,740
Is this really showing loyalty and care for this nation?

219
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,950
What to do...

220
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,430
I mean, 30 minutes have already passed,

221
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,990
but why hasn't His Majesty come yet?

222
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,930
Who was the one that said there is no time to lose?

223
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,320
Hwalinseo's patients are refusing treatment,

224
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,460
and the capital is at the brink of rebellion.

225
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,530
Don't we have to come up with a countermeasure?

226
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,080
How can we appease the people?

227
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,250
Shouldn't an official step up and take responsibility?

228
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,480
Who? Who will go there?

229
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,000
Are you going to go?

230
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,630
What are you doing? Go check his palace.

231
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,430
Yes.

232
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,970
 What on earth do you mean?

233
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,320
 That you, Assistant Officer Jo Hyeon Myeong, and Park Moon Soo will resign?

234
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
 You must allow it, Your Majesty.

235
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,340
 Now to lead this court, you must throw us away.

236
00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:00,040
 Your Majesty, please do not feel sorry toward me or get hurt...

237
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,860
 If you know how gladly I am traveling this road,

238
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,000
 But I wanted it, Your Majesty.

239
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,260
 Rather than living a normal woman's life,

240
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,180
 I wanted to be with your cause in this palace.

241
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,750
 - Yeo Ji. 
- And you probably have no idea how relieved I feel now.

242
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,230
 I get to stay by your side.

243
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,010
 The ones who left me for my sake. The ones who stayed by me for my sake.

244
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,360
 For them, I cannot collapse here.

245
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,620
 I will do all that a king should do here.

246
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,240
- Let's go.
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

247
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,010
What did you say just now? His Majesty left the palace?

248
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,450
Chief Royal Secretary!

249
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,470
Right State Councilor. You see—

250
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,030
Answer me. Where did His Majesty go?!

251
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,990
No way...

252
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,560
Did His Majesty...

253
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,990
Out of the way!

254
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,460
Move out of the way!

255
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,770
Other than patients, no one else can enter Hwalinseo any longer!

256
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,180
We cannot trust this nation nor Hwalinseo anymore!

257
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,060
I need to take back my family who is in there!

258
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,120
Please let my mother go. I cannot let her pass away in there.

259
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,460
Everyone! Let's push on and force our way in!

260
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,930
There is a rumor that Hwalinseo added Chinese aconite in the medicine!

261
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,330
Step back right now! Do you hear me?!

262
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,550
This is no good. It's probably best to just retreat.

263
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,040
- Wait!
 - Let us in!

264
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,340
What is that?

265
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,170
What?

266
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,060
We will go out!

267
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,620
We can't just wait to die like this!

268
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,110
Step back! You dare to disobey the king's command?

269
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,720
Like it matters!

270
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,490
While all of his people are dying, the king went away by himself

271
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,230
so that he could survive. He's not even a king!

272
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,610
 His Majesty is coming!

273
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,210
Your Majesty!

274
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,420
Your Majesty!

275
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,590
Your Majesty!

276
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,970
Your Majesty!

277
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,660
Your Majesty!

278
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,440
Your Majesty!

279
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,220
What are you doing?

280
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,110
Doctors and nurses, raise the patients.

281
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,840
How could you make the sick kneel?

282
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,760
Is this your father?

283
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,180
Yes, Your Majesty. He is.

284
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,010
Stand up.

285
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,380
How could you be on the cold floor when your body is weakened like this?

286
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,240
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

287
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,400
I know what you are all worried about,

288
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,880
what horrid rumors are spreading in the capital,

289
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:25,960
and what kind of fear you have regarding this illness because of that.

290
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:38,280
However, I, as the king of this nation,

291
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,380
will never abandon my people.

292
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,290
This illness is not a punishment,

293
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:58,390
and you will definitely be cured of it.

294
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:11,420
So I hope that you will believe my words.

295
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:20,420
I will not take one step away from this place, this capital.

296
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:32,290
Until the end, I will be with my people.

297
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:49,010

298
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,570

299
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:57,510
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫

300
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:05,200
♫  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  ♫

301
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,100
 That man called king is quite a trickster.

302
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,980
 The rebellion plans are going to change. Send my command to everyone right away.

303
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,830
 The third person who led this... who on earth are you?

304
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,830
 Are you saying the rebels have infiltrated the capital and the palace?

305
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,500
 You say you're preparing a rebellion, yet you don't even know that a mouse has been poking around.

306
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,990
 What have you been doing?!

307
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,340
 To be frightened by a mere thing like this...

308
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,460
 - Is it ready?
 - It won't be easy at all.

309
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,840
 Is there, by any chance, another problem in the palace?

310
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,790
 What will happen and from where...

311
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,480
 I can't even fathom right now.

312
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,980
 Do you know how long we've been preparing for this?

313
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,850
 We are going to overturn this dirty world

314
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,500
 no matter what sacrifice it takes.

315
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,290
 Definitely, the final goal must be the overturn of the country.

316
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,030
 Lee In Jwa, how far have you gone?
