1
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,150

2
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,020
No way. Was this it?

3
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,860
Prince Milpoong, you will

4
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,800
use the queen as your promoter,

5
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,240
and using China as your support,

6
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,320
you plan to become the king's adopted son?

7
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,110
Oh no.

8
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,220
There are times when even Your Excellency makes such a face.

9
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,100
Prince Yeoning.

10
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,270
Your head must be hurting

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,320
since you were the one who gave and then took away the throne from Prince Milpoong.

12
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,320
That's why I asked you to look for me earlier.

13
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,830
Didn't I warn you through a messenger?

14
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,330
What is it that you want to say?

15
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,910
You didn't come forward just to brag.

16
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,080
Don't you need a prince, Your Excellency?

17
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,480
One that will become a pawn-like king on the chessboard.

18
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,970
That kind of prince, I mean.

19
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,460
Recommending Prince Milpoong as His Majesty's adopted son, Queen!

20
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,650
Are you in your right mind?!  Did you forget what kind of person he is?

21
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,110
- Your Highness Queen Dowager!
 - I cannot allow this.

22
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,030
It cannot be unless it's over my dead body!

23
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,370

24
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,750
Your Majesty!  When it comes to dance, my moves are of the highest quality.

25
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,060
May I dance for you?

26
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,810
Will you do so for me?

27
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,530
That would be the greatest honor, Your Majesty!

28
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,550
Whether I need a prince... What do you mean?

29
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,230
Hasn't it begun now?

30
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,470
His Majesty's heir to succeed him.

31
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,140
Everyone has begun to seek out that prince in earnest.

32
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,400
You cannot mean the seat of the next king, Your Highness.

33
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,210
Even with lowly blood in me, I am at least nominally a royal.

34
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,600
Why didn't you at least dream of becoming the king?

35
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,740
Weren't you the one who asked me that, Your Excellency?

36
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,460
I thought I might dream that dream, too, as you advised.

37
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,410
Don't you think I would be an easier piece

38
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,600
to deal with than Prince Milpoong?

39
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,480
Prince Milpoong!  How on earth did that come about?!

40
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,690
My Lord, isn't that Prince Yeoning and His Excellency Min Jin Heon together?

41
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,770
Why are those two together?

42
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,180

43
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,110
Prince Yeoning.

44
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,050

45
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,840
Tell me. Who gave you the money?

46
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,770
Hey, who the heck are you?

47
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,810
We'll leave as soon as our business is done.  Don't butt in.

48
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,610
Is this wench crazy?

49
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,380
What are you looking at?

50
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,200
Why do men always have to have sense beaten into them?

51
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,510
I really don't know.

52
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,240
I just did as I was ordered because I was paid handsomely.

53
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,060
Does it make any sense that you don't know?

54
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,270
I lost my parents at an early age and even my extended family gave up on me a long time ago.

55
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,640
So who gave you money and asked you to take care of me?

56
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,400
It's the truth!  I was contacted only through letters, so I don't know.

57
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,050
They just asked me to follow if you were studying well and whether you might pass the exam...

58
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,730
What?  They even wanted you to stalk me?  What perverts...

59
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,180
Did you say they paid you handsomely?

60
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,550
How much more than the going rate?

61
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,460
That is... three... four times?

62
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,060
Hey, is the money part important to you, at this point?

63
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,170
So some unidentified person definitely paid you overgenerous sums?

64
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,890
Lord!  Lord!  Lord Moon Soo!

65
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,730
The list of exam passers will be posted now at the central market.

66
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,750
What?

67
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,170
Lord!

68
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,050
Please hurry over there.  It's not the time to be doing this here.

69
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,920
Finally, finally that day comes...

70
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,560
I really didn't tell you this before, afraid that I might jinx it.

71
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,370
But honestly, I think I will place first because my answer was perfect.

72
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,110
Maybe that's why, but I dreamed of a dragon soaring to the sky!

73
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,970
Right?!

74
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,080
Why are you two going on like that?  Just passing the exam will be a miracle.

75
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, you punk!

76
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,790
My blood, sweat, and tears. What do you know about that?

77
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,500
Enough with the goofing around.  You should hurry over there and confirm.

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,860
Let's go!

79
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,750
What do you think you're doing?

80
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,350
Get out of the way!

81
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,260
Get the heck out!  What are you doing?

82
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,990
Do it quickly!  You're embarrassing us!

83
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,410
Okay, I'll do it.

84
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,310
Here it goes.

85
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,320
Why?  Why?  Why?

86
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,640
Lord, it's not your name.

87
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,020
It's not me?

88
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,720

89
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,070
- How can this be?
 - What did I tell you?  You should've worked your way up.

90
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,690
No, no, no, it must be the next one.

91
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,900
I definitely placed first or second.

92
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,870

93
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,570
No way.

94
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,370
This can't be.

95
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,940
Not even third place.

96
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,740
Enough, look up and down through the whole list to see whether your name is in it or not.  Uncle Jang Dal, you, too, hurry.

97
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,140
Please don't worry, it must be in here, Lord.

98
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,480
Lord, here, here!

99
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,650
There?  So my name was over there.

100
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,390
No, I meant it's not here either.

101
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,980
What?!

102
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,710
Don't play with me.

103
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,110
You're right.  We have a Park Myeong Soo but not Park Moon Soo.

104
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,950
Lord...

105
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,690
No, this can't be happening. I did so well on the exam!

106
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,650
Let's look through it again.  My name will certainly be here, definitely here!

107
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,580
Wait!

108
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,840
- Lord, enough already.  Let's go.
- Let go of me!

109
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,410
Something is wrong.

110
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,730
I mean it, Ah Bong, Jang Dal, and Yeo Ji.

111
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,760
There is no way my name is not here.  This time, it is for real.

112
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,700
Just one more time, let's look through it one more time, okay?

113
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,210

114
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,090
Wait!  Who disposed this case?

115
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,920
I am sorry but what do you mean?

116
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,600
The corruption case involving the Royal Clan Management Office, who disposed of this case?

117
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,470
- Cheating at the civil exam?
 - Yes.

118
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,110
But, hey, everyone does it.  Where have you seen a fair exam grounds?

119
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,470
Everyone buys good seats and looks over at others' answers.

120
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,290
I am not reporting petty acts of cheating like seat buying and copying others' answers.

121
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,010
This time around, there is circumstantial evidence of systematic cheating involving some high government officials.

122
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,140
Do you have the proof?

123
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,760
That is... I don't have it yet, but...

124
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,840
You must really have nothing to do.

125
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,490
Do you have a light load?  Should I assign you more?

126
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,030
Lead Inspector, this is also a very important matter.

127
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,500
Enough! Close the case!

128
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,640
If you have nothing better to do, just take that and get out!

129
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,750
What do you mean, take that and get out?!

130
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,200
What?  Why?  I am the lead inspector.

131
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,100
Okay, I will leave you now.

132
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,490
But that bastard, the way he looks...

133
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,470
Even his okay's are intimidating.

134
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,550
Lead Inspector!

135
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,310
Excuse me.

136
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,980
The Royal Clan Management Office corruption case. Did you dispose of this case?

137
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,550
I am asking whether you really notified the Office of the result like this.

138
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,010
Yes, since it was started by you, Sir, I especially expedited it.

139
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,840
What are you unhappy about?

140
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,110
Shut up.  Do you even know what mistake you just made?

141
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,110
With whose permission did you dispose of the case without my approval?

142
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,320
Who the heck do you think you are?

143
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,470
What are you looking at?  Pick them up.

144
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,440
Do you remember the corruption case involving the Royal Clan Management Office that you gave me a little while ago?

145
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,310
I mean the case you said was only the excuse to visit the Saheonbu.

146
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,460
 Do you think I came without any excuse?

147
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,150
 It's a request for a corruption investigation related to the Royal Clan Management Office.

148
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,550
Since you said it was just an excuse, I didn't think much of it.

149
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,560
But at the end of this matter—

150
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,000
There must have been Prince Angye.

151
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,770
How dumb and foolish.

152
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,590
I mean Prince Angye, whom Min Jin Heon has picked out as the next king.

153
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,150
Seeing how you have come running to me, I guess the Royal Clan Management Office is already grilling him?

154
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,050

155
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,260
Move quickly!

156
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,400
Your Highness Prince Angye.

157
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,490
Your Excellency Minister of the Interior.

158
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,220
 As young as he is, he sure made a killing.

159
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,520
Don't you think the royal relatives are something else?

160
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,360
No matter how foolish they seem, they seem to be born with talents for corruption.

161
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,620
So this was your target from the beginning?

162
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,850
Blowing away Prince Angye whom His Excellency Min Jin Heon is pushing to be the heir?

163
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,680
If not...

164
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,530
would I have joined the boring Royal Clan Management Office?

165
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,470
Just... just why?

166
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,670
Careful with your assumption.

167
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,480
You probably... can't even imagine it yet.

168
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,980
His Excellency Min will not stand for it

169
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,480
if he finds out you are involved—

170
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,630
- Of course, you'll cover it for me. 
- Your Highness!

171
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,750
You better!

172
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,800
That prisoner...

173
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,850
That man is still in my hands.

174
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,450
If you lose that man at this point,

175
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,270
your position with Min Jin Heon...

176
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,010
will become quite hard.

177
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,570
Am I wrong?

178
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,030
How can you chase your customers out?

179
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,530
So you've made enough money, is that what it is?

180
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,470
We're sorry.  We'll serve you better next time.

181
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,710
Did you clear out all the customers?

182
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,330
Yes. I put the Norons in the inner room as you said.

183
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,800
Okay.

184
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,670

185
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,640
What do you mean Prince Milpoong?

186
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,740
Why is that crazy bastard still alive and making a fuss like this?

187
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,710
That's not the only problem.

188
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:27,230
Prince Angye, whom Interior Minister has been pushing to be the heir, is about to be blown away with corruption.

189
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,890
Just how is the Minister of the Interior handling things?

190
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,090
How can I assign any task to him with confidence?!

191
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,080
You came?

192
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,030
I made you come a long way.

193
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,980
Call the girls since you brought us to a gisaeng house.

194
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,700
You never call the girls in, so why bother me to come and go when I have a perfectly serviceable house myself?

195
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,320
Why don't you call it a day, Prime Minister?

196
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,880
- Did you just tell me to leave now? 
- Yes.

197
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,170
Look here, Minister of the Interior!

198
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,130
The rest of you can go in, please.

199
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,570
Let's.

200
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,820
Are you in your right mind?

201
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,040
Do you dare put me at bay now?

202
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,920
I tried to save your face since you are the so-called leader of Noron.

203
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,300
Then you should've at least known what your mistress was up to.

204
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,940
What do you mean my mistress?

205
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,570
Just what did Yoon Yeong do?

206
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,100
Then go back and

207
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,610
ask that wench who buttered up the queen for Prince Milpoong,

208
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,810
though I am not sure if she's still in your house.

209
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,020
What did you say?

210
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,130
Let's go in.

211
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,210
I'll be in touch, Your Excellency.

212
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,150
What do you mean Prince Milpoong?!

213
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:09,840
That man coveted the throne before you became the king.

214
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,790
Are you saying you forgot all of that?

215
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,910
No matter how foolish I am, how can I forget?

216
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,010
Then... why is it, Your Majesty?

217
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,360
Why for that Prince Milpoong...

218
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,340
I must grab it.

219
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,400
Anyone's hand, if I am weak.

220
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,110
Anyone who can hand me a sword which will keep the Norons at bay,

221
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,660
I'll grab his hand even if I have bone-chilling resentments against him.

222
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,320
At the point when Prince Milpoong had returned,

223
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,750
what do you mean by Prince Angye's corruption?!

224
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,840
The inspectors got intelligence from the Royal Clan Management Office,

225
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,760
but I guess they didn't realize it would lead to Prince Angye.

226
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,490
What are we going to do if His Majesty proceeds to take Prince Milpoong his adopted son, Minister of the Interior?

227
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,650
We still don't have another plan.

228
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,310
We do have Prince Yeoning though.

229
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,410
Who? Prince Yeoning?

230
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,410
A prince in the right age bracket whom we can support to be the heir—

231
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,380
Inspector General, watch your words!

232
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,130
Prince Yeoning is a low-born's son.

233
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,610
Are all princes the same?

234
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,050
How can noblemen like us bow to a low-born's son?

235
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,940
I was just saying without a thought.

236
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,370
How could you say that without any thought?

237
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,390
 I wonder who tripped up Prince Angye at this point?

238
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,240
 Was it Prince Milpoong?

239
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,920
 What if it wasn't him? No way...

240
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,460
 Don't you need a prince, Your Excellency?

241
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,390
 No way...

242
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,920
Are you saying you want information?

243
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,410
Bring everything if possible.

244
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,640
Anything relating to Prince Milpoong. I understand.

245
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,360
You are planning to turn that information over to Saheonbu, right?

246
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,740
But... Why Prince Yeoning?

247
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,170
Isn't he the second son of the previous king?

248
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,720
Why would you bother with a powerless prince?

249
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,850
Do you need to know that at your level?

250
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:43,230
What that lowly water maid's son did during the past year and what he is doing now.

251
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,610
Bring everything about him.

252
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,310
Perhaps he's more dangerous

253
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,960
than Prince Milpoong.

254
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,830
Look here, Your Highness...

255
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,600
What are you up to?

256
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,750
Uh, over there. It seems like he's coming over there.

257
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,580
Your Highness!

258
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,000
How long has it been? Good work.

259
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,030
You got so old. Such a shame that an old man has to work so hard in this frigid weather!

260
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,250
It's not hard work. It's a good thing that I have something to do at this age.

261
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,440
But to where have you been away for as long as fifteen days?

262
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,600
You stay right here for a minute.

263
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,030
Did you get the item I asked you to get?

264
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,610
Yes, Your Highness. Would you like to see it?

265
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,060
As you instructed, I found the paper used in the civil service examinations as answer sheets.

266
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,000
I also got the witness as well.

267
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,300
What should I do? Should I give it to them like before?

268
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,570
You have something to do before that.

269
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,170
Tan is back and he's targeting the throne.

270
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,120
He's got the support of the queen and the Qing Dynasty.

271
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,700
What?

272
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,140
Then that'll mess up your plans, won't it?

273
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,620
No. He'll actually help me, Ja Dong.

274
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,030
Before this play of mine starts to play out,

275
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,680
Prince Milpoong will first shake up the Norons for me.

276
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,280
How long has it been?

277
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,520
About an hour.

278
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,840
Just how long is he planning to do that?

279
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,600
He is soft in the head to begin with and he's going to make it even worse.

280
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,260
He failed the eleventh time, so how can he be in the right mind?

281
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,640
I think Yeo Ji is more strange.

282
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,220
Why is she playing along there? She's scaring me.

283
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,260
Boom, bam. Boom, bam.

284
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,560
No way... Is it like that?

285
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,740
Perhaps. It could be.

286
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,440
Right. That's it!

287
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,420
Why didn't I think of that before?

288
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,460
- I need to go somewhere. 
- Me too.

289
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,710
Where?

290
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,230
Lord Moon Soo. Yeo Ji!

291
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,310
Eh?

292
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,150
- Oh, you came. 
- Sir.

293
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,150
I was looking for you to do some work.

294
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,250
The pay is good this time, too.

295
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,620
- Let's go in. 
- Sir, I have something to tell you.

296
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,980

297
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,900
Excuse me.

298
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,690
Not at all. You take it since you picked it up first.

299
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,130
It's one nyang.

300
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,500
Good day.

301
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,880
They sent the book back.

302
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,590
Give it to me.

303
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,450
Here you go.

304
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,050

305
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,220
Once again the author is not known?

306
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,360
Yes, I was only asked to sell it.

307
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,500
My Lord.

308
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,090
I got the intelligence again from the informant.

309
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,190
Did you find out about his identity this time?

310
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,060
He seems to be a very careful person.

311
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,090
Or he doesn't trust me yet.

312
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,850
Who do you think is giving us information relating to the exam fraud yet hiding his own identity?

313
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,840
Probably a whistleblower who feels the danger.

314
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,890
But we must find out who the informant is.

315
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,260
Even if we don't tell our higher-ups, don't you think we ought to know?

316
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,410
Right now Saheonbu is a bigger problem than the informant.

317
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,980
- I got the order to stop investigating the civil service examination corruption. 
- What?

318
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,150
Move over! Move!

319
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,180
Excuse me, what's going on?

320
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,520
I heard a crazy bastard is making a ruckus in front of the storage for the civil service examination papers.

321
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,960
Isn't that the place where they store the answer sheets from the past civil service examinations? Why there?

322
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,740
Let's go check it out.

323
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,110
Move over, I want to see the answer sheets now!

324
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,000
Just what are you doing?

325
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,310
You have all the submitted answers for the civil service examinations stored here.

326
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,200
Show me if you've got nothing to hide.

327
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,950
If you show me the answers of those who passed the exam,

328
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,900
then I'll understand why I had failed.

329
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,020
Look, do you think you are the only one who is like this?

330
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,430
You should blame your skills. Why make ruckus here?!

331
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,140
I did in the past!

332
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,050
I blamed my skills, too.

333
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,720
But not this time.

334
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,690
I studied to death with this not so good brain.

335
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,060
If I failed, then there is a foul play.

336
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,250
Someone is stomping on the honest efforts made by people like me!

337
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,160
When is the Police Bureau coming?

338
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,310
They are coming now.

339
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,690
- Move aside.
 - Over here. Come quickly.

340
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,270
Over here.

341
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,090
Is this the person who's making the ruckus?

342
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,830
He's totally crazy!

343
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,650
No!

344
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,520
I'll never leave until I verify there was no corruption!

345
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,860
Drag him out now!

346
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,590
Yes.

347
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,750
I told you, until it is confirmed, I will never leave.

348
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,390
This man, how dare he?

349
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,180
Drag me away? Fine.

350
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,830
If you can, try it.

351
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,650
If I stop holding myself back and decide to go wild, what will happen?

352
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,750
I will make sure you see it.

353
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,420
What are you doing? Hurry.

354
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,410
Yes, sir!

355
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,630
Let him be, Lieutenant Jang.  He's my acquaintance.

356
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,060
Inspector Yoon from Saheonbu? What are you doing here?

357
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,010
I was wondering who it was and it is you.

358
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,500
I mean the man who was pushing away the seat-grabbers at the exam ground.

359
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,710
Do you know me?

360
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,670
You're a Saheonbu inspector?

361
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,820
My name is Yoon Hyeok.  You didn't get hurt anywhere, right?

362
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,880
That's Lord Park Moon Soo?

363
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,420
Why are those two...

364
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,190
What did you say? Moon Soo did what to Inspector Yoon of Saheonbu?

365
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,410
I don't know the whole story, but these two men seemed to know each other.

366
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,760
What is going on?

367
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,480
Your Highness, if things happened this way, how about letting Lord Moon Soo and Yeo Ji know?

368
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,860
If we can receive any help from those two, Your Highness—

369
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,720
I cannot do that.

370
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,970
You know what a dangerous thing I am intending to do.

371
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,410
Moon Soo could not pass the test after all, Ja Dong.

372
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:38,140
No matter how hard he tried, he could not overcome the long-standing dishonest practice related to the civil service exam.

373
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,180
But Moon Soo will find a path,

374
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,090
just as he had opened a path for me.

375
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,230
Until such time, this work must be undertaken wholly by me.

376
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,500
What? That damo  (tea maid, female investigator)  said she would quit her job? Why?

377
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,300
She doesn't answer when asked,

378
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,850
and she insists on quitting.

379
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,430
Why, all of a sudden?  Where would she find another cushy job like this one?

380
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,170
That's what I am saying!  Because this household paid good money,

381
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,800
I paid her three to four times the usual daily wage for inedible food.

382
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,000
I doubted it, but it was true.

383
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,200
You...

384
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,320
What are you doing here?

385
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,680
We've met before, haven't we?

386
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,090
And from what I remember, this is the home of Prince Yeoning?

387
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,530
That...

388
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,130
You found out.

389
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,080
What's going on?

390
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,900
Did Prince Yeoning order you to do this, by any chance?

391
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,550
You are such a good, tough drinker.

392
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,280
You are really my type of person.

393
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,340
Do you want some?

394
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,560
Sure, I drink well, too.

395
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,770
I used to be a liquor peddler.

396
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,960
Ah, yes.

397
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,760
You aren't shocked? I told you that I used to sell alcohol.

398
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,490
Is that something to be shocked about? Why?

399
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,700
So this is why.

400
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,340
That is why he...

401
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:23,460
He? Do you mean Prince Yeoning?

402
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,750
So that was what you wanted to know?

403
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,940
Yes, you are right. It was Prince Yeoning.

404
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,970
I was just the middle person carrying out his requests.

405
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,030
Since you would need it to make ends meet, he asked not to give you hard work

406
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,080
but to pay you well.

407
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,500
Then, the one who tried to help Lord Moon Soo...

408
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,620
I don't know about that, actually.

409
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:56,900
But the Prince Yeoning I know would have done it.

410
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,270
But why?

411
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,930
A touch of conscience

412
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,540
or to ease his guilt for betraying us?

413
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,210
From a displeased perspective, sure.

414
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,440
But I think it's different if you want to see his sincerity.

415
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,600
What do you mean by sincerity?

416
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,440
Please speak so that I can understand you.

417
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,490
That's no fun.

418
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,140
I heard that you were a very skilled damo, so find out for yourself.

419
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,410
Hey, look. How can you just leave like this?

420
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,720
Prince Yeoning...

421
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,340
I don't know much about it, but I think he is up to something dangerous.

422
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:46,330
Something he is staking his life on, something very difficult.

423
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,050
This is all I can do,

424
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,610
but you or Lord Park Moon Soo may be able to help him.

425
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,330
And I think you will be able to see his sincerity.

426
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,440
♫  An unimaginably painful dream  ♫

427
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,220
 Please ease things for Yeo Ji.

428
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,370
 Her actions and words are different from those of ordinary women,

429
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,850
 so she is a bit of a bungler with the ways of the world.

430
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,840
 Why not meet her and fix her misunderstanding?

431
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,810
 She seems to resent you.

432
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,620
 Seeing each other will be painful for both of us.

433
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,980
 Then just forget.

434
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,190
 If you pretend to not know, at least your mind will be at ease.

435
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,660
 I want to do that, but my feelings just won't stop.

436
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,920
 I want to forget her.

437
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,880
 I really want to, but...

438
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,450
 I'm envious.

439
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,630
 He thinks about you.

440
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,450
 He doesn't just feel sorry for you, as he does for me.

441
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:12,180
♫  I cannot erase  ♫

442
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:24,150
