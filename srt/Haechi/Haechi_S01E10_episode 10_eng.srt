1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:14,340

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,740
Joon Jae, you should bow to your father.

3
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,880
And then right after, even his wife passed away.

4
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:49,020
Lord Jeong Seok and Lady, too... The bastards as good as killed them both.

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,760
But after all that, we can't do anything.

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,510
How does that make sense?

7
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,410
- Until when must weâ€” 
- Stop it. We're in front of Hyung-nim's ancestral tablet.

8
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,930
That's why I'm speaking up. To speak for our lord who was wrongfully accused!

9
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,570
I told you to stop.

10
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,900
There are moments when you need to endure even if it means you have to bite down on your lips until they bleed.

11
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,940
Even if you feel like you'll go crazy out of anger,

12
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,390
until you gain the power to be able to do something.

13
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,030
My Lord.

14
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,170
Lord, please calm down.

15
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,950
The memorial service hasn't ended yet.

16
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,400

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,660
Lord Moon Soo.

18
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,400
Lord Moon Soo.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,370
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,790
Joon Jae is around,

21
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,460
so I can't be like this but...

22
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,150
But... Even though I endure and live, I can't stand it.

23
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,640
Anger wells up in my heart!

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
This world seems like such bullshit.

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,950
Hyung-nim Jeong Seok passed away so unfairly like that, but those bastards still live so well.

26
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,450
And Prince Yeoning...

27
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,620
I heard he's like that, too. He forgot it all and is living well.

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,470
When our hyung-nim died because of him...

29
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,570
That bastard lives on as if nothing happened!

30
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,050
So what?

31
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,320
However he lives, why does it matter to us?

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,550
I have ears to listen with too, so I know

33
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,820
how Prince Yeoning Lee Geum is doing.

34
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,440
To survive somehow, he's looking for a rope to hold on to.

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,210
A rope like Wi Byeong Joo at that.

36
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,730
A bastard like that.

37
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,880
Are you okay?

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,500
Here. The thing you asked for.

39
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,930
So forget Prince Yeoning, My Lord.

40
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,290
Yeo Ji.

41
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,370
The reason he lives is different than ours.

42
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,740
Hwon,

43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,740
it's already been this long

44
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,740
since I started to live this way.

45
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,350
Okay, okay, brushes for sale!

46
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,190
Please, let me get first place. Gosh.

47
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,910
Why are there so many people?

48
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,870
Do they have nothing to do that they're taking the exam?

49
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,230
But half of these people are those who came to grab a seat for the test-takers.

50
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,620
You know, those who get paid to grab a good seat for someone else at the exam site.

51
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,190
Wow, look at their build.

52
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,600
Makes sense. The location of your seat is important.

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,590
You have to sit as close to the front as you can to look at the question earlier and write down your answer.

54
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,700
They don't even look at late submissions.

55
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,560
That's how I failed last time.

56
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,870
Of course, you would have ten reasons for your ten failures.

57
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,870
Oh, it'll become 11 now.

58
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,900
Gosh, you!

59
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,580
You jerk! It's because I don't do anything illegal and take the exam fairly.

60
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,940
Do you surrender?

61
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,190
What is this person doing?

62
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,530
Hey you, what are you doing right now?

63
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,790
How could you cut in line in broad daylight?

64
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,030
Are you talking to me?

65
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,980
I looked and there was an open spot, so I came and stood. Is that not allowed?

66
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,120
Stay.

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,420
Yes, it is an open spot.

68
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,010
We will open the doors to the examination site!

69
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,460
The doors are opened!

70
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,340
I'll go, Ah Bong. Let's hope to meet again alive.

71
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,990
- Aigoo.
- Out of my way!

72
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,180
No! I have to go!

73
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,710

74
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,970
- Get out of my way!
 - Aigoo!

75
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,650
Aigoo.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,930
You there!

77
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,590
Come this way!

78
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,310
You are...

79
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,330
Get up!

80
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,160
This way. Out of my way!

81
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,200
Here. Over here.

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,890
It's this way. Come this way.

83
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,690
- Come this way!
 - Put some strength into your legs.

84
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,190
This way. Over here.

85
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,230
Get off!

86
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,970
- Here. Sit on this seat.
 - Sit here.

87
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,010
- Me?
 - You're lucky.

88
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,940
- I hired people to get two good seats.
 - Yes, over here.

89
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,000
And what timing! That's when I saw you.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,090
- What are you doing? Quickly, take a seat.
 - Sit down.

91
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:21,850
No. I am thankful, but I will decline. This is illegal.

92
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,440
What are you talking about? Everyone else does it.

93
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,850
Just because everyone does something that breaks a law, it doesn't mean that action becomes legal.

94
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,220
I am studying to make a world where the law wins, so...

95
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,920
Good luck.

96
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,180
He-He-Hey!

97
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,170
Hey!

98
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,960
This can't happen.

99
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,500
Lord.

100
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,420
I told you to speak informally.

101
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,400
I apologize.

102
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,460
There is no worse chaos than this.

103
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,990
There will be many cheaters so look around secretly.

104
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,390
Yes.

105
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,570
You caught the man I asked for right away.

106
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,460
As expected, the back streets of Hanyang are in your hands.

107
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,660
You realized that Norons had to do with the prison break.

108
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,130
You have keen eyes.

109
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,970
I could see through things before, too. It wasn't useful so I chose not to look.

110
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,750
Did you find a use for it now?

111
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,450
Perhaps. Even if I found a use, I don't want to tell you.

112
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,180
Even if our relationship is no longer awkward,

113
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,690
I haven't forgotten that you're Min Jin Heon's dog.

114
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,740
It seems like you are spending money for something else too, through Goon Tae.

115
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,540
Isn't it about time you stepped forward?

116
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,830
The damo and that lord named Park Moon Soo have a deep misunderstanding about you.

117
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,300
It's not a misunderstanding. It's the truth.

118
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,720
I betrayed them.

119
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,960
Both of them faced large consequences for believing in someone like me.

120
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,160
Let's stop with the small talk. I'll be off now.

121
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,070
The state of affairs will become very loud soon.

122
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,930
I don't know how you decided to use yourself,

123
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,370
but for when it happens, you might want to hurry.

124
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,340
What do you mean the state of affairs will become loud?

125
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,160
The king's morality causes him to act upon his filial duty without fail.

126
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,310
A mother gains honor through her son as loyalty is more important than any other thing, as a human being.

127
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,200
Your Excellency.

128
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,820
Just what is going on?

129
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,110
Which crazy person is creating a situation?

130
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,770
Your Majesty, I bow down and plead that you select a noble title for your mother,

131
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,850
fulfill your righteous duty, and raise your dignity.

132
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,930
This...

133
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,190
Your Majesty, the one who died without reason,

134
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,640
your mother, Jang Hui Bin, please reinstate her status!

135
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,830
 Jang Hui Bin?

136
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,380
 Are the Sorons deliberately invoking the Hui Bin incident?

137
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,070

138
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,570
 This will inevitably result in war between Noron and Soron.

139
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,890
That person's petition is outrageous!

140
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:50,050
You must burn his petition and kill him right away.

141
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,840
Please grant  my request.

142
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,650
Please grant the request!

143
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,350
Please grant my request.

144
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,370
Please grant the request!

145
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,010
If that is the case,

146
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,280
next comes...

147
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,990
What comes next will be...

148
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,930
What does His Majesty intend to do?

149
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,960
Today, he didn't even say that he will take our words into consideration, as he always does.

150
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,620
No matter how much power Noron gets, the throne is still the king's.

151
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,950
Would he be pushed away without a fight?

152
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,380
So does he intend to fight us? How?

153
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:39,040
What can't he do when he knows it means death if he falls off the throne?

154
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,330
The heir. The time has come for us to decide who the heir to the throne will be.

155
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,390
What? The heir?

156
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:55,060
I am saying that we Norons must decide who the heir will be.

157
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,930
It is no longer just Norons.

158
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,360
Sorons will also try to support their own heir.

159
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,330
The heir? Already?

160
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,250
It is for the next one to sit on the throne.

161
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,320
If the heir is selected by Norons, His Majesty will be in danger.

162
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,250
If Sorons select the heir, they can protect the king's authority.

163
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,860
The queen is already looking for a son to adopt.

164
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,270
This is Prince Ancheong's second son, Prince Hyeonryeong.

165
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,540
The third son of Prince Gwangmin...

166
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,590
Hurry and throw open the gate to welcome the Dashing King.

167
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,580
When the Dashing King comes, there's no need to offer him any grains.

168
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,840
These are the words that were spread among the citizens during Li Zicheng's Rebellion.

169
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,700
It was to create expectations in the people for this rebellion.

170
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,030
But in the end, Li Zicheng did not achieve his objectives

171
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,130
and that song became false,

172
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:02,290
because Li Zicheng did not have enough ability nor people on his side to accomplish it.

173
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,090
He was in the same position as me.

174
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,660
In order to achieve one's objective,

175
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,090
one must have the capacity and a supporting organization, first of all.

176
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:18,380
But neither myself nor Soron has such power.

177
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,050
Your Majesty.

178
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,090
When you are not sufficient on your own,

179
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,060
you need to either use your opponent's power

180
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,760
or find an alliance.

181
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,610
Right, someone who can fill the gap for me.

182
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,850
I need an alliance.

183
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,760
Do I have any reason to enter the palace? I need to enter the palace urgently.

184
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,250
Do you mean right now?

185
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,390
I do need someone to guide some royal clan members to the queen's quarters.

186
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,890
Right. The queen is adopting an heir.

187
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,300
But you have to go to Mohwa Hall now, Your Highness.

188
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,290
To Mohwa Hall?  Why there?

189
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,970
You need to welcome the Qing's envoy.

190
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,570
Why do I need to do that? There are other royal clan members...

191
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,530
The thing is, they requested you.

192
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,090
Me?

193
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,540
Who requested me?

194
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,550

(Where envoys from China are received and entertained)

195
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,070

196
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,440
Hyung-nim, it's been a while!

197
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,050
You... Tan.

198
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,390
Even from the Qing, I heard the news of you taking a position at the Royal Clan Management Office and becoming a human.

199
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,170
So it is true. I was really surprised.

200
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,940
No way... You are the one who called me out through the envoy?

201
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,260
I got acquainted with the upper-class people in Qing.

202
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,150
There's nothing money can't do.

203
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,780
I wanted to see you first.

204
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,940
For real. For the past year,

205
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,000
I haven't forgotten you for even one day.

206
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,320
Remove your dirty hand. It's disgusting.

207
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,880
Do you remember?

208
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,660
My fight ends when I win the battle.

209
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:58,110
I am going to become the king, Prince Yeoning. That's why I came back.

210
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,230
No. Don't you think you'll die by my hands before that?!

211
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,070
Calm down, or you might regret this later.

212
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,950
Just... what are you up to?

213
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,760
I told you, I will become the king.

214
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,460
I am all done with my preparation to be the next king.

215
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,110
I heard all the women who ate raw silkworms bore children.

216
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,560
Boys at that.

217
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,400
You must produce an heir for you and for His Majesty.

218
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,210
I saw you meet the young princes earlier.

219
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,960
If I can't get pregnant despite all my efforts,

220
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,930
then I'll have to adopt a reliable prince.

221
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,090
That will ensure His Majesty's safety, don't you think?

222
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,590
Your Highness, you're here.

223
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,260
That queen bi*ch whined after eating a silkworm,

224
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,210
I swallowed it too, to show her it's nothing.

225
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,690
That's why you are my partner, being so ferocious.

226
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,200
It was hard to convince that bi*ch.

227
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,240
You can do it well, right?

228
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,520
You should be next to me when I am seated on the throne, right?

229
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,290
As this country's new queen that is.

230
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,100
 I told you, I will become the king.

231
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,230
 I am all done with my preparation to be the next king.

232
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,940
What does he mean by the next king?

233
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,440
Tan...

234
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,240
did you perhaps...

235
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,570

236
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,400
Your Highness, no matter how urgent, for you to come to Saheonbu is a bit...

237
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,160
Do you think I came without any excuse?

238
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,200
It's a request for a corruption investigation related to the Royal Clan Management Office.

239
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,270
Let's say we discussed that.

240
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,540
No way. It's not even possible.

241
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,510
There's no way Lord Min Jin Heon and the Norons will allow it.

242
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,500
What if Prince Milpoong brought a supporter who can force it upon us?

243
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,820
I don't care if you believe it or not...

244
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,060
but at least tell this to His Excellency Min Jin Heon.

245
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,920
So before he is put in a hard spot,

246
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,970
tell him to come to find me.

247
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,830
I'll contact you as soon as possible.

248
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,930
I'll be waiting.

249
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,630
Who has such guts to dare to trespass into Saheonbu?

250
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,950
Yeo Ji, why are you here?

251
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,550

252
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,200
Is it because of Inspector Hanâ€”

253
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,730
It's nothing that concerns you, Your Highness.

254
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,180
Who's there? Who's inside?

255
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,990

256
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,030
What's going on?

257
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,520
I heard something strange coming from the archives.

258
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
What?

259
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,700
Move aside.

260
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,460
Shh! Hide quickly.

261
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,320
Who's in there? Who is it?

262
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,430
You surprised me. What's going on?

263
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,370
Prince Yeoning.

264
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,930
Why didn't you make any noise? You scared me.

265
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,540
I'm sorry. But why is Your Highness here?

266
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,410
Why? I can't be?

267
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:51,420
That is... not without permission.

268
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,890
I see. Then I'll come back with Chief Inspector Wi's permission. I didn't know.

269
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,980
Yeo Ji.

270
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,360
 Hide quickly.

271
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,950
Prince Yeoning, why...

272
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,840
Why did you help me?

273
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,070
Really? Are you sure that guy was paid off?

274
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,000
Remember how you said that there was a weird scholar at the exam site?

275
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,800
The one who saved a seat for you and later even tried to show you his answer.

276
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,290
Yes, what about him?

277
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,190
Who are we? We used to be assistant investigators working for Saheonbu.

278
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,910
We caught him.

279
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,640
He said he was paid by someone to help you.

280
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,470
Why? Who would do something like that for me?

281
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,330
Well...

282
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,540
What are you talking about?

283
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,790
Who was paid to help Lord Moon Soo?

284
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,190
Prince Milpoong? Prince Milpoong is back?

285
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,740
Yes. Also, according to Prince Yeoning,

286
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,280
he is certain that Prince Milpoong has a trick up his sleeve that the Norons cannot beat.

287
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,650
You're good at getting to know people.

288
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,060
Prince Yeoning? You hang around with such a person?

289
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,660
I've closely watched over Prince Yeoning for a while.

290
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,560
He has the eyes to accurately read the flow of the state of affairs andâ€”

291
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,330
It's not the right time for that. Surely there is something else you must take care of?

292
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,790
The prisoners that escaped. The job I trusted you with.

293
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,000
Your Excellency, without a problem, I willâ€”

294
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,160
Yes, you will need to take care of it without a problem

295
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,720
if we don't want you or me or the Norons to face trouble.

296
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,750
I will keep that in mind.

297
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,660
I have to head over to the party held for the Chinese envoys.

298
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,270
Yes.

299
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,010
Prince Milpoong?

300
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,650
How tiring.

301
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,150
Envoys in this state of affairs right now?

302
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:48,840
That girl. Why is that girl with the queen?

303
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,410
Oh, Yoon Yeong? What do you mean why?

304
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,940
She asked me to introduce her to the queen,

305
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,370
saying that if she got close to the queen, it would help me as well.

306
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,390
What did you say?

307
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,900
Minister of Interior, she is skilled even though she may not look like it.

308
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,660
She quickly turned the queen to her side.

309
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,710
Prime Minister!

310
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,040
What did you do?

311
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,080
Don't you know who that girl is?

312
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,230
Wh-Why are you being like this?

313
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,450
It can't be.

314
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,450
It can't be.

315
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,840
His Majesty has arrived.

316
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,540

317
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,990
Your Majesty, it's an honor to meet you.

318
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,580
Welcome, Envoy. You took great efforts to come here.

319
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,330
It wasn't too hard.

320
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,700
I had good company while traveling.

321
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,240
Company while traveling?

322
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,180
Your Majesty.

323
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,350
I, Prince Milpoong, am here to pay respects.

324
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,930
Prince Milpoong?

325
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,140
How did this happen? Why is Prince Milpoong here?

326
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,370
Your Majesty, have you been well?

327
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:40,430
This unfaithful, humble servant came only now to pay respects, Your Majesty.

328
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,300
No way...

329
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,840
No way. Was this it?

330
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,260
Prince Milpoong, you will

331
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,060
use the queen as your promoter,

332
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,400
and using China as your support,

333
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,720
you plan to become the king's adopted son?

334
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,440
Oh no.

335
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,730
There are times when even Your Excellency makes such a face.

336
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,550
Prince Yeoning.

337
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,100
Your head must be hurting

338
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,520
since you were the one who gave and then took away the throne from Prince Milpoong.

339
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,480
That's why I asked you to look for me earlier.

340
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,290
Didn't I warn you through a messenger?

341
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,860
What is it that you want to say?

342
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,520
You didn't come forward just to brag.

343
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,440
Don't you need a prince, Your Excellency?

344
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,240
One that will become a pawn-like king on the chessboard.

345
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,510
That kind of prince, I mean.

346
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,840

347
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,380
â™«  You whom I love  â™«

348
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,010
â™«  Become the moonlight  â™«

349
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,980
 What are you up to? Why are you interfering here?

350
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,060
 Their weaknesses are in the palm of my hand.

351
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,380
 You are investigating corruption related to the civil service exam.

352
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,660
 Your Majesty!

353
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,370
 Will you be able to reveal the truth?

354
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,110
 Do you believe that that is all it takes to bring down the Noron Faction?

355
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,470
 Look here, Your Highness... What are you up to?

356
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,590
 - This was it.
 - He finally...

357
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,040
 So this was your target from the beginning?

358
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,520
 Just what are you trying to do, Your Highness?

359
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,590
 I've waited for this day for so long.

360
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,390
 Since pottery that's cracked will break more easily.

361
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,870
 Prince Milpoong will first shake up the Norons for me.

362
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,100
â™«  I break down inside of you  â™«
