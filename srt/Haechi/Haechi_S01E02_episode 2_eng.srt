1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,110
His Majesty will personally give it to Prince Milpoong.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,780
What is its content?

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,420
He will unlock the chain fettering Prince Milpoong first.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,100
That way, he will be able to disentangle the complicated political situation with us Norons.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,600
I have decided to right the wrongs suffered by Royal Consort Kang, Prince Milpoong's great-grandmother,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,000
and restore her status.
  (She was deemed a traitor by late King Injo)

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,660
Your Majesty!

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,980
Accordingly, let Crown Prince Sohyeon's Royal Consort Kang's posthumous name be Minhoe

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,700
and transfer and enshrine her mortuary tablet in Crown Prince Sohyeon's shrine.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,960
Your order will be carried out, Your Majesty.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,800
Your Majesty, your royal grace is infinite!

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,220
 Your Highness!  Your Highness the Crown Prince!

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,500
What do you mean by restoring Prince Milpoong's great-grandmother's royal consort status?

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,600
Your Majesty, what is your intention?

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,770
You do not mean to depose the crown prince, right?

16
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,170
You do not mean to put Prince Milpoong in that seat...

17
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,580
It is not your place to intervene.

18
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,060
However, Your Majesty...

19
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,670
Are you saying I should just let the royal line of succession fall to pieces?

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,000

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,280
Hwon.

22
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,460
Your Highness, Prince Yeonryeong!

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,310
Congratulations, Your Highness.

24
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,430
Your long-cherished desire has been granted.

25
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,370
You will walk the royal road in the future.

26
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,180
Isn't it a natural outcome?  The nation's foundation has been regained.

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,160
Your Highness, make haste and leave the palace.

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,570
I have contacted everyone in a hurry to discuss today's development.

29
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,900
You don't need to worry about me.

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,150
Hurry and go.

31
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:00,460

32
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,780
To where should I escort you?

33
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,120
Let's go to Jeongdong.

34
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,650
Yes.

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,300
You are late.  I thought you'd come right away.

36
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,950
I stopped by the palace briefly.

37
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,990
Oh, didn't someone come here—

38
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,930
 Who do you think you are, to dare to look me in the eye?

39
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,850
Eyes... and then mouth...

40
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,130
All right, then, should I rip that mouth of yours now?

41
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,610
Would that be okay with you?  Since I couldn't wash for days, it will smell rancid.

42
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,240
You lowly thing!  How has a filthy wench like you found its way to my house?

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,600
If you want to talk about lowliness,

44
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,530
who in Hanyang  (capital)  can beat me?

45
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,470
In my opinion, this girl has found a perfect place for herself.

46
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,300
Isn't that so, My Lady? That low, filthy blood runs in my veins too.

47
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,710
All right, play.

48
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,480
Play as you've been playing.

49
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,500
No matter what is happening in the world, whoever becomes the next king,

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,770
that's all you have to do.

51
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,520
But you should have brushed off the dust outside of home.

52
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,890
At least the royal clan and noble families of this country

53
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,570
take gisaengs as their mistresses, not a lowborn like this one from the streets.

54
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,550
Are you a prince?

55
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,060
Be understanding.

56
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,220
She's a daughter of a noble family but had to marry a guy like me for political reasons.

57
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,800
She suffered mental pain.

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,510
She seems obnoxious to begin with.  I can tell at a glance.

59
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,620
You're fine, from the way your mouth works.

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,080
But you are a real prince?

61
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,660
Just half.

62
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,960
Because my mother was from the lowest class.

63
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,260
I think I've heard about this.

64
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,710
The current king became smitten by some slave girl in the palace and...

65
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,980
Water maid.  She fetched water in the palace.

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,310
Oh, yeah, that's right, a water maid.

67
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,690
But that had never happened before. They were just playthings.

68
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,690
A lowborn who's not even a court lady had never been made the king's mistress before.

69
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,820
- Not a mistress but a royal concubine. 
- Eyes or eyeballs, the same thing.

70
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,220
That is right.

71
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,950
A prince or a bastard, the same thing.  I am that lowly prince.

72
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,950
Gross.

73
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:08,300
But I've heard that the lowly prince is not treated with much respect.

74
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,600
Because he is neither a prince nor a subject, he is not accepted anywhere.

75
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,330
I see that I am rather famous.

76
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,730
So are you disappointed?

77
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,520
No.  It worked out well.

78
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,870
Since you have nobody to play with, you'll seek out only me.

79
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,980
That's why you didn't throw me away.

80
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,010
Because I am a lowly wench, you pitied me.

81
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,250
How long will this meeting last?

82
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,490
Do these people catch criminals with their mouths rather than with their legs?

83
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,890
Since there is an unusual development in the palace, their side will definitely make moves.  More—

84
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,360
Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim Jeong Seok! I am here.

85
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,470
- Still?
 - I've been waiting.

86
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,470
Aigoo, what have I told you?

87
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,550
He is a born dog.  Once latched onto something, he won't let go.

88
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,110
His biggest issue is that his intellect is also that of a dog.

89
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,800
Wow, Park Moon Soo, what kind of person on earth are you—

90
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,390
Surely he is a repeat offender.

91
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,850
With the money he got paid, that gigolo-looking guy bought and rides around on a frightfully expensive horse.

92
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,890
His excuse for failing the exam this time around is this, a gigolo.

93
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,410
He does look off-putting, though.

94
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,110
You already reported him to the Saheonbu  (Office of Inspector General)  and made a facial composite as well.

95
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,020
It will be assigned to the right inspector tomorrow.

96
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,070
By then, he will have run off all the way to Pyeongyang.

97
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,060
If you're really busy, Hyung-nim, at least show me the family register.

98
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,790
Noh Tae Pyeong, 52 years old. I'm sure I saw the word Hanyang too.

99
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,590
That's an abuse of power and is illegal.  How many times have I told you?

100
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,930
Going by due process, we will lose the criminal, Hyung-nim.

101
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,280
I know your aspirations are uncommon.

102
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,140
That's why I cherish you.

103
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,590
However, pursue those aspirations when you become an officer of the Saheonbu by fair means.

104
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,710
Hyung-nim!

105
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,030
I better go now.

106
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, my wife asked after you.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,910
She seemed like she'd prepare you some repast.  So drop by one of these days.

108
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,570
But, Hyung-nim, that food is not important...

109
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,770
After calling you a cherished hoobae  (junior) , he is cruel to you.

110
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,870
Telling a person who's failed the exam 11 times to pass it first...  Such cruelty.

111
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,260
It's only been 10 times so far.

112
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,590
Do you have to taste poo to know it is poo?

113
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,500
Isn't there a way?

114
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,400
Can't you two help me out?

115
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,780
Aigoo, we have no leftover energy.

116
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,220
Don't you know our inspector's case is awfully big?

117
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,030
Jang Dal, what's big or small when it comes to a case?

118
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,840
That's right!  Yeo Ji!

119
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,800
Huh?

120
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,100
Why is Yeo Ji, the macho man, not showing her face?

121
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,340
Whatever the case, she will go at it with fire in her eyes.

122
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,440
The alcohol bottle grows ever smaller when you're paying the same money.

123
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,550
Small?  These are small?

124
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,430
Oh, I see...  This size is considered small.

125
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,640
I've never taken an interest in this before.

126
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,330
Is the size very small?

127
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,890
They must be as least that big

128
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,890
for me to be allowed in that room.

129
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,530
What is it?

130
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,620
Nothing.

131
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,420
I was just drinking.  Really.

132
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,980
Then drink the alcohol.

133
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,540
Ah, I should steal a few tangerines from somewhere.

134
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,260
His Excellency Min ordered the girls out?  Why?

135
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,730
Since they will talk about something important, he ordered them out today.

136
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,120
So particular.

137
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,050
Why come to a gisaeng house then?  We should've just exchanged letters.

138
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,740
Your Excellency.

139
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,260
This way.

140
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,290
Here.

141
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,660
If redressing Royal Consort Kang's wrongs has been confirmed,

142
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,390
doesn't that mean His Majesty has made up his mind?

143
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,320
He will hand down the throne to Prince Milpoong.

144
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,820
But will it go without any problems?

145
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,560
As you know, the inspectors of the Saheonbu gathered at my house last night and did yadasi—

146
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,040
I know.  I've heard that a cocky inspector from the Saheonbu

147
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,140
is investigating a few murder cases,

148
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,960
and he is suspecting Prince Milpoong.

149
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,260
I pressured the police bureau to stop it and

150
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,270
am suffering this humiliation at the hands of the inspectors of the Saheonbu.

151
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,530
There is a limit to how much I can rein in the Saheonbu.

152
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,600
But suspicion is just suspicion.

153
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,920
Nothing has been proven yet.

154
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,110
That is right.  Prince Milpoong is the worst son of a bitch and scoundrel under the sun.

155
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,800
He also has many weak points.  However, weak points are not necessarily bad.

156
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,250
Because of those, Prince Milpoong will become

157
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,480
a king who speaks the same language as we do.

158
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,570
Distressed, so distressed...

159
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,840
Why?  Who's here?

160
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,600
Minister of the Interior.

161
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,200
About that case...

162
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,330
Of course I don't believe it was Prince Milpoong,

163
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,420
but the vibe is somewhat...

164
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,670
So?

165
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,130
As the head of the Saheonbu, I have to uphold my reputation.

166
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,980
I can't keep on stalling them.

167
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,870
There is an inspector named Wi Byeong Joo at the Saheonbu.

168
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,170
Wi Byeong Joo? You mean, that Namin Faction member?

169
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,690
Appoint him the lead inspector.

170
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,270
He will take care of headaches for us.

171
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,360
Prince Milpoong?  Are you saying the substitute exam taking I did was at the order of Tan?

172
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,250
That is what I am saying!

173
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,190
Why would Prince Milpoong do it, though?  Who was the person he had to make pass the exam?

174
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,470
How would I know the reason why a crazy bastard does a crazy thing

175
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,150
when I am normal?

176
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,500
You know Prince Milpoong's personality.

177
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,470
If things go wrong, we are dead.

178
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,240
Prince Milpoong does not know that you are the substitute exam-taker.

179
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,690
How on earth can you mismanage things this way!

180
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,420
You have heard the rumor about Tan's "Record of the Dead," right?

181
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:20,980
You know how dead bodies pile up around Prince Milpoong Tan!

182
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,990
"Record of the Dead"?

183
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,790
He kills people and records the number of dead bodies.

184
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,700
Is that what it means?

185
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,430
It's a rumor.  It could just be a tale told among gossipmongers.

186
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,610
However, that notably many people died around Prince Milpoong

187
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,500
is definitely a fact.

188
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,220
What do I do?

189
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,030
I have to hold it in.  Holding it in is the right thing to do.

190
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,890
Dear Bodhisattva of Great Compassion...

191
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,510
Prince Milpoong's estate steward was the first one, four years ago.

192
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,660
It was right after he visited the police bureau

193
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,160
to expose Prince Milpoong's wrongdoings.

194
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,520
After that, a bodyguard of Prince Milpoong and that bodyguard's wife...

195
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,660
The policeman investigating the case committed suicide.

196
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,560
A little while ago, a young widow raped and pregnant by Prince Milpoong died.

197
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,230
Even her elder sister...

198
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,320
 Look here!

199
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,890
The police officer pursuing the case also lost his life in the end.

200
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,770
 Practicing the profound Prajnaparamita, Avalokiteshvara illuminated the Five Skandhas and saw that they are all empty.

201
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,990
  O Shariputra, form is emptiness. Emptiness is form.

202
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,090
  (continuing to chant the Heart Sutra)

203
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,990
But I am no Buddha.

204
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,630
How can I hold it in?

205
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,530
When insects crawl up on you if you talk to them nicely!

206
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,630
They say there is no ghost who's died after getting everything off his chest.

207
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,070
But here is one bastard.

208
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,660
 I will overlook your murder of my niece,

209
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,310
 but please help me pass the civil service exam.

210
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,640
 Thinking it over, I need to receive some money, too.

211
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,440
When his widowed child niece died, carrying a baby no less,

212
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,880
a sad excuse of an uncle comes to me asking for a government position in return for silence,

213
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,480
asking me for money...

214
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,210
What a son of a bitch he is.

215
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,000
If I told him that I would let him pass the exam, that ought to have been enough.

216
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,750
Why did he keep whining for more?  So unscrupulous...

217
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,090
Hey, what was this jackass's name again?

218
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,630
Noh... What was it?

219
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,390
Tae Pyeong?

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,210
The reason you are telling me this is to warn me?

221
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:19,800
If it is true, that means Prince Milpoong wipes out anything in his path.

222
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,540
In his path... Do you mean the throne?

223
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,440
Palace politics is none of my business.

224
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,030
However, I am in charge of this case.

225
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,750
I will look out, too, but Your Highness must be vigilant yourself.

226
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,790
You have not called it a day yet?

227
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,580
You must be a damo  (tea maid, female investigator)  belonging to Inspector Han?

228
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,010
Your name is?

229
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,750
I am Yeo Ji.

230
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,980
Are you here to see My Lord Inspector?

231
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,010
I stopped by to have a drink with him, but he must have been one step ahead of me.

232
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,070
I will tell him that you came by.

233
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,150
I'd appreciate it.  Work hard.

234
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,100
By the way, your hairdo...

235
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,490
I just tried wearing it up.

236
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,570
Women wearing their hair up looked so pretty.

237
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,440
Please overlook it.

238
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,660
All right.

239
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,730
"Record of the Dead"?

240
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,370
But knowing how crazy that bastard is...

241
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,380
But Noh Tae Pyeong's substitute exam taking...

242
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,170
For what?

243
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,250
Here you are.

244
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,450
But why a bow, all of a sudden?

245
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,270
Milpoong is holding a hunting match in Yangjoo today.

246
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,720
What?

247
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,460
Why?

248
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,140
He means to celebrate Royal Consort Kang's restoration and show off his political might.

249
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,940
He is ever so anxious to brag.

250
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,010
That is not what I mean.  Why would Your Highness go there?

251
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,400
You never go to such events.

252
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,740
Because I'm curious

253
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,710
about that bastard Tan's ulterior motive, what he's scheming.

254
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,060
You must be worried about Prince Yeonryeong.

255
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,540
- And you're worried about me?
 - You must not put yourself in harm's way.

256
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,970
I've done that all my life.  Such nagging...

257
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,650
Help me with this.

258
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,100
Yes.

259
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,350
Nothing to nitpick.  She puts up a hair knot better than any man.

260
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,070
Just one more stroke to "Yeo Ji"   (여지)   will make it "Yeo Ja"   (여자  Korean for woman) .

261
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,490
What a shame that she lacked that one stroke.

262
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,890
Yeo Ji, are you all ready?

263
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,750
Yes, Sir.  All the preparations have been made.

264
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,620
Danger lurks in every corner.  Will you be all right?

265
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,450
Considering how hard it has been for you to get to this point,

266
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,740
I must catch Prince Milpoong without fail.

267
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,950
From what I've eavesdropped on at the gisaeng house last night,

268
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,070
Norons seem to know about Prince Milpoong's crimes too.

269
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,440
Even though they know, they are busy covering them up for him.

270
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,350
It's so obvious.  Who can deny it?

271
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,080
That's why they are trash.

272
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,320
Such a ruffian is about to become this nation's king.

273
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,230
We must sneak out his "Record of the Dead."

274
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,150
You must take caution.

275
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,890
Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim Moon Soo!

276
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,990
Ah Bong!

277
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,810
Over here!

278
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,130
Did you bring it?

279
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,040
You know I'm dead if I get caught, right?

280
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,730
I know.

281
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,100
This is illegal. This won't do.

282
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,170
- Wait. 
- Hyung-nim!

283
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,070
If you don't hand it to me, you'll die first by me.

284
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,730
- Give it, punk!
 - Here.

285
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,350
Punk.

286
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,410
You should put that spirit to studies. Then you would've passed the test in first place a hundred times by now.

287
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,810
There you are, 52-year-old Noh Tae Pyeong.

288
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,800
My deep condolences to you first, you punk!

289
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,110
You are indeed Prince Milpoong!

290
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,850
A hunting entourage of this grand magnitude is a first!

291
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,270
But our Prince Milpoong is someone who only does the best in anything he does.

292
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,780
Since he's the future king, what else do you expect?

293
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,000
It's true! True!

294
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,000
Whoever it is, the one who catches the biggest animal

295
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,380
will get a special gold toad with my name engraved on it.

296
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,180
Here, let's go!

297
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,100
Crazy punk.

298
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,070
He pays money to hire a substitute test-taker when he lives in these conditions?

299
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,400
Did he sell his wife?

300
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:28,770
What? He ran off already, after getting caught by me!

301
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,010
He's gone. Gone.

302
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,650
Well, not everyone who hires a substitute test-taker makes it.

303
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,610
He got caught by me red-handed so he took off.

304
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,610
If I can't catch Noh Tae Pyeong, then what about the pimp?

305
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,190
It's so great!

306
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,240
Right?

307
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,340
 Prince Milpoong is now just...

308
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,460
 Often.

309
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,190
 Try this.

310
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,430
 Great!

311
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,580
 It's delicious.

312
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,700
Pardon me.

313
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,520
Here you go.

314
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,190
 What is it?

315
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,300
 Nothing.

316
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,810
 I was just drinking. Really.

317
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,760
It's fine. Continue on your way.

318
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,080
Look here.

319
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,690
By chance, is Prince Milpoong over there in the tent below?

320
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,920
What is it?

321
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,490
What is it? What happened?

322
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,940
The poster. The roster of those who passed the state exam.

323
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,300
Already?

324
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,210
Wait. Let me see it.

325
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,000
Wait.

326
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,460
Please. It's fine if it's last place too, so please just put my name on it once.

327
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,690
 First place: Noh Tae Pyeong.

328
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,900
It's there.

329
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,730
It's here.

330
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,480
Noh Tae Pyeong.

331
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,770
First place?

332
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,630
You're reckless.

333
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,960
No matter what an idiot Prince Milpoong is, he's not that dumb.

334
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,320
You can't open it with just a thing like that, I mean.

335
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,050
It's better to just take the whole thing away.

336
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,280
I'm curious too, about what's in it.

337
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,050
Move aside, please.

338
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,940
If it's money you need, I'll give it to you so put that down.

339
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,330
Am I a beggar?

340
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,830
Is it uncomfortable? It's better than being a thief.

341
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,220
Fine.

342
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,580
Your effort is admirable.

343
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,330
So about, 20 nyang?

344
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,810
Thirty nyang?

345
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,740
And not 200 or 300 nyang?

346
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,010
Why... trying to fix your life altogether is a bit...

347
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,650
It'll cost quite a bit to treat that, so supplement it with that.

348
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,820
You'll need your male part working, so I went easy on you. Be thankful.

349
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,250
What are you?

350
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,660
What are you to be walking out of there?

351
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,290
Catch him! Now!

352
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,330
You punk!

353
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,070
How strange.

354
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,270
Rats should live in fields,

355
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,820
but a pretty-looking rat lives on the mountain.

356
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,540
Right?

357
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,220
The boy's so cute and so little.

358
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,300
How can I catch him when he's so pitiful?

359
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,270
Then let her go since she's not a boy.

360
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,010
You have pride too, right?

361
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,590
Twisting a girl's wrist is a bit much.

362
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,170
A girl?

363
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,440
Come, Tan. Go at it with me instead.

364
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,110

365
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:47,410

366
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,400
 Catch them!

367
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,060
 It seems both of us have that item as our goal.

368
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,440
 Weren't you chasing after Prince Milpoong because you already knew about his crime?

369
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,980
 You are His Majesty's second son, Prince Yeoning, right?

370
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,010
 - Really?
 - You are a bold girl indeed.

371
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,310
 So you will support Prince Milpoong in the end?

372
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,490
 Don't try to protect Prince Milpoong any longer!

373
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,590
 Where is this wretched informant, whose source nobody knows?!

374
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,860
 Won't you reveal to the world the side of you that I know?

375
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,650
 I'm trying to decide whether I want to get drunk on liquor or drunk on dreams.
