1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,600

2
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,990

3
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,960

4
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,290
How?

5
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,190
How could Cheongju Fortress fall this easily?

6
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,670
Cheongju's General Lee Bong Seong was friends with the rebel leader Lee In Jwa.

7
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,070
While he lowered his guard out of friendship, they were suddenly ambushed.

8
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,430

9
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,170
Look! The general who was resisting was beheaded.

10
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,590
Oh my!

11
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,070
Like this, whoever stands for injustice will die

12
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,940
and whoever stands for the great cause will live in glory.

13
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,810
Wow!

14
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,580
The current king is not a rightful heir.

15
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,950
A low-born water maid gave birth to him.

16
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,500
That seed, whose roots we do not know, murdered the preceding king

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,380
and is pretending to be this nation's owner.

18
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,780
Therefore, we must remove the pretender

19
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,690
and enthrone the real one.

20
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,290
Now all of this nation's people will follow our wise king,

21
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,540
His Highness Prince Milpoong, who is the direct bloodline of Crown Prince Sohyeon.

22
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,740
Your Majesty the King.

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,350
Your Majesty the King.

24
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,340
Your Majesty the King.

25
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,570
Your Majesty the King.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,540

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,590
Your Majesty.

28
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,080
King.

29
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,180
My people, listen!

30
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,130
I will save you who are tired of being exploited.

31
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,400
I will save this nation that has fallen into distress.

32
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,550
It's not just in Cheongju.

33
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,660
Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Hamgyong, all of this nation

34
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,860
will stand together to remove the false king

35
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,580
and greet the true owner!

36
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,820
Your Majesty!

37
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,230
Your Majesty!

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,050
Your Majesty!

39
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,830
Your Majesty!

40
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,440
Your Majesty!

41
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,990
Your Majesty!

42
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,260
Your Majesty.

43
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,540
What about the other locations? How is the situation in other regions right now?

44
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,780
The rebel army is approaching. Quickly raise the beacon of fire!

45
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,140
It's not just in Cheongju, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,710
In Gyeongsang and Jeolla, and Hamgyong and Pyongan,

47
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,920
rebels have risen up at the same time.

48
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,830
Not only Gyeongsang and Jeolla but Hamgyong and Pyongan as well?

49
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,160
Now all of this nation is swept by the rebel fire.

50
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,750
 Lee In Jwa, in the end, he had to...

51
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,790
 To this nation...

52
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,130

53
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,300
- It's a rebellion! A rebellion!
 - Hurry, we need to go!

54
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,170
- Out of my way!
 - I need to go!

55
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,970
A rebellion has started!  Chaos has broken out!

56
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,980
Everyone, go home! Quickly!

57
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,610
This way. Secure the area thoroughly.

58
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,610
Increase security inside and outside of the palace.

59
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,100
Gather all government officials and soldiers immediately.

60
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,460
Yes!

61
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,970
This is the report from the Commander of the Supreme Military Headquarters.

62
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:40,720
In the rebel post, they found a gun that was supplied to Cheongju Government Office.

63
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,340
Fortunately, there weren't that many guns.

64
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,380
It will be problematic going forward.

65
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,630
Gyeongsang was sent more guns in preparation for possible Japanese attacks.

66
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,530
How is it in Gyeongsang Province?

68
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,720
A messenger dispatched to the Gyeongsang region found that

69
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,700
the rebellion headcount is anywhere between 10 to 30 thousand,

70
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,610
and it is continuously increasing.

71
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,430
Why? How is that possible?

72
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,270
They are probably incited.

73
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,040
Gyeongsang region has long been abandoned by the royal court.

74
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,130
They have the highest mistrust for the central government,

75
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,340
so it would have been easy to win them over.

76
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,430
Right State Councilor, send all of the military officers of the Five Divisional Garrisons to Gyeongsang Province.

77
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,830
However, Your Majesty, then the capital will beâ€”

78
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,640
As much as the capital, Gyeongsang is important.

79
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,170
That region is also part of Joseon, isn't it?

80
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,140
Minister of Defense, plan a defensive strategy for the capital in response to this.

81
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,000
Lee In Jwa's army will head straight to the capital.

82
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,520
At this rate, it might be as quick as three, four days.

83
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,190
Within that time, the rebels may arrive at the capital.

84
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,480
Your Majesty.

85
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,720
Do you know...

86
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,450
that this rebellion is the largest one

87
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,850
of the Joseon Dynasty?

88
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,920
In addition, it's the first one

89
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,000
that is targeting a king.

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,180
Your Majesty, but it's not solely due to mistrust in you.

91
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,790
That's right.

92
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,010
It's also that the rebellion triggered the explosion of the people's built-up anger from all their hardships, Your Majesty.

93
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,930
However the current king is me.

94
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,890
Then whatever people say, that responsibility

95
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,110
is mine.

96
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,430
Your Majesty.

97
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,870
Already there are thousands of casualties.

98
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,530
How many more will shed blood?

99
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,970
It's probably because of my disloyalty.

100
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,890
By not being able to trust you,

101
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,040
the one who encouraged disloyalty and resentment was me.

102
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,140
I'm not sure how I can wash away this crime.

103
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,160
Right State Councillor.

104
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,700
Your Majesty, last night

105
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,610
we were able to track down the rebels who were acting secretly inside the palace and the capital.

106
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,040
That alone would have affected them greatly.

107
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,940
Therefore, please postpone self-blame and lamentation.

108
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,120
Right now, we need to overcome this rebellion.

109
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,690
I and the other Norons will go beyond the faction lines

110
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,020
and give our best to overcome this rebellion.

111
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,540
Thank you, Left State Councillor.

112
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,010
Thank you, Right State Councillor.

113
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,330
They say Cheongju Fortress fell.

114
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,380
It's just a matter of time before they get to the capital.

115
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,380
Are we going to all die at this rate?

116
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,640
- What do we do?
 - I don't want to die.

117
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,280
What do you mean what to do?

118
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,550
If you are afraid of death, then you can fight.

119
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,560
What do you mean?  How would we be able to fight?

120
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,410
Then, should I quickly teach you how to hold a sword?

121
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,440
That will be better than being terrified like this.

122
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,510
She is right.

123
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,430

124
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,150
How can we just hide behind and lament because we are women?

125
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:58,700
The ones suffering under the rebels' swords are innocent soldiers and subjects.

126
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,690
And how dare you allow yourselves to be terrified first?

127
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,760
Henceforth, nobody shall wear fearful expressions.

128
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,940
You must not show your fear just because you are women.

129
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,480
Yes, Your Highness.

130
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,090
The military will be deployed soon, right?

131
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,360
This is an emergency.

132
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,000
At this rate, the main rebel armies in Cheongju will come charging at the capital right away.

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,740
Please send me to the battlegrounds, too, Your Excellency.

134
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,920
You?

135
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,980
You might not think it, but I have trained in martial arts.

136
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,820
I have wielded the sword quite a lot working in Saheonbu, too.

137
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,960
Before anyone else, I will take on the rebels and stop them.

138
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,030
I won't allow even one to set foot in the capital.

139
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,280
Thank you.

140
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,410
Everyone, take money and rice.

141
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,100
From now on, all of you will be able to stuff yourselves and live it up.

142
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,350
Thank you, sir.

143
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:10,700
In the country run by me, there are no class differences and no taxes,

144
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,780
and everyone will be able to live in mammoth mansions with gold, silver, and precious gems galore in their storages.

145
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,570
Your grace is immeasurable!

146
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,730
Thank you, Your Majesty. Your grace is immeasurable.

147
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,980
Look me in the eye.

148
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you think I am telling you a lie?

149
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,260
No, Your Majesty.

150
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,680
Thank you!

151
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,260
Now praise him.

152
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,960
Long live the king!

153
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,370
Prince Milpoong!

154
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,970
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

155
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,730
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

156
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,280
Your Highness Prince Milpoong!

157
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,600
Yoon Yeong...

158
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,960
Thank you.

159
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,420
How could you keep that among yourselves?

160
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,660
Am I a fool and a human bullet shield?

161
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,720
What do you think you are doing?!

162
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,950
Get away from me!  Why is the king still alive?

163
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,750
What on earth does it mean that our organizations in the capital have been wiped out?

164
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,580
Take him and go now.

165
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,450
- But, Generalâ€” 
 - Now!

166
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,020
Yes.

167
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,660
If we cannot gain the palace, this rebellion might as well be over.

168
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,580
Everyone can be killed like dogsâ€”

169
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,950
You dare to touch my men?

170
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,360
Everyone is treating me like a king.

171
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,610
My subjects are calling me "Your Majesty."

172
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,050
Here.  This is the whole of our property that I guarded with my life.

173
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,260
As expected, I knew you would get it done.

174
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,510
However, you cannot give it away easily.

175
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,420
This is your last stronghold...

176
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,030
You want to slay me?

177
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,990
Wait.

178
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,650
Just try doing it.

179
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,050
Slay me!

180
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,320
I put my life on the line anyway.

181
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,200
Rather than suffering the humiliation of defeatâ€”

182
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Shut up!

183
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,530
You risked your life?

184
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,650
Humiliation?

185
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,430
All this time, you abandoned your Namin brothers

186
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,760
and lived in the lap of luxury as a pet dog of the powerful.

187
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,680
Do you even know what those words mean?

188
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,430
I'm asking if you think it's okay for the likes of you

189
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:11,050
to mouth such words at this point just because you got your feet wet a bit in the rebellion?

190
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,810
We gained the Cheongju Fortress here.

191
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,380
Also, we are already prevailing in Gyeongsang and Jeolla.

192
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,130
Just because you are called General,

193
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,560
do you really think you are somebody?

194
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,530
This mere Cheongju Fortress...  So what?

195
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,420
Lee In Jwa, just what do you know?

196
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,650
If we can't replace the king, we are mere traitors.

197
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,240
The king has been replaced already.

198
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,940
What do you mean treason, Deputy Inspector General Wi?

199
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,960
Put down the sword.

200
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,600
How can there be a fight between two commendable loyal ministers?

201
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,580
It is a royal command.

202
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,160
Lower it.

203
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:52,260
Okay, I know how you two feel better than anyone else.

204
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:59,040
Because of being Namin, you probably had to live a life of humiliation and insult.

205
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,820
I, too, had to live that life.

206
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,220
Despite being the real owner of this country,

207
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,990
I was abandoned by the Norons

208
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,540
and even had my throne stolen by a low-born's offspring.

209
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,070
The unfairness of struggling endlessly without being able to achieve the goal...

210
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,140
How that stings and hurts ...

211
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,990
I know that better than anyone else.

212
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,340
However, the torturous times are over.

213
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,220
I am going to go to the palace and sit on the throne, on my seat.

214
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,480
At that time, you two shall guard me by my side.

215
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,860
That will

216
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,620
open that path for us.

217
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,440

218
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,420
Buy the people's hearts with that and open the way to the palace.

219
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,590
We will proceed without delay and enter the capital.

220
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,830
What are you doing?  It is your entire fortune!

221
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,370
- Even if to prepare for the future...
- There is no such thing as future.

222
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,640
To live as king or to die.

223
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,970
Those are the only remaining options.

224
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,060
Isn't that why you came searching for me again as well?

225
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,330
To stand by the king's side.

226
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,760
To become the highest woman in Joseon.

227
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,670
To become the queen.

228
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,550
Are you all ready?

229
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,440
Yes, Hyung-nim.

230
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,910
You are headed to battlefields where you have to risk your lives.

231
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,300
Even if you don't come forwardâ€”

232
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,220
You are not telling us to keep out of it like cowards, right?

233
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,800
It is a duty to protect His Majesty and this country.

234
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,060
If not us, who'd take it on?

235
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,980
We will never change our hearts.

236
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,600
Okay.

237
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,010
- Let's make haste. 
- Yes!

238
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,930
Let's move it.

239
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,570
- My Lord!
 - My Lord!

240
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,530
Ah Bong, Jang Dal.

241
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,950
My Lord, we have volunteered to join the army too.

242
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,930
We will assist you by your side till the end.

243
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,430
What?

244
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,890
For Ah Bong, that may be okay,

245
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,170
but, Jang Dal, do you know how old you are?

246
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,960
Fifty this year.  I'm still a young boy.

247
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,490
We are ghost-busting* assistant investigators, after all.
 (*pun on how modern-day Korean marine corps are called fearless ghostbusters)

248
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,320
When rebels have their eye on the capital if we don't catch them, who would?

249
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,390
Ah Bong.

250
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,110
Jang Dal, you guys...

251
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,490
My Lord, you are not the only pledged brother of His Majesty.

252
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,620
We, too, are the people of this country and His Majesty.

253
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,270
Lord Moon Soo, Ah Bong, Uncle Jang Dal!

254
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,270
Hey, Yeo Ji!  Hey.

255
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,970
How long has it been?

256
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,230
Why did you volunteer when you are a scaredy-cat?

257
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,460
Hey, still I am a man, punk.

258
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,600
Uncle and Lord, please take good care of Ah Bong.

259
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,150
Don't worry.  I will tell him to hide well behind me.

260
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,940
Lord, you too.  Because of that temper of yours, you shouldn't just charge on, head first.

261
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,100
Hey, when did I...

262
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,250
Kid, don't worry. I will grab on to the back of his pants tightly.

263
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,720
- Let's go.  Hurry.
 - We better go.

264
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,150
- We must go now.  See you again.
 - Ah Bong...

265
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,600
Why are you acting like this?  Like you'll never see each other again.

266
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,030
Yeo Ji, don't worry.  We will come back alive no matter what.

267
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,130
Yes.

268
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,770
We are leaving.

269
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,940
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

270
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,340
See you later.

271
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,310
Come quickly.

272
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,130
I'll be on my way too.

273
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,150
Take good care of yourself.

274
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,350
I should come with you, but I am tied down like this at the palace.

275
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,700
Hey, dude, what are you saying?

276
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,540
Do you know how relieved I feel about that?

277
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,580
Because you will be fine.

278
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,900
Pardon?

279
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,280
For the first time, I thought it was a good thing that you became a palace maid.

280
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,850
If not, you would definitely have tagged along to the battlefields.

281
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,490
Aigoo, just thinking about it makes me feel annoyed and bothered.

282
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,930
Lord!

283
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,150
Don't worry.  I'll return alive.

284
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,940
Please take good care of His Majesty, Yeo Ji.

285
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,300
 Here comes His Majesty.

286
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,470
Your Majesty!

287
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,310
Your humble subjects District Governor  (temporary provincial military head at times of war, rebellion, etc.)  Lee Gwang Jwa and your military

288
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,630
have finished our battle preparations.

289
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,700
Please send us off, Your Majesty.

290
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,340
Listen.

291
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,460
You who are standing here are all my friends,

292
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,400
my soldiers, and my people.

293
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,100
When I ought to protect you,

294
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,390
for the sake of this kingdom, I have no choice but to send you off to battlefields.

295
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,930
Please forgive me.

296
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,360
However, we will surely emerge triumphantly

297
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,550
from this grievous rebellion.

298
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,800
We will guard this land

299
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,050
and the lives of innocent people

300
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,290
from the frontline.

301
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:57,870
Moreover, I trust

302
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,640
that all of you

303
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,970
will come back alive.

304
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,510
This is the king's command!

305
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,300
None of you must ever

306
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:25,410
fall at the hands of those dishonorable rebels.

307
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,990
I and your military will carry out your solemn biddings.

308
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,810
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

309
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,590
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

310
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,920
At the send-off ceremony,

311
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,920
you must have had the same thought.

312
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:50,110
The ones who've been ruining this country for the longest time are us,

313
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,790
practicing court politics and wielding power.

314
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,760
In particular, including myself

315
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,220
and Noron.

316
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,010
Yes...

317
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,080
But the ones who go into battle are those

318
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,670
who've never even once enjoyed that power

319
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,200
and the people.

320
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,620
The people...

321
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,420
What can I do now, Ja Dong?

322
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,720
My friends...

323
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,100
After sending my people off to a place of death,

324
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,460
what can I now

325
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,190
do in this palace?

326
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,970
You must do the king's job, Your Majesty.

327
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,220
When the people have put their lives on the line to guard the king,

328
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,860
a proper king must

329
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,050
find a way to save the country, must he not?

330
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,650
You must know why this rebellion was triggered, Your Majesty,

331
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,980
because even an ignoramus like me knows.

332
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,390
There must be things that you can do.

333
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:24,000
There must be things that you ought to do.
