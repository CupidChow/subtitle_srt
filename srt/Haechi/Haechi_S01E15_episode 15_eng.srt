1
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:41,960

2
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,340
Kill.

3
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,410
Who are you?

4
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,340
Why are you doing this to me?

5
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,150
Dal Moon. Are you here to kill me under Min Jin Heon's order?

6
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:06,170
Min Jin Heon protects us and I help him.

7
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,060
That's the deal I had with him.

8
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,990
You're the one who is interrupting that exchange.

9
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,560
So you're stepping up yourself for Min Jin Heon.

10
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,460
Yes, you indeed aren't careless with your work.

11
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,700
I didn't want to step up in this matter.

12
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,900
What I wanted was the power of someone of authority for my family,

13
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,030
not my involvement in political fights.

14
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,970
You will need to slash me in one go.

15
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,920
If hesitation lingers at the edge of the sword,

16
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,500
then the next person to go will be you.

17
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,050
A nation that is a little different?

18
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,370
To dream of such a thing...

19
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,040
However, you said you will achieve it, right?

20
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,640
The thing that everyone in this world is saying you cannot achieve.

21
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,730
 - What if I accomplish it? What will you do if I accomplish that?
 - Your Highness.

22
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,540
  The thing that you and everyone else is telling me that I cannot accomplish...

23
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,660
  If I become the most kingly of all kings of this nation Joseon...

24
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,320
Stand up.

25
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,310
Your Highness's path and mine have become one now.

26
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,600
This fight, let's start it together.

27
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,920

28
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,760
Deputy Minister! Deputy Minister!

29
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,380
Deputy Minister!

30
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,230
Kim Chang Joong and Lee Yi Gyeom are meeting the king? Why at this hour of the night?

31
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,920
According to the queen, she said it sounded like they were discussing the heir.

32
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,860
She said that it's ominous that the queen dowager stepped up.

33
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,150
What are those old foxes trying to do?

34
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,630
Where is His Highness? Where is Prince Milpoong right now?

35
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,540
Come in.

36
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,070
- This is...
 - Here is where all information in this capital is gathered.

37
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,340
Information in Hanyang and even secret conversations inside the palace.

38
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,970
This is information from the palace. It's regarding you, Your Highness.

39
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,070
Regarding me?

40
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,160
What does this mean?

41
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,210
Kim Chang Joong and Lee Yi Gyeom,

42
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,820
two Noron officials are meeting the king regarding me?

43
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,260
As expected, you didn't know about it.

44
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,290
Prince Yeoning as crown prince?

45
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,710
Is that really your, Noron officials', will?

46
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,360
It comes from our loyal hearts thinking of the safety of the nation, Your Majesty.

47
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,530
We can't leave the crown prince position open any longer.

48
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,270
Prince Yeoning. Does he know about your will?

49
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,640
Does he know that you are pushing him to become the next crown prince as well?

50
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,150
We confirmed through his father-in-law, Seo Jong Je.

51
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,400
His Highness will gladly accept this important position and support you, Your Majesty.

52
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,840
 You really achieved it. You did.

53
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,820
 As I promised you, Your Majesty.

54
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:48,030
 Now the Norons will be shaken and will begin to split.

55
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,220
 By chance, was this it?

56
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,160
 Do you truly not know of the sinister ambition Prince Yeoning is hiding inside him?

57
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,890
 It wasn't to get rid of the Norons but to gain the throne with them?

58
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,790
Quickly come, quickly.

59
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,680
What is this? Are you sure he was sent by His Highness?

60
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,610
I know. It is a bit suspicious.

61
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,940
Hey kid, stop there for a second.

62
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,140
What is it now? There's no time for idling.

63
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,820
You punk.

64
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,760
We quickly followed after you because you said Prince Yeoning was looking for us, but we need to check.

65
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,400
Gosh, this yangban  (can mean nobleman or chap) . It was tiring to watch him but now that I'm talking to him, it's even more tiring.

66
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,540
Watch me? Me?

67
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,240
But wait a moment.

68
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,900
Ah Bong, Jang Dal. When he said "this yangban," he didn't mean man as in a nobleman, huh?

69
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,130
It's the "this chap, that chap" kind of use of yangban, right?

70
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,920
- Yes.
 - You little punk!

71
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,310
Hey, come here. Come.

72
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,860
Hey!

73
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,700
Lord Park Moon Soo.

74
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,290
Come inside. His Highness is waiting.

75
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,980
What? Who are you that you know me?

76
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,940
Since when were you...

77
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,920
This famous?

78
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,470
- Wow.
 - It's really spacious here.

79
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,140
Stop blabbering.

80
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,160
You're all here.

81
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,260
Hyung-nim, what is all this about?

82
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,510
Pushing for a crown prince?

83
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,370
Why would Kim Chang Joong and Lee Yi Gyeom push for you?

84
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,040
I don't know the reason as well.

85
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,850
Why they suddenly stepped up

86
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,720
and what else will happen tonight.

87
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,700
The only certain thing is that this is not Min Jin Heon's doing.

88
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,170
It's not the will of the Minister of the Interior? Then how is the Noron...

89
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,730
This probably means that the Norons are split.

90
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,420
So the problem is if this fails.

91
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,180
If Kim Chang Joong and Lee Yi Gyeom acted alone,

92
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,840
then Min Jin Heon and the majority of the Norons will not accept it.

93
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,360
And the Sorons, too. His Majesty, too.

94
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,580
If you are nominated as the heir and this situation fails...

95
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,080
Yes.

96
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,680
I know. It might become treason.

97
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,560
And I know what will be at the end of that.

98
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,420
Deputy Minister!

99
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,810
- Send a message to the rest of the Sorons right away. 
- Okay.

100
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,640
 So I've called you here.

101
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,260
- Your Excellency!
  - Tonight, a fight that will put everyone's life at risk will start.

102
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,310
However, there is no one who is on your side inside the palace.

103
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,700
They have political power, but you—

104
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,760
No, maybe it will

105
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,410
be my strong point.

106
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:57,080
I... am planning to use that weakness as my strong point.

107
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,040
The horse is ready.

108
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,500
- Please take care of the rest.
 - Yes, don't worry.

109
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,720
But Hyung-nim, the guy inside...

110
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,080
He can be trusted. I'll explain in detail later.

111
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,980
I understand. Please take care of yourself.

112
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,290
But how about Yeo Ji?

113
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,070
She went to meet some students, but she hasn't returned yet.

114
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,540
But she and I parted ways almost two hours ago.

115
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,960
She must have gotten wasted somewhere.  That punk, of all times, at a time like this...

116
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,960
Be sure to tell Yeo Ji to watch out for herself too.

117
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,570
Yes, Hyung-nim.

118
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,550
Giddy-up.

119
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,710
Lord, we should get going too right about now...

120
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,800
But, about Yeo Ji...

121
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,370
Cheon Yeo Ji, our Macho Man, might lay waste to alcohol,

122
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,960
but not get wasted by alcohol...

123
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,690
Huh?

124
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
A wench?

125
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,480
Not a prince but a wench?

126
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,660
Don't you hear me telling you to announce me to His Majesty right now!

127
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,630
The prime minister and inspector general all got in, I hear?

128
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,890
When mere ministers get to come in and out, why can't I, a prince?

129
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,490
Raising a ruckus before the king's quarters is a serious crime.

130
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,580
A serious crime?

131
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,210
How dare you, a mere eunuch, order me around?

132
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:57,460
All right, if you can't do it, I will personally announce myself to His Majesty.

133
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,470
Your Majesty!  Your Majesty!

134
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,700
Those mere eunuchs' martial art skills...

135
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,180
You must know their extent?

136
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,300
Your Highness Prince Milpoong!

137
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,910
How come you, the high and mighty minister of the interior, stooped to visit me

138
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,810
in my humble room in the palace back corner in this dark, unruly night?

139
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:35,350
I must have lived on until now to behold this wondrous spectacle.

140
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,390
You are right.

141
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,940
This is a dark, unruly night.

142
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,990
Prince Yeoning is scheming to get the throne.

143
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,420
However, what can I do about it?

144
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,760
"What can I do?"  It's not the time for you to be saying such things.

145
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,730
Your Highness!

146
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,250
To some, this is a fearful night when their lives hang by a thread.

147
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,470
Putting forward Prince Yeoning as the heir?  By whose permission?!

148
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,150
And where is the rule against it?

149
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,810
Hah!

150
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,110
The king chooses his own heir!

151
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,190
Even then!

152
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,120
 Also somewhere, tonight, old comrades turn their backs on one another as enemies...

153
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,540
When you are still in your prime, how can you talk about making your brother into your heir?

154
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,740
Please punish Kim Chang Joong, Lee Yi Gyeom, and Prince Yeoning, Your Majesty!

155
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,700
 And some get pushed to make a conflicted decision.

156
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,920
 And some,

157
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:35,050
 at the end of futile expectations and struggles,

158
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,430
 succumb in the end.

159
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,460
 I am talking about such a night.

160
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,690
Your Highness, even though you were a daughter of a Soron family,

161
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,450
you stood on the Noron's side after marrying into the royal familiy.

162
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,840
Was that not because you understood the Noron's position that the pillars of this country are the Sadaebu  (noble class) ?

163
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,880
Since Prince Yeoning is not the Noron's choice,

164
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,870
even though I am the queen dowager, I should just stay in the back meekly?

165
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,170
This is Joseon.

166
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,660
One who is from a low origin cannot become a king—

167
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,520
Prince Yeoning is the predecessor king's flesh and blood.

168
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,930
However, his biological mother was a water maid.

169
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:17,010
Yes, this came about because the predecessor king made a mere low-born into his royal concubine.

170
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,740
- Minister of the Interior!
 - How can the nobles of Joseon

171
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,600
bow their heads before the offspring of a low-born?

172
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,390
How can you demand such humiliation on the part of the nobles?

173
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,960
Humiliation?!

174
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,700
A mere minister dares to insult the predecessor king and his descendant!

175
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,510
His mother was a low-born.

176
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,280
In that case, I will adopt Prince Yeoning as my own son.

177
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,780
Wouldn't that solve the problem?

178
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,850
Since neither you, the minister of the interior, nor any Noron

179
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,830
will ever dare to label me "lowly."

180
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,050
No, you will not be able to

181
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,170
because it is already too late.

182
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,880
Too late?

183
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,200
What do you mean?

184
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,110
Your Excellency!

185
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,160
Your Excellency!  What did the queen dowager say?  She can't possibly have said...

186
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,610
Then is it all resolved?

187
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,440
There is no need for this commotion.

188
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,490
Prince Yeoning becoming the crown prince will never come to pass.

189
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,750
What a relief.

190
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,950
Well, you must have lost some sleep over me for nothing.

191
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,390
As expected, Minister of the Interior, you were here too.

192
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,910
Your Highness, how can you be here?

193
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,140
I ought to have some shame and not fail to be present here.

194
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,740
When, albeit unintentionally, I caused you to come running here almost barefoot at this hour.

195
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,040
 So, was it indeed you?  The one who sent assassins to me.

196
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,410
But, Minister of the Interior, so unlike yourself, you are deathly pale.

197
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,720
That is odd.  Why is that?

198
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,910
It is such a shock to see me appear here?

199
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,780
Your Highness Prince Yeoning!

200
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,090
His Majesty is looking for you.

201
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,870
Please go to the king's quarters now.

202
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,210
 How is Prince Yeoning alive?

203
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,180
How could he have made this kind of mistake!

204
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,170
Your Excellency, what on earth is happening?

205
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,590
Bring the Deputy Minister of Taxation here!

206
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,520
You can't mean Lee Gwang Jwa of the Soron?

207
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,240
Hurry, we haven't got a moment to lose!

208
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,320
 No!

209
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,440
 Becoming a dog watching over the yard of the powerful!

210
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,160
 Jeong Seok!

211
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,270
No!

212
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,740
 - I said let go of me!
 - You can't do this!

213
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,660
Chief Inspector Wi!

214
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
What is it?

215
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,870
Spare me some time.

216
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,940
To be or not to be, tonight your fate depends on it.

217
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,170
Your Majesty, Prince Yeoning is here.

218
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,320
You are... the guy who threw a fit when Jeong Seok, that pal, died.

219
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,460
Jeong Seok, that pal...

220
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,870
Hearing that, strangers would think you were best buddies, when, in reality, you betrayed him.

221
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,760
- What the heck are you saying?  How dare you...
 - Enough with that.

222
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,690
Let me just cut to the chase.

223
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,250
Most likely in the palace right now, Min Jin Heon is meeting the Sorons.

224
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,210
What?  What do you mean...

225
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,010
To propose that they eliminate Prince Yeoning together.

226
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,700
 What did you just say, Minister of the Interior?

227
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,440
Will you just stand by and watch Prince Yeoning become the heir?

228
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,500
The Sorons don't want that either, right?

229
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,310
Only if it's for the sake of His Majesty.

230
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,340
Are you suggesting a deal?

231
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,520
We will give you the Sorons the positions of right state councilor and chief scholar of the Office of Special Advisors.

232
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,070
If, tonight, you will

233
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,090
join us in punishing Prince Yeoning for high treason.

234
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,360
Treason?

235
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,120
From the beginning did you have your heart set on becoming the heir?

236
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,440
That is correct.

237
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,840
That day, that night, when I got your audience,

238
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,500
I made that resolve in my heart.

239
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,270
 Of all people, Your Highness and I, such as we are,

240
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,970
 what if we can turn this world upside down?

241
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,680
So you used me?

242
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,550
From the beginning, you wanted to become Noron's king!

243
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,550
No!

244
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,440
That is not correct.

245
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,870
I have come here to tell you only the truth.

246
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:45,130
Yes, I resolved to become the heir.

247
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:52,940
However, stopping the Norons is also my sincere wish.

248
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,240
However, how can I trust you?

249
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,610
No matter what your sincerity is now,

250
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,440
in the end, you will be after my neck in this palace.

251
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,980
Those who want to put you in the heir's seat will, in the end, make you so.

252
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,720
If you truly think so, Your Majesty,

253
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,330
you can have me tried for treason.

254
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,060
As Minister of the Interior Min Jin Heon and the Soron, who would have joined him by now, wish,

255
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,000
question my heart for treason.

256
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,690
Wh-What did you say?

257
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,880
Minister of the Interior and the Sorons?

258
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,310
Treason?

259
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,460
Where is the Deputy Inspector General?

260
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,750
Where is the Deputy Inspector General?!

261
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,030
Deputy Inspector General, you must decide now.

262
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,390
This is a letter from Minister of the Interior.

263
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,000
This is from Inspector General Lee Yi Gyeom.

264
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,820
Minister of the Interior is telling me to create a charge against Prince Yeoning for treason,

265
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,320
and Inspector General is telling me to protect Prince Yeoning.

266
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,050
What do they want me to do?

267
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,000
So you have to choose a side between the two!

268
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,110
Wouldn't it be better to side with Minister of the Interior Min Jin Heon?

269
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,130
- In the end, Noron will— 
- But what if Inspector General wins?

270
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,410
Will you take responsibility?

271
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,630
I'm asking, will you take responsibility?!

272
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,640
Deputy Inspector General!

273
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:36,340
Then do you think something will happen tonight?

274
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,280
Political maneuvering, that's what.

275
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,210
I am someone whom the majority of the Norons and the Sorons cannot approve.

276
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:52,470
To get rid of me, they joined forces. Isn't it obvious?

277
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:58,930
However, is that what you truly want, Your Majesty?

278
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:06,450
That the royal heir would be shaken by such political maneuvering and collusion?

279
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,500
I don't have the Norons or the Sorons.

280
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,310
Therefore,  I can only think about the safety of Joseon, not about a political faction.

281
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,080
Not about a political faction, but the safety of Joseon?

282
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,010
Isn't that the kind of country you dreamed of?

283
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,340
Practicing politics only for this nation and its people.

284
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,850
Am I the one

285
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,000
who misread your sincere heart?

286
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,710
What would be best?

287
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,140
One is telling me to create a charge of treason.

288
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,790
One is telling me to block it. With whom shall I side?

289
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,430
Letters from Minister of the Interior and Inspector General...

290
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,140
Just like what he said, will we face our demise because of the difference of one word?

291
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,490
 It's true.

292
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,580
 I'm certain that Minister of the Interior and Inspector General will desperately try to stop each other.

293
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,840
 But who can be sure about who will win that fight?

294
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,150
 What if you side with Minister of the Interior, but Prince Yeoning becomes the heir?

295
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,880
 - Then what will you do?
 - Why should I believe a nobody?

296
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,840
 So find a way to survive, Chief Inspector Wi!

297
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,760
 Do you not understand?

298
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,760
 Tonight, if you can't be certain about who will win,

299
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,070
 do the thing that you're best at, the only thing that will at least save you.

300
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,730
 I'm telling you to do it.

301
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,940
Hey Chief Inspector Wi, please say someth—

302
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,710
Use the inspectors, My Lord.

303
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,340
What?

304
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,970
It's a battle where we can't be sure who will win.

305
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,060
For us, the Saheonbu, to survive, we can't side with anyone.

306
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,170
So I'm saying, let's create a reason to take no action.

307
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,460
What do you mean the Saheonbu is trying to create a charge of treason?

308
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,170
It's not certain.

309
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,070
But there is suspicious movement between

310
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,030
the Deputy Inspector General and the Daejangcheong.

311
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:29,180

312
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,040
What is it?

313
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,840
I apologize but there is something I must check with Deputy Inspector General.

314
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,200
There are unsettling talks about Daejangcheong trying to fabricate a treason charge.

315
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,490
Who is saying that?

316
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:49,500
We, inspectors, cannot approve of the Saheonbu being used for political maneuvers.

317
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,580
Please reveal the truth clearly!

318
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:35,550
This is my handwritten letter stating that

319
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,370
King Hyojong's and the preceding king's remaining blood relations

320
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:45,130
are only you, Your Majesty, and Prince Yeoning.

321
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:50,600
However, everything is in your hands, Your Majesty.

322
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,700
I will follow your decision.

323
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:06,050
Will you really follow my decision no matter what it is?

324
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
You look like you haven't slept a bit.

325
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,250
It must have been quite a long night for you as well.

326
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,350
Go get some sleep.

327
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,080
Whichever side it may be, a decision will be made.

328
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,380
You will die

329
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,400
or I will die.

330
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,860
I should have killed you last night.

331
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:18,340
These idiots... How could tens of them not manage to slash one of you down?

332
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,470
What are you talking about?

333
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,310
Last night, the one who sent assassins after me was you?

334
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,550
You can't be it.

335
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,660
Even if it's not me, at least you can't be it!

336
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,900
Tell me, Prince Milpoong! It was not Minister of the Interior, but you?

337
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,150
 Your Highness, how can you be here?

338
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:58,630
 If the person who sent the assassins after me was Tan, then whom did Minister of the Interior Min Jin Heon...

339
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,500
 But how about Yeo Ji?

340
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,440
 She went to meet some students, but she hasn't returned yet.

341
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,580
Perhaps?!

342
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,380
Is there no news from the palace yet?

343
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,140
- My Lord!
 - My Lord!

344
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,170
- My Lord!
 - What's wrong?

345
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,170
There's a big problem!

346
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,030
- Did Hyung-nim Prince Yeoning send news?
 - No!

347
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,910
- That's not it!
 - It's Yeo Ji!

348
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,110
Our Yeo Ji! We think she's in big trouble!

349
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,730
What are you talking about?

350
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,610
Why would she be?

351
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,460
If you hurt her who was wearing my clothes,

352
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,800
I swear that I will kill you.

353
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,140
- What is he talking about?
 - What is he saying?

354
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,660
What happened to Yeo Ji?

355
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,370
My Lord.

356
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,390
The scholars who were with Yeo Ji were ambushed and died? Then what about Yeo Ji?

357
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,360
Thankfully, the damo's body was not there.

358
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
Then it means she's alive, right?

359
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,160
Where? Where is she right now?

360
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,570
I'm not sure of the exact location.

361
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,030
There is a place I'm suspicious of but if we move rashly—

362
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,620
Tell me!

363
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,950
Where is it?
