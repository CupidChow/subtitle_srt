1
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,050
Yeo Ji, no!

2
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,700
What are you doing?

3
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:14,010

4
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,580
You...

5
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,840

6
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,240
"Master-killer"?

7
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,220
You will kill your master? What does that mean...

8
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,700
Kill me!  I came prepared to die anyway.

9
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,880
You're a girl?

10
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,080
Hey! Are you okay?

11
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,810
Hey!

12
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,460
Is anyone there?

13
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,800
Is no one here?

14
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,720
Hey there. Come to your senses.

15
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,640
This...

16
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,680
What is this, Your Highness?

17
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,440
It's dangerous, Yeo Ji.

18
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,390
This is...

19
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,350
Is he dead?

20
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,480
Is that what happened?

21
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,440
- Deputy Inspector General.
 - Deputy Inspector General.

22
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,900
Crown Prince.

23
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,650
C-Crown Prince?

24
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,010
Crown Prince.

25
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,450
Chief Inspector Oh.

26
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,630
Isn't that our Chief Inspector Oh?

27
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,850
Everybody, step back.

28
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,080
This is the scene of a murder.

29
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,630
No evidence must be mishandled.

30
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,660
And arrest the crown prince this moment!

31
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,650
Withdraw.  Withdraw quickly!

32
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,390
My Lord.

33
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,270
Are you okay?

34
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,580
Yeo Ji!

35
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,550
- The crown prince has been arrested.
- What do you mean?

36
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,190
Hurry, hurry to the scene.

37
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,660
What are you hesitating for?

38
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,290
I said arrest the crown prince.

39
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,110
You can't possibly

40
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,240
dare to put your hands on me.

41
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,620
I will come of my own accord.

42
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,560
Your Highness.

43
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,410

44
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,160
 What did you just say?

45
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,630
His Highness the Crown Prince is under the Saheonbu's custody?!

46
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,030
I am extremely sorry to inform you

47
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,770
that it seems true that the crown prince was arrested at the murder scene.

48
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,100
Then, are you saying the crown prince is in the Saheonbu now?

49
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,430
Your Majesty!

50
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,500
What do they mean the crown prince committed a murder?  What happened?

51
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,140
I don't know the details yet.

52
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,500
Still, how can they apprehend His Highness?

53
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,130
- He is the crown prince!
 - Because they are the Saheonbu.

54
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,130
They can impeach high officials and target even royals.

55
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,430
But before their very eyes, one of their own died.

56
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:10,250
Do you think the Saheonbu will be fearful of His Highness who has no power?

57
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,160
Inspector General.

58
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,060
Let's go.

59
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,760
What is going on right now?

60
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,680
Someone, tell me.

61
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,700
- Lord, why the heck was His Highness at that gisaeng house?
 - For our sake.

62
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,130
He came to inform us of the danger we were facing.

63
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,850
And things went wrong like this.

64
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,090
But a murder!  That doesn't make any sense.  He can't possibly have...

65
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,150
I will go to him.  I must see him.

66
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,590
Are you crazy?  Do you know how many Saheonbu guards are out there?

67
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,510
Are you saying we should just stay here fazed, then?

68
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,280
While His Highness is under detention, we don't know anything about why.

69
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,200
Doing nothing is crazier, isn't it?

70
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,540
The crown prince was at the scene, and the deputy inspector general witnessed it.

71
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,590
How do we interpret this?

72
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,450
Even so, we are talking about the crown prince here.  We can't rashly charge him withâ€”

73
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,280
If so, what kind of daegan  (officers of Saheonbu and Saganwon; inspectors and censors; auditors)  are we, Lord?

74
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,110
A Saheonbu colleague, one of us, has been murdered!

75
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,050
If we cannot try his crime just because he's the crown prince, then we ought to discard these inspectors' robes!

76
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,210
Enough already!  I am very much aware of that, too!

77
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,320
Are you positive that His Highness was the only one at the scene?

78
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,740
Yes, only the crown prince, the dead Chief Inspector Oh, and a bloody dagger were there.

79
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,980
Although, understandably, the crown prince denied the charge.

80
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,430
 You can't possibly dare to put your hands on me.

81
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,070
 I will come of my own accord.

82
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,820
 However,

83
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,470
 I am not the murderer who killed the chief inspector.

84
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,160
 Of course, I would like to believe you.  Why wouldn't I?

85
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,830
Summon the assistant officer of Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau)  now!

86
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,370
- Yes, Your Majesty.
 - Your Majesty!

87
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,080
Your Majesty!

88
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,620
How can the Saheonbu dare to arrest the crown prince!

89
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,800
 If this is true, what a catastrophe it will be.

90
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,260
Your Excellency!

91
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,490
The crown prince did that?

92
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,070
 What a whirlwind of confusion would this country be swept into?

93
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:59,380
That's why I also want to believe your statement that someone else murdered Chief Inspector Oh Se Hwan.

94
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,450
But?

95
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,350
But why am I still unable to leave?

96
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,990
What is the reason you dare

97
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,060
to detain me, the crown prince?

98
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,210
This testimony.

99
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,950
Something isn't quite right about this testimony.

100
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,450
Why did you, someone more clever than anybody else,

101
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,810
give a testimony that has a subtle gap?

102
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,620
Are you, by any chance, hiding something?

103
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,820
Move aside!  I said move aside!  Let go!

104
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,390
Won't you let go of this?  Let go!  I said move!

105
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,890
- Move!
 - Have you all gone mad?

106
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,650
Please move out of our way.  We must see the crown prince!

107
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,760
The crown prince has been framed.

108
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,250
 Hearing a cry of help, you rushed over there.

109
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,770
But when you got there, Chief Inspector Oh was already dead from the dagger wound.

110
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,140
How many times are you going to ask me this?

111
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,360
And you only managed to see the back of a nobleman running from the scene.

112
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,350
Oh my, I think I'm slowly getting bored.

113
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,400
"You're a girl?"

114
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,490
 Kill me! I came prepared to die anyway.

115
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,740
 - You're a girl? Why on earth... 
 - "Why on earth?"

116
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,940
What were the words I heard?

117
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,680
Those were definitely in your voice, Your Highness.

118
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,770
Yes!  You saw the culprit!

119
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,570
If you are not the culprit, that is!

120
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,290
Pull back already, Inspector Park!

121
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,790
I understand how you feel, but Saheonbu simply investigates according to its principles.

122
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,660
You mean investigating the crown prince without Uigeumbu's  (Royal Investigation Bureau)  consent?

123
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,430
Isn't Uigeumbu the organization that deals with crimes involving the royal family?

124
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,610
Saheonbu also has jurisdiction over corruption committed by royals!

125
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,510
What do you know to act up like this?

126
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,490
- Forget this and drag all of them out of here!
 - Unhand us!

127
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,020
Can't you hear our order to make way now!

128
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
Right this moment!

129
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,030
So you'd better give me the answers.

130
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,560
Who did you see and why are you lying?

131
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,310
If you can't reveal the answers, then you become the culprit, Your Highness.

132
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,100
Why don't you try fabricating the case?

133
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,540
That's your speciality, isn't it?

134
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,570
Your Highness!

135
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,720
Lord, outside right now...

136
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,560
You dare to unsheathe your swords in Saheonbu's yard?

137
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,230
You, Uigeumbu officers!
 (The Royal Investigation Bureau is under the king's direct control)

138
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,630
Give us the crown prince in your custody.

139
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,390
Uigeumbu will take over the investigation now.

140
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,190
But this case belongs to us, Saheonbu.

141
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,770
I have already told you that the case has been transferred.

142
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,800
Assistant Officer!  Is this a challenge?

143
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,740
- Are you saying you will disobey His Majesty's royal command, Lord? 
- How dare you!

144
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,790
What are you waiting for?  Carry out the royal order now!

145
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,070
- Yes!
 - But how can youâ€”

146
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,010
No, inconceivable!  How can Saheonbu lose out to Uigeumbu?

147
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,530

148
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,840
Are you from Uigeumbu?

149
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,730
We are here to escort you, Crown Prince, under His Majesty's command.

150
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,490
However, I must tell you this first.

151
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,910
Uigeumbu investigating you does not mean

152
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,130
you will be given a more favorable treatment.

153
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,970
Nowhere in this country can I expect such a thing.

154
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,040
Escort His Highness.

155
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,050
Yes.

156
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,800
Your Highness!

157
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,720
Just a minute!  Just give me a moment.

158
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,960
They are my acquaintances.

159
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,530
Give them some space.

160
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,500
Your Highness,

161
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,220
this time, it's your turn to trust us.

162
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,250
We will make sure to prove that you have been framed.

163
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,090
Moon Soo.

164
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,120
Did you guys get hurt again

165
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,430
because of me?

166
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,610
It's just a scrape.

167
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,160
What the heck is he doing?  Does he think that's a girl and therefore he's womanizing even at this moment?

168
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,240
Your Highness... why?

169
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,800
Master-killer.

170
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,390
What I saw was a tattoo written "Master-killer."

171
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,520

172
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,540
And...

173
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,500
What is it?  What more did he say?

174
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,640
 And a young girl.

175
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,010
 Come and find me, Yeo Ji.

176
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,590
What?

177
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,320
We've set up a check point because of the murders.  What is this?

178
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,120
Oh, I see.  This is a waste container.

179
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,900
Go on.

180
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,840
Okay.

181
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,940
 The one who killed Chief Inspector Oh

182
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,650
 was a simple, young girl of the low-born class.

183
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,970

184
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,330
Did you hear?

185
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,640
The opportunity we've been waiting for came sooner than expected.

186
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,150
Lower your volume.

187
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,350
You are inside the Amitabha Hall housing the Buddha.

188
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,710
But, have you heard, the crown prince killed someone?

189
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,630
It hasn't been long since he was named the crown prince though.

190
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,590
It's because he was born lowly.

191
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,330
Still, how can he kill a person?

192
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,660

193
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,860
It's not like that.

194
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,650
Next door, front house, rear house, all neighbors...

195
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,450
The situation in the palace is grave.

196
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,900
And even the public opinion is turning disadvantageous.

197
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,200
Now, they are even picking faults with his origin.

198
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
The lowly people should side with the crown prince.

199
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,290
Why are the people making a bigger deal out of this?

200
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,390
As lacking as I am, I will go out to the streets and try to turn the tables.

201
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,880
Will you be alright?

202
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,900
A storyteller ought to die, telling stories.

203
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,920
E-Ex-Excuse me!

204
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,380
Do you have some time?  My Lord is urgently looking for you.

205
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,910
What do you mean?

206
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,290
Are you also claiming that my brother did it?

207
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,510
If it wasn't him, please convince me, Your Majesty.

208
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,190
Giving a false excuse to visit a gisaeng house itself is serious misconduct.  And a murder on top of it?

209
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,760
Even then, the crown prince is not cooperating with Uigeumbu's investigation.

210
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,030
If he was framed, why is he not even trying to free himself of it?

211
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,320
What about other high officials?  How are they behaving?

212
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,990
Won't you get out of my way!

213
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,070
We said leave right now!

214
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,900
Telling me to leave right now?!  Sirrah!

215
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,820
This is Noron's working space!

216
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,620
That is why we are telling you to leave.

217
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,490
- Do you deserve the name of Noron, Prime Minister?
 - Where have you seen such...

218
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,190
Where do you think you are acting like an ignorant, lowly wretch?

219
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,440
We can't rub shoulders with you who put that scoundrel in the crown prince's seat!

220
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,500
This insolent thing, who do you think you are shaking your finger at?  You rascal!

221
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,200
I am the prime minister of this country!

222
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,670
Get out!

223
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,090
Just try kicking us out!

224
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,560
But we should be the outraged ones.  Why are the Norons raising hell?

225
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,710
Let's be on our way.  I have to go to the interrogation room...

226
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,610
Your Excellency Prime Minister!

227
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,310
You rascals must want to die so bad that you've lost your sanity!

228
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,670
How can you, who've learned the manners of Confucius and Mencius, act so contemptibly?

229
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,340
Okay, try smacking me too!  I said try smacking me too!

230
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,300
Do it!  Do it!

231
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,810
What the heck do you think you're doing?

232
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,330
Did you advise the queen dowager that I will be coming to see her?

233
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,490
Yes, she said she would see you.

234
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,690
I guess she still considers him her husband to act so anxiously.

235
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,330
Court Lady Ha!

236
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,170
Gramps!  How did it go?  Did they get in okay?

237
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,570
You don't get weary of giving the same answers.

238
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,190
Did you say you are Assistant Officer Jo Hyeon Myeong?

239
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,850
Your persistence also deserves high praise.

240
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,480
It's strange. You seem to complicate the matter even more

241
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,160
when that will put you at a greater disadvantage.

242
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,690
Because even if I talk, that won't better the situation.

243
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,530
Since I gave you answers all night long, can I also ask you something?

244
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,480
I mean the murders of noblemen a while ago.

245
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,170
Were those cases solved?

246
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,910
Why do you ask that?

247
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,240
Shall I just say it feels like my own business?

248
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,780
A court lady from the crown prince's quarters is here.

249
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,340
It's His Highness's lunch time.  I have to serve him for a short while.

250
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,160
You won't possibly deny the request, right?

251
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,340
Yeo Ji!

252
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,260
Your Highness.

253
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,260
You've grown very haggard overnight.

254
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,260
That's not important.

255
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,210
That couldn't have lessened my beauty though.

256
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,840
B-Beauty?

257
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:20,880
Still, I am happy... to see you like this.

258
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,690
Master-killer?  Did you just say the master-killer band?

259
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,060
Yes, you must know it too.

260
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,880
The master-killer band that thrived during the rule of the predecessor king.

261
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,070
I mean the organization slaves formed to kill their masters.

262
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,590
If I am right, that master-killer band has been re-established.

263
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,320
A chief inspector of Saheonbu and before him, an official belonging to the Ministry of Taxation.

264
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,590
Surely there will be more murdered noblemen.

265
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,250
But are you saying that the culprit was a young girl?

266
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,010
That is why

267
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,820
I could not say anything.

268
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,650
She was barely twelve or thirteen years old.

269
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,690
It was so appalling that such a young girl committed such an act.

270
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,150
More than anything, the reason I kept my mouth shut at Saheonbu was...

271
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,660
that you worried about the frenzy that will create.

272
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,710
Even though I was very young at the time, I, too, remember

273
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,560
when the master-killer band was first discovered.

274
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,580

275
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,640
 - Behead them! 
 - Those were brutal times

276
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,470
because the wipe-out went beyond those who participated in the master-killer band.

277
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,260
I think that is why the crown prince is keeping silent.

278
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,480
Moreover, he is pitted against the Saheonbu, the highest judiciary institution.

279
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,080
Since one of theirs was killed, how cruelly they will deal with them...

280
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,160
Wouldn't it be because His Highness can guess the extreme cruelty?

281
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,880
So look into their stories as discreetly as possible.

282
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,310
Even though they must be punished for the crimes they committed,

283
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,240
we have to at least prevent the kind of frenzy we saw before.

284
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,030
Your Majesty!

285
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,300
Your Majesty!

286
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,590
At least I must know the reason, Brother.

287
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,850
What is the story behind what you seek to find out

288
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,360
and how on earth is that related to your deed yesterday!

289
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,890

290
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,460
Has everyone reached an agreement?

291
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,020
All high officials of Saheonbu including me, Deputy Inspector General Wi Byeong Joo,

292
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,970
have agreed to put our jobs on the line.

293
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,290
The 22 inspectors including me, Lead Inspector Joo Yeong Han, have also agreed.

294
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,880
What are you all doing when there are so many matters piled up waiting for resolution at Saheonbu?

295
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,720
Get lost, you backstabbing bastard.  You know that only you and Park Moon Soo have not joined us, right?

296
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,970
Why don't you two remain and try handling everything?!

297
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,680
Please save my face and refrain from this just once.

298
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,380
Your Excellency, how could you?

299
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,990
You used to be the head of the Saheonbu.

300
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,020
You know what the Uigeumbu bastards did to us!

301
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,590
- Look here.
 - Let go of me.

302
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,130
Inspector General, Inspector General!

303
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,110

304
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,580

305
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,370
You must know what it means to disobey the royal command.

306
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,150
Answer me.  What happened?

307
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,070
Your Majesty.

308
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,430
What is the reason you cannot tell me?

309
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,490
Is it because you cannot trust me as much as I trust you?

310
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:16,040
I want to help you, Brother.  Did I misread your sincerity?

311
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,380
"Master-killer."

312
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Do you remember that word, Your Majesty?

313
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:39,800
I mean the events that pushed the whole nation into a frenzy during the predecessor king's reign.
