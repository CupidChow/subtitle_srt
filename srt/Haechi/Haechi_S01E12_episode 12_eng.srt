1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,280
Move your asses.  You'll be the tiger's prey at this rate.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,770
Tigers are the biggest catches in Joseon.  You should get a taste of that tiger skin.

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,310
Even if just words, I appreciate that.

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,150
Here, please accept this.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,370
You want  me  to catch it?!

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,910
I will catch that tiger, so why don't you catch an elk?

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,200
No, I am fine.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,560
It's because I want to gift you with a good experience.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,450
Giddy-up!

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,300
He looks like he's really enjoying it, no?

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,430
I would say so!  Aigoo, that geezer.

12
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,920
What would he have done if I hadn't brought him?

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,150
Let's ride on.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,170
Over there!  There's one passing over there!

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,590
Shoot!  It's now.

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,590
-But I have never done this before.
 - Quickly!

17
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,650
You'll lose it at this rate.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,690
Give it here.

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,080
I said give it here.

20
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,610
Envoy!

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,080
Whoa.

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,940
Are you all right?  (in Chinese)

23
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,590
I think so, thankfully.  (in Chinese)

24
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,220
What the heck?  Why are you here?

25
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,730
Still, I will call a doctor for you, just in case.  (in Chinese)

26
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,830
Hurry and go fetch a doctor.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,300
Yes!

28
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,680
Thank you.  (in Chinese)

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,550
But who might you be?

30
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,540
That is, Envoy...

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,040
He is... just a...

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,250
I am Prince Yeoning, the second son of the late king.

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,730
Belated greetings, Envoy.

34
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,130
Oh, so to the predecessor king of Joseon

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,890
there was a second prince.

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,700
But you even know our Qing language.

37
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,740
What are you up to? Why are you interfering here?

38
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,420
Because I work at the Royal Clan Management Office.  Isn't this all in a day's work?

39
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,670
When did you learn Mandarin?  What did you blabber to the envoy?

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,790
You can't understand it even though you stayed in Qing for quite a while?

41
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,310
You must be really dumb. I studied it briefly last night.

42
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,140
Why would you show up here?

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,940
You are not the kind of human being who'd show up at events like this.

44
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,060
What if it's for the throne?

45
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,020
What if I also want to become a king?

46
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,960
- King?
 - Why?

47
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,730
Is there a rule against nutty Prince Yeoning acting up when dum-dum Prince Milpoong is doing the same?

48
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,930
You must have lost your mind, seriously.

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,070
How can you when you have no backers at all?

50
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,870
The real masters of this country...

51
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,460
I can win them over.

52
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,990
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,870
Are you, by any chance, saying you can win over the Norons?

54
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,810
Enough bullsh*t.  How? By what means?!

55
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,950
 I am going to cut you off first, Prince Milpoong.

56
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,430
Everyone, stop doing what you've been doing.

57
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,770
 By now, the Saheonbu must be probing into your affairs.

58
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,360
From this moment on, all the investigation will be focused on Prince Milpoong.

59
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,780
Employ all Saheonbu's manpower in this matter.

60
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,960
Yes!

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,000
Examine all illegalities committed by Prince Milpoong, even petty mistakes.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,350
His offenses that you fail to discover will end up being your own offenses.

63
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,410
You must comb through everything with the determination that your failure to find his crimes will lead straight to your death.

64
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,120
Yes, My Lord!

65
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,600
 There is no way Min Jin Heon will leave you in one piece, Tan.

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,920
What is the matter?

67
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,790
We will search the room that wench Chae Yoon Yeong used to use.

68
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,500
Didn't I tell you that wench is no longer in my house?

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,350
I am sorry, but it is by the authority of the Saheonbu.

70
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,210
We request your cooperation, Your Excellency.

71
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,700
- Go through it!
 - Yes!

72
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,910
These bastards!

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,980
Yoon Yeong!  Yoon Yeong.

74
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,600
Min Jin Heon has started to move the Saheonbu to catch you.

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,420
What?

76
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,830
That old rat!

77
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,980
Calm down.  We can draw out His Majesty's decision before that.

78
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,060
How can I calm down?

79
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,630
When even that bastard Prince Yeoning is running amok.

80
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,660
Why is he?  For what reason?

81
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,530
 But that won't be the end.  It is only the beginning, Tan.

82
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,090
Your Highness.

83
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,640
What's the situation in Saheonbu?

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,760
As you predicted, Saheonbu started to investigate Prince Milpoong.

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,350
In the end, he means to pressure that scoundrel through Saheonbu.

86
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,370
I have sufficiently provoked Prince Milpoong.

87
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,020
Would he make a move as we want him to?

88
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,120
We'll have to take a chance.

89
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,120
Contact Chief Inspector Wi and tell him that we'll hand over the escaped prisoner to him tonight.

90
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,850
Yes.

91
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,330
This is Prince Milpoong's profile that I got through another source.

92
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,600
It's for your reference.

93
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,750
Since the Saheonbu is digging through everything, too, he won't be able to escape.

94
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,900
But what happened with Prince Angye's case?

95
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,680
- Pardon?
 - According to the inspector general,

96
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,520
it was a case that you opened.

97
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,920
I am sorry.  It started from an unimportant piece of information from the Royal Clan Management Office,

98
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,470
but the inspectors made it serious without knowing the full story.

99
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,000
That is all?

100
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,530
Why would there be anything else to it?

101
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,330
What happened to that jailbreaker?

102
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,730
These are very delicate times.  Making even a very trivial mistake will become problematic.

103
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,450
Yes, he will come under my custody today.  Do not be worried.

104
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,420
Send this right over to the inspectors' room.  I have somewhere I need to visit.

105
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,070
I understand.

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,740
It's that guy from the prison whom you asked for.

107
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,160
Thanks.  I will put him to good use.

108
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,330
Umm, but, can I ask you what you are up to?

109
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,790
Why?  Did Min Jin Heon order you to ferret out information about me?

110
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,360
By all means.  Goon Tae is very familiar with my doings for the past year.

111
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,310
You can ask him.

112
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,930
I... do not work sloppily.

113
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,030
I know.  I do my work and you do yours.

114
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,080
It would be nice if they coincide someday.

115
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,020
Will you really gather information about Prince Yeoning, too?  That's too harsh.

116
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,320
Gather up all of it.

117
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,630
Everything that is suspicious.

118
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,500
Your Highness, over here!

119
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,780
I am a bit late.  Check the package.

120
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,520
It's the right one.  I didn't know you'd bring him alive.

121
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,050
Well, you had to verify him first.

122
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,450
If you want me to, I'll dispose of him here.

123
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,930
- Who are those assailants?
 - I am not sure myself.

124
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,530
I will buy you some time.  You take him and run, now!

125
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,130
Let's go.

126
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,520
Who are you?

127
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,250
Strike!

128
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,610
There must be more of you.

129
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,780
Where is Tan?

130
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,050
 Yes, Tan. You must have that man,

131
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,880
 because this is a bait tossed to you, not to Wi Byeong Joo.

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,900
- Yeo Ji.
 - Let's talk after we take care of these guys.

133
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,490
Where do you—

134
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,330
Let them go. They're not my goal.

135
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,920
- However—
 - There's no reason to put yourself in danger because of me.

136
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,570
More importantly, what's going on? How are you here?

137
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,120
I have been following Your Highness's steps.

138
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,090
What?

139
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,300
I didn't want to see you from a displeased perspective.  I wanted to see your sincerity, but I wasn't sure how.

140
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,800
I wanted to find out more about Your Highness, but I couldn't think of another way.

141
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,670
What happened?

142
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,120
Your Excellency.

143
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,160
You can go.

144
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,350
What about the prisoner?

145
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,000
He was taken from me by Prince Milpoong.

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,890
What?

147
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,590

148
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,390
Prince Milpoong. He finally...

149
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,400
You met Cho Hong?

150
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,420
I won't beat around the bush. I don't have the talent to anyway.

151
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,350
What are you planning?

152
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,370
It's not something you need to know.

153
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,780
This dangerous scheme for which you're putting your life at risk...

154
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,130
I'm asking what it is.

155
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,330
Your Highness knew for certain that Prince Milpoong's men were following you.

156
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,520
Even though you knew, why did you purposefully let that man be taken away?

157
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,900
Just what are you trying to do, Your Highness?

158
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,420
How did you...

159
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,000
What was done to us a year ago,

160
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,260
does it have to do with getting even?

161
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,170
If so, I need to know too, Your Highness.

162
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,380
If I have been misunderstanding you...

163
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,180
If we are still walking down the same road.

164
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,110

165
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,370
Welcome.

166
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,660
Hurry, hurry.

167
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,010
Come on, give me a little more.

168
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,410
I flattered that household's kitchen maid so much to get this information.

169
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,360
Gosh, fine.

170
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,460
Hyung-nim.

171
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,440
Find out a little more. Then I'll give you more. Okay?

172
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,430
What brings you all the way here?

173
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,460
Prince Yeoning...

174
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,350
had the guy stolen from him by Prince Milpoong? What happened?

175
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,790
There were too many of them.

176
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,570
Prince Yeoning didn't realize he was being tailed.

177
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,690
- That's not possible.
 - What?

178
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,790
Prince Yeoning isn't that easy of a person to fool.

179
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:46,230
If the guy was taken from him, it's not that he was stolen but he was let go on purpose.

180
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,440
Why? Why would he do something crazy like that for Prince Milpoong's benefit?

181
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,270
Something to benefit Prince Milpoong...

182
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:02,460
That would mean it's detrimental to the Norons and... to Min Jin Heon.

183
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,800
What did Prince Yeoning ask you to do in the past year?

184
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,660
Not much. Overall, he wanted information regarding the civil service exams.

185
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,760
- Civil service exam.
 - To help Lord Park Moon Soo.

186
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,590
That's how I understood it.

187
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,800
What are you saying all of a sudden? What kind of person am I?

188
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,330
Didn't I tell you last time? I work at this—

189
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,470
Saheonbu's inspector, Yoon Hyeok.

190
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,660
You are investigating corruption related to the civil service exam.

191
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,060
However you've been stopped by those higher in power than you,

192
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,370
so you even apologized to me saying that you feel sorry about my situation.

193
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,290
 I was wondering who it was and it is you.

194
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,460
 Do you know me?

195
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,420
 You're a Saheonbu inspector?

196
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,650
 My name is Yoon Hyeok. You didn't get hurt anywhere, right?

197
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,520
 If I step up with this investigation,

198
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,900
 I can reveal long-standing corruption related to the civil service exams.

199
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,070
 But I'm sorry that I'm only a low-leveled inspector without any power.

200
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:11,510
 Can we still call the civil servants of Saheonbu as Haechi that distinguish between good and evil?

201
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:17,180
An inspector that I knew in Saheonbu with those exact lights in his eyes came to my mind.

202
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,900
So I wanted to make sure.

203
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,820
Like that inspector, would you be able to only chase after the truth?

204
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,070
And if I am that kind of a person?

205
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,340
If I risk my life to publicize this

206
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,360
so that Saheonbu has no choice but to step up about the matter,

207
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,230
would you, Inspector, become Haechi

208
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,220
and reveal the truth?

209
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,530
Please answer. Do you have the courage to bite down and not let go like a wild dog?

210
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,840
Hey, go in and convince him not to. He's going to die!

211
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,390
Don't you know he's as stubborn as cow sinew? He won't listen.

212
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,910
Oh, Yeo Ji. Why are you returning only now? We've been looking for you this whole time.

213
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,270
- Why?
 - Convince Lord Moon Soo.

214
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,180
Use your strength if you must.

215
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,060
He's going to hit a small gong to reveal corruption related to the civil service exams.

216
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,130
He's going to stop the king's procession and really cause trouble this time!

217
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,500
He's going to hit a small gong to reveal the truth?

218
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,260
If you do it recklessly, you might get beaten to death.

219
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,990
- Yes, you die.
 - Yeah.

220
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,450
My Lord.

221
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,350
You're here.

222
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,730
I thought I would have to leave without seeing you, so I'm glad.

223
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,970
You're really going to hit a small gong and beseech the king?

224
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,210
I met a Saheonbu inspector.

225
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,490
He wants to investigate this case but he is unable to

226
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,150
because the higher ups stopped it.

227
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,420
So you're going to step up? Put your life on the line?

228
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,890
Yeo Ji, if I reveal this to the world,

229
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,230
if I gain His Majesty's permission through this,

230
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,350
then Saheonbu's top officials won't be able to do anything about it...

231
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,530
because they'll have no rationale.

232
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,180
I'll return alive, so don't worry.

233
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,410
Hey, you know that I am tough.

234
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,860
Wait, My Lord.

235
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,930
Is the Saheonbu inspector you met named Yoon Hyeok?

236
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,690
How did you know about that?

237
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,740
If so, then there is something you must know before you go.

238
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,840
What you are about to do,

239
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,830
how that started,

240
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,560
what the goal is,

241
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,470
and who is behind it.

242
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,620
- Leave now.
 - Yes, sir.

243
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,820
What about the evidence?

244
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,500
I will hand it over to Saheonbu by 9 AM.

245
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:17,310
Then now I just have to wait for Tan to shake up the Noron.

246
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,900
Since pottery that's cracked

247
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,970
will break more easily.

248
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:33,830
The prisoner that initiated the prison break has been taken by Prince Milpoong?

249
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,780
To find our weakness, he tailed the chief inspector of Saheonbu.

250
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,950
Didn't we cause the prison break to eliminate the newly appointed Soron right state councilor?

251
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,090
What if Prince Milpoong hands him over to the king?

252
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,910
No, he will come find us first.

253
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,670
The rules of the power game, he knows at least that much.

254
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,970
After calling us out here, they make us wait like this? Such a bad example to set.

255
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,300
They must have something important to discuss amongst themselves.

256
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,720
Prime Minister, perhaps you can go in first?

257
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,470
Ordering Saheonbu to cut out Prince Milpoong and then asking that the case be closed?

258
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,020
What is the reason for that?

259
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,330
It's not as if that 'great man' listens to me.

260
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,760
Surely he doesn't mean to try again to put Prince Milpoong on the throne?

261
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,030
Of course not. Prince Milpoong and the Minister of the Interior are practically archenemies.

262
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,020
Minister of the Interior this, Minister of the Interior that.

263
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,950
Is the Minister of the Interior the one who decides on our country's heir?

264
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,750
Prince Milpoong and Prince Angye, too!

265
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,570
If you think about it, has the Minister of the Interior ever even done anything right?

266
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,860
That's going too far, Prime Minister.

267
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,590
How is that going too far?

268
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,430
Have I said something untrue?

269
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,030
My, oh my. I see a fight is about to break out here.

270
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,190
What an achingly enjoyable sight.

271
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,520
Wait, what is that wench doing here?

272
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,780
Oh my, Your Excellency! Long time no see!

273
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,740
This wench! How dare you!

274
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,490
Please go back and wait for now.

275
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,160
What chaos, Minister of the Interior.

276
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:20,910
I suppose this is because of Noron's weakness which has fallen into my hands.

277
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,930
Weakness? What is he talking about?

278
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,510
Minister of the Interior, what does Prince Milpoong have?

279
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,830
Saheonbu has changed its mind?

280
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,890
That's right. I definitely heard them say they are going to secretly investigate Prince Milpoong,

281
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,210
but this morning that was suddenly brought to a halt.

282
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,620
What do you suppose happened? Why would they suddenly change their minds overnight?

283
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,910
But that's Saheonbu's business.

284
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,950
It's time for the procession. Let's go now.

285
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,210
What is he thinking?

287
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,890
Do you have any idea, My Lord?

288
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,280
Let's go.

289
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,360
Isn't that the sound of a small gong?

290
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,870
Someone must be hitting a small gong to complain of an injustice.

291
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,020
How dare they try to block our procession!

292
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,030
The royal guard will punish him, so please pay him no mind, Your Majesty.

293
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,830
Your Majesty! I have something to inform you about!

294
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:00,900
Please hear me out!

295
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,820
- Drag him out of here already! 
 - Yes, sir!

296
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,220
Let me go!

297
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,250
Let go! I need to tell His Majesty something!

298
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,310
It's related to deep-rooted illegality and corruption in this country!

299
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,170
Let me go!

300
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,150
Your Majesty!

301
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,700
Arrest and take him away!

302
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,270
No, no you can't! Your Majesty!

303
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,380
Please listen to—

304
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,510
Your Majesty!

305
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,500
Get your hands off of him right this instant!

306
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,740
Prince Yeoning?

307
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,300
Moon Soo, are you alright?

308
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,670
So it was true.

309
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:58,440
What Yeo Ji said was true.

310
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,520
Your Highness, why do you stoop...

311
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,680
Everyone get back!

312
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:13,340
Do you hear me? Don't you dare touch so much as a hair on this man's head!

313
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,930
Our apologies, but we can't comply with that.

314
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,120
Stopping the king's procession by hitting a small gong and protesting must be handled by law.

315
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,270
However...

316
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,300
Your Majesty.

317
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,380
If I listen to his request, what will happen?

318
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,450
Your Majesty.

319
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,930
So, if I, the king, would like to hear this man out

320
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:49,630
regarding this country's long-time corruption he speaks of...

321
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,940
if I choose to hear him, then what?

322
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,200
It's simple.

323
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,320
Put me on the throne.

324
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,970
Then the prisoner who is in my hands,

325
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,380
I will grind him up with a millstone and erase him from existence without a trace.

326
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,390
Your standard is low, as ever.

327
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,520
Do you believe that that is all it takes to bring down the Noron Faction?

328
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,930
I suppose not.

329
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,680
All you'd have to do is cut off those few tails.

330
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,290
But what about you?

331
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,050
How silly will you look?

332
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,210
Noron is already in a panic.

333
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,050
Will they listen to you anymore?

334
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,660
- Be careful of your words, please.
 - Why must I?

335
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,230
I've waited for this day for so long.

336
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,280
So if you don't want to become an old man in a back room  (useless, diminished old man) ,

337
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,210
persuade Noron and enthrone me.

338
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,390
Then I...

339
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,980
will at least let you live.

340
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,600
Your Excellency! Something big has happened.

341
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,600
A message from Saheonbu just arrived. It said that Saheonbu...

342
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,710
Saheonbu...

343
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,160
Turn the procession back around. I must return to the palace as soon as possible.

344
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,250
We will do as you ordered, Your Majesty.

345
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,680
It's not possible. You cannot enter any further.

346
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,820
Corruption in the civil service exam involving high Noron government officials?! It's not possible!

347
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,800
Stop the false investigation right away!

348
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,990
You really achieved it. You did.

349
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

350
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:13,060
As I promised you, Your Majesty.

351
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,310
To go further would be improper, Your Excellency. This is the Saheonbu.

352
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,700
Without interference or pressure from anyone

353
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,060
this is where crimes are ruled only by the law.

354
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,910
 So you want this? A real war?

355
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:34,530
Now the Norons will be shaken and will begin to split.

356
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:45,930

357
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,220

358
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,700
♫  You whom I love  ♫

359
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,010
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

360
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,740
 Like this, I am able to stand before you guys again.

361
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,060
 How the power-hogging Norons

362
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,590
 corrupted the civil service exam that ought to have remained the fairest system.

363
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,380
 Is this a real declaration of war? You will greatly regret it.

364
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,420
 I will become the king.

365
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,090
 You will never become the king.

366
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,510
 But at least be on the side of the people.

367
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,590
 Prince Yeoning is on the move. What are you going to do?

368
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,600
 Do you truly not know of the sinister ambition Prince Yeoning is hiding inside him?

369
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,160
 King material! King material!

370
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,660
 If I become the king no matter what method I use, that makes me king material.

371
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,860
 Who are you?

372
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,870
 Yeo Ji.

373
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,220
 Who are you?

374
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,100
♫  I break down inside of you  ♫
