1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,820
I cannot believe that Gyeongsang and Jeolla have fallen in vain like this.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
The situation in Hamgyong is nearing its end as well.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,970
It seems that our army will surrender soon.

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,910
How many remaining soldiers do we have?

5
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,710
Excluding the wounded, we only have a few hundred.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,420
- What?
 - General, at this state, resisting will be futile.

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,870
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,380
This has not ended yet.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,340
There are regional noblemen who support this cause

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,790
and the family members of the rebel soldiers remaining.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,950
Send word to each region immediately

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,900
for the family members of rebel soldiers and all those who support this rebellion

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,150
to join us at the rendezvous.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,360
Yes, General.

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,940
However, what if the gathered forces aren't enough?

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,560
In case that happens, we have to plan another path to survive.

17
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,000
I was close to beheading Lee Geum that jerk.

18
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,470
I was close to getting him to kneel at my feet.

19
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,980
It's all over!

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,380
Gyeongsang and Jeolla have all surrendered!

21
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,070
All that is left of Lee In Jwa's army is only that disorderly crowd up there!

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,520
It's...

23
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,410
It's all over.

24
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:02,280
There is no other way anymore.

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,670
No. It's not true, Yoon Yeong.

26
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,960
You saw it, too.

27
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,310
Those who cheered while looking at me.

28
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,020
My people who cried out asking me to be their king.

29
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,820
This news should have reached them,

30
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,740
so now they will rise up.

31
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,450
Of course! They will rise in rebellion for me.

32
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,390
What?

33
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,990
Yes. Yes, I believe in my people.

34
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,530
They will protect the king. This nation's true king.

35
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,290
Its people will protect him.

36
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,990
Don't lose consciousness. You will live!

37
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,020
Don't lose consciousness.

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,290
General Lee In Jwa.

39
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,110
How is the situation?

40
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,150
The remaining soldiers on our side

41
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,380
are only a few hundred, I heard.

42
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,880
Is that really true?

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,520
It's not that worrisome yet,

44
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,480
so you don't have to be anxious.

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,880
We still have enough troops remaining.

46
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:32,950
Right. As expected, we should.

47
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,590
Your Majesty,

48
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,980
all of the court officials have arrived at the palace.

49
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,130
Your Majesty, what do you mean by that?

50
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,880
You won't punish the rebel soldiers' family members and those who sympathized with them?

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,910
Are you saying that you won't charge them for their crime?

52
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,380
That is right. We will catch all of the rebels who participated themselves,

53
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,020
but implicating relatives and family members by association will be forbidden.

54
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,430
What...

55
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,990
In addition, I will make sure that

56
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,200
random state tribunals are not held on purpose to execute criminals

57
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,560
and tracking down the ones who sympathized with the rebellion to punish them will be strictly forbidden.

58
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,860
Your Majesty, this was an unprecedented large scale rebellion that fought against the royal court.

59
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,640
It's only right that you set an example by punishing them as a warning to the others.

60
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,440
Severe punishment is not always the right solution, Left State Councilor.

61
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,480
In addition, I believe that this decision will be effective

62
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,960
in rounding up the remaining rebels.

63
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,390
Is this true?

64
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,320
They're going to let our town be even though we let the rebels just pass through?

65
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,170
Is it true? There are people who fed the rebels and labored for them,

66
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,820
but they won't be punished?

67
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,370
Yes, I'm saying that's how it will be.

68
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,990
Due to his grace, know that all of your lives are saved.

69
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,880
In addition, I decree that the relatives and family members of the rebels shall not be

70
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,730
found guilty by association and punished for the crime.

71
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,080
Charging regional noblemen with crime

72
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,000
just because they interacted with the rebels will be strictly forbidden.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,550
Through this, we will reform the nation so that the noblemen and the people

74
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,120
can work hard in their studies and work.

75
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,490
- It's a relief.
 - Is this true?

76
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,910
This time, too, you look like you were thrown off guard by His Majesty.

77
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,790
By forgiving the rebel sympathizers,

78
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,190
he will stop them from joining the remaining rebel soldiers.

79
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,460
It's true. It's an excellent political move that throws people off guard.

80
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,300
However, is that only a political strategy?

81
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,050
Deciding to give opportunities in the government to Namin.

82
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,600
Forgiving those who sympathized with the rebellion, too.

83
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,170
Often, some political moves come not from the head

84
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,730
but from the heart.

85
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,760
That's why those who only use their heads get slapped in the back of their heads  (outwitted) .

86
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,010
One who uses his head instead of his heart.

87
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,680
Are you talking about me?

88
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,060
Gosh, did I hit the mark too hard?

89
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,230
How is the current situation?

90
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,070
It seems that your judgment was right.

91
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,160
The hearts of the people in the areas where rebellions have occurred are stabilizing quickly.

92
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,520
However, it is not over yet.

93
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,280
No. Lee In Jwa and Prince Milpoong who have escaped still remain at large, Your Majesty.

94
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,370
We must capture both of them.

95
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:45,330
As long as they are alive, a rebellious spirit will lift its head again.

96
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,520
Where are Lee In Jwa, Prince Milpoong, and the remaining rebels?

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,470
There must be a rendezvous that was promised.

98
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,500
Why do you think that I will share that?

99
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,820
Perhaps if I tell you that, you will let me live? Is that it?

100
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,010
If that is the deal, I will consider it.

101
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,770
Wi Byeong Joo.

102
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,910
Hey, you have a way to reach His Majesty, don't you?

103
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,860
Persuade him. If you can save my life,

104
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,170
I will tell you where the two are hiding immediately.

105
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,670
At one point, I pitied you.

106
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,970
Was it at the Uigeumbu?

107
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,440
You even said such words.

108
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
 Would you have behaved differently

109
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,820
 if you were in my shoes?

110
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,200
 If only I could've had my ability acknowledged,

111
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,940
 I wouldn't have come to this.

112
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,490
 I could have been like you.

113
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:11,100
Yes, please pity me, Inspector Park.

114
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,060
If I can only avoid decapitation, I will hand those two bastards over to you.

115
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,440
But, no.

116
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,750
Some human beings deserve pity and understanding.

117
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,720
Those who at least know how to repent.

118
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,530
Those who do not blame others but know how to look back on their own wrongful actions.

119
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:40,270
Unlike you, they don't sell others, until the end, so that they can get off.

120
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,500
Look here, Inspector Park...

121
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,810
Decapitation?

122
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,610
Don't you think that's an overly ambitious dream?

123
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,930
This nation's law sentences those who are guilty of high treason, like you, to death by quartering.

124
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,440
What?  Park Moon Soo...

125
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,200
Park Moon Soo... Park Moon Soo!

126
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,260
Inspector Park!

127
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,660
No, no!  Investigator Kim, you know me well.

128
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,270
I'm Wi Byeong Joo.  I am Wi Byeong Joo!

129
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,590
No, no!  No!  Let go of me.  Let go of me!

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,360
They are coming over there.

131
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,490
You are here.  You worked hard.

132
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,550
General...

133
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,050
But this is it?  How about the rest of the reinforcement troops?

134
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,030
You can't be saying this is it.

135
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,930
It's because of the king.

136
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,670
He brought around the regional noblemen and people to his side, so nobody came forward.

137
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,040
Yoon Yeong.

138
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,480
Where did she go?

139
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,030
Yoon Yeong.

140
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,030
Your Majesty.

141
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,150
You...

142
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,490
How could you come here?

143
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,970
Even if I die, I wanted to die by your hand.

144
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,670
- Bok Dan... 
- Isn't this how it should be, though?

145
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:07,070
I should give you at least this kind of gift before dying.

146
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,540
You are telling me to go down the mountain and gather up people?

147
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,390
That is right.  If Your Majesty would encourage them personally,

148
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,950
wouldn't they come forward?

149
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,500
However, wouldn't below the mountain be swarming with government soldiers?

150
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,480
- That's a bit dangerous... 
- Have you forgotten already

151
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,860
the people who tearfully sang Your Majesty's praises?

152
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,030
Right now, everyone is hiding with bated breath because of the government soldiers' swords.

153
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,700
But if Your Majesty would lead them, everyone will follow.

154
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,670
The one we can trust and rely on right now is only Your Majesty.

155
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:53,170
Right now, Your Majesty must become the force leading the people.

156
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,490
They trust me and rely on me?

157
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,560
Dal Moon at this hour?

158
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,760
Yes.  He said he must speak to you personally about an urgent matter.

159
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,210

160
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,810
You... What did you just say?  Who's here?

161
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,100
Chae Yoon Yeong, Prince Milpoong's mistress who had escaped.

162
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,930
That person

163
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,980
is here with me right now, Your Majesty.

164
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,410
But why?

165
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,650
In that case, you can hand her over to Uiguembu or the Police Bureau.

166
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,790
Why tell me about this?

167
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,670
Chae Yoon Yeong brought information about where Lee In Jwa and Prince Milpoong are.

168
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,830
She informed me of the place.

169
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,760
If you give your order,

170
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,000
I will turn Chae Yoon Yeong over to the Royal Guards here now

171
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,650
because she has committed sins for which she cannot repay even with death.

172
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,090
However, Your Majesty,

173
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,980
please...

174
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,070
Please, won't you be able to spare just her life?

175
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,220
Dal Moon!

176
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,390
I know I neither can

177
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,390
nor should ask you this.

178
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,210
What deeds she has engaged in,

179
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,170
what horrendous crimes she has committed...

180
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes, I know it better than anybody else.

181
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,420
Despite it all, I

182
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,200
don't think

183
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,790
I can bear to watch her die.

184
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,950
Even though I know clearly

185
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,160
what she did and what kind of person she is...

186
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,050
Even though I know her completely,

187
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,700
still...

188
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,790
still her death...

189
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,950
Your Majesty.

190
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,990
Yeo Ji!

191
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,540
The king's palace was lit, so I came in to check just in case.

192
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,750
But is something the matter?

193
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,190
Why are you still in your work robe?

194
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,980
Yes,

195
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,520
Dal Moon must also

196
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,520
feel this way.

197
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,930
No matter what happens,

198
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,480
one person...

199
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,020
just one person that he wants to protect.

200
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,020
I am speaking of such a heart.

201
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,690
Just as I am

202
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,210
toward you.

203
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,200
Your Majesty...

204
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,020
This should be enough to buy a small house.

205
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,980
No matter where you go, you will need the means to survive.

206
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,710
I don't need it.

207
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,720
I never begged you to save my life.

208
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,370
Consider your acceptance of this as your gift to me.

209
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,650
I have to do this so I can erase you.

210
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,430
Go.

211
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,020
He will take you to the ferry dock.

212
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,680
You could have held onto me.

213
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,820
If you were going to save my life,

214
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,480
you could have forgiven me too.

215
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,920
Chae Yoon Yeong disclosed the whereabouts of the traitors?

216
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,260
They are hiding over there.

217
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,510
Go arrest Lee In Jwa and Prince Milpoong right now.

218
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,750
Without fail, I will capture them alive, Your Majesty.

219
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,400
How about the local government office?

220
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,720
I have arranged it so that around the time Prince Milpoong gets there, they will get hold of the information.

221
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,810
Fine.  That is when we leave this place.

222
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,460
Right when all the government soldiers are busy trying to catch Prince Milpoong,

223
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,610
we will get out of this place.

224
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,970
Yes, General.

225
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,500
Hurry up.

226
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,850
We must get down there quickly and gather up the people.

227
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

228
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,410
Since we got out of the capital at least, you should be alright.

229
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,500
Wait here for a little bit.  I will go see if there is any boat we can use at the ferry dock.

230
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,190
What is going on?

231
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,660
Why is Prince Milpoong...

232
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,200
Is it here where the local noblemen who'd help me will come to meet me?

233
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,690
Yes, if we wait here, the Namin noblemen we had contacted before will come.

234
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,670
Your Majesty can go with them.

235
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,090
Then I will go and scope out the area just in case of any danger.

236
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,650
Okay, I see.

237
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,230
Work hard.

238
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,190
What?  Government soldiers?

240
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,470
So we should use the stage station rather than the ferry dock.

241
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,800
The local government office here seems to have gotten intelligence about traitor Prince Milpoong's appearance.

242
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,750
The ferry dock is crawling with government soldiers right now.

243
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,070
 Prince Milpoong?

244
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,800
 How? Why would Prince Milpoong alone—

245
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,160
 Can it be... Lee In Jwa, that jerk...

246
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,660
 using Prince Milpoong as a decoy?

247
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,760
Hurry up. Move to the rendezvous point as quickly as possible.

248
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,980
What time is it?

249
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,620
Why aren't the ones who are coming here yet?

250
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,570
Not yet.

251
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,910
No, run away.  You are a scapegoat.

252
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,910
They are throwing you under the wagon so they can live.

253
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,010
Let's go.  The horse is ready.

254
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,120
 It's all over, Yoon Yeong.

255
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,410
 No!  It's not over.

256
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,080
 Who says it's over?

257
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,880
 Prince Yeoning.

258
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,580
 This is all because of that scum!

259
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,890
 That scum ruined me.

260
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,910
 You're not ruined.

261
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:46,160
 You can reclaim the royal throne anytime!

262
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,140
 It was hard to convince that bi*ch.

263
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,960
 You can do it well, right?

264
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,140
 You should be next to me when I am seated on the throne, right?

265
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,270
 As this country's new queen that is.

266
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,740
 At your request, I diligently

267
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,490
 saved the bastards I wanted to kill

268
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,510
 and did as much as I could.

269
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,050
 King material!  King material!

270
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,770
 So I could prove that I'm king material!

271
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,140
You fool...

272
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:33,020
You foolish piteous clown.

273
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,130
No matter how much I think about it,

274
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,920
this is a bit odd.

275
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,820
Somehow...

276
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,280
Go and see why nobody is coming yet.

277
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

278
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,050
Prince Milpoong!

279
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,390
Yoon Yeong!

280
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,340
Yoon Yeong.

281
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,970
Just in case, we have to stay alert to the highest degree.

282
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,690
Search all the surrounding areas.

283
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,220
Yes, General.

284
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,200
Lee In Jwa!

285
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,750
You are...

286
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,300
General...

287
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,620
Everyone, put down your swords.

288
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,800
If you surrender, at least your lives will be spared.

289
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,010
Don't listen to him!

290
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,510
It's all a lie.

291
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,130
The moment you drop your swords, you are dead.

292
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,300
Raise your swords.

293
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,850
Raise your swords now!

294
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,950
What are you doing?

295
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,330
I said hold your sword.

296
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,860
Hurry and hold your sword!

297
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,780
Raise your sword.  Raise your sword, I said!

298
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,330
It is all over now.

299
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:25,070
This crazy circus of yours.

300
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,150
 Here comes His Majesty!

301
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,720
Your Majesty!

302
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,660
I finally see you,

303
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:44,340
the rebel head, Lee In Jwa.

304
00:29:52,030 --> 00:30:02,020

305
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,380

306
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:11,300
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫

307
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:18,160
♫  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  ♫
