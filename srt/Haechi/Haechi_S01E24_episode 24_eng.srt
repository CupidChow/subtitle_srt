1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,270
What the heck are you doing as the lead inspector?

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,000
How can you assign such a case to Park Moon Soo?

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,710
I thought it was a simple disturbance of public morals case because of a delayed funeral.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,930
Do you even know what you did?

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,100
Kwon Ik Soo!  Behind this matter is the section chief of the Ministry of the Interior.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,620
Pardon?

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,620
Is something the matter?

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,590
Why would you go around snooping a case that the police bureau closed?

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,450
I did?

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,990
I simply checked on a public morals—

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,910
Stop it now!  I am telling you to get your hands off of the case.

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,960
Are you alright?

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,660
I'm fine.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,180
Who are you?  Get out of the way.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,880
This... hurts a little.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,190
But if this lessens your anger,

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,990
may I continue with the investigation?

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,560
One chick hopping around barefoot doesn't make it spring.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
I, the deputy inspector general, have ordered you to stop now.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,750
Yes, I want to stop too but it's become a bit tricky, Lord Deputy Inspector General.

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,420
- Tricky?
 - Yes.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,550
Even if I want to follow your order,

23
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,950
the culprit has already been apprehended.

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,820
The culprit who killed the police bureau constable Ma Sang Tae.

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,690
The person who ordered him to do so.

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,330
I and my skillful men have already apprehended all of them.

27
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,160
This is the butler of Kwon Ik Soo, section chief of the Ministry of the Interior.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,480
I will take him to an interrogation room.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,200
You've heard, right?

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,760
This case has just changed from edification of public morals

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,370
to an investigation of murder and corruption involving Kwon Ik Soo, section chief of the Ministry of the Interior.

32
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,900
Since I caught the culprit, I can wrap up the case, right?

33
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,390
You! Park Moon Soo...

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,060
So what happens if Park Moon Soo proves the charges against the section chief of the interior?

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,120
His Majesty will gain a chance.

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,170
Since the section chief of the interior will be impeached,

37
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,630
we can replace him, the one that has the right to appoint officials to the Three Offices  (Saheonbu, Saganwon, and Hongmoongwan) .

38
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,830
If this case goes public, we Sorons

39
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,580
may even be able to fill that position.

40
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,400
But do you think the Norons and His Excellency Min Jin Heon

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,660
will easily give up the position of the section chief of the interior?

42
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,790
It's a position that the Norons have monopolized for a long time.

43
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:50,590
So excuse my insolence, but may I tell you about my idea?

44
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,760
I mean a method that can make this rarely seized chance

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,070
work out the way His Majesty wants.

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,060
Did you deliver my message directly?

47
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,700
Yes.

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,000
He has already arrived over there.

49
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,740
Your Highness Crown Prince?

50
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,920
Can you do it?

51
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,050
But the section chief of the Ministry of the Interior?

52
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,440
How dare I take on such an important position?

53
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,830
Yoon Hyeok, an inspector at Saheonbu who placed first in the civil service exam

54
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,250
and a scion of a highly respected Noron family.

55
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,350
But you yourself are impartial toward any political faction and unmoved by political or social currents.

56
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,540
That is the reason why I recommended you.

57
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,000
A person who belongs to Noron but without personal ambitions or partiality.

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,530
That's enough to overcome the Noron's objections

59
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,310
and even to carry out the reforms His Majesty wants.

60
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,750
Are you saying you recommended me?

61
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,600
Of course it will be a difficult decision

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,930
because if you become the section chief of the interior and wield your sword,

63
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,510
you will become everyone's target.

64
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,630
However, if that is you, I believe

65
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,520
you will aid His Majesty in his fight against

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,980
the long-standing corruption of the Three Offices.

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,370
How far are you determined to go?

68
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,320
It will become a road more difficult for you and His Majesty than for me.

69
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,570
But even so, if you give me your word that you'll pursue it to the end,

70
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,940
I will gladly take on the duty.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,390
Inspector Yoon!

72
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,480
In the end, your butler confessed the crime to Saheonbu?

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,570
I am sorry, Your Excellency!  I committed a wrong for which I ought to die.

74
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,350
The bribery charge cannot be helped.

75
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,890
But at least the murder charge, even if my butler has to lose his life for it,

76
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,810
- he won't mention my name—
 - Even if you have to lose your life for it!

77
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,920
The one who ought to have protected the Noron was you, not your underlings.

78
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,170
Bribe-taking!  You can't even engage in that dirty act discreetly so you make a huge mistake?!

79
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,840
Do you even know what trouble you caused?

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Now the Soron will use this excuse and aim for the next section chief of the interior position!

81
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,900
Your Excellency!

82
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,920
I will meet with Right State Councilor Jo Tae Goo and negotiate with the Soron,

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,140
because we can't just give it all up to them.

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,410
Wait just a little bit more, Your Excellency Min.

85
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,440
Soon you will need me.

86
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
You are here?

87
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,550
Your Highness Crown Prince!

88
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,360
Your Highness.

89
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,960
So you are all here.

90
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,740
Is that true?  Inspector Yoon will become the section chief of the interior?

91
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,860
Tomorrow, His Majesty's order will be handed down.

92
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,510
Moon Soo, you've scored big.

93
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,020
Because of that case, the Norons were cornered and had no choice but to compromise.

94
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,590
I am happy that I was of assistance.

95
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,270
It turned out well.

96
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,890
Inspector Yoon will become an upright section chief.

97
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,000
I, too, believe in him.

98
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,060
The long-standing problem of Saheonbu lay in the power to control the personnel.

99
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,570
And the person in charge of it is the section chief of the interior.

100
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,860
That's why Noron's have been defending that position to the end.

101
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,860
The original reason that kind of authority was given to a section chief

102
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,730
was to prevent high-ranking officials from getting involved with the appointment of personnel.

103
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,490
Any system will have a loophole.

104
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,160
Norons will be up in arms.  Will it be alright?

105
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,640
I will also help His Majesty, so don't worry.

106
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,690
Rather than that, will you scope out what Prince Milpoong is up to?

107
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,550
Prince Milpoong?

108
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,750
Not only is he obstructing Moon Soo and Yeo Ji,

109
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,310
but also he's not the type who will just do nothing.

110
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,500
I understand.

111
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,690
Through Dal Moon, I will keep you informed about the situations in the palace.

112
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,800
Yes, be safe on your way back, Your Highness.

113
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,480
Okay.  Everyone...

114
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,810
Anyway, I'll be on my way.

115
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,920
Your Highness, just a moment.

116
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,600
I have something to talk to you about separately.

117
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,060
- To me?
 - Yes.

118
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,050
Let's wrap it up here and return to Saheonbu, too.

119
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,390
Ah Bong, about the man question Yeo Ji asked...

120
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,380
Was it, by any chance, about man and woman holding hands

121
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,940
and perhaps doing something more?

122
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,930
What?  What an inconceivable...

123
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,230
How did you know?  Did she ask you, too?

124
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,550
Hey!  Why are you acting this way today?  Why do you keep joking?

125
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,060
So?  So what did Yeo Ji say?

126
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,030
And what did you say?

127
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,890
I am sorry, Yeo Ji.

128
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,630
- That night, I... 
- Why did you do that?

129
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,770
What you did to me that night...

130
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,600
What I'm thinking, is that really the case?

131
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,710
 Hey, Ah Bong, go on and tell me.

132
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,010
Gosh, seriously, what could I have said?

133
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,150
I told her as it is.

134
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,180
As it is?

135
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,880
Cheon Yeo Ji, you really don't know?

136
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,460
When a man acts like that toward a woman, it can mean only one thing.

137
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,420
What... did you just say?

138
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,810
Ah Bong said that there is only one reason men would act that way toward me.

139
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,390
"You... are you that strong?"

140
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:22,330
"How strong can you be? Let's fight to see!" Something like that.

141
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,580
"Let's fight to see?"

142
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,800
If a man grabs Cheon Yeo Ji, pulls her close, and glares at her,

143
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,220
then he's trying to psych her out before the fight.

144
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,340
I think Ah Bong is correct, too.

145
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:49,230
Okay. It seems like you're right, you fools.

146
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,700
Why did I even ask?

147
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,320
Psyching you out?

148
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,710
So what I did to you... was trying to psych you out?

149
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:06,570
But I didn't realize that... and misunderstood unnecessarily.

150
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,120
That perhaps Your Highness had different feelings for me.

151
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,760
- That's...
 - I know. It doesn't make sense.

152
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,650
So that's why I was a little confused.

153
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,850
But Your Highness,

154
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,820
you can't trust me that much?

155
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,070
That's why you tried to test my skills?

156
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,400
No, Yeo Ji. That's not what I—

157
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,340
I'm Cheon Yeo Ji. A human weapon.

158
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,280
I really can do it well.

159
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,130
By becoming a palace maid, I want to protect you by being by your side.

160
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,280
What did I do?

161
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,690
- With you who are like this. 
- Pardon?

162
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,040
In the end, it turns out like this,

163
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,750
but I could not sleep through the night because of it?

164
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,750
Your skills are enough.

165
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,870
But you still can't be a palace maid.

166
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,020
As it has been, women should be protected by men.

167
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,240
Before I'm a woman, I'm a damo  (tea maid, female investigator) .

168
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,970
Before I'm the crown prince, what if I'm a man?

169
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,060
Pardon?

170
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,280
Yes.

171
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,890
Even if it is like this, it's nice.

172
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,900
Feeling the same wind as you,

173
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,570
even if you don't have the same feelings as I do.

174
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:02,980
♫  A feeling of longing hangs at my fingertips  ♫

175
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:10,060
♫  And it calls for you to me  ♫

176
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:16,750
♫  This whisper that calls for me  ♫

177
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:23,300
♫  Is it you who are waiting for me?  ♫

178
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,910
♫  You whom I love  ♫

179
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:36,680
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

180
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,280
♫  You whom I love  ♫

181
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,560
 I'm sorry.

182
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,990
 What am I doing to you?

183
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,490
 Your Highness.

184
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:55,570
♫  So that I cannot forget you, so I cannot erase you  ♫

185
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:03,470
♫  So I would have to remember you even in my dreams  ♫

186
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,060
 By chance, does His Highness like Yeo Ji?

187
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:16,490
♫  I become tears  ♫

188
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,620
 Rather than that, will you scope out what Prince Milpoong is up to?

189
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Hyung-nim.

190
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,420
Yes, Goon Tae. Get people tomorrow right away to track Prince Mil—

191
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,830
Before that, wait. Can we talk?

192
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,590
You.

193
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,740
We have something to talk about.

194
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,670
That's why you came by, isn't it?

195
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,880
What are you doing?

196
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,320
How can you come here? How can you...

197
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,520
You missed me.

198
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,380
That's why you came to see that person.

199
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,400
Me? I am fine.

200
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,530
Like you said, I'm doing well.

201
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,860
The silk dress, the palace-sized house,

202
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,100
I shouldn't have been a low-born from the start!

203
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,890
You haven't changed.

204
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,880
At all.

205
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,260
Go home. If Prince Milpoong knows that you are here—

206
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,680
He knows, too.

207
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,390
I told Prince Milpoong that I would convince you and bring you to him.

208
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,120
- Yoon Bok Dan. 
- It's Chae Yoon Yeong!

209
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,670
Who I am now is Chae Yoon Yeong.

210
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,520
So help Prince Milpoong, Dal Moon.

211
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,940
So that Prince Milpoong can become the king.

212
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,690
Stop it. Okay?

213
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,030
How can you be this cruel and tenacious?

214
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,010
Up to what are you willing to do?

215
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,750
You didn't know?

216
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,350
That I'm a cruel person.

217
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,030
You also knew how bad I am.

218
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,660
Even though you knew, you rescued me and protected me

219
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,500
for a long period of ten years.

220
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,990
If Prince Milpoong does not gain the throne, then I will die, too.

221
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,620
So please. Help me, Dal Moon.

222
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,230
Alright, stay still.

223
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,500
Gosh, look at him.

224
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,440
This is great.

225
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,160
Keep sending them the most expensive alcohol that this gisaeng house has.

226
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,520
They're valuable horses that will take me to the palace in the future.

227
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,700
Who are those people that you're doing this?

228
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,120
Why does it matter for you to know?

229
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,060
Just do what I order.

230
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,940
Now go out and bring back a nobleman who can write well.

231
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,300
It's finally the time for me to step forward.

232
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:26,240
Five-hundred nyang. I can't make it any cheaper.

233
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,630
You are so blinded by greed that you will fall into the hell of iron beds.

234
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,630

235
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,390
Oh, you came!

236
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,510
How is it? Is it to your liking?

237
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,700
Of course!

238
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,690
Have a drink.

239
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,150
Yoon Hyeok as the section chief of the interior?

240
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,820
How! How could this be?!

241
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,740
Deputy Inspector General.

242
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,340
Yoon Hyeok is a stubborn person who won't listen to anything!

243
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,740
Saheonbu's staffing is in that kind of person's hands?!

244
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,500
Calm down, Your Excellency.

245
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,510
What's the point? It's just Yoon Hyeok alone.

246
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,620
Just him alone? What about His Majesty? The crown prince? The Soron?

247
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,220
This is saying that they're going to war against Saheonbu!

248
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,130
Yes! That's true! It's war!

249
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,730
They, who have had a bone to pick with Saheonbu all along, are asking for a fight.

250
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,890
So if we don't want to get eaten here, pull yourself together!

251
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,570
What about the other officers? Do they seem shaken up?

252
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,070
What do I do?

253
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,790
I should have been nicer to him on a daily basis.

254
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,120
Hey, did I berate him that much?

255
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,100
Yes, a lot.

256
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,610
I'm going to go crazy, gosh...

257
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,720
How was I supposed to know this would happen?

258
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,090
That a world where Yoon Hyeok becomes the section chief of the interior would arrive!

259
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,630
Lord Yoon Hyeok.

260
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,500
How is the atmosphere?

261
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,990
It's crazy. All of them worrying about their necks.

262
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,260
They are sunbaes but so pathetic.

263
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,860
Imagine if they worried about our nation as much!

264
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,150
Do you think this will actually change the Saheonbu?

265
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,800
What if we unsheathed our swords but couldn't strike?

266
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,130
I know. We will be struck instead.

267
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,400
So that we can win, we must gather more strength.

268
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,220
Do you understand?

269
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,650
Let's go.

270
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,330
How is the movement on Saheonbu's side?

271
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,060
They are greatly shaken. Inspectors, of course,

272
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,540
and especially the high-ranking officials who are directly affected.

273
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,930
Saganwon  (Office of Censors)  is the same. The censors are in confusion.

274
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,420
How could they hand over the appointment power to such a person?

275
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,630
There are times when we will be pushed back without a choice!

276
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,970
What is important right now is to minimize our sacrifice.

277
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,680
Your Highness.

278
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,860
Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior are on their way.

279
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,060
Y-You have been looking for us, Y-Your Highness?

280
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,510
Welcome, Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior.

281
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,040
We've been a bit distant from one another, haven't we?

282
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,070
When the ones who put me in this seat were you two.

283
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,570
- Pardon?
 - Pardon?

284
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,420
Let's go inside.

285
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,320
Okay.

286
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,420
Why is he like this all of a sudden?

287
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,730
He needs political influence, that's why.

288
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,890
Because a war has started, he is looking to gain one more to his side.

289
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,800

290
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,090
The prime minister and minister of the interior will, in the end, stand by my side

291
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,700
because they know it is too late to turn back.

292
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,980
The Sorons are uniting as well.

293
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,770
This kind of opportunity will not come easily. Before they retaliate—

294
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:26,010
Your Highness the Crown Prince, it seems that I have run into you here.

295
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:35,630
After you have come into the palace, there is no day of sleep for the wind  (no uneventful day) .

296
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,110
When it comes to politics, stability is the utmost priority.

297
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,630
To those who fear change, it would be,

298
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,800
if they have something to lose because of the stirred wind.

299
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,580
You believe that you are different from the others,

300
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,520
when it would be already a great achievement if you did just as well as the others.

301
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,720
The Norons must seem foolish in your eyes.

302
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,360
That you will not become like them, that you will not end up in their state,

303
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,300
that you will practice a different kind of politics. You must be confident about these.

304
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,320
What do you... want to say, Left State Councilor?

305
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,900
Foolish ones generally think that they can achieve something different than the others.

306
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,170
Do you know why?

307
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:24,100
Because they are foolish, they do not know their own skill and limit.

308
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,080
Left State Councilor, watch your words!

309
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,560
How could you in front of the crown prince—

310
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,620
No! Do not interfere!

311
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,470
I will listen to all of Left State Councilor's words.

312
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,510
However, Your Highness—

313
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,110
Speak, Left State Councilor.

314
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:57,450
I will listen to more of the arrogant words you speak.

315
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,410
That I am foolish, that I should know my place.

316
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:14,270
Is that your loyal advice that you dare to give to me, the crown prince?

317
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Of course not. I would not dare.

318
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,750
However if you allow me to

319
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,510
I will give a piece of advice with due respect.

320
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,450
Do you think the Sorons are different?

321
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,760
Just do as well as the others did, Your Highness.

322
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,190
That alone is good enough.

323
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,010
"It will be nice to do just as well as the Norons did."

324
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:49,030
"Doing just as well as them will keep this nation safe."

325
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:54,170
Soon, you will know that to be true.

326
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,810
This petition is written very well.

327
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:13,360
Sentence after sentence, it is written beautifully.

328
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,110
Prince Milpoong has made a move. What should we do, Hyung-nim?

329
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,880
Chief Royal Secretary, My Lord, look at this.

330
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,150
What is it?

331
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,820
You need to see it immediately.

332
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,830
What is this?

333
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,540
Who dared to write this subversive petition?

334
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,920
Does this man wish to die, accused of treason?!

335
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,190
Your Excellency, we have to submit this petition to His Majesty.

336
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,030
I knew this day would come in the end

337
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,980
the more power the crown prince gained!

338
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,730
In the end, this actually happened!

339
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,070
 You believe that you are different from the others.

340
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,370
 "It will be nice to do just as well as the Norons did."

341
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,500
 "Doing just as well as them will keep this nation safe."

342
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,510
 Soon, you will know that to be true.

343
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,420
 No, Min Jin Heon. I will never become like you.

344
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,500
Crown Prince, you were here.

345
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,130
Prince Milpoong.

346
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,350
I entered the palace to see you,

347
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,400
but you weren't at your quarters, so I have been looking for you for a while.

348
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,990
Pavilion where the wind blows...

349
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,750
Don't you think you're being too leisurely?

350
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,870
I'm not free enough to listen to your nonsense at any time.

351
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,580
For that to happen, don't you think our statuses are too different?

352
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,440
However, it would be best

353
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,270
if you listened to the rest of what I have to say.

354
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,860
How could this be?

355
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,780
How could there be such a terrible petition as this?

356
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:48,930
That is why I told you before to not protect the crown prince.

357
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,650
In the end, it becomes a dagger like this and returns to you, Your Majesty.

358
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,480
How dare... how dare they request regency?

359
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,190
When Your Majesty is still so young!

360
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,940
How could there be such cruel words

361
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,690
asking for the crown prince to take over the nation's affairs?

362
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,230
Headwind.

363
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,900
Soon at this palace,

364
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:24,190
there will be a headwind that will blow you away.

365
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,970
Headwind?

366
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,200
Hyung-nim, what should we do about Prince Milpoong?

367
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,420
Nothing.

368
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,290
What?

369
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,720
Nothing.

370
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,790
What are you talking about, Tan?

371
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,290
Just what did you...

372
00:28:53,290 --> 00:29:01,890

373
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,430

374
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:09,830
♫  You whom I love  ♫

375
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:14,840
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

376
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,670
 It was just one petition arguing for regency.

377
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,540
 So I would look like a laughable king to you.

378
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,280
 How could you...

379
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,260
 When engulfed by passion and desire, they can't see anything else.

380
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,110
 From this moment on, I, Inspector Park Moon Soo,

381
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,490
 have been ordered to investigate Deputy Inspector General Wi Byeong Joo's corruption.

382
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,080
 You must punish the crime so that treason can never again raise its ugly head.

383
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,010
 Execute as the royal command states.

384
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,450
 Why must His Highness...

385
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,130
 At last, has it become possible for me to give you what you want?

386
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,730
 Change His Majesty's heart.
