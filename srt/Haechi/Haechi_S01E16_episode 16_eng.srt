1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,080
 No, Yeo Ji. Yeo Ji!

2
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,030
Yeo Ji!

3
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,900
Lord Moon Soo.

4
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,470
This bastard.

5
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,860
No! Avoid him!

6
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,760
Yeo Ji.

7
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,600
If your legs are broken, you won't be able to stand.

8
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Even if you can't feel any pain...

9
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,950
Yeo Ji, you...

10
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,150
My Lord, were you hurt?

11
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,650
You rascal, the one who got hurt isn't me but you!

12
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,890
I was injured only a little—

13
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,120
Yeo Ji. Yeo Ji!

14
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,450
You rascal, don't you dare die.

15
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,720
If you die—

16
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,250
My Lord, let me carry her now. You've already—

17
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,750
No. I will save this rascal.

18
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,450
- What about a doctor?
 - Yes, Doctor Jang from Gyedong is headed over there.

19
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,920
- Dal Moon!
 - Your Highness.

20
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,400
Where's Yeo Ji? Where is she right now?

21
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,430
Oh my. Yeo Ji. Yeo Ji...

22
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,460
Oh my. How is she? Is she okay?

23
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,980
She will live, right?

24
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,700
Doctor, please...

25
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,850
- Wake up.
 - Yeo Ji.

26
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,400
Moon Soo!

27
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,710
- Moon Soo.
 - Hyung-nim.

28
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,250
- Hyung-nim, why are you— 
- How is Yeo Ji?

29
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,320
Are you okay, Yeo Ji?

30
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,130
Hey, don't get up. You're not—

31
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,810
I'm fine. Rather, how is His Highness?

32
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,970
Your Highness.

33
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,830
How are you here? What about the palace?

34
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,860
How...

35
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,800
How could this happen?

36
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,230
It's nothing.

37
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,530
Do not worry about it.

38
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,340
Did you say it's nothing?

39
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,920
When you're hurt like this?

40
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
On my way here, do you know how much I...

41
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,290
how much I...

42
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,100
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,480
It's all because of me.

44
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,060
In the end, you're like this because of me.

45
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,870
What are you saying?

46
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,830
Rather, it's a relief.

47
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:44,280
It's such a relief that the person who was hurt isn't you but me.

48
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,660
Here.

49
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,960
- This is information from the palace?
 - Yes, the king's decree has been handed down.

50
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,260
What are the contents?

51
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,470
Y-You're looking for His Highness?

52
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,960
That doesn't make sense. The royal guards? Why?

53
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,860
No way... is Prince Yeoning being charged with treason?

54
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,960
We don't know the exact content of the king's decree yet.

55
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,620
However, just in case, you should hide for now.

56
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,660
No.

57
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,210
I won't do that.

58
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,370
Your Highness.

59
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,710
- What is it?
 - Why are you pushing your way in?!

60
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,020
Let's talk first. Hey!

61
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,450
Where do you think you're forcing your way into?

62
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,150
What are you doing? What are you trying to do?

63
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,880
Step back, Moon Soo.

64
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,340
But Hyung-nim!

65
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:30,740
You... came looking for me, Commandant of the Royal Guards.

66
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,360
Please forgive our sudden rudeness.

67
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,830
I will obey the royal command.

68
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,080
Give it to me, Commandant.

69
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,100
Hyung-nim!

70
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,050
I, Commandant of the Royal Guards, under the king's command,

71
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,250
greet the crown prince.

72
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,470
In addition, under His Majesty's command,

73
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,960
from this moment on, your safety as the crown prince will be guarded by us.

74
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,210
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

75
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,960
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

76
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,690
Crown Prince?

77
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,060
Crown Prince?

78
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,570
D-Did you all hear that?

79
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,200
It wasn't just me, right?

80
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,180
Yes, I heard it.

81
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,140
Clearly.

82
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,300
He called Prince Yeoning the crown prince, right?

83
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,830
Our hyung-nim became the crown prince, right?

84
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,600
Hyung-nim... no.

85
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,450
Your Highness.

86
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,010
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

87
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,790
It can't be Prince Yeoning, Your Majesty!

88
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,370
Are you trying to destroy this country?

89
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,520
Seeing that you are this upset and angry,

90
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,040
I am more certain that I made the right choice.

91
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,830
This way, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

92
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,930
Ja Dong.

93
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,410
Gosh, what is this?

94
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,580
Am I moved to tears right now?

95
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,060
How embarrassing.

96
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,180
You're a man. Don't be embarrassing.

97
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,910
Gosh, you're both the same, crying and all.

98
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,830
His Highness Prince— No, His Highness the Crown Prince is coming out.

99
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,460
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

100
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,350
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

101
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,060
You may rise.

102
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,490
Ah, okay.

103
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,850
Gosh, you punk.

104
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,310
You guys are my friends, aren't you?

105
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,450
Your Highness.

106
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,710
♫  An unimaginably painful dream  ♫

107
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:14,750
♫  Wakes me up all of a sudden  ♫

108
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:21,160
♫  A feeling of longing hangs at my fingertips  ♫

109
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,140
♫  And it calls for you to me  ♫

110
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,930
♫  This whisper that calls for me  ♫

111
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,980
♫  Is it you who are waiting for me?  ♫

112
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,240
We will accompany you to your residence until you head into the palace.

113
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,200
Okay.

114
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,030
♫  You whom I love  ♫

115
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:54,270
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

116
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:01,540
Your Highness the Crown Prince!
 ♫  You whom I love  ♫

117
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,580
♫  Shine on me again  ♫

118
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:13,640
♫  So that I cannot forget you, so I cannot erase you  ♫

119
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:21,400
♫  So I would have to remember you even in my dreams  ♫

120
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,190
♫  I break down inside of you  ♫

121
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,700
♫  I become tears  ♫

122
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:41,800
♫  I cannot erase  ♫

123
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,770
Where is my jade colored ornament? The one with the arabesque design.

124
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,740
Is this what you're talking about, Madam?

125
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,200
Yes, that's it.

126
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,050
When I enter the palace, I will have to greet the queen and the queen dowager,

127
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,340
so don't forget to pack all of the precious accessories.

128
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,090
Ah, this. Pack this too.

129
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,930
His Highness, no, the crown prince looks good in navy.

130
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,980
So he must take this one and...

131
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,040
It's okay. When he goes into the palace, he will have to get all new clothes.

132
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,290
Is that so?

133
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,090
I wanted to pack all the nice ones for him

134
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,640
since there is nothing for me to do when he leaves for the palace.

135
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,540
What do you mean? You will enter the palace together.

136
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,260
Me? How can I?

137
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,650
The crown prince's concubines are called "sohoon."

138
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,790
Sohoon. But what does that have to do with me entering the palace?

139
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,560
That's because of course—

140
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,810
What I mean is, sohoon or whatever it may be,

141
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,280
a concubine must receive grace  (have slept with)  from His Highness.

142
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,020
Pardon?

143
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,320
Oh, so you didn't know?

144
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,930
The master of the house draws bawdy pornographies with his words, but he's pretty unpracticed in real life.

145
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,650
You really must not have known.

146
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,790
Our Highness is?

147
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,460
Alright. Your medicine will be ready soon.

148
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,580
Thank you.

149
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,660
Well, well. I guess it's slowly starting to feel real for you.

150
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,890
Becoming the crown prince.

151
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,340
It's all thanks to you.

152
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,810
I won't forget what I told you.

153
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,480
I mean the promise that one day I will become the most kingly of all kings of Joseon.

154
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,850
Then there's a lot you'll need to learn from me.

155
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,320
Since the king of the streets is me, Dal Moon.

156
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,190
That palace  (gwol)  and this street  (geo-ri)  sound similar, too.

157
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,550
Now that you say it, it is so. I expect you to advise me from now on.

158
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,790
Sure.

159
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,390
Here it is.

160
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,850
You must care for that damo quite a bit.

161
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,380
What? Who? Me?

162
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,980
No. I just... felt sorry.  I did.

163
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,960
What did you mean that he cares for that damo?

164
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,920
There's something like that. You'll understand when you're older.

165
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,490
 Thank you, Ma'am!

166
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,090
Can it be?

167
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,920
What's wrong?

168
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,270
Hyung-nim! Where are you going?

169
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,940
What are you doing right now?

170
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,080
Prince Yeoning— I mean, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

171
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,250
Why are you out here? And why are you undoing the bandages?

172
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,950
I... it's all healed.

173
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,520
Come inside immediately. You must rest.

174
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,380
No, Your Highness. I'm fine.

175
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,300
Just look. I'm really completely fine.

176
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,990
Sit down. Even so, you still need to keep applying medicine.

177
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,860
Pardon?

178
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,230
I got this from the most skilled doctor in all of Hanyang.

179
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,910
Give me your arm.

180
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,850
I can put it on myself.

181
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,130
Ah Bong already told me everything.

182
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,680
Apparently, you don't like using medicine because it makes you look weak?

183
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,620
That brat Ah Bong. He's such a tattletale.

184
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,800
Having moments of weakness is no big deal.

185
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,940
Make sure you apply this every day. Morning and nigh—

186
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,230
Are you not going to apply the medicine?

187
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,550
Y-You... should probably do it.

188
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,140
I don't know exactly where it hurts for you.

189
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,420
That makes sense. It's my arm after all.

190
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,970
You did the same thing before when you were helping me with my hat tie.

191
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,870
Why do you always stop in the middle of doing things?

192
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,760
Hat tie?

193
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:06,090
 Tying it... It'll be better if you did it.

194
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,980
Where did everyone go?

195
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,350
Moon Soo!

196
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,250
Moon Soo?

197
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,330
Today is the day the new civil exam passers, after filtering out the cheaters in the past, will be posted.

198
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,490
So what does that mean?

199
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,330
Today is the day I become the civil exam's ace of course.

200
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,310
No matter how much they filtered out names, I doubt yours is going to be that high.

201
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,370
He's right. Let's just be satisfied with a reasonable runner-up placing.

202
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,300
What are you saying Jang Dal? It's me.

203
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,200
I'm the future secret royal inspector, Park Moon Soo.

204
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,550
The only appropriate spot for me is first place.

205
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,050
Yes, yes. We know.

206
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,590
Oh, it looks like they're posting it up right now.

207
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,500
Let's go take a look.

208
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,010
Apologies! My name will be easy to find,

209
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,150
so I'll be out of your way in a jiffy. Okay?

210
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,190
Pardon me. Apologies.

211
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,820
- It's here, My Lord! 
 - He's right , My Lord!

212
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,810
What?

213
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,120
It's finally me. First place goes to...

214
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,530

First place?

215
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,860
Kim Dae Seong isn't my name.

216
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,310
Not there, My Lord!

217
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,790
Over here. Here at the end!

218
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,770
It's listed at the bottom!

219
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,360
Why is my name over here?

220
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,030
Take a good look, My Lord. Park Moon Soo.

221
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,260
You passed!

222
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,290
Please forgive me, My Lord.

223
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,560
Honestly, I thought you'd fail again this time.

224
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,510
Even if every other noble in the capital passed,

225
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,310
I was sure that you, My Lord, would never ever pass!

226
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,190
He passed!

227
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,290
He passed! Look!

228
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,380
This is our lord!

229
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,160
Our lord did it!

230
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,390
My name.

231
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,570
Park Moon Soo!

232
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,160
My name is finally there.

233
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,170
Passed! Passed!

234
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm Park Moon Soo!

235
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,930
Park Moon Soo is our lord!

236
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,430
Thanks to your advice about gaining power

237
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,920
I made it all the way here.

238
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:12,570
I look forward to your continuous loyalty.

239
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,430
It's my honor to serve you, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

240
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,310
I announce that today, September 27, 1721,

241
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,540
Prince Yeoning will become the crown prince.

242
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,980
The crown prince shall uphold this nation and royal family

243
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,340
and may be called upon to rule in place of the king

244
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,930
to become the joy of this nation's numerous people.

245
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:23,460
Your grace is immeasurable.

246
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,920
I hope that the path we look toward is the same one.

247
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:47,840
I... will always follow your order, Your Majesty.

248
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,220
All civil and military officials of this court,

249
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,440
four reverent bows to the crown prince!

250
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,860
Bow.

251
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,230
Hail.

252
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,240
Bow.

253
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,610
Hail.

254
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Bow.

255
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,910
Hail.

256
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,280
Bow.

257
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,560
Hail.

258
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,510
 Haechi.

259
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,120
 Distinguishing between good and evil and protecting justice.

260
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,510
 A legendary creature.

261
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,800
 No, it's no longer a legend.

262
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,030
Let me introduce myself.

263
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:05,170
I am Saheonbu's new inspector, Park Moon Soo.

264
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,310
And now, you're all dead.

265
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,990
Rise.

266
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,780
 And now...

267
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:30,780

268
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:37,320
♫  You whom I love  ♫

269
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,570
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

270
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,130
 Even though you have become the crown prince, your position in the palace is still precarious.

271
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,720
 The current crown prince does not deserve that position!

272
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,900
 It's not because you are lowly-born.

273
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,520
 If I prove that I am king material...

274
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,390
 Park Moon Soo, that fellah won't do.  You have to kick him out right now.

275
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,070
 Why Hyung-nim Jeong Seok died...

276
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,450
 I am going to find that out, no matter what, Deputy Inspector General.

277
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,510
 An officer from the Ministry of Taxation was murdered?

278
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,390
 Are you saying they are illegally selling to Qing?

279
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,610
 Move cautiously.

280
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,280
 If you don't know when the back of your head is prickly,

281
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,450
 then you will die. That's how it is here.

282
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,470
 Who are you?

283
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,800
♫  I break down inside of you  ♫
