1
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:40,020

2
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,590
Please spare us!

3
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,590
Please spare us!

4
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,130
- What are you?
 - She's my only daughter!

5
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,650
How can you tell me to sell her for money?

6
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,090
Do you want to board that boat, too?  (in Chinese)

7
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,600
Then I'll give you five more nyang.  (in Chinese)

8
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,930
What happened to that wench who ran away?  (in Chinese)

9
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,390
Did you catch her?  (in Chinese)

10
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,510
I am being chased.  Please help me, Madam.  Madam!

11
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,950
That night, too, it snowed like this.

12
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,050
Because I, too, who was sold to become an old man's concubine,

13
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,870
smashed his head and ran away.

14
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,770
If I am sold off like this, I will end up being a Qing man's concubine as well.

15
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,300
How old are you?

16
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,540
Thirteen?

17
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,600
Fourteen?

18
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,260
Yes, I was only fourteen years old as well.

19
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,670
 - Stop there!
 - Stop!

20
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,240
 Stop!

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,970
The night, I was chased like you and stood at the brink of the world.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,210
There was a person who extended a helping hand to me.

23
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,300
But how do you think that turned out in the end?

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,680
In the end, I betrayed him

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,610
and became the beloved concubine of an old nobleman.

26
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,040
Pardon?

27
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,880
You, too, will turn out that way someday.

28
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,770
That's why I won't help you.

29
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,990
Because it's best to wake up from a pipe dream as soon as possible.

30
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,420
No, don't go!  Please help me, Madam.

31
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,820
Please save me, Madam!  Madam!

32
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,370
Madam, please don't leave me.

33
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,160
Briefly, the world will turn white too.

34
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,350
Even though it will become even more sullied later.

35
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,850
Madam, please do not go!

36
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,930
Aigo, aigo...

37
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,740
Here is your rent money!

38
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,000
- Are you satisfied now, Master!
 - You will get flogged, too, at this rate!

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,240
Let go of me!  A father who ended up selling his own daughter, what big deal is it if he gets flogged?

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,020
I'm telling you to take back this dirty money!

41
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,440
What is this?  What is this?

42
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,140
Aigo, Master!  Master!

43
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,480

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,020
Aigo, Aigo...

45
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,400

46
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,620
Wow, they must've played hard all night long.

47
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,290
Where on earth were they from?

48
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,380
That is, from Saheonbu...

49
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,770
Saheonbu?

50
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,330
Yes.

51
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,770
What was that?!

52
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,730
Please save me...

53
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,970
Save me...

54
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,730
Wh-Wh-What is all this?

55
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,260
Here, here, here, and there...

56
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,180
What is this scene all about?

57
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,650
No way... is he dead?

58
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,590
Hey, who came?

59
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,420
L-Lord Park Moon Soo?

60
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,200
- Goon Tae.
 - Why are you hanging from here like a dried fish?

61
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,170
P-Please help me, help me.

62
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,180
Those jerks...

63
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,680
I feel like dying.

64
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,910
My Saheonbu hat...  Where is my uniform hat?

65
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,100
Now that the crown prince isn't doing this, is it your turn?

66
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,600
Is this a gisaeng house or a clothing shop?

67
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,050
Oh, thank you.  By the way, what is the time?

68
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,940
It must be nearing the hour of dragon  (between 7-9 AM) .

69
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,990
What?  No!  I'm dead if I'm late.

70
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,360
The Saheonbu inspectors are undergoing hazing nowadays, right?

71
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,990
He must have been hazed all night long.  He was hanging upside down.

72
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,390
The hazing culture is strongest in the Saheonbu.

73
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,360
Do you think he can endure it?

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,750
With his persistence...

75
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,980
Oh, right, Hyung-nim.  That little girl you brought...

76
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,180
Did she come to?  How is her condition?

77
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,240
- Is our lord here yet?
 - Where is he?

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
Yeo Ji!

79
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,030
How about Lord Moon Soo?  He's still not here, right?

80
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,940
Not only him, but no new inspector has arrived yet.

81
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,020
They must have forced them to drink all night long.

82
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,690
Soon, it's going to be the time to formally greet the superiors.  If late, he's going to get destroyed.  What do we do?

83
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,940
It's war!  We protect our own boss!  Go get the tools!

84
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,380
- What the heck?
 - Sorry, sorry.

85
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,590
Is it you, Inspector Nam? Inspector Nam!

86
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,990
Inspector Park, you are late, too?!

87
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,010
Let's hurry!  We're late!

88
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,490
- This way.
 - Hey there! Inspector Nam! Inspector Park!

89
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,440
Oh! Inspector Lee! Hurry, hurry!

90
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,360
Inspector Jang, are you alright?

91
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,970
It's too late for me.  You guys, go on and save yourselves.

92
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,000
What are you talking about?  We live and die together!

93
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,810
Until what hour did you get hazed?

94
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,560
All night long!

95
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,080
Let's run.  Our goal lies just ahead.  We can't be late.

96
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,650
Let us go!  Follow me.

97
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:15,060
 Here comes the inspector general.  Everyone, greet him!

98
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,220
Deputy Inspector General!

99
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,790
Let's go, everyone.

100
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,420
Oh, are the new inspectors still in the middle of their initiation rituals?

101
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,370
By today, a few of them won't make it to the greeting ceremony.

102
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,360
- Let's go on.
 - Yes.

103
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,770
The newbies are playing hooky from the greeting ceremony because of mere gallons of alcohol?

104
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,350
I'll show you the taste of hell.  Let's go!

105
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,070
But why is...

106
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,590
Inspector General not coming?

107
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,800
What?  The roof tiles are unsafe?

108
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,650
Yes, Lord.  There are signs of the roof tiles coming undone,

109
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,490
especially over that gate.

110
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,420
Are you saying even passing through it briefly is unsafe?

111
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,790
Safety comes first, Lord.  Please wait just for a little bit.

112
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes, yes, yes.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,750
Safety comes first.

114
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,150
Lord!  Lord Moon Soo!

115
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,040
Lord!  Lord!

116
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,790
Oh, Ah Bong!

117
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,550
Lord, the rear door.  The rear door.

118
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,780

119
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,380
Run?  Run away?

120
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,850
Rear door, rear door!

121
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,110
Around?  Run around?

122
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,010
Go over?  Did you say you're going over?

123
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,170
Hey, moron.  Why would you try to guess that?

124
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,650
Because he said go over.

125
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,710
 Rear door?

126
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,850
Oh, isn't he saying rear door?  Rear door!

127
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,620
Rear door!

128
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,700
Hey!

129
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,010
What the... how did you guys make...

130
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,710
We aren't late since Inspector General isn't here yet.

131
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,830
We've passed.

132
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,790
Hey.

133
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,670
The inspector general is coming.

134
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,150
Everyone, greet the inspector general.

135
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,980
 Park Moon Soo, that fellah won't do.  You have to kick him out right now.

136
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,710
The Saheonbu is where the brightest talents of this nation gather.

137
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,350
But a guy like that becoming an inspector?  Where would that leave our reputation?

138
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,460
Park Moon Soo is that guy who placed the last in the recent civil service exam?

139
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,570
My Lord, he ill fits our dignified institution.

140
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,980
Even though I know that, what can I do?

141
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,680
They say the assignments were made as a way to straighten out the government after the civil exam corruption.

142
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,910
Additionally, he will become a headache for us.

143
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,810
You have to find a way to get rid of him, no matter what.

144
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,520
Your stomach seems to feel even queasier than mine.

145
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,460
You feel stressed because of me, right?

146
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,220
But what can be done?  I am going to keep popping up before your eyes from now on.

147
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,340
The sooner you grow accustomed to that idea, the easier your stomach will feel.

148
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,560
Why don't you get accustomed to the idea of improving your flippant language only the low-borns use?

149
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,950
This is the great Saheonbu and I'm your boss, Deputy Inspector General.

150
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,110
Why Hyung-nim Jeong Seok died...

151
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,860
I am going to find that out, no matter what, Deputy Inspector General.

152
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,410
Just saying, so you will at least remember that much.

153
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
We dare to petition with our lives on the line.

154
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,670
The current crown prince does not deserve that position!

155
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,090
Please hear our petition!

156
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,040
Please hear our petition!

157
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,190
Please hear our petition!

158
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:48,140
How pathetic!  How can they keep doing that when the political current changed a long time ago.

159
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,820
- Let's go.
 - Please hear our petition!

160
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,730
Please hear our petition!

161
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,520
Nobody came. It's just us. How!

162
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,460
How can this happen?

163
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,790
Aigo, you are all here early.

164
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,560
You are here, Prime Minister.

165
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,180
Inspector General, no, I mean, the new Minister of the Interior.

166
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,810
Not having to see Min Jin Heon here, my eyes feel so refreshed.

167
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,800
You should've gotten the minister of the interior position a long time ago.

168
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,980
Your Excellency!  It's not the time for you to be saying such things!

169
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,970
What things should I be saying?

170
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,850
Where is His Highness during this emergency?

171
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,470
What were you doing?

172
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,020
Thousand apologies, Your Highness.

173
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,810
How about Cho Hong?

174
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,210
Court Lady Ha does not know where His Highness is, either?

175
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,410
Your Highness!

176
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,660
Your Highness!

177
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,710
Your Highness Crown Prince!

178
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,810
Your Highness!

179
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,140
Wow, he was here.  Your Highness Crown Prince.

180
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,160
Yes, Cho Hong.

181
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,230
How could you be here like this?  Right now...

182
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,930
Wow, the court lady's habit becomes you.

183
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,560
"How could you be?"  Even the parlance becomes you.

184
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,950
Is this the time to be saying this?  Right now, the palace is turned—

185
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,070
I know.  It must be upside down because of me.

186
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,280
And you are doing this here?  Today's your...

187
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,340
that... that... what was that?  Gosh, what was it called?

188
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,360
Morning lecture.  None other than the day of the crown prince's first lesson.

189
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,690
Oh, that's right.  That is what I meant.

190
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,920
So all court officials will gather.  But egad!

191
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,140
The so-called crown prince is playing hooky here without any solution.  Has this dude gone mad?

192
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,080
What?

193
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,670
Don't worry.

194
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,770
It's not that I don't have any solution but simply I am looking for one.

195
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,360
What on earth are you saying...

196
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,690
Probably nobody came.

197
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,270
I am definitely not the only one playing hooky...

198
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,030
Because nobody will show up at that place.

199
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,020
Not only the Norons, but even Soron high officials

200
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,810
refused to participate in the crown prince's first morning lecture?

201
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,280
A thousand apologies, Your Majesty.

202
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,660
All right, that was expected from Min Jin Heon's Noron followers

203
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,810
because they won't accept him as the crown prince.  But why the Sorons?

204
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,900
They should abide by His Majesty's wishes, no?

205
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,830
Wouldn't that be out of their loyalty, Your Highness?

206
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,470
What did you say?  Does Soron's loyalty amount to this?

207
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,650
Do you think His Majesty named his heir out of his true wishes?

208
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,980
Was it not because of the pressure put on him for not having an heir?

209
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,010
Even you cornered him into it, Queen Dowager.

210
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,330
You are speaking too harshly, Queen.

211
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,300
What did Soron do wrong?

212
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,160
Wouldn't they know His Majesty's true feelings when they have stood by him for so long?

213
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,300
How can they accept the current crown prince?

214
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,040
Queen, that is disloyal and irreverent!

215
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,020
Your Highness Crown Prince, excuse me for saying this but...

216
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,830
Would you hand me the towel over there?  I'm sweaty.

217
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,530
Pardon?

218
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,440
Here it is.

219
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,510
After playing outside in the cold weather, I got a bit of a cold.

220
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,210
This is why the palace is nice.  It's a paradise where one can do all he wishes.

221
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,030
Your Highness, right now idly...

222
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,780
I am sorry to say this, but you must know what happened today.

223
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,530
Even though you have become the crown prince, your position in the palace is still precarious, so...

224
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,290
So?

225
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,300
- So... did I ask for your opinion?
 - Pardon?

226
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:32,240
Going out of your way to visit me without invitation and to counsel me without solicitation.

227
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,970
That is so like you two excellencies since you snatched at my hand when I didn't even want it.

228
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,750
- Y-Your Highness!
 - So rash.

229
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,820
But what are you saying?

230
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,730
I am about to take off my shirt.

231
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,170
Are you going to stay?

232
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,860
- But...
 - Your Excellency...

233
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,870
You may.  It will be quite... a sight.

234
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,170
Dear lord...

235
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,080
But where have you seen such an ingrate?

236
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,670
- Thanks to whom, does he think he became the crown prince?
 - He might hear you.

237
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,050
When he has diddly-squat when it comes to political power,

238
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,440
what does he plan to accomplish by snubbing you and me?

239
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,350
Who in this palace is on his side?

240
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,900
He's a spring chicken ignorant of politics.

241
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,430
We have to teach him and lead him.

242
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,590
Sheesh...

243
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,520
Come here.  Is anybody outside?

244
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,640
An officer from the Ministry of Taxation was murdered?

245
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,230
According to the police bureau report, noblemen were murdered in Angookbang and Soonhwabang, too.

246
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,160
And last night, in Yangdeokbang...

247
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,360
How can these disturbing events happen one after another?

248
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,640
Excuse me, Lord Deputy Minister. As for me,

249
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,850
I feel uneasy about even Sorons not attending the morning lecture today.

250
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,730
What is wrong with that?

251
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,880
Are you suggesting right now that we accept the crown prince?

252
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,730
That is not it.  But His Majesty asked us to care for the crown prince and...

253
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,670
if we Sorons do not obey, then—

254
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,810
Enough already.  His Majesty couldn't speak his mind,

255
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,350
but do you really think he wanted his brother as the heir?

256
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,100
On top of that, Prince Yeoning is the offspring of a low-born.

257
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,060
That is right!  How can we accept an heir proposed by Noron and a lowly born one at that?

258
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,900
That goes without saying!

259
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,710
Of course, it will be hard for you to accept me.

260
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,690
Your Highness!

261
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,600
Being the untactful one that I am, I've overheard you.

262
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,420
Murders of noblemen.  On top of that, I've interrupted you when you are discussing important cases.

263
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,510
Excuse me for asking, Your Highness, but what brings you here?

264
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,510
Bring it in.

265
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,560
Wasn't today my first morning lecture?

266
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,410
But for some reason, I felt like I had to come here rather than to the tutorial office to see you, officials.

267
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,680
Let me greet you.

268
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,500
Propriety requires the crown prince to politely greet his teacher and court officials at the first morning lecture.

269
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,590
Therefore, I, the crown prince, have come to greet you properly.

270
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,920
Your Highness!

271
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,630
Lest you might misunderstand, this old man offers you this one word.

272
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,400
The reason I cannot accept you is not because you are a lowly born prince.

273
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,860
I can't speak for other officials, but at least for me, no.

274
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,380
Ability rather than blood

275
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,420
comes first for the sake of this country.

276
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,330
Ability rather than blood.  What an unexpected remark from you.

277
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,540
Does that mean if I can prove ability,

278
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,240
at least you can accept me?

279
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,020
What if I show you the qualities of a king governing his nation?

280
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,130
The crown prince, who is not the king, cannot participate in government.

281
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,630
He is not allowed to even mention any related subject.

282
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,900
Because all related subjects fall into the realm of the king, if you do mention any,

283
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,900
that is as good as coveting the king's authority.

284
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,940
That is the reason why I cannot trust you.

285
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,520
The fact that you might covet the king's authority.

286
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,010
So it comes down to this: that I am simply Soron's enemy.

287
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,430
So don't do anything.  While not doing anything, still

288
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,760
prove your ability.

289
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,760
You are giving me impossible homework from the very beginning, Teacher.

290
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,900
- I am sorry.
 - But you know,

291
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,150
if I were you, I would not have me simply as an enemy.

292
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,550
Because just for that, I am too dangerous,

293
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:34,960
and also just for that, I might unexpectedly share common ground with you, Teacher.

294
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,440
While not doing anything, still prove that I am king material.

295
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,060
 Right, I must not be rash.  I must wait for the right time.

296
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,460
Your Highness, an officer from the Aekjeongseo  (palace custodian's office)  is here.

297
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,540
How is working in the Aekjeongseo?

298
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,200
What does it matter to me as long as I can assist you?

299
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,300
How hopeless.  Your lifelong wish is to become sticky rice, right?

300
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,210
Yes, as long as I can stick around Your Highness.

301
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,100
What are Min Jin Heon and Tan up to?

302
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,380
Nothing unusual.  His Excellency Min has been demoted to Capital Bureau,

303
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,390
and Prince Milpoong is holed up in his house.

304
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,990
Neither of them are the type to give up like this.

305
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,560
But what can they do right now?

306
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,570
Well...

307
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,270
When it comes to that, I may be in the same situation as them.

308
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,830
I don't have anything to do here in the palace anyway.

309
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,060
I should go outside and scope out what is going on.

310
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,790
Can you think of a plausible excuse?

311
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,130
What are you going to do?

312
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,700
I want to drop in on someone who's in a similar position as me.

313
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,570
I'm curious if that person is suffering as much as I am.

314
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,520
If not, somehow I think I will be vexed.

315
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,900
293.

316
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,230
294.

317
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,320
295.

318
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,170
- 296.
 - Come on.

319
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,410
298.

320
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,970
300!

321
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,480
Don't let it fall!

322
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,180
Ooh, our cute newbies, shall we move on to the next level?

323
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,530
Th-There is a next level?

324
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,300
Here, here!

325
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,750
See how slow you are moving!

326
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,370
At this rate, how can you provide the ingredient for the carp stew to accompany our drinks tonight?

327
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,570
Ten per person, mind you!

328
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,350
Gosh, I can't.

329
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,970
I did hear about how vicious the Saheonbu hazing is, but I never imagined it to this extent!

330
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,110
Me, neither.  I can't do this any more.

331
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,420
- Let us stop now.
 - Enough.

332
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,320
I'm going to see it through to the bitter end.

333
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,090
How tough it was to enter Saheonbu.  I can't ever give up!

334
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,380
Hey, the carp is passing over there, you dorks!

335
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,340
Oh, a carp!  Carp!

336
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,430
Are you okay?

337
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,780
At this rate, do you think he can make out of there today?

338
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,960
He'll have to pull an all nighter.

339
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,240
There were even inspectors who had to live in the pond for three days and three nights.

340
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,770
Still, seeing our lord going through the hazing, I am very moved.

341
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,990
I know, right?

342
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,760
Right?  You are proud of him, too, right?

343
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,120
No, what an eyesore the sight is.

344
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,380
I know, right?  An eyesore.

345
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,960
How the heck is that a disciplining tradition?

346
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,820
It's just harassing the subordinates for sh*ts and giggles.

347
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,190
Organizations, seriously...

348
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,370
Are you that damo named Cheon Yeo Ji?

349
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,040
I am sorry, Lord.  I didn't know you were there.

350
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,590
Sorry for what?  Oh, the newbie hazing...

351
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,300
Don't be sorry because I agree.

352
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,620
- Excuse me?
 - Humans are one thing, but to harass the poor carps so!

353
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,420
- That is also violence.
 - Poor carps?

354
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,100
I wouldn't even begin if it were just the carps.  Thank goodness it's winter.

355
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,130
In the spring, they also trample on those pretty flowers so!

356
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,360
When these children, too, will feel the pain!

357
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,690
Don't you think so?

358
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,970
Yes, what you said makes sense in a way.

359
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,570
Oh, by the way,

360
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,810
I heard that you can speak the Qing language.  Is that true?

361
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,630
Yes, that is true.  I'm fluent in Japanese too.

362
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,600
- Really?
 - But why are you asking?

363
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,910
Lord, so you mean someone is buying poor farmers or slaves at a cheap price

364
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,550
and illegally selling them to Qing?

365
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,000
Yes, this is definitely trustworthy intelligence.

366
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,590
What?  An operation?  You are all getting deployed for an operation?

367
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,570
Yes, that is right, My Lord.

368
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,060
 Illegal human trafficking is being perpetrated.

369
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,500
 A crime targeting young powerless girls.

370
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,450
What?  Young girls?

371
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,140
Damn it. Where have you seen such a fiendish thing happening?

372
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,630
So for covert investigation, he says he needs Yeo Ji.

373
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,620
Ah Bong and Uncle Jang Dal are joining, too.

374
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,490
No, that would be a bit difficult.

375
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,390
- Huh?
 - What do you mean it will be difficult?

376
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,320
If I don't include you, you can't spare me the damo and assistant investigators?

377
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,440
Isn't that a given, though?  They are my subordinates, so they must follow my direction.

378
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm in, too.  Or if you don't like it, forget it.

379
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,310
What are you going to do about the initiation rites?  Even just tonight, you...

380
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,120
Whatever, I'll just cut and run.  Do you think I entered the Saheonbu to kiss up to them with alcohol?

381
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,650
Look here, do you know what it means to be disfavored by your superiors in the Saheonbu?

382
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,410
Let alone getting promoted, you...

383
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,080
- Gosh, really.
 - Are you all right?

384
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,200
I am sorry.  Because I was trying to catch fish for so long...

385
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,750
But you've just seen it, right?

386
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,700
How I even sneezed "haechi"

387
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,100
rather than achoo?

388
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,010
What?

389
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,020
I'm not scared of being disfavored at all,

390
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:52,050
because I am a real inspector who even sneezes "haechi."
