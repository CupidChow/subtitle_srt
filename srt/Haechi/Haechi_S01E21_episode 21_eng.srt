1
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,100
No, wait!

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,730
- Your Excellency Min Jin Heon.
 - Before you hold a jejwa hearing,

3
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,900
there is something you must see.

4
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,340
Min Jin Heon.

5
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,150
How could the nation's Saheonbu treat their people this way?

6
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,280

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,080
That person is...

8
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,390
Look who it is.

9
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,100
Aren't you our crown prince's friends?

10
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,520
Bring the criminal.

11
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,360
How is that child...

12
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,700
Min Jin Heon.

13
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,010
What is this, Deputy Inspector General Wi?

14
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,100
Do you recognize this child?

15
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,770
Take a clear look. You've seen this child before, haven't you?

16
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:26,070

17
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,160
Prince Milpoong, what are you doing right now?

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,370
What am I doing? I, too, am meeting a friend.

19
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,240
With me, he is trading ginseng with the Qing.

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,190
Trading?

21
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,620
What kind of nonsense are you pulling?

22
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,720
Do you think that kind of excuse will work?

23
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,260
- Sheath your sword.
 - He's royalty.

24
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,200
Let go! It doesn't matter.

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,600
If we can't catch that guy, then Crown Prince can't reveal anything!

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,130
You get agitated easily.

27
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,590
There is nothing that will get solved... by you acting like this.

28
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,660
You—

29
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,750
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

30
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,130
Oh no. If you don't remember, should I help you?

31
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,080
- Stop it!
 - Master-killer!

32
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,450
- Master-killer?
 - She killed her master?
 - What is that?

33
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,640
This criminal's body is branded with a promise that she will kill her master who is a nobleman!

34
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,330
This criminal is the one who killed Chief Inspector Oh Se Hwan

35
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,060
and you, Crown Prince, have known this all along.

36
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,450
The crown prince knew?

37
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,250
Master-killer?

38
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,260
You mean that is the master-killer band that kills noblemen?

39
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,200
The crown prince knew? What is going on?

40
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,210
Crown Prince!

41
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,260
What are you doing? Give us an answer.

42
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,330
Do you not know this child?

43
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,050
That this child killed her own master?!

44
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,160
How can he take off his robe?

45
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,210
But what is he doing?

46
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
How can the crown prince act like that?

47
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,140
Stop torturing this child.

48
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:34,270
Yes. I... saw this child.

49
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,760
Really?

50
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,710
Is that good enough? Now... stop.

51
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,500
He saw? The crown prince really did?

52
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,300

53
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,240
Out of the way! Everyone move aside!

54
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,390
- What's going on?
 - A master-killer band has been found.

55
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,770
- The ones who only kill the noblemen?
 - Yes, exactly.

56
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,410
- That's a huge problem!
 - Yes, it's a big problem!

57
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,880
What will happen now?

58
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,230
- So how is the crown prince right now?
 - The situation has worsened.

59
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,290
Now the Saheonbu will investigate the possibility of the crown prince protecting the band of master-killers—

60
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,070
That makes no sense! The crown prince didn't even know them.

61
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,470
However, it's true that he kept quiet about this.

62
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,820
Send the royal guards and bring the crown prince.

63
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,260
What do you mean the royal guards, Your Majesty!

64
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,680
You can't! It might lead to a war.

65
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,160
This is a royal decree! Not a favor.

66
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,020
Your Majesty!

67
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,160
Don't interfere with Saheonbu's investigation any more, Your Majesty.

68
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,730
This crime must clearly be revealed.

69
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,810
If Your Majesty protects the crown prince,

70
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,140
then the nation will collapse.

71
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,930
It's not protecting him. I'm trying to give him a chance to explain.

72
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,590
Saheonbu, Saganwon, Hongmoongwan.

73
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,490
Are you truly saying you'll go against the three offices of this nation?

74
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,840
Are you going to go down the path of a tyrant who goes against the press?

75
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,210
Gosh, the hearing must have already ended.

76
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,130
Then what about the crown prince?

77
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,460
We didn't catch Do Ji Gwang.

78
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,100
Figure out what's going on at the palace, Yeo Ji. Right away!

79
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,140
- Uncle Jang Dal, let's go. 
- Okay.

80
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,230
You, come with me to the inspector's office. Quickly.

81
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,720
Yes, My Lord.

82
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,670
We're going to the master-killer band's headquarters.

83
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,540
Under the inspector general's orders, you are allowed to kill all those who fight.

84
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,530
Yes!

85
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,200
What are you doing right now?

86
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,460
Who is this? It's the barking newbie.

87
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,320
Take that and follow us. We need even someone like you today.

88
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,830
They're going to catch those children.

89
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,810
The master-killer children.

90
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,670
You're correct.

91
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,420
And that too is our job.

92
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,950
- However, Lord, these children— 
- It doesn't change the fact that they're criminals.

93
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,650
Which is why we needed to have caught the human traffickers first.

94
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,740
But we failed. We lost the means.

95
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,260
In the end, it was you and Wi Byeong Joo's doing.

96
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,610
This is not only those children's crime.

97
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,920
You know that much, too!

98
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,660
Of course, I do.

99
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,130
Their things taken by force. Extremely high rent for farmland.

100
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,470
Poverty and hunger caused by them.

101
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,180
They become tenant farmers and slaves of noblemen who've stolen their land.

102
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,420
But even then, they can't live, so they have to sell their own children.

103
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,970
This world is like that.

104
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,920
This world probably made those little children take up a knife.

105
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,510
Even so, you're going to do this.

106
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,810
Like when Hwon died, are you going to say this is politics, too?

107
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,020
This isn't politics but logic.

108
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,210
As long as status and power exist, this world's logic won't change.

109
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,710
Don't you know that humans by nature differentiate themselves through discrimination?

110
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,410
To think that you can change that...

111
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,920
The ones who can kill or save them through that logic are the noblemen, Your Highness.

112
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,070
So!

113
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:56,170
So... are you planning to kill all of those children?

114
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,340
Among them, there are children who haven't committed a crime.

115
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,590
As expected, you feel much compassion for the low-borns.

116
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:12,070
However, it's not time for you to worry about them right now.

117
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,570
Everyone run away! Run away!

118
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,700
It's them! You must not lose a single one!

119
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,000
Ah! Please stop it!

120
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,430
What is this? Unless they are going to kill them all, what the heck is this?

121
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,860
Stop it.

122
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,620
Please stop it.

123
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,410
You didn't have to go this far.

124
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,430
This is illegal.

125
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,070
Are you planning to kill all the kids without a trial?!

126
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,120
Drag this punk away first.

127
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,770
Whose side are you taking as an inspector?!

128
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,160
These are the horrible criminals who killed the nobles.

129
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,430
You bastard.

130
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,470
Do not touch him! What did he do wrong?

131
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,650
You guys are the ones who broke the law!

132
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,700
Don't!

133
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,830
How is it possible? How can they to the crown prince—

134
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,610
Head Merchant, I have a favor to ask.

135
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,880
- Right now— 
- I think His Highness will be taken to the Capital Bureau.

136
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,890
What do you mean Capital Bureau? What right do they have to—

137
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,260
Saheonbu and Capital Bureau are investigating jointly.

138
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,850
No way. Then why take His Highness over there when they can just come here?

139
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,910
Humiliation.

140
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,370
Is this about humiliating him?

141
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,520
This is about him being dragged in front of the people, isn't it?

142
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,080
Probably.

143
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,750
They want to shame him.

144
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,460
Those bastards deserve to die. How dare they!

145
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,600
How is it at the palace?

146
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,510
What is His Majesty doing?

147
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,560
Please help the crown prince, Your Highness.

148
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,170
Now the only one I can depend on is you, Your Highness.

149
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,000
Queen Dowager!

150
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,870
We cannot obey your order to send the royal guards!

151
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,470
Instead, chop off our necks first!

152
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,880
Step aside, Deputy Minister!

153
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,860
We have a duty to guide you, Your Majesty!

154
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,900
If you send the royal guards right now,

155
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,770
all noblemen would become your enemy.

156
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,660
So are you saying we should abandon the crown prince?!

157
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,020
The one who allowed this was me!

158
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,460
Then will you abandon your loyal ministers?

159
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,510
If Your Majesty steps forward, don't you know what kind of storm will brew?

160
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:44,090
But to protect the crown prince, you will abandon your council who would give up their lives for you?

161
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,880
If so, then kill me as well.

162
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,740
We've endured so long to get here.

163
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,730
We've undergone so much to keep the throne.

164
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,790
Your Majesty!

165
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,440
I apologize, but there is no horse or carriage prepared for you.

166
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,450
Is this enough to shame me?

167
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,120
You will need a rope to bind me as well.

168
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,370
Lead the crown prince to Capital Bureau.

169
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,340
Yes!

170
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,160

171
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,160
They say the crown prince is involved with the master-killer band.

172
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,140
Still, how can they arrest the crown prince?

173
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,060
What kind of nonsense is this?

174
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,380
Oh, there's the crown prince!

175
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,410
There is a rumor that he's the head of the master-killer band.

176
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,310
I heard he tried with all his might to hide them.

177
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,210
Gosh, serves him right.

178
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,180
Oh my. What's going on?

179
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,550
It's because he's born from lowly blood.

180
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,290
Why are we letting this nation be under that lowly blood's care?

181
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,000
I knew this would happen.

182
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,060
It's not a rumor.

183
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,860
Just because he's royalty...

184
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,810
- Crown Prince.
 - Yeo Ji.

185
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,490
Are you trying to die? If you get arrested too, then what will we do after?

186
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,790
You can't.

187
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,030
What's going to happen?

188
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,020
Hey, hey, Park Moon Soo. Isn't that your crown prince?

189
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,780
No way.

190
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,430
Why is His Highness... going through that?

191
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,540
Get out of the way!

192
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,520
My Lord!

193
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,540
Lord Moon Soo!

194
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,290
Let's go.

195
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,400
This is unfolding strangely.

196
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,030
I didn't even start my plan.

197
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,520
So that was the crown prince, huh.

198
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,220
I thought that he didn't seem like a person that would be in a den of beggars.

199
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,750
Hey, you know the crown prince?

200
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,820
- What?
 - Answer me, you punk!

201
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,360
What do you mean by a den of beggars?

202
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,400
Scholar Jeong Jin Taek, born in 1664.

203
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,350
Why are you slow? Don't you see that the line is getting long?

204
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,030
Go on in.

205
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,510
There are a lot of noblemen going into the capital, huh?

206
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,660
They're all coming to cause chaos, you know.

207
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,120
It's been crazy due to the master-killer band today.

208
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,410
Y-Your Excellency, my apologies. I was only...

209
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,150
You have nine fingers.

210
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,490
It must be uncomfortable.

211
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,390
It was while I was a police officer.

212
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,250

213
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,290
- Work hard.
 - Yes.

214
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,920
A present. I picked it up on the way to give it to you.

215
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,370
Welcome, Ha Gok  (Jo Tae Goo's pen name) .

216
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,900
You have no loyalty.

217
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,520
Immediately going to one with power.

218
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,550
Power? You're making fun of me who has stepped aside to inhabit a back room  (becoming a paper tiger) .

219
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,210
Even from a back room, your skills are this great?

220
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,120
The capital has become chaotic.

221
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,280
The head of Soron has finally returned. Ha Gok Jo Tae Goo.

222
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,540
It seems that you will regain the head position of Noron soon.

223
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,910
We were originally from the same root, Ha Gok.

224
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,080
Both Seoin, who've been the pride of Joseon all this time.

225
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,750
That's a memory from long ago.

226
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,830
Right now, we're just Noron and Soron.

227
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,290
Joseon is not the king's nation. It's the noblemen who govern the nation.

228
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,970
Hasn't it been a while since those noblemen became rotten?

229
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,320
Is it right that we just look to the king as the Soron believe?

230
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,690
The wrong kind of king can ruin the nation.

231
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,520
Whether one ruins it or multiple people ruin it—

232
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,360
Ha Gok.

233
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,350
Yes, Noron has become rotten.

234
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,870
We've been accustomed to such long-standing power that we've become incompetent.

235
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,500
However, this is where I am rooted,

236
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,350
and I will revive that root.

237
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,170
You will ask for the dethronement of the crown prince?

238
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,920
It will be a good opportunity to reunite the Noron who have split.

239
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,970
If you target the crown prince,

240
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,540
then we might suspect that the Noron are plotting treason.

241
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,330
No. Will His Majesty be able to handle the heated opinions of his noblemen?

242
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,550
You've seen it, too.

243
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,770
The angry noblemen.

244
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,590
The crown prince will have to give it up, Ha Gok.

245
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:38,120
If not, then His Majesty will fall into danger, too.

246
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,880
I must have gone crazy

247
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,980
to have put my family name and my life on the line for Prince Yeoning!

248
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,210
This is not the time to lose your mind.

249
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,550
Noblemen from outside the capital are gathering in the city.

250
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,950
Your Excellency, by chance, will the crown prince

251
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,350
be dethroned like this?

252
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,440
What?

253
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,560
What are you talking about?

254
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,340
Then we will all die.

255
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,910
Soron...

256
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,870
At least the Soron will be on the crown prince's side.

257
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,660
After all, the crown prince was chosen by His Majesty.

258
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,330
Is His Majesty not ready yet?

259
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,740
He hasn't slept all night.

260
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm not the only one who got older.

261
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,930
You all have become very wrinkly.

262
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,730
Your Excellency!

263
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,760
You've returned, Right State Councilor.

264
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,200
Is Head Eunuch outside?

265
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,420
What do you mean dethronement of the crown prince?!

266
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,910
But how can... how can we, as Soron, first suggest...

267
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,340
In the end, it will happen.

268
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,700
If anything, for His Majesty, you are saying that we should lead it.

269
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,850
However, will this chaos be stilled by that?

270
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:29,240
- In the end, another— 
- Politics is originally about surviving through chaos.

271
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,730
That's the innate nature of the monster called politics.

272
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:39,410
Even if we prevent one chaos after giving up the crown prince, another chaos will occur.

273
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:45,190
In the midst of all that, we must die if the fight is to stop at all.

274
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,450
However, we can't die right now, can we?

275
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,650
Not only us but His Majesty, too.

276
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,540
So this time, let's choose to lose this way.

277
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:03,600
Who knows? We might have a win one day.

278
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,250
The Noron ministers are coming.

279
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,420
Chief Scholar and...

280
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,810
Your Excellency.

281
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,690
I heard there is a giro party between 11 AM and 1 PM.

282
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,290
His Majesty needs to attend too, so let's try to finish the cabinet meeting as early as possible.

283
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,530
His Majesty has to attend, so let's.

284
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,720
It's been a while, so let's all drink together.

285
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,050
- It's been a while.
 - Yes.

286
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,030
What... what is that strange scene I'm seeing?

287
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,960
Why are they looking so friendly?

288
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,690
Soron has abandoned the crown prince.

289
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,650
What?

290
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,410
Soron and Noron have come to an agreement.

291
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,730
Gosh, this is...

292
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,500
Lord Moon Soo. Lord.

293
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,260
Please regain your senses!

294
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,360
What to do...

295
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,840
Lord.

296
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,820
Lord Moon Soo! A-Are...

297
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,780
Are you awake?

298
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,130
Can you hear me? Gosh...

299
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,400
His Highness.

300
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,670
Ah Bong, what happened to His Highness?

301
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,710
Tell me. What happened?

302
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,410
Where is he right now?

303
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,450

304
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,530
He is definitely there somewhere.

305
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,940
Don't you hear me saying to open the door this instant?

306
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,900
Isn't it past the time when His Majesty should have arrived?

307
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,490
Does it make sense that you don't know where His Majesty is?

308
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,310
Come on, Head Eunuch.

309
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,760
My Lord!

310
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,270
Your Majesty.

311
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:05,070
It has not been long since you became the crown prince, but you have raised a ruckus.

312
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,430
I apologize, Your Majesty. I am well aware of my own sin.

313
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,490
I will... bear the responsibility.

314
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,680
As requested by your council,

315
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,720
dethrone me.

316
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,500
Who are you to bear responsibility?!

317
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,610
Don't fool yourself, Crown Prince.

318
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,260
I am the king of this nation!

319
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:37,450
The responsibility can only be taken by those who have the right!
