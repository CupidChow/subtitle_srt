1
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,670
Your Majesty.

2
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,520
All civil and military officials of this court,

3
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,880
four reverent bows to the king!

4
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,990
Bow.

5
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,570
Hail.

6
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,070
Bow.

7
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,520
Hail.

8
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Bow.

9
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,120
Hail.

10
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,580
Bow.

11
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,300
Hail.

12
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Salute!

13
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,470
Long live the king!

14
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,290
Long live the king!

15
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,690
Long live the king!

16
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,160
They say the king killed the predecessor king.

17
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,100
He still gets to ascend the throne in one piece?

18
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Don't even make me start, dude.

19
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,760
It hasn't been even three days and he speedily became the king.

20
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
How can a human being act like that?  Is he even human?

21
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,850
Aigoo, what a mess this country is in.

22
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,730
Long live the king!

23
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,930
Long live the king!

24
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,920
Long live the king!

25
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,910
Long live the king!

26
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,880
 Here comes His Majesty!

27
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,950
Your Majesty!

28
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,250
Then, I shall

29
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,810
begin the first day of my reign today.

30
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,160
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

31
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,590

32
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,310
This isn't a dream, right?

33
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,250
This better not be a dream.  If it is, I shouldn't wake up from it.

34
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,920
Ah ah ah, Uncle, Uncle...

35
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,150
I'm letting you know this isn't a dream, punk.

36
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,870
His Highness is now His Majesty.

37
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,830
Hey, Ah Bong!

38
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,250
That can't be ginseng, right?

39
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,010
You'd better tell me that it is not.

40
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,000
It is. This is Punggi  (a locality in Gyeongsang Province famous for ginseng)  ginseng My Lord gave us.

41
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,360
Hey!  Who told you to eat it?

42
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,270
How many times do I have to tell you to give it to Inspector Park Moon Soo?

43
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,050
Hey, Ah Bong, haven't you told Lord Inspector Joo?

44
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,070
Oh, it slipped my mind.  My Lord Moon Soo's constitution doesn't agree with ginseng, so he cannot accept it.

45
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,010
Really?  Then what agrees with him?

46
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,420
If not ginseng, then deer antler velvet or bear bile?

47
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,220
He just needs to say the word and whatever it is, I will prepare the premium quality.

48
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,750
Hey, punk, if you have the time to curry favor, do your job properly.

49
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,990
What?

50
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,890
"Even a dog kept at a village schoolhouse will recite verses after three years, tsk tsk tsk."

51
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,840
"You, too, should play the part of an inspector a little, no?"

52
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,860
Me?  Did you guys just say that to me?

53
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,360
Was what he asked us to relay to you.

54
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,820
It's from My Lord Moon Soo.

55
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,450
Oh... right.

56
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,890
Let's go.

57
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,990
Here.

58
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,030
Oh, my life...

59
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,350
It's yummy.

60
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,600
These are the investigation records of the section chief of the interior's corruption case from the last time.

61
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,670
This is the list of the seized bribes.

62
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,190
But why are you giving these to...

63
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,300
Can it be that His Majesty has summoned you to the palace?

64
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, that's why you are cleaning up already.

65
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,350
To which post has he summoned you?

66
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,100
Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau)  or Royal Secretariat?  It must be a key post.

67
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,390
And these are the investigation records of the cases worked on together with the Capital Bureau.

68
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,530
Keep them well so they won't get mixed up.

69
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,430
Hey, dude, stop acting so coy and tell us.  Which post did he give you?

70
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,150
Inspector Park!  Inspector Park, don't forget to put in a good word for us too once you enter the palace.

71
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,850
Good word my butt.  Trail blaze your own future, okay?

72
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,410
I'm busy taking care of myself.  Go and do your work now.

73
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,400
Hey, how can a person be so cold?

74
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,880
Aigoo.

75
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,350
Aigo, so loud.  Everyone, leave.

76
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,830
Alright, alright.

77
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,020

78
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,930

79
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,520
Aren't you overdoing it from day one?

80
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,320
Teacher.

81
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,450
What do you mean "Teacher," Your Majesty?  Now, it's an excessive title.

82
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,960
Have you, by any chance, brought me homework?

83
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,840
You're too much from day one.

84
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,900
I guess you can call it homework,

85
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,320
because these are the books you will need for your future colloquia with your ministers.

86
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
Colloquia?

87
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,170
Now that you have become the owner of this palace,

88
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,160
you ought to debate with your ministers

89
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,660
not only over politics but over academics as well.

90
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,510
You should show them who is the boss.

91
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:26,970
Of course, you will do very well even without these books.

92
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,890
But you could have given these to me later.  Why now?

93
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:44,290
That is because there might be no "later," Your Majesty.

94
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,090
I am extremely sorry to say this, but

95
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:58,130
I have come to bid you goodbye today, Your Majesty.

96
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,100
What are you talking about?

97
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,440
Goodbye?

98
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,950
Teacher!

99
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,570

100
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,040
What on earth is this, man?

101
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,100
I am sorry, My Lord.

102
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,900
Inspector Park!

103
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,930
A letter of resignation?  I am asking why out of the blue?

104
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,770
What on earth do you mean?

105
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,940
That you, Assistant Officer Jo Hyeon Myeong, and Park Moon Soo will resign?

106
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,950
You must allow it, Your Majesty.

107
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,870
Now to lead this court, you must throw us away.

108
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,180
I cannot do that.

109
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,880
Who had trusted me and supported me until I ascended to the throne?

110
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,920
So how can you tell me to throw those people away?

111
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,670
Only that way, your reign can be made a peaceful one.

112
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,900
First, you must acquire power through the Noron.

113
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,610
Is it, by any chance, Min Jin Heon?

114
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,570
He must have made such a suggestion to you, Teacher.

115
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,550
"You all resign. Then I will cooperate with the king."

116
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,400
Was that how it was?

117
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,900
- Your Majesty!
 - No!

118
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,890
I cannot do it.  I will never do it!

119
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,560
Your Majesty...

120
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,610
Left State Councilor!

121
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,500
Was it you? Did you—

122
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,310
You must have seen Lee Gwang Jwa.

123
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,900
I have no thought of accepting your deal.

124
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,170
Do you understand?

125
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,140
Discarding them and holding the hand of Noron!  I swear never in my life

126
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,630
will that happen.

127
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,260
It was not me, Your Majesty.

128
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,150
It was not me.

129
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,330
The ones who volunteered to resign from their posts

130
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,750
were none other than those followers of yours, themselves.

131
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,020
 In any event, we Norons must be prepared for any exigency

132
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,050
 so that we can stay on top.

133
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,910
 Yes, Your Excellency.

134
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,080
 As needed, we may hold the right state councilor's hand.

135
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,490
 Your Excellency.

136
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,440
 What is it?

137
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,100
 If the Noron cooperate with the crown prince,

138
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,320
 right after the coronation,

139
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,350
 all of you will resign?

140
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,880
 Assistant Officer of Uigeumbu Jo Hyeon Myeong and other Sorons who follow you,

141
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,890
 and Saheonbu Inspector Park Moon Soo, who might as well be the crown prince's own limbs, too?

142
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,250
 This is not for the sake of only this negotiation.

143
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:40,130
 For the sake of the first years of the new king's reign, too, that would be better.

144
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,590
 Rather than us who are powerless, don't you think Your Excellency and the Noron

145
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,530
 can give the new monarch peace and calm?

146
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,270
 You...

147
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,950
That was their choice?

148
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,580
That is right, even though it is a choice I cannot understand.

149
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,720
How?

150
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,740
How can they be...

151
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:19,140
Struggling to seize power and afterwards laying it down for their own sovereign...

152
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:26,740
Yes, even though I also fail to understand how...

153
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,400
how they can do it.

154
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,640
However, if I may offer you a piece of advice,

155
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,060
even if just to placate Right State Councilor Jo Tae Goo and the hard-liner Sorons following him,

156
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,960
you should accept this deal.

157
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,610
Not for the sake of anyone else but for yourself, Your Majesty.

158
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,530
So,

159
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,350
for myself,

160
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,740
throw away those who've followed me with their lives on the line?

161
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,690
Because the king's seat is also such a place

162
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,190
where he must readily sacrifice even innocent ones

163
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,330
solely for the sake of the monarchy and for the kingdom.

164
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,660
And in the end,

165
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,330
it's a place where he alone sits solitary.

166
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,060
Now, the Norons will cooperate with your rule.

167
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,000
Moreover, I hope Your Majesty's reign

168
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,100
will be peaceful.

169
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,870
Is that true?

170
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,470
Lord Inspector General, Assistant Officer of Uigeumbu, and even Lord Moon Soo

171
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,810
will all resign and return to their hometowns?

172
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,960
So His Majesty has just left the palace to hold back Inspector Park.

173
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,750
 Yeo Ji...

174
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,350
 Do you know what you are trying to do right now?

175
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,230
 Yeo Ji, becoming a palace maid like this means...

176
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,670
 I know it, too,

177
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,630
 that I can never return to my ordinary life,

178
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,440
 that I cannot return either to Saheonbu or to the position of a damo.

179
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,230
 And?

180
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,670
 And still why?

181
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,240
 Because it was the only way

182
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,220
 to stay next to His Highness and protect him.

183
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,470
 When you know that, why would you...

184
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,460
 Look here, you may never be able to return to Saheonbu.

185
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,980
 Because this is the only way

186
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,990
 I can protect His Majesty right now.

187
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,510
 Will you really... be okay?

188
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,930
 Will you... be really okay?

189
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,050
 You are still a woman.

190
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,160
 When you, too, are an ordinary woman,

191
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,870
 it is okay to spend the rest of your life in the palace like this?

192
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,390
 Yes, of course.

193
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,510
 Yes, of course, My Lord.

194
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,690
 If I can only protect His Majesty...

195
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,450
 If I can only protect His Majesty,

196
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:45,030
 for me, too, that is enough.

197
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,640
Dal Moon!  Dal Moon!

198
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,610
Your Majesty!

199
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,400
Moon Soo, where is Moon Soo right now?

200
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,720
This is a letter Inspector Park left you.

201
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,260
He said he was afraid of not being able to leave once he saw you.

202
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,200
 Please forgive me for being rude and just leaving you this letter, Your Majesty.

203
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,500
 But this cannot be helped.

204
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,790
 You did that too in the beginning.

205
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,250
 You sent one letter and ordered me to come and go.

206
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,620
 Looks like we need to clarify some things.

207
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,590
 - Clarify?
 - Look, it's not as if I am your mutt.

208
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,890
 You just issue orders like this and expect me to go wherever you tell me? That isn't right.

209
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,970
 I have to study and I am quite busy—

210
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,250
 Undo this rope, and give up on studying.

211
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,910
 - It's over for you already.
 - What?

212
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,900
 In this world, there are people who just can't do something, no matter how they try.

213
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,130
 It's not as if just anyone can get the highest score, as I did, after making a minor effort.

214
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,240
 Look here, Your Highness. How can you speak harshly like that?

215
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,520
 Your Majesty, please do not feel sorry toward me or get hurt...

216
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,610
Moon Soo.

217
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,510
 If you know how gladly I am traveling this road,

218
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:02,460
 if you understand how full my heart felt

219
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,680
 because I could assist you.

220
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,300
 And please be a sage king, Your Majesty.

221
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,190
 From wherever I will be, whatever I will be doing,

222
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:23,550
 I will protect you with all the loyalty in my heart.

223
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,870
So this is what it's like?

224
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,760
A throne is... where I cannot

225
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,110
safeguard even my men, my friends.

226
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,280
Such a place...

227
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,680
♫  You whom I love  ♫

228
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,500
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

229
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,160
♫  You whom I love  ♫

230
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,180
♫  Shine on me again  ♫

231
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:29,320
♫  So that I cannot forget you,  ♫

232
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:37,240
♫  So I would have to remember you even in my dreams  ♫

233
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:43,890
♫  I break down inside of you  ♫

234
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:52,920
♫  I become tears  ♫

235
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,780

236
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,210
How can this happen?  Is this really true?

237
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,890
Yes, it's news that has just arrived from the place of exile.

238
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,990
I must see His Majesty right now.

239
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,110
Palace Maid Cheon!  Palace Maid Cheon!

240
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,890
Yes, I am coming, Court Lady.

241
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,760
No way...

242
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,860
Your Majesty.

243
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,190
Inspector Yoon, what brings you all the way to the palace?

244
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,100
Your Majesty, I have urgent news.

245
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,160
What on earth did you say?!

246
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,380
Criminal Wi Byeong Joo who's been waiting for his execution escaped his place of exile?

247
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,970
Not only Saheonbu but also

248
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,560
the Ministry of Justice is investigating the situation right now.

249
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,540
But it is certain that he disappeared from his place of exile.

250
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,500
But how on earth could something like this...

251
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,000
Who on earth sneaked out the criminal?

252
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,850
- How about Prince Milpoong?
 - Excuse me?

253
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,330
Have you checked Prince Milpoong's place of exile?

254
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,120

255
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,550
You... Wi Byeong Joo?

256
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,280
Long time no see, Prince Milpoong.

257
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,320
Thankfully, you're still alive.

258
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,990
What is this?  How can you...

259
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,980
You two don't seem to have a very close relationship anyway.

260
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,650
Enough with the affectionate reunion.  How about we leave now?

261
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,880
That thing must have broken out in the capital already.

262
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,920
That means we have no time to fritter away.

263
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,270
Who are you?

264
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,460
Send a herald right away and check on Prince Milpoong's place of exile.

265
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,330
- If needed, the royal guards—
 - Your Majesty!

266
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,560
Tell me who the heck are you?

267
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,280
Something broke out in the capital and we have no time?

268
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,040
Just what does that mean?

269
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,470
Prince Milpoong.

270
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,430
Do you want to turn the world upside down?

271
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,060
An epidemic?  Did you just say an epidemic is spreading?

272
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,450
That is correct.

273
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,870
A mysterious disease is spreading at an alarming rate.

274
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,870
I mean an epidemic without a known cause or reason.

275
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,870
 If you want to turn the world upside down,

276
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,910
 you first have to create chaos.

277
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,550

278
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:33,450
Because then that chaos will turn around

279
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,900
and question the king about his qualifications.

280
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,010
A mysterious disease without a known cause or reason?

281
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:03,930

282
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,580

283
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:13,560
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫

284
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:20,810
♫  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  ♫

285
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,700
♫  Now the gentle and gentler wind hurts too  ♫
