1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,560
- Out of the way! 
- Aren't they the Saheonbu soldiers?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,400
What on earth is going on?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,720
Are they going to do it in the end?

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,370
- Aish.
 - What on earth is going on?

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,090
This is the house of Yoon Gyeong Je, Rebel Lee In Jwa's father-in-law.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,930
Any letter or object Lee In Jwa sent to him is fine.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,030
Whatever the evidence, you must turn up something.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,920
Yes.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,150
What are you doing?

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,200
His Majesty definitely said nobody would be found guilty by association only.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,690
Your son-in-law plotted treason,

12
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,820
and how is it possible that you are not guilty?

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,200
- Take the criminal into custody now!
 - Yes!

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,630
What did you just say?

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,260
Saheonbu arrested Lee In Jwa's father-in-law?

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,320
Didn't I order not to find anyone guilty by association?

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,930
 Your Majesty, Chief Censor and Chief Scholar are here.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,170
- Your Majesty.
 - Let them in.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,650
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,810
I know what you are going to say.

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,170
Still, do I need to hear it?!

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,990
How about the court?  What is the situation like?

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,260
Right State Councillor.

24
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,320
Hand down His Majesty's next order right now.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,290
Yes, Your Excellency.

26
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,670

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,820
- My Lord.
 - My Lord.

28
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,790
- Have you heard?  Right now in Saheonbu...
 - Where is the lord inspector general?

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,870
Where are all the high-ranking Saheonbu officials?

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,870
Start interrogating Lee In Jwa's father-in-law and his family members right now.

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,330
The judicial rights rightfully belong to Saheonbu.

32
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,300
Irrespective of the king's orders, we shall do our jobâ€”

33
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,660
Irrespective of the king's orders?

34
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,310
If this is not treachery and treason, what is?

35
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,110
What are you doing?

36
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,960
What do you mean what I am doing?

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,220
I, too, am doing my job as a Saheonbu inspector.

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,180
I am simply trying to punish criminals who dare to

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,370
defy royal commands.

40
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,110
They are trying to drag Inspector Park out of their office?

41
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,580
You know I still network with the higher-ups.

42
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,870
The chief inspector was livid and ordered me to fetch soldiers.

43
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,140
- What?
 - But I really didn't think that was right, so

44
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,550
I first came to the inspectors' room.

45
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,080
Lead Inspector, are you just going to watch this?

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,320
Now, let's go!  We should lend support to Inspector Park.

47
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,080
H-How about me?

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,110
My personality does not like putting myself forward!

49
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,290
Just why did I tattle on this?

50
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,620
Aish, did I get attached to them just because I've been mingling and conversing with them lately? No, no...

51
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,460
Has Saheonbu made its moves?

52
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,980
The interrogation will start soon.

53
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,390
Even with the royal command, what can they accomplish

54
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,030
when the judicial branch of this country insists on doing its job?

55
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,220
The court must be totally empty too.

56
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,870
Just tell him to try to govern with just the Namins.

57
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,820
He won't be able to last.  Impartial hiring not based on political affiliations...

58
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,590
Which monarch has won this battle so far?

59
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,450
Nobody was able to get it done.

60
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,220
Your Excellency!  Your Excellency Minister of the Interior!

61
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,380
What is it?

62
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,450
His Majesty seems to be determined to see this through to the bitter end.

63
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,380
He is really asking for it!

64
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,480
What are you saying?  What on earth happened?

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,060
I am sorry, Your Majesty, but what do you mean you are appointing me to be the prime minister?!

66
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,260
Exactly what the job titles say.  I am appointing you as prime minister

67
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,930
and Commander of Supreme Military Headquarters Jo Hyeon Myeong to the post of Saheonbu inspector general.

68
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,310
Your Majesty!

69
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,610
No!  That is unacceptable!

70
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,310
How can you entrust me, when I have so little experience, with such crucial duties?

71
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,380
I cannot carry out your order either!

72
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,610
Then, will you make me go on this path alone, Teacher?

73
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,520
Is it how it is?  Will you, too, leave me to fend for myself?

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,930
You know what I am trying to do here!

75
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,860
It's the path of Magnificent Harmony that this nation's court has never attained before!

76
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:57,210
Perhaps this may not be a royal command, but a shameless favor.

77
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,960
This hard path whose good end cannot be guaranteed,

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,560
please walk it with me.

79
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,190

80
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,590
- Have you heard? 
- What?

81
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,900
The palace is in havoc because Namins were hired.

82
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,140
Look here.  Look here!

83
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,350
Let me ask you a question.  According to soldiers,

84
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,080
the king hired Namins and caused a whirlwind in the palace.

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,310
Is it true?

86
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,020
Gosh, what will a criminal do with that knowledge anyway?  Be quiet.

87
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,900
Please answer me.

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,100
Are Namins really being placed in key positions?

89
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,430
That is how it is!

90
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,150
For the sake of stability, His Majesty

91
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,140
is pushing hard to create opportunities for Namins.

92
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,630
But just look at what the high-ranking schmucks are doing.

93
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,790
Whether Noron or Soron, afraid that they might lose their turf war,

94
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,250
they are throwing royal commands or whatnot to the dogs!

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,470
I mean, did they even take on any sword fights because of the rebellion?

96
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,370
Those dirty old farts.  Step down for a bit!

97
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,870
- I lost my lifeblood-like eldest son in the Anseong Battle.
 - Aigoo!

98
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,150
When they haven't even once held a sword in the battlefield,

99
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,230
what right do those scoundrels have to call for this or that?!

100
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,280
Agreed!

101
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,540
B-But the s-storyteller is me.

102
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,890
Hold on a sec.  Let me say something too.

103
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,140
Until when will those schmucks stir-fry, pan-fry, and only fight?

104
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,800
This is why only commoners get squeezed to death from battles and exploitation!

105
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,210
Yeah!  Here, here!  Well said!

106
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,420
Through and through, a hundred times, a thousand times right on.  Isn't that right?

107
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,350
They are saying only the truth.

108
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,560
Me too! I have something to say too!

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:07,340
Aigoo, gosh, well done. In fact they're doing better than I did, by golly.

110
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,050
The public sentiment deep down is to that extent?

111
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,750
Don't even make me start.  I couldn't even cut them off to throw in a word.

112
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,420
They must be venting as much as they've suffered.

113
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,270
Hasn't everyone seen enough political feuds in the court to be sick and tired of them?

114
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,130
This time, the public opinion will surely move as one.

115
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,100
Inform the palace of this fact now.

116
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,440
Yes.

117
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,640
Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim!

118
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,940
I've found the peddler's house.

119
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,000
It's this way.

120
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,950
Hyung-nim, this is the house.

121
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,900
Bok Dan!

122
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,370
Your Highness, we have to go quickly.

123
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,980
What are you doing?  Do you want to be caught?

124
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,240
Hurry, Your Highness.

125
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,100
It can't be... Prince Milpoong.

126
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,170
What is wrong?

127
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:42,520
Th-That is... The rest of the silver taels,

128
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,410
I'd like it if you gave them to me now.

129
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,580
- What?
 - If you pass through here, it's the ferry dock.

130
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,810
The boat will be waiting, so I should take my leave here.

131
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,370
But look here, that's not what you promised.

132
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,610
What are you up to?

133
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,730
Wh-Wh-Why are you acting like this?

134
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,260
You were suspicious from early on when you kept glancing sideways.

135
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,030
Is the boat really there?

136
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,950
I'm asking whether you are trying to backstab us?!

137
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,470
When you're traitors, what?

138
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,940
Give it here.  Give me the silver taels!

139
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,970
- You bastard!  How dare a wretch like youâ€”
 - No!

140
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,690
Yoon Yeong, are you okay?

141
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,550
Is anyone there?

142
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,440
Isn't anyone here?

143
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,680
Isn't anyone here?

144
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,620
N-No!  D-Don't m-make noise, any noise.

145
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,750
Yoon Yeong.

146
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,110
Yoon Yeong.

147
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,790
Over there! Over there!

148
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,300
Excuse me, the traitors I reported are over there!

149
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,180
Yoon Yeong, you must stand up.

150
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,390
You have to come with me.

151
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,520
You have to come with me.

152
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,030
At least you said...

153
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:56,290
you'd make a lowly gisaeng like me your queen.

154
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,080
Still, not even once

155
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,620
did I embrace you with my whole heart.

156
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,870
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,510
No, no...

158
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,620
It's my fault, Yoon Yeong.

159
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,610
Don't be like this, Yoon Yeong.

160
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,980
I will wait for you from there,

161
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,560
so don't be too afraid to come.

162
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:36,370
I will be waiting... as your queen in the other world.

163
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,930
You must come... as king.

164
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,290
Yoon Yeong.

165
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,890
As king...

166
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,760
No.

167
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,130
Don't go without me, Yoon Yeong.

168
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,570
Don't abandon me.

169
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,280
At least you, don't abandon me.

170
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,520
 Over there! Just over there will be Prince Milpoong!

171
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,890
 Over there!  Over there are the traitors!

172
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,770
Prince Milpoong isn't here!  Find him!

173
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,680
Yes.

174
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,320
Bok Dan.

175
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,180
 Despite it all,

176
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,090
 I don't think I can bear to watch her die.

177
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,930
 Bok Dan.

178
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,990
 I'm Bok Dan.

179
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,570
 You?

180
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,270
 Dal...

181
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,400
 Dal Moon.

182
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,580
Here...

183
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,560
Get up.

184
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,550
What are you doing here, you fool?

185
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,150
You didn't

186
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,940
live so heartlessly

187
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,030
to end up like this.

188
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,870
I didn't let you go

189
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,850
so you could leave like this.

190
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,340
No!

191
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,810
No.

192
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,060
That woman... ended up like that.

193
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,080
Head Merchant Dal Moon personally buried her body.

194
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,520
Dal Moon.

195
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,350
They are looking for Prince Milpoong everywhere, so...

196
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,340
I am sorry, Your Majesty, but an urgent message has just arrived from Saheonbu.

197
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,860
What discourtesy is this?

198
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,640

199
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,890
I said the high-ranking Saheonbu officials are to make way for me.

200
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,720
We cannot obey.

201
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,700
We, the Saheonbu high officials, cannot accept installment

202
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,930
of the newly appointed inspector general, who is unfit for the job.

203
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,920
Under pain of death, we will not pull back from this stance.

204
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,380
Are you saying you will disobey the royal command?

205
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,740
Those fellas, in the end...  What are you waiting for?

206
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,130
Summon soldiers now!

207
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,390
No, Inspector Park!

208
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,350
- Are you going to cause a disturbance here?
- Lord!

209
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,410
What do you think they are after?

210
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,210
It's an excuse that His Majesty is persecuting the Saheonbu.

211
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,310
So are you going to just watch this?

212
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,160
Even when they are obstructing the lord inspector general?

213
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,010
We must.  His Lordship is also enduring this humiliation.

214
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,470
Stop.

215
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,120
Oh my!

216
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,280
The Saheonbu high officials are blocking the inspector general from coming to work?

217
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,600
I am extremely sorry, Your Majesty.

218
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,790
 Yet... what's the reason you helped me?

219
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,920
 You think it's no use in the end.

220
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,550
 Why?

221
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,190
 That is...

222
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,900
 the reason is, Your Majesty...

223
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,500
 that is the most genuine form of politics.

224
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,610
 Even if advancement is brief and in the end one has to retreat,

225
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,710
 not getting weary, not despairing,

226
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,700
 never letting go of the old hope till the end.

227
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,940
 From there, the world, little by very little,

228
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,750
 gets better, that's why.

229
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,850
Let's go on

230
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,090
not getting weary, not despairing,

231
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:17,210
even if in the end we have to retreat, that is.

232
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,970
His Majesty will go outside the palace.

233
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,870
All soldiers, take upmost care to guard him!

234
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,820
Yes.

235
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,360
 Here comes His Majesty!

236
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,610
H-H-His Majesty.

237
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,270
What do we do next?

238
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,010
L-Look over there!

239
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,120
Here.

240
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,510
My Lord!

241
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,730
Your Majesty.

242
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,780
Saheonbu high officials, hold a jejwa hearing  (Saheonbu's supreme decision-making tribunal)  right this instant.

243
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:29,290
I have something to say personally in that meeting.

244
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,680
Here comes His Majesty!

245
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,940
Here comes His Majesty!

246
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,890
Here comes His Majesty!

247
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,200
Over here!

248
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,030
Here comes His Majesty!

249
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,250
That's right.

250
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,350
I am the king.

251
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:27,680
I am. None other than I am the king!

252
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,300

253
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:37,360
The reason I have personally come to Saheonbu's jejwa hearing room today

254
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,970
is because I want to tell you that the new Joseon

255
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,190
needs to start here at Saheonbu.

256
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,650
This nation's Three Offices, and particularly Saheonbu,

257
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,930
have long been rotten to the core with evil customs and traditions.

258
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,550
Who of this nation would trust Saheonbu,

259
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,650
and who would believe in the fairness of Saheonbu?

260
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,080
Your Majesty, I am sorry butâ€”

261
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,280
Stop! I have not finished speaking.

262
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:31,780
However, I will not overlook Saheonbu's long history of corruption any longer.

263
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,740
This is for the sake of this country and all officials of Saheonbu.

264
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,150
As of today, from this place,

265
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,940
I proclaim to the whole world that I will abolish

266
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,510
the Ministry of the Interior's section chief system,

267
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,750
which has long held the appointment rights over Saheonbu,

268
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:57,080
and I will completely reform that system.

269
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:19,730

270
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,580

271
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:27,560
â™«  Since we met saying hello  â™«

272
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,910
â™«  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  â™«

273
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,990
 Carry out the sentences against the criminals immediately.

274
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,460
 Since I am innocent, I will walk tall and go of my own accord.

275
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,150
 Currently, even the popular sentiment favors His Majesty.

276
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,490
 What cause is there for you to fight?

277
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,890
 This time, I will definitely keep my promise to make you pay for your sins.

278
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,310
 Well, perhaps a life without any regrets... isn't that even more terrifying and frightening?

279
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,030
 I won't die by your hands.

280
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,550
 - Lee Geum!
 - Your Majesty!

281
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,060
 I am the king.

282
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,900
â™«  The wind is saying we must let each other go  â™«
