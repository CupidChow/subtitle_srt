1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,280
Entering the crown prince's quarters?

2
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,800
Yes, I am saying I will become a palace maid.

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,660
Do you even know what that means?

4
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,090
I do.  To become a palace maid, certain conditions must be met.

5
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,770
I know I am lacking as a palace maid.

6
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,830
But that is not what I am saying!

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,820
If you don't mean that, then what do you mean?

8
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,360
Are you asking me because you don't know what a palace maid is?

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,150
If you become a palace maid, not only doing your master's bidding but—

10
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,360
Of course.  I know it involves a lot of miscellaneous chores.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,190
No, not that, but...

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,480
Oh, I might end up in  suragan (palace kitchen) , but that's not a problem.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,780
I am a very good cook.

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,270
So please allow me to enter the crown prince's quarters.

15
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,570
I want to protect you no matter what.

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,630
Of course, there was no way you'd understand what I'm saying.

17
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,170
Excuse me?

18
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,380
I will teach you... what it means to become a palace maid.

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,630
That means

20
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,690
this is possible

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,650
and also

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,220
doing this

23
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,700
and

24
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,240
even doing this

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,430
are allowed.

26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:09,130

27
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,980
♫  An unimaginably painful dream  ♫

28
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,370
What am I doing to you?

30
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,800
Your Highness.

31
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,610
Do you understand now?

32
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,220
This is what it means to be a palace maid.

33
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,650
Irrespective of your heart,

34
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,700
this sort of thing can happen.

35
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,030
That's what it means.

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,940
So never again

37
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,280
speak such nonsense.

38
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,570
I think the crown prince is running late.

39
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,260
I will go and escort him here.

40
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,890
No.

41
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,650
No need.

42
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,410
Let's go.

43
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,780
I am a little late.

44
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,550
♫  So that I cannot forget you, so I cannot erase you  ♫

45
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:41,980
♫  So I would remember you even in my dreams  ♫

46
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,950
You came back sooner than expected.

47
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,600
Why are you out here?

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,390
I came out to see Hyung-nim off and fell down.

49
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,940
I didn't get to see him off.

50
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,100
But why did you come back so soon?

51
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,770
Didn't you walk him to the palace?

52
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,490
He said he'd go by himself.

53
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,150
This kid, this kid.  Hey, you shouldn't be like that toward Hyung-nim.

54
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,210
Yeo Ji, you're slacking a lot on your job lately.

55
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,460
♫  This whisper that calls for me  ♫

56
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,250
 Do you understand now?

57
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,080
 This is what it means to be a palace maid.

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,150
 Irrespective of your heart

59
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,490
 this sort of thing can happen.

60
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,040
 That's what it means.

61
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,390
♫  I cannot erase  ♫

62
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,400
This is the extent of the beat, but you don't have to patrol it every day,

63
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,530
because usually, not even a mouse stirs here after sundown.

64
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,700
Oh, yes.

65
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,410
I'm showing you because this is your first day.

66
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,130
Now, let's head back and drink...

67
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,450
Oh!  Wasn't that a human voice?

68
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,260
You can take this straight to the lord.

69
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,750
Patrolmen don't come here.  So as I said, follow this road straight ahead and...

70
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,810
Freeze!

71
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,780
Over there! Who the heck are you guys?

72
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,520
Didn't you hear the curfew bell tolling?

73
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,840
That is...

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,280
Do you have permission to pass?  Give me your ID stick.

75
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,100
We got delayed while taking the master home.

76
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,220
Here, Mr. Patrolman.

77
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,330
Let us pass just this once.

78
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,100
Buy yourselves some drinks with this.

79
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,460
You shouldn't have...

80
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,620
Mr. Patrolman!  Patrolman, this!

81
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,440
You got found out by constables patrolling their beat.

82
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,030
How can you mishandle things this way!

83
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,570
I apologize, Lord Section Chief.

84
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,820
How about the clean-up?  Did you do it properly?

85
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,750
Yes, however, just in case, how about asking the police commissioner for his assistance?

86
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,460
Police commissioner...

87
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,160
That greedy bastard will definitely ask for his share...

88
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,420

89
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,270
So the people eat these kinds of dishes for their snacks.

90
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,550
They have unfiltered rice wine with plain  namool (cooked seasoned vegetable) .

91
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,980
This will be a good experience for His Majesty and Crown Prince.

92
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,940

93
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,040
Soon the king's tillage ceremony will take place, right?

94
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,770
I am very sorry but, Your Majesty, that is not it.

95
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,970
When transplanting rice seedlings, you have to reinforce the furrows with wet earth.

96
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,260
That is right.

97
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,800
I do it every year during the tillage ceremony but I keep forgetting it.

98
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,240
It is a given that you would not know about the people's work.

99
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,680
But there is a person who's good at it the first time around.

100
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,140
Did you possibly finish all that by yourself?

101
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,690
I finished the tilling, so can I transplant the seedlings?

102
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,570
How can you be so skillful?

103
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,660
To do my rice bowl's worth, I gave my all to memorize this.

104
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,530
Do I look like a proper farmer?

105
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,410
Your grace is immeasurable.

106
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,110
Your Highness!  Your Highness Crown Prince!

107
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,550
It is okay.

108
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,310
Your Highness, I didn't get to tell you something.

109
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,180
Tell me.

110
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,090
Look here, why are you doing this?

111
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,620
I saw you at the giro party. 
 (Annual party held in honor of retired high government officials)

112
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,270
Thank you for understanding how we humble sharecroppers feel.

113
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,630
I really wanted to give you a big bow.

114
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,110
Look here, stand up already.

115
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:43,660
Your Highness, you will surely become a great king in the future.

116
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,560
If there is no one to work that land,

117
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,900
how will you feed and clothe yourselves?

118
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,220
That's so right.

119
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,380
Truly, who is living thanks to whom?

120
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,760
Hear, hear.

121
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,180
That part, even as I'm hearing it again, I get so emotional.

122
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,980
Is that why you, a man, are crying?

123
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,930
I don't grow tired of it no matter how many times I hear it.

124
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,360
- Right?
 - Yes, me, neither.

125
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,620
If I, the crown prince, get to succeed to the throne,

126
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,980
I shall levy land taxes from landowners!

127
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,210
His Highness the Crown Prince will become a great king!

128
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,180
Hooray!

129
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,720
Hooray!

130
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,680
Long live the crown prince!

131
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,690

132
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,110
What a bad situation we are in!

133
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,510
The capital is still echoing with praises of the crown prince.

134
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,420
They are cussing us, the Saheonbu, for arresting the crown prince!

135
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,590
Even my bond slaves were murmuring about the crown prince.

136
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,430
But the Saheonbu ruffled the crown prince's feathers.

137
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,680
Wouldn't he retaliate?

138
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,460
There's no way he will let it go.

139
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,290
Definitely, we are in for a sh*t storm.

140
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,260
You are worried for nothing.

141
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,610
Who has the right to appoint Saheonbu officials?

142
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,620
The crown prince?

143
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,420
The king?

144
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,620
No.

145
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,460
What is the reason we can wield our judiciary powers without pandering to the powerful?

146
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,330
There is nobody who can shake up the Saheonbu.

147
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,700
That is how the Saheonbu is.

148
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,460
The wilder the world goes, the more we have to lead the people to the right path.  That's our job.

149
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,160
Because that is the Saheonbu and its inspectors.

150
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,410
Today, you take care of a royal clan member, Prince Jangyeong's corruption case.

151
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,120
The impeachment case of the Secretary of Ministry of Rites.

152
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,460
The murder case of the chief gatekeeper.

153
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,560
And...

154
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,880
You two, why don't you just play some street hockey games?

155
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,220
Please forgive me.  I apologize, Lead Inspector.

156
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,120
I acted up insolently, not knowing the sky from the earth.

157
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,080
From now on, I will diligently carry out the biddings of the lead inspector.

158
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,750
Would you like some dog barks?  Woof, woof, arf, arf.

159
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,310
I am very good at those things.

160
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,560
Wh-What's up with you?

161
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,430
There is a leftover case anyway.

162
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,440
A wife is not holding a funeral rite for her dead husband?

163
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Wow, this is an edification of public morals case.  This is totally my speciality.

164
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,990
Let go of this before you talk!

165
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,280
I'm not going to let it go until you give it to me.

166
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,930
Going forward, I will diligently serve you, Sir Lead Inspector.

167
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,980
What's up with you?  Have you switched sides?

168
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,870
Yes, because the important thing is to survive.

169
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,620
I am going to gain power first.

170
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,670
To get power, I have to get cases.

171
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,150
To get assigned to cases, I will even crawl between the lead inspector's legs.

172
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,210
With unflapping wings and closed beaks, wait for the right time?

173
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,050
Why don't you recruit colleagues who will join us in our endeavor?

174
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,960
We are probably not the only ones thinking that the Saheonbu cannot stay like this.

175
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,030
You grow up fast.

176
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,450
Oh, by the way, about Damo Cheon,

177
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,640
is something the matter with her lately?

178
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,440
Yeo Ji?

179
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,420
But why?  What about Yeo Ji?

180
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,010
Ah Bong, why is she like that?

181
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,930
Strange, right?  Today, she didn't even eat lunch.

182
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,180
- She passed her meal?
 - Yes.

183
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,130
Don't kid me, dude.

184
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,280
It's true.

185
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,160
Hey, Ah Bong.

186
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,320
You come here.  See me for a second.

187
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,080
- Me?
 - Yes.

188
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,420
Did I do anything wrong?  I don't know what it is, but I'm sorry.

189
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,580
That's not it.

190
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,050
I have something to ask you.

191
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,490
Go on.

192
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,470
Come with me?

193
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:02,290
 And even doing this is allowed.

194
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,510
Your sigh is about to bore a hole in the ground.

195
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,490
What is it?  Why are you like this?

196
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,800
Nothing.

197
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,510
I don't think it is nothing.

198
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,370
I said it is nothing special.

199
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,950
I just did something to someone that I shouldn't have.

200
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,180
How do I fix it...

201
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,290
I am just thinking.

202
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,080
With a red face, you say something you shouldn't have done to someone...

204
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,650
Did it finally transpire?  An affair?

205
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,000
What?

206
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,660
Does it have to be fixed?

207
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,740
Your Highness who turns out to be rather inexperienced,

208
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,740
there is nothing like disallowed love in this world.

209
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,610
Love?  What are you saying...

210
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,240
It's because of Damo Cheon, right?

211
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,790
The thing you shouldn't have done...  How far did you get with that?  Confession?

212
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,690
If not...

213
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,720
Court Lady Ha!  Ha Cho Hong!

214
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,640
What?  Who on earth did that to you?

215
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,940
I can't tell you who.

216
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,740
But... a man... did it.

217
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,460
So according to you, a man definitely...

218
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,740
- Like this...
 - Yes, like that.

219
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,370
Like this?

220
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,690
Yes, like this.

221
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,280
You're saying he did this to you.

222
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,190
Yes, he did stop in the middle of it, but definitely...

223
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,580
Ah Bong, what does this mean?

224
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,270
Can it be...

225
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,400
You know, this...

226
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:33,330
Is this what a man and woman do that is talked about in those romance stories?

227
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,130
Cheon Yeo Ji, are you really asking me because you don't know?

228
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,470
You said he grabbed you, pulled you, and stopped.

229
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,120
A man to you.  In those situations, what would that mean?

230
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,860
Ah Bong, I'm right, right?

231
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,240
What I'm thinking is right, right?

232
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,060
You!

233
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,940
Dal Moon.

234
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,190
Are you that Dal Moon?

235
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,380
You came so soon.

236
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,360
I thought it would take a while.

237
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,820
It's this man right here, Yoon Yeong.

238
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,850
The person who plays with the capital's secret information.

239
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,440
I heard that you were under Min Jin Heon, too?

240
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
I heard that that old fox borrowed your hands.

241
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,930
That is just a rumor.

242
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,900
What special means would a street thug have to manage such things?

243
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,100
Oh, you want to raise your price.

244
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,170
Coming here means you'll be my man, no?

245
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,400
I am a royal and a generous rich man.

246
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,120
Mere money, plenty of it—

247
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,590
No, the reason I came is because I don't want to accept any more troublesome customers.

248
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:57,130
Especially, I don't deal with dogs in human's clothing like you.

249
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,520
Because I, too, have principles.

250
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,470
What?  Dog?

251
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't send me any more bothersome messengers.

252
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,620
I came to tell you that.

253
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,740
Hey, you beggar son of a bitch, to whom do you dare?

254
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,190
What are you doing?  Are you crazy?  You said you wanted to gain this person!

255
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,400
Then why the heck did you mingle with the crown prince?

256
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,060
It's because of your laughable ambition, isn't it?

257
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,330
The beggar that you are, you still wanted to make more fortune and get more power!

258
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,020
Don't do this, please!

259
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,140
Yes, there was

260
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,410
a time when I wanted that

261
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,610
because of a woman.

262
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,890
What the heck are you saying, son of a bitch?

263
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,290
Because of a woman

264
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,970
who wanted a higher place that I couldn't give her

265
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,260
instead of streets swarming with beggars.

266
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,660
Wait.

267
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,230
I said stop there!

268
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,280
Did you come, knowing?

269
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,930
I'm asking you if you came knowing that I was here.

270
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,830
 Catch her!  First, hurry and find her!

271
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,850
 Find her!

272
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,800
 Catch her!

273
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,580
 Catch her!

274
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,130
 Find her!

275
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,200
 Find her!

276
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,150
 Catch her!

277
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,520
 Bok Dan.

278
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,590
 I'm Bok Dan.

279
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,780
 You?

280
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,660
 Dal... Dal Moon.

281
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,670
You look good.

282
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:37,660
Yes, that silk dress surely

283
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,460
fits you better.

284
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,600
Her husband died. Why wouldn't the wife hold a funeral for him?

285
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,470
Lord, I think it's over there somewhere.

286
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,410
You told Yeo Ji to rest, right?

287
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,970
Yes, she overdid it for a while and she doesn't seem to be in good condition.

288
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,570
Supposedly, she even passed her meal today.  That's got to be a joke, right?

289
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,800
Lord!  Lord!

290
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,130
Uncle!

291
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,020
I'm sorry, I'm late.

292
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,310
Hey, how can you be so tardy, punk?

293
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,910
Yeo Ji kept asking me obvious questions about men.

294
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,080
I was busy answering her.

295
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,610
Yeo Ji asked about men?

296
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,910
Yes, that dummy. Seriously, I feel so frustrated with her.

297
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,140
She is a total fool. A fool.

298
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,510
Punk, you keep giving these excuses after coming late.

299
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,810
Wait.  Ah Bong, what did Yeo Ji...

300
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,680
 No!

301
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,110
 You can't.  Get away from there.

302
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,260
What's wrong?

303
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,330
Over there.  In there...

304
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,370
Kill me first.

305
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,760
You'll have to kill me to hold a funeral rite.

306
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,910
Drag her away this minute!

307
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,210
- Yes!
 - What is going on?

308
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,740
Are you from the Saheonbu?

309
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,250
We are making our rounds to check on public morals.  But what is up with the missus?

310
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,800
I am wronged.  My husband died a wrongful death!

311
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,220
I am saying he was murdered.

312
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,770
- What is she saying? Hurry and shut her up!
 - Yes!

313
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,970
Stop!

314
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,550
I will hear her story.

315
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,630
Lord Inspector!

316
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,390
I am from the Saheonbu. You can calm down.

317
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,910
What were you saying? A murder?

318
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,600
So the police bureau tried to cover up a constable's death?

319
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,690
Are you saying they faked an accidental death when there are suspicions of a homicide?

320
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:57,220
The deceased was a constable who started his job six days ago.

321
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,760
The police bureau said he had fallen from a bridge late at night.

322
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,780
But there is not even a bruise on his body.

323
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,410
This definitely is not a body that fell to its death.

324
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,690
But why is the police bureau covering up the death of one of its own?

325
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,370
Just see how he's handling the dead body.

326
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,870
Our Lord has become a proper inspector.

327
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,540
Concentrate, punk.

328
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,340
Can you help me with this for a second?

329
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,890
Yes.

330
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,570
Three pronged holes.

331
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,370
The tridents used by the police officers?

332
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,730

333
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,340
I heard that the police commissioner was looking for me?

334
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,420
Please enter.  He is expecting you.

335
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,750
You know him, too, right?  He's Kwon Ik Soo, the Section Chief of the Ministry of the Interior.

336
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,920
Of course, I do.  You have the right to appoint our Saheonbu officials.

337
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,180
I have seen you in a drinking party a while ago.

338
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,030
Yes, yes, I remember.

339
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,200
How can I forget Lord Deputy Inspector General?

340
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,070
Please talk down to me, Lord Deputy Inspector General.

341
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,740
Your rank is much higher than mine.

342
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,670
Oh, yes.

343
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,130
There was such an incident?

344
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,390
Isn't the section chief of the Ministry of the Interior a position that handles important matters for the country?

345
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,290
Because he oversees appointment of the officials of the Three Offices  (Saheonbu, Saganwon, and Hongmoongwan) .

346
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,500
It's a given that he will get tokens of appreciation from here and there.

347
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,260
In fact, isn't that customary?

348
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,720
It's discourteous to refuse small gifts.

349
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,030
A few days ago, while receiving some monetary gifts,

350
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,110
you got discovered by a couple of constables of the police bureau.

351
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,460
 If you divulge this, you won't be able to get out of this harmless.

352
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,950
 But isn't this illegal?

353
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,590
 However, one said he would report it,

354
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,340
 so you used the other constable to muzzle him.

355
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,120
But he suddenly died in the middle of it.

356
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,190
His wife won't bury him, so this case went to the Saheonbu.  Is that what you are telling me?

357
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,700
That is right.  I hushed it up within the police bureau,

358
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,570
but one of your inspectors is digging up the matter.

359
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,110
Please help me, Lord Deputy Inspector General.

360
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,510
If this gets revealed, I am really finished.

361
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,210
What on earth is the name of the Saheonbu inspector?

362
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,990
That is...

363
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,740
Did you just say Inspector Park Moon Soo of the Saheonbu?

364
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,250
Do you know him?

365
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,750
He is my friend who shares the same ideals.

366
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,830
That Inspector Park Moon Soo seems to be after

367
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,410
the secretive corruption of the section chief of the Ministry of the Interior.

368
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,050
This is intelligence from Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau) .

369
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,860
What?

370
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,600
Moon Soo is after the section chief of the Ministry of the Interior?

371
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,270
Ouch, my leg.

372
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,950
To where are you in such a hurry to go?

373
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,970
Who are you?

374
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,380
My Lord, I found it.

375
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,900
It's you, right?

376
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,300
The one who killed Constable Ma Sang Tae with this trident.

377
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,800
Tell me, who ordered you?
