1
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,800
 Here comes His Majesty!

2
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,970
 Your Majesty!

3
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,680
 That you, Assistant Officer Jo Hyeon Myeong, and Park Moon Soo will resign?

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,760
 Now, to lead this court, you must throw us away.

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,100
 An epidemic?  Did you just say an epidemic is spreading?

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,930
 If you want to turn the world upside down,

7
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,280
 you first have to create chaos.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,570
 - Who are you?
 - Do you want to turn the world upside down?

9
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,320
 A disease that broke out from Chungcheong Province has reached the capital Hanyang already!

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,820
 Is the whole country being devastated by the epidemic?

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,980
 Summon all high officials above the third rank belonging to the Border Defense Council.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,750
 Your Majesty, this may not be a plague.

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,110
 Have you all been well?

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,240
 So he has been preparing for a rebellion for a long time.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,360
 We need to live, too!

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,470
 We can't die staying in the capital!

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,800
 Third day since the breakout in the capital.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,830
 If you can't control the plague here,

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,560
 the capital will be total chaos.

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,870
 By now, not only the capital but the whole country is in chaos.

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,480
 Now we need to make propaganda flyers and spread them to anger people.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,370
 Wi Byeong Joo? Why is that man...

23
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,990
 The reason for the plague spreading in this country is because of the previous king's bloody tears,

24
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,480
 because the king has killed the previous king and stolen the throne.

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,760
 I am taking my father and leaving.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,720
 Do you not know a plague patient can't leave!

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,590
 The king is abandoning his people to save his own neck!

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,580
 The king won't be able to withstand the public opinion.

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,720
 That's the time to start the rebellion.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,130
 The plague and even the horrible posters slandering His Majesty.

31
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,570
 There must be something.

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,730
 Wi Byeong Joo, who should be dead by now, is still alive.

33
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,160
 I'll find out what it is.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,950
 Just what kind of a situation is His Majesty in right now?

35
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,360
 The rumor says Your Majesty will leave the palace to avoid the plague

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,860
 - and go to your vacation palace.
 - What?

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,550
 As soon as the day breaks, tell them this is a baseless rumor through the morning paper.

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,860
 They won't find a way.

39
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,720
 There's no easier and stronger weapon than fear.

40
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,220
 I cannot collapse here.

41
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,310
 I will do all that a king should do here.

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,040
What did you say just now? His Majesty left the palace?

43
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,820
Chief Royal Secretary!

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,670
Right State Councilor. You seeâ€”

45
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,430
Answer me. Where did His Majesty go?!

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,040
No way...

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,470
Did His Majesty...

48
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,800
His Majesty went to Hwalinseo.

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,490

50
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,440
Hwalinseo? You're saying he went himself?

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,040
Yes, Right State Councillor.

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,210
He went himself to comfort the patients.

53
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,030

54
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,110
Move out of the way!

55
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,520
We cannot trust this nation nor Hwalinseo anymore!

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,450
I need to take back my family who is in there!

57
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,860
Everyone! Let's push on and force our way in!

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,580
There is a rumor that Hwalinseo added Chinese aconite in the medicine!

59
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,430
We will go out!

60
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,910
We can't just wait to die like this!

61
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,330
Step back! You dare to disobey the king's command?

62
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,140
Like it matters!

63
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,750
While all of his people are dying, the king went away by himself

64
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,560
so that he could survive. He's not even a king!

65
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,520
 His Majesty is coming!

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:54,190
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

67
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,880
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

68
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:07,090

69
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,270

70
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,370
What are you doing?

71
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,990
Doctors and nurses, raise the patients.

72
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,510
How could you make the sick kneel?

73
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,890
Is this your father?

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,260
Yes, Your Majesty. He is.

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,910
Stand up.

76
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,180
How could you be on the cold floor when your body is weakened like this?

77
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,910
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

78
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,650
I know what you are all worried about,

79
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,210
what horrid rumors are spreading in the capital,

80
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:24,750
and what kind of fear you have regarding this illness because of that.

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,650
However, I, as the king of this nation,

82
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,560
will never abandon my people.

83
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,800
This illness is not a punishment,

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,570
and you will definitely be cured of it.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,370
Today, I came

86
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,790
to tell you this.

87
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:12,440
I will not take one step away from this place, this capital.

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,950
All of this is just a horrible deception.

89
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:22,860
Until the end, I will be with my people.

90
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,560
In addition, I will find a way to cure this illness

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,530
and save you who are suffering from it.

92
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,260
So endure and wait just a little longer.

93
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,490
Your Majesty.

94
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,780
I, the king of this nation, will definitely

95
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,800
keep this promise.

96
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,450
Your Majesty.

97
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,550
Did you see?

98
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,140
It is His Majesty.

99
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,560
It's the first time I've ever been this close to the king in my life.

100
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,220
That he came all the way here himself...

101
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,940
Who are we that he did this?

102
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,520
The king came to this dangerous place.

103
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:37,680
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

104
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,010
Your Majesty the King!

105
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,940
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

106
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,130
Your Majesty!

107
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,100
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

108
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,990
Stand up.

109
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,520
If you collapse, then who will take care of your father?

110
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,610
Your Majesty.

111
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,700
Please kill me.

112
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,140
Without knowing anything, I spoke blasphemy.

113
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:34,360
Please kill this worthless being, Your Majesty.

114
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,660
Your Majesty!

115
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,460

116
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
Come take a look.

117
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,330
Come and see.

118
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,590
Come look at this before you go.

119
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,550
 There must be something.

120
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,530
 Wi Byeong Joo, who should be dead by now, is still alive.

121
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,470
 You are thinking there's a plot to harm His Majesty.

122
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,790
 I'll follow Wi Byeong Joo.

123
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,760
 You two go to the capital and tell His Majesty of this fact.

124
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,890
Welcome, My Lord.  It's real jade.

125
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,480
What do you think about this one?

126
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,760
- Let me see that one, too.
 - Okay.

127
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,780
Altogether, they are ten nyang, but I will give them to you for four nyang.

128
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,950
Give me all four.

129
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,050
Goodbye. Come again, My Lord.

130
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,280
- Let me ask you a question.
- Are you going to buy an ornament?

131
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,490
Who are you going to give it to?  These for lawful wives and these for mistresses.

132
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,270
I couldn't even get married, so what the heck.

133
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,620
That's not what I want.

134
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,040
The customer just now... do you know him well?

135
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,690
Excuse me?  Why are you asking me that?

136
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,850
I don't need an ornament, just an answer.

137
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,210
Isn't this a profitable deal?

138
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,290
He seemed like an official belonging to Cheongju provincial government.

139
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,230
What does he do?

140
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,770
My Lord!

141
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,480
- Here you go.
 - Oh my!

142
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,160
Thank you, My Lord.

143
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,440
 He is a military officer in charge of the Cheongju arsenal?

144
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,650
Yes, he is a high ranking officer who keeps the arsenal keys.

145
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,120
 The provincial government's arsenal?

146
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,930
 Why did Wi Byeong Joo contact such a person?

147
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,250
 What do you mean by leaving the palace at a time like this?

148
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,530
Comforting the subjects' feelings, yes, that was needed.

149
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,240
However, you should have sent ministers to such a potentially dangerous place.

150
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,370
Overseeing the people is not just the king's job,

151
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,950
but it is also the ministers' job.

152
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,690
Do you think it would have worked?

153
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,480
This was probably the only way.

154
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,290
I know that I, the king, stepping up at a time like this

155
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,080
is, in a way, an irresponsible thing to do.

156
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,880
But if I had not taken charge personally,

157
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,190
do you think we could have placated the public that was on the brink of a rioting?

158
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,620
- Your Majesty, that isâ€”
 - What to do and how to get it done,

159
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,440
these are what matter right now, Left State Councilor.

160
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,560
Who gets it done does not matter.

161
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,010
Like you said, safeguarding the people

162
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,140
is the job of the king and ministers, all of us.

163
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,150
So let us now do our job.

164
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,600
This is the list of patients at Hwalinseo  (city medical clinics) .

165
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,190
Most of them seem to have used a few specific wells for their drinking water needs.

166
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,050
Did you just say wells?

167
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,590
Like I said from the beginning,

168
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,580
there must be a vile plot behind this.

169
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,910
Relay these instructions to the Mayor of Hanseong right now.

170
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,200
Yes, Left State Councilor.

171
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,580
First of all, seal up all the suspect wells right away

172
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,240
and provide the citizens of the capital with other clean drinking water.

173
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,540
Use of this well is prohibited.

174
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,050
Are you saying it can be the same disease that broke out in Cheongju before?

175
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,080
The symptoms are remarkably similar.

176
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,630
To call it a plague, it's strange that a rash is not one of the symptoms.

177
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,920
I think this disease is the same as Cheongju's mysterious disease.

178
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,750
We can search for the reason for its spread later.

179
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,500
For now, use the same prescription to treat the patients in the capital.

180
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,640
Send down the prescription that cured the Cheongju disease to Hwalinseo right now and let them treat the patients with it.

181
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,370
Yes.

182
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,960
A prescription from the King's Physician's Office.

183
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,460
I see.

184
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,300
This is the prescription from the King's Physician's Office.

185
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,310
Here.

186
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,840
It does not make any sense!

187
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,120
What does the king know about medicine?

188
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,190
A mysterious disease not caused by pestilence but by a plot?

189
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,970
Wasn't the predecessor king enough?

190
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,460
Now he wants to kill all the citizens of the capital?

191
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,880
Instead of blocking him, how can you be assisting him?

192
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,050
Then, do you have an alternative?

193
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,300
What are you doing besides throwing fits?

194
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,820
At least His Majesty is looking for a way.

195
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,190
He personally visited dangerous hwalinseos and prevented public opinion from turning sour.

196
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,960
His prescription is also worth giving a tryâ€”

197
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,710
What right does the king have to tend to the public opinion?

198
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,920
What right does he have when he committed immoral fratricide?

199
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
Look here!

200
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,290
Look at this.  This is the real public sentiment.

201
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,630
The king killed the predecessor king!

202
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,850
This is heaven's will as well.

203
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,190
Are you in your right mind?  How dare you use such a thing!

204
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,920
We can never be the king's followers.

205
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,440
And that applies to you, too, if you tell us to keep silent.

206
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,260
What?

207
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,010
This is a difficulty involved in the work we do.

208
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,800
If an enemy, then as an enemy we can fight against until the end,

209
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,830
it would be nice if he stayed incomprehensible.

210
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,250
Since politics is a human affair, too, the time comes when you start comprehending the enemy's point of view.

211
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,110
- Left State Councilor.
 - It was the first time

212
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,110
I felt at a loss for words in front of His Majesty.

213
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,540
This old and seasoned me

214
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,850
learned a lesson

215
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,950
from a young king.

216
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,410
That must be what troubles you too,

217
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,400
because you can understand His Majesty, the enemy.

218
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,260
Because you feel like you've got to hand it to him.

219
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,430
Yes, this may be the bizarreness of politics,

220
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,150
that none other than you, my political enemy,

221
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,990
understand how I feel right now better than anyone else.

222
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,230
Your Majesty, you are here.

223
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,970
How is the queen dowager?

224
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,270
Your Majesty.

225
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,440
It's okay. Stay seated.

226
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,160

227
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,560
She just had her medicine and fell asleep.

228
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,570
You must be having a tough time.

229
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,210
Are you okay?

230
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,630
Yes, do not worry about me, Your Majesty.

231
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,000
Her Highness will get better in no time.

232
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,010
She is stronger than anyone else.

233
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,600

234
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,990
Are you okay?

235
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,190
Ah, this...

236
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:49,050
Doctor!  Doctor, please hurry and come see this.

237
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,890
Look, the patients' complexions are getting better.

238
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,030
The medicine must be finally, finally taking effect.

239
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,300
Indeed, their pulses are normalizing.

240
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,970
How about other patients? What's the status in West Hwalinseo?

241
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,180
Hurry and go to the palace to inform them

242
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,490
that the patients in West Hwalinseo are getting better as well.

243
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,020
Yes, Doctor.

244
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,480
 Is that true?

245
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,050
All patients at Hwalinseo are regaining their energy?

246
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,250
I think the prescription worked.

247
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,340
Now, I think you can breathe a sigh of relief.

248
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,880
Your Majesty.

249
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,850
How about the queen dowager? Is she feeling better?

250
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,650
It is alright.

251
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,470
I can sit up by myself.

252
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,370
I will let His Majesty know.

253
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,380
Queen Dowager.

254
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,220
Your Majesty.

255
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,370
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

256
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:39,300
When you worry over me so much, how can I not be okay?

257
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,720
I have heard

258
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,190
that you are my life saver.

259
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,920
That is undeserved.

260
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,840
You have no idea how grateful I am that you have convalesced.

261
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,620
I should be the one thanking you.

262
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,500
She had a tough time nursing me too.

263
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,000
Your Majesty.

264
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,530
Is there, by any chance, another problem in the palace?

265
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,950
I can sense unusual military movements.

266
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,740
Also your countenance...

267
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,620
This illness can be but the beginning.

268
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,730
What will happen and from where...

269
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,720
I can't even fathom right now.

270
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,460
Do not worry.

271
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,490
No matter what happens, I will not be shaken,

272
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,000
because, as you said, you are guarding me by my side.

273
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,220
Your Majesty.

274
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,500
Now, now, everyone can show your ID stick and pass.

275
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,610
- Is it true that the plague has been contained? 
- That is right.

276
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,570
Now, everyone can feel safe and may enter.

277
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,320
Have you heard?  His Majesty personally went to the hwalinseo

278
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,150
and comforted the patients.

279
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,110
Then, that he'd run or something,

280
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,150
what was that rumor all about?

281
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,410
Aigoo, it wasn't just yesterday or today that fake news has been popular.

282
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,450
General.

283
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,930
That man called king is quite a trickster.

284
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,480
I shouldn't underestimate him.

285
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,770
Ask Saheonbu Inspector Yoon to come in now,

286
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,990
as secretly as possible.

287
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

288
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,710
 What in the world does this mean?

289
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,430
 Criminal Wi Byeong Joo who'd been awaiting execution escaped his place of exile?

290
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,030
 By the time I got there, all the soldiers guarding the place were dead,

291
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,100
 and Prince Milpoong had already escaped.

292
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,710
 Wi Byeong Joo and Prince Milpoong have disappeared.

293
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,820
 But to think that this matter was plotted by them...

294
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,950
 they had been confined and in exile for too long.

295
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,430
 Then, in the end, yet another person or another power

296
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,650
 could have spearheaded this matter.

297
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,140
Definitely, the final goal must be the overturn of the country.

298
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,290
Who on earth are you?

299
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,880
How far have you advanced?

300
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,390
- Is everything ready?
 - Yes.

301
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,080
The royal guards who will escort you will get here soon, too.

302
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,510
- Everyone, hurry.
 - Yes!

303
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,250
- What is going on?
 - I think His Majesty is going outside the palace.

304
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,130
- Really?
 - Yes.

305
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,470
At this hour?

306
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,660
Is this the right place?

307
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,260
I-I... think so.

308
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,570
Why of all places did he ask us to meet him here?

309
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,590
But isn't this...

310
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,320
Why?

311
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,980
What better place is there for forming an alliance?

312
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,410
Isn't this the late predecessor king's tomb site?

313
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:59,070
Oaths of revenge should be taken at none other than this place.

314
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,180
Are you Lee In Jwa?

315
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,920
By the way, to be frightened by a mere thing like this...

316
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,490
How can you accomplish something big?

317
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,750
- Your Majesty.
 - Dal Moon.

318
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,390
Your Majesty.

319
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,650
Is your message true?

320
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,610
Where are both of them?

321
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,500
Your Majesty.

322
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,190
Your Majesty.

323
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,320
Teacher, Assistant Officer, what happened?

324
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,740
Why are you two here?

325
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,510
Inspector Park informed us of this place.

326
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:49,060
He said we would be able to see you right away if we went through this place.

327
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,040
Cheongju?  Did you just say Cheongju?

328
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,330
Yes, Inspector Park Moon Soo said he definitely saw

329
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,940
Wi Byeong Joo  in front of the Cheongju government office.

330
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,490
There is another information.

331
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,950
Chae Yoon Yeong, the mistress of Prince Milpoong, who ran away,

332
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,080
was spotted in Jincheon, near Cheongju.

333
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,810
We have also heard, Your Majesty,

334
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,530
that the ground zero for the mysterious disease that spread to the three southern provinces and the capital

335
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,380
seems to be Cheongju.

336
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,730
Cheongju.  This rebellious vibe must have originated from there

337
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,070
and called in Wi Byeong Joo and Prince Milpoong as well.

338
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,630
They caused the spread of the disease even in the capital

339
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,320
and distributed propaganda flyers all over the nation on a massive scale.

340
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,710
The rebellious forces most certainly are not minor.

341
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:47,710
How many men and how organized they are will be the question, Your Majesty.

342
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:57,100
 From this moment on, why don't you leave behind that fear of yours, comrades?

343
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:05,120
Because we have embarked on the road with a mission of creating a new Joseon,

344
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,750
not even a waver in your determination shall be tolerated.

345
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,500
Th-Th-Th-Those... Who are those?

346
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,590
But isn't that Police Commissioner Nam Gyeong Jin?!

347
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,160
Provincial Military Commander of Pyongan Lee Sa Gyeong

348
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,600
and Ministry of Defense Royal Messenger Lee Sa Cheol are there, too.

349
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:12,450
All of us here have endured the tyranny of the world ruled by Norons.

350
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:18,530
Namin and Soron and everyone were killed

351
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,020
and ousted by them.

352
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,280
And the current king who had poisoned the predecessor king to death

353
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,150
has given power to those Norons again.

354
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:37,930
How can we bow down to him, the low-born murderer?

355
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,900
Therefore, now we are going to overturn this dirty world

356
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:51,040
no matter what sacrifice it takes, without fail.

357
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,530
And...

358
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,100
a new nation,

359
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,920
a new Joseon will be established.

360
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,870
- Right you are!
 - Here, here!

361
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,050
We must build a new Joseon!

362
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,650
Let's oust the king and build a new nation!

363
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,210
Let's build one!
