1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,560
Your Majesty!

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,200
Right State Councilor.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,330
Everyone, please excuse us.  I have something to discuss separately with Right State Councilor.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,960
Yes.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,480
Namin?  Did you say you would meet

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,100
the descendants of the fallen Namin families who are still in the capital?

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,190
That is right.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,760
The power base for Lee In Jwa, the leader of the rebels, is the fallen Namins outside the capital

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,700
who were slaughtered by the political purges.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,770
For that reason, they could not work for the government.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,220
If I were to promise them

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,820
opportunities to work for the government,

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,250
what if that information reaches the rebel armies?

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,070
You think the enemies will waver from inside.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,670
Also, this has been persistent homework this country ought to work on.

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,890
Opening the public offices to the talented regardless of their political factions.

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,350
Is that why you asked to see me?

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,500
Because I maintain close relationships with them?

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,280
Please do me this favor and allow me to see them.

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,950
This crisis can turn into

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,250
an opportunity for us.

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,360
Currently, our main base is here,

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,950
and the rebels are expected to reach Mokcheon by midnight.

24
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,820
The defense around Mokcheon Fortress is strong.

25
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,140
They will never be able to raid it easily.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,110
I will take select soldiers and go to Mokcheon ahead of time

27
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,950
and secretly observe the enemies' movements.

28
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,970
Lord Lieutenant.

29
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,570
You and I will try to get to Mokcheon as early as possible, before the main force, and scope out their movements.

30
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,830
Yes.

31
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,120
Where is Dal Moon?

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,620
He is gathering intelligence undercover as a refugee.

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,610
He will rejoin us as soon as he's finished.

34
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,120
Let's go.  We'd better rush.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,670
Yes.

36
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,830
Everyone, gallop on without stopping.

37
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,200
We will continue our march all the way to the capital without taking a break.

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,110
Yes, General!

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:04,770
 However, the Norons...  Do you think they will give in, Your Majesty?

40
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,990
 The ones who have monopolized government posts for a long time are Norons.

41
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,710
 To promise Namin opportunities,

42
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,380
 first, Noron's concession must be predicated.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,580
 I will see Left State Councilor Min Jin Heon.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,180
 At least he may be able to agree with us

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,880
 that this is the only way.

46
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,460
 Your Majesty, His Excellency Left State Councilor Min Jin Heon is here to see you.

47
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,000
Welcome, Left State Councilor.

48
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,350
- You seem like a refugee.  Where are you coming from?
 - Let me ask you a question.

49
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,960
Where have you seen the rebel armies?

50
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,020
Hyung-nim, Hyung-nim, Dal Moon Hyung-nim!

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,890
Whoa.

52
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,690
Lord Lieutenant.

53
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,450
Our whereabouts are here, probably Cheongan.

54
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,670
We'll be able to get to Mokcheon if we gallop on until 1 AM.

55
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,470
Just a moment, Lord.

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,310
Look over there.

57
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,870
- What on earth are those firelights?
 - Hide the horses quickly!

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,460
 What?  Mokcheon?

59
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,520
Yes, she ran away from Mokcheon today

60
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,270
and the bastards arrived there by 1 PM

61
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,170
without shedding a single drop of blood.

62
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,070
They already captured Mokcheon by that time!

63
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,190
Can it be they have by now...

64
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,830
This doesn't make any sense.  How can this be?!

65
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,440
This is Cheongan.  How can they possibly be here already?

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,460
Cheongan is the gateway to the capital!

67
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,210
Your Majesty, I am sorry but what are you talking about?

68
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,900
Equal hiring, without taking political affiliations into account.

69
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,600
I said I would promise the Magnificent Harmony policy that is impartial to

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,220
any political party in regards to government personnel hiring.

71
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,520
- Your Majesty!
  Left State Councilor, you must be aware of this, too.

72
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,940
Why this country had to undergo bloodbaths in the past.

73
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,120
Why political schools that used to debate over values and convictions

74
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,190
degenerated into factions out to kill one another.

75
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,450
Monopoly over power and positions.

76
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,160
Machinations and clashes for their sakes.  Weren't those the exact cause?

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,080
That is absurd, Your Majesty.

78
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,430
How can you blame only Norons for that?

79
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,110
The ones who suffered the most amidst the political strife

80
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,880
were none other than us, Norons.

81
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,720
That is why I suggest we end this mayhem.

82
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,830
That mayhem will never end!

83
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,940
Before power, how can human beings make concessions and peace?

84
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,350
- How can you dream such a naive dream from the throne?
 - Left State Councilor!

85
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,410
Your Majesty, did you just say we should share and cede power?

86
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,340
Hand over Noron's positions to Namin and Soron?

87
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,570
Impossible. It is an impossible thing.

88
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,990
That is not politics but

89
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,140
a mere, fantasy-like dream.

90
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,460
I've heard from Right State Councilor.

91
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,790
That while sending the people off to the battlegrounds,

92
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,640
you too were grief-stricken.

93
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,210
Wasn't that because, as a politician, at least you felt

94
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,710
responsible toward the people?

95
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,270
Noron's power?

96
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,430
You should try to protect it.

97
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,560
However, simultaneously, that responsibility...

98
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,630
You cannot ignore it, am I not right?

99
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,900
You and I do not shed

100
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,610
blood in battlefields.

101
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,980
Left State Councilor, the ones who always die in our stead

102
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,900
are the weak people.

103
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,280
However, there is something we can do for them.

104
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,380
So that this war can end,

105
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,670
so that this kind of misery never happens again,

106
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,130
I am saying there is

107
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,460
another thing that politics can accomplish.

108
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,970
- Friend.
 - You did a useless thing.

109
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,010
This suggestion doesn't deserve a single thought.

110
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,270
Go on and arrange my meeting with Namin as discussed.

111
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,220
- But Your Majesty!
 - The king of this country is me.

112
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,960
I will persuade them.

113
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,860
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

114
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,490
It's an urgent message.

115
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,790
A report has just arrived informing of the rebel armies' arrival at Cheongan.

116
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,750
Cheongan!

117
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,400
Isn't that place the entrance way for the capital?

118
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,860
An official message!  Official message!  Official message!

119
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,330
An official message!

120
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,200
From Mokcheon even on to Cheongan!

121
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,160
The rebel armies captured it without shedding a single drop of blood!

122
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,210
How on earth could this happen?

123
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,230
Money?  They bribed them?

124
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,560
Yes, My Lord.  It must be from Prince Milpoong.

125
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,240
With that money, they distributed rice and grain and bought the hearts of the people in Mokcheon and Cheongan

126
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,170
and brought around the government soldiers first.

127
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,320
Even so, government soldiers making way to traitors without any resistance!

128
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,130
Some people don't care who the country's sovereign is.

129
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,210
To them, a grain of rice in their hand is more important.

130
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,180
The one who made them that way is also this country.

131
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,420
Still, this is unacceptable.

132
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,580
If we can't block them here,

133
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,260
the next one is the capital.

134
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,130
The rebels have arrived at Cheongan.

135
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,670
It's just a matter of time before they reach the capital.

136
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,240
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

137
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,680
I am sorry at a moment like this, but can I tell you this...

138
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,860
What happened?

139
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,370
Your Majesty.

140
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,930
Where are you going?

141
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,380
What on earth is all this...

142
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,740
No, this...

143
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,580
Were you going to leave the palace?

144
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,280
It can't be, to guard the capital, even you would...

145
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:35,060
No, you must never leave the palace.

146
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,910
I have heard that the traitors are on the capital's doorsill.

147
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,310
If I don't do anything about it, Your Majesty will...

148
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,850
Please...

149
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,160
stay here for me,

150
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,530
by my side,

151
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,240
at least you.

152
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,710
I can't put even you in danger.

153
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,830
I...

154
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,790
If I can't protect even you....

155
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,200
If that happens, then I'm going to...

156
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:27,500
♫  You whom I love  ♫

157
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:34,240
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

158
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,010
♫  You whom I love  ♫

159
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:49,960
♫  I cannot erase  ♫

160
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,480
It's not just the higher-ups of Saheonbu.

161
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,770
Even Lord Inspector General hasn't come under a pretext of sickness.

162
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,980
It's obvious.  They must be running away even before the ordinary people.

163
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,520
When they are paid government officials,

164
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,710
how can they behave like this?

165
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,950
Let's go.  First, we have to go to Kaesong.

166
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,450
L-Lord Inspector General.

167
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,130
A-Are you on your way to take refuge?

168
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,100
You, too?

169
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,690
N-No, not refuge, but I...

170
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,260
My health is poor so I have to recuperate for the time being.

171
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,680
Ah, yes. Let's go.

172
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,310
Yes, let's go.

173
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,600
I am too ashamed to look you guys in the eye.

174
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,060
What fault is it of yours?

175
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,200
We just feel sorry for His Majesty and the people who rely on these kinds of men as Saheonbu.

176
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,410
Even if just us, let us, the remaining ones, do all of our duties conscientiously.

177
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,590
The capital must be chaotic right now so we—

178
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,110
Who is it?

179
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,560
It's me.

180
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,460
Lead Inspector, please help me.

181
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,280
Inspector Joo?  Help him up quickly.

182
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,630
Ouch...

183
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,940
Thank you.

184
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,540
But what are you doing here right now?

185
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,440
No way... have you just come to work?

186
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,740
- Pardon?
 - None other than you?

187
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,010
Me?

188
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,690
Inspector Joo!  How surprising and commendable!

189
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,170
Frankly, I thought you'd be the first one to cut and run!

190
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,170
What's this?

191
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:11,400
No, the thing is, while I was packing up stuff at home before fleeing, I remembered that I left this at Saheonbu.

192
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
- What?
 - You...

193
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,040
Yes, I hid a bit of my salary here each payday without my wife's knowledge.

194
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,350
Then, I will take my leave now.

195
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,700
Everyone, you must be on your way to find shelter too.

196
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,810
Not in a million years.

197
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,040
Today, you are coming with me to make rounds to check on public morals.

198
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,740
Excuse me?  Public morals?

199
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,570
In this chaos?

200
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,400
Since things are chaotic, all the more reason why we should make rounds.

201
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,350
Follow me.

202
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,340
Lead Inspector, I am the only son of my family for the fifth consecutive generation,

203
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,700
and I support a widowed mother.

204
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,720
I know that you have four older and younger brothers and both your parents are healthy and alive.

205
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,840
- Come with me!
 - How meticulous!

206
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,580
Please save me.  I have to leave!

207
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,390
Your Majesty.

208
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,750
Then, you will open ways for us Namins, too,

209
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,040
to go on to hold government posts, Your Majesty?

210
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,890
That is correct.  I've come to confirm it and promise it to you personally.

211
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,800
And what you want in return is for the leading Namins of the capital

212
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,830
to make a declaration that they support this country's court?

213
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,900
Of course, this is a political deal.

214
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,920
But at the same time, I am trying to rectify the persistent social ills of this country.

215
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,380
Your Majesty, what you are saying is plenty moving.

216
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,740
Through His Excellency Right State Councilor, too, we have already confirmed that

217
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,840
this is not mere political rhetoric but Your Majesty's sincere intention.

218
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,870
However, Your Majesty, do you think you can keep that promise?

219
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,500
When we know the realities of the court so well,

220
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,330
how can we follow you simply trusting in your word?

221
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,990
Look here, this is the long-cherished hope of all of us.  Please reconsider...

222
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:34,050
No!  That is an impossibility.

223
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,070
As long as Noron holds out, your promise will

224
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,000
become an empty oath in the end.

225
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,000
Look here.

226
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,610
How come you haven't fled the town?

227
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,010
I am on my way to do some fieldwork.

228
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,270
It's the main sowing season.

229
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,920
No matter where I go, the likes of me...

230
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,730
where would the likes of me afford restful shelter?

231
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:44,070
I will just die working my field.

232
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,130
You seem like a lofty nobleman and seeing you still here in the capital,

233
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,050
that sight is more surprising to me.

234
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:59,140
They say the high-ranking government officials hightailed it out of here first.

235
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,170
Left State Councilor.

236
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,310
Your Majesty.

237
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,360
What is the current status regarding the defense of the capital?

238
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,410
The Five Military Garrisons led by the Governor's Military Aides were placed at main gates.

239
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,490
According to the latest report from the district governor,

240
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,850
our military will form the final line of defense at Jiksan.

241
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,850

242
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,800
Wait.  Did you just say Jiksan?

243
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,520
Jiksan...

244
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,140
Yes, it is Jiksan.

245
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,470
They will definitely use the wide road from Cheongan to Jiksan

246
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,560
because that will afford the easiest access to the capital.

247
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,890
Jiksan...

248
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,350
Jiksan, you say...

249
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,230
However, what if we move all the soldiers to Jiksan

250
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,360
and they head through another route? Then it'll be the end for us.

251
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,310
But there is no other way.

252
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,970
With an insufficient number of government soldiers, we can only guard one place.

253
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,700
We have to go to Jiksan.

254
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,720
Anseong and Jooksan have rough mountainous terrains so the danger of ambush is quite high.

255
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,140
What are you going to do, General?

256
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,250
General, we cannot delay our march further.

257
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,910
The government soldiers are right behind us...

258
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,490
General, a message.

259
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,130
From our spy in the government military camp, a piece of intelligence has finally arrived.

260
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,250
Our spy?

261
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,900
What is going on?  Weren't they all discovered?

262
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,290
When we have suffered so long under them, how can we be all wiped out overnight?

263
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,380
Still there are quite a number of Namins hungry for bloody revenge inside the capital.

264
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,800
What can we do?

265
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,520
Where does it say the bastards will be guarding?

266
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,290
Jiksan.

267
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,670

268
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,320
As expected, it is Jiksan.

269
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,110
In that case, we will charge through here, Anseong.

270
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,660
What are you waiting for?  Prepare everyone for the march.

271
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,130
We have to proceed through Anseong and break all the way through the capital.

272
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,360
Yes, General.

273
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,370
You can't mean to participate in this battle?

274
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,770
No, not you, Your Highness.

275
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,700
Your Majesty!

276
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,450
You have to call me "Your Majesty" now.

277
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,650
Finally, I am on my way to recapture my country, my seat, Yoon Yeong.

278
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,410
I have to be at the forefront.

279
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,120
The one who first sets foot in the capital, the one who opens up the palace gate,

280
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,540
and the one who beheads Lee Geum should be me.

281
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,900
If this gets done, I become a dynasty founding merit subject.

282
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,810
My descendants will become a family of

283
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,910
left and right state councilors and prime ministers.

284
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,510
Are you all ready?

285
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,940
Lord!  Yes.

286
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,970
Of course, as soon as you are ready.

287
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,560
Everyone, let's

288
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,840
meet again all safe and sound.

289
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
Of course.  That goes without saying.

290
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,290
After demolishing all the traitors.

291
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:23,710
After cutting off the necks of those damned bastards Prince Milpoong, Wi Byeong Joo, and Lee In Jwa.

292
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,930
Without fail.

293
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,830
We will see you again alive, Lord.

294
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,240
Please.

295
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,310
Please.

296
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,490
We will hide here and when the enemies appear, we'll ambush them.

297
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,240
Yes.

298
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,100
Nock your arrows now and get ready.

299
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,450
Please come...

300
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:53,420
You bastards must come through here, to this place.

301
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,410
The government soldiers must have headed to Jiksan after all.

302
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:13,190
I can't see even a mouse stirring around the Anseong Fortress.

303
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,610
Then what are we diddling around for?  We have to seize Anseong right away and proceed to the capital.

304
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,740
Everyone, seize Anseong!

305
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,620
Attack!

306
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,830
Attack!

307
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,480
But why is it so quiet?

308
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,380
Isn't it about time that they are here?

309
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,480
My Lord, it can't be...

310
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,580
No, they will come.

311
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,890
The bastards will definitely come through here.

312
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,490
Yes, it will be so.

313
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,140
Definitely.

314
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,650
Everyone, don't stop but charge on!

315
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,800
Run on all the way to the capital!

316
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,080
I will cut off that pretender Lee Geum's neck!

317
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,810
This battle.

318
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,490
Gallop on!

319
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,520
 For sure we will...

320
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,460
 We will

321
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,940
win it.

322
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,310

323
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:54,340
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫

324
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:01,340
♫  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  ♫

325
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,700

326
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,720
 Charge!

327
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,130
 No one, back down!

328
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,540
 We must recapture the fortress at all cost!

329
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,740
 I have heard that they have spies even inside the government military camp.

330
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,040
 Soldiers are flooding in, General.

331
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,340
 Park Moon Soo, our long tiring relationship comes to an end now.

332
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,510
 It is not over yet.

333
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,550
 Often, some political moves come not from the head

334
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,970
 but from the heart.

335
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,620
 Lee In Jwa and Prince Milpoong who have escaped still remain at large, Your Majesty.

336
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,810
 I have to go and behead that bastard Lee Geum!

337
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,090
 Is something the matter? Why are you still in your work robe?

338
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,620
 No matter what happens,

339
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,880
 we must capture both of them.
