1
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,380

2
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,390
No matter how much I think about it,

3
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,560
this is a bit odd.

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,590
Somehow...

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,090
Go and see why nobody is coming yet.

6
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

7
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,380

8
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,220
Prince Milpoong!

9
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,110
Yoon Yeong!

10
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,320
Yoon Yeong.

11
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,470
Yoon Yeong.

12
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,350
Where were you?

13
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,840
I thought you had abandoned me.

14
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,200
But that's not the case, right?

15
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,420
You came back.

16
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,380
Don't worry.  I am to gather up our reinforcements here.

17
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,860
No such thing as reinforcements will come.  This is a trap.

18
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,760
Lee In Jwa has abandoned you!

19
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,360
What?

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,130
No, that's not true. That's not the case.

21
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,060
We have to go.

22
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,440
The government soldiers are coming.

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,750
If you stay here, you will die!

24
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,910
You must capture Prince Milpoong alive!

25
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,740
Yes.

26
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,890
It's no use.  It's over!  If you want to live,

27
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,580
you have to run away too.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,810
 Here comes His Majesty!

29
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,480

30
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,770
I finally see you, the rebel head, Lee In Jwa.

31
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,630

32
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:04,920
How dare you harm innocent people and ravage this land.

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,770
I shall not fail to exact severe penalties for your heinous crimes.

34
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,730
An unqualified king.

35
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,000
You rascal!

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,770
I, too, get to see you finally.

37
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,320
What do you dare to babble?

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,160
Dare to?  Who is he, anyway?

39
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,960
Exactly how is this guy different from me?

40
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,720
If I sinned, it was the sin of being born a Namin.

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,090
That is all.

42
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,340
Shut your mouth!

43
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,070
Just strike me.

44
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,400
My life is over anyway.  I will die here for you.

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,970
However, I justly rose up in arms.

46
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,790
This world where I can't do anything because I am guilty of being born a Namin!

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,330
That rotten world...

48
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,030
I simply tried to change it.

49
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,730
Your Majesty, please give me your order.

50
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,380
- I will immediately kill— 
- Stop.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,110
Your Majesty!

52
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,410
Is that truly all?

53
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:30,370
The sole reason you killed people and wreaked havoc in the world is that?

54
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,570
I am asking you.

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,410
Alright.  What you say is correct, Lee In Jwa.

56
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,210
You and I are not different.

57
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,080
Because for me, too, the only sin I was guilty of was being born with lowly blood.

58
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,870
- Your Majesty!
 - It must be so.

59
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,890
The one who knows how you feel better than anyone else in this country

60
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,980
must be the king you tried to oust,

61
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,930
none other than myself.

62
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,410
However, you were wrong!

63
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,170
That the world can never be changed that way,

64
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,920
that there is another way,

65
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,410
I will make sure

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,430
to prove it to you.

67
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,780

68
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,770
Wait just a little while.  Together with your comrades,

69
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,350
I will kill you all in one go.

70
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,270
- Guard the criminal closely. 
- Yes.

71
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,100
Your Majesty.

72
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,120
Prince Milpoong has not been arrested yet?

73
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,800
He couldn't have gone far!

74
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,690
Block the ferry dock and thoroughfares and search every nook and cranny!

75
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,350
Yes.

76
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,780
Stay here.  I will somehow find a way to get away from this place.

77
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,930
I don't want to.

78
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,190
Why?  Why do I have to run away?

79
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,640
- Prince Milpoong.
 - I am the king.

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,340
I have to return to my place—

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,460
King? Come to your senses.

82
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,350
You were never that capable to begin with.

83
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:21,130
It wasn't just the Noron or Lee In Jwa!  I, too, have used you

84
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,000
because you were pathetic and stupid.

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,500
If anyone called you king and flattered you just a little bit,

86
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,760
it was only too easy to manipulate you.

87
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,880
Yoon Yeong.

88
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,310
After being used by a bi*ch like me all your life,

89
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,240
do you even want to be killed like a dog?

90
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm asking whether you will die acting up like a clown to the end?

91
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,430
How is the situation outside?  How about the government soldiers?

92
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,020
The surrounding area is crawling with them.

93
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,340
Even Lee In Jwa and the rest of his rebels have been shipped off to Uigeumbu just now.

94
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,380
What?

95
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,910
This won't do.  Since Head Merchant Dal Moon asked me to do this,

96
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,810
I even brought you to my house.

97
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,030
But doing more will be troublesome.

98
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,540
Please look into getting a boat to go to Qing.

99
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,280
Without Dal Moon's knowledge.

100
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,740
But...

101
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,560
No. It's too dangerous.

102
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,470
Half of what I have remaining will be all yours too

103
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,340
once you get the boat.

104
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,290
 King? Come to your senses.

105
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,240
 You were never that capable to begin with.

106
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,780
 It wasn't just the Noron or Lee In Jwa!  I, too, have used you

107
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,830
 because you were pathetic and stupid.

108
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,560
 If flattered you just a little bit, it was only too easy to manipulate you.

109
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,120
 If you knew you couldn't amount to much,

110
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,370
 you shouldn't have thrown such a fit.

111
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,110
 No, no. You can't!

112
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,010
 Don't abandon me.

113
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,220
 Please! Please! I will do anything you tell me to do, so please!

114
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,410
 When I see the likes of you...

115
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,840
 Status is only a delusion.

116
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,660
 Humans are just talking beasts.

117
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,970
 That's what you find out.

118
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,000
 Since you're singing about blood,

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,980
 you're not even a son of the king.

120
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,840
 So in other words, the collateral family line?

121
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,870
 I did wrong.

122
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,910
 I did wrong, Father.

123
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,510
 How can I trust a fool like you?

124
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,730
 Who will consider you king material?!

125
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,930
 No!  You are all wrong!

126
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,630
 You are all wrong.

127
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,780
The true king of this nation is me.

128
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,350
 - Your Majesty the King.
 - Your Majesty the King.

129
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,470
 All of this nation will stand together to remove the false king

130
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,270
 and greet the true owner!

131
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:43,180
 This country is Crown Prince Sohyeon and my father's...

132
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,710
My father...

133
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,590
I am here to see His Majesty.  Please announce me.

134
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,600
Your Majesty, are you really going to hand down your decree like this?

135
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,960
- Carry it out like I have told you.
 - But Your Majesty...

136
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,270
 Your Majesty, Saheonbu Inspector Park Moon Soo is standing by.

137
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,280
Let him in.

138
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,520
Welcome.

139
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,410
Your Majesty, was Prince Milpoong's trace discovered?

140
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,130
The soldiers of the Five Divisional Garrisons are after him.

141
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,940
He will never be able to get away.

142
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,370
More importantly for you, Moon Soo, you must now return to Saheonbu.

143
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,530
- To Saheonbu, you say?
 - Yes.

144
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,180
Because now in the court and in Saheonbu,

145
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,680
a different sort of an old war will start.

146
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,980
Is anyone outside?

147
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,550
Are you looking for me, Your Majesty?

148
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,010
I will convene a cabinet meeting right now.

149
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,190
Tell all high officials over the senior third rank to participate without exception.

150
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,710
Who are they?

152
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,460
Red robes mean officials over the senior 3rd rank.  But they are unfamiliar faces...

153
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,160
Your Excellency, isn't that Jo Deok Soo of the Namin faction?

154
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,920
- What? Namin?
 - Yes.

155
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,390
That's right.

156
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,880
The Namins who had been ousted from the court...

157
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,900
So why on earth did they come into the palace?

158
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,480
 Here comes His Majesty!

159
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,630
Your Majesty.

160
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:17,460
Your Majesty, I am sorry to say this, but how come in this court right now—

161
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,380
If you are sorry, then it would be better if you stopped there, Minister of the Interior.

162
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,430
What you are curious about is the agenda of this cabinet meeting.

163
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,970
So if you wait, I, the king, will kindly give you the answer to your question.

164
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,900
Thanks to your loyalty and efforts, the rebel head Lee In Jwa was apprehended

165
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,130
and the remaining rebels have been caught.

166
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,480
This was thanks to the people who sacrificed their lives

167
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,940
as if they were mere straws  (as if their lives meant little to them)  to stop this rebellion.

168
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:01,970
It was also thanks to your cross-factional decisions and devotion.

169
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,330
I will never forget that.

170
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,820
With that strength, we will overcome the wounds left by this rebellion,

171
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:18,350
and unwaveringly, we shall proceed on the road to reform Joseon.

172
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:25,070
Therefore, firstly, I intend to reshape the court by adding new personnel.

173
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,120
Chief Royal Secretary, proclaim the king's decree.

174
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

175
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,660
"Today, I, the king, appoint new personnel."

176
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,530
"First of all, to rally all the regional public sentiment that has been divided by the rebellion,

177
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,870
I appoint Jo Deok Soo, the former fourth counselor of the Office of Special Advisors,

178
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,530
to the position of recruiting commissioner of Gyeongsang Province."

179
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,510

180
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,710
Your grace is immeasurable.

181
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,280
"Moreover, as the recruiting commissioner of Chungcheong Province,

182
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,880
Yoo Soon, the former deputy minister—"

183
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,600
No, this is unacceptable, Your Majesty!

184
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
Your Majesty, how on earth do they deserve—

185
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,270
Chief Royal Secretary, continue!

186
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

187
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,120
"As the recruiting commissioner of Chungcheong Province,

188
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,420
Yoo Soon, the former deputy minister, is named."

189
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,300
Your grace is immeasurable.

190
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,240
"Moreover, Yoon Heon Joong, the former minister,

191
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,940
is appointed pacification commissioner of the Northern States."

192
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,550

193
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,920
Your grace is immeasurable.

194
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,750
"My ministers, carry out your given duties with all your loyal hearts."

195
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,470
Your grace is immeasurable.

196
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,310
What do you mean by Jo Deok Soo and Yoo Soon, Your Majesty?

197
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,430
They have no right to set their foot in this court.

198
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,830
I cannot agree to this royal decree!

199
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:17,150
What contribution have they made for you to entrust them with such important duties?

200
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,720
Please listen to our counsel!

201
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,250
Please listen to our counsel!

202
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,990
Please listen to our counsel!

203
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,630
Please listen to our counsel!

204
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,330
They are all Namins.

205
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,120
There could be spies who aided and abetted Lee In Jwa!

206
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,180
When you should be punishing them, you're instead giving them government positions!

207
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,880
That is absurd and unreasonable!

208
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,730
What do you mean aid and abet?!  Watch your words!

209
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,360
Did I say anything wrong?

210
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,850
What nonsense are you spewing?!

211
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,570
What are you saying!

212
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,280
Be quiet, quiet!

213
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,430
Look here!

214
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,850
So what is the atmosphere like among the ministers?

215
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,870
Everyone is enraged irrespective of their factions.

216
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,780
Of course, they won't stand for giving Namins opportunities.

217
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,130
His Majesty is about to engage in a hard battle.

218
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,430
One slip and he can turn the whole of the court into his enemies.

219
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,290
Your Majesty, what do you think about slowing it down a little bit?

220
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,320
We have barely come out of the rebellion's ravages, and Prince Milpoong is still at large.

221
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
When there is chaos to be set aright still—

222
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,800
That is why I am insisting on doing it now.

223
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:46,320
Because the present, when there are still vestiges of chaos lingering, is the best time for reform.

224
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,540
What do you mean the present is the best time?

225
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,530
I am still a weak king without many resources.

226
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,410
As such a king, the only thing I can trust in is the public opinion.

227
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,870
The rebellion ended yesterday, but the government officials are busy fighting over personal gains.

228
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,190
What would the people think about them?

229
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,700
Public opinion?  Are you saying you will move it to gain support?

230
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,950
The casualties from this rebellion reached thousands.

231
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,960
They were all the people's family members and relatives.

232
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,140
When the country is in this shape, the officials rise up

233
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,420
like an angry swarm of bees at the suggestion of hiring Namins.

234
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:32,450
This wrath will not end here, with me only.

235
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,410
Palace Maid Cheon.

236
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,790
Court Lady, how is His Majesty?

237
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,690
May I see him briefly?

238
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,510
I think it will be hard now.  He's been having non-stop meetings in his office.

239
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,560
You know how the whole palace is in an upheaval right now?

240
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,140
We Sorons have stood by the court during the rebellion.

241
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,140
But Namins get the positions?

242
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,160
We are pushovers when it comes to Norons.

243
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,430
We cannot take back seats any longer!

244
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,900
We Sorons are getting pushed back in the turf war.

245
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,630
Are you suggesting that I make that protest to the king?

246
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,130
Your Excellency, that's not what we are saying, but—

247
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,780
Go on.

248
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,470
What more should I entreat to His Majesty for your sake?

249
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,890
Is it true that you agreed to let the Namins have government positions?

250
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,860
It was an inevitable choice to stem the rebellion.

251
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,900
His Majesty will now demand the next thing, the next position from us!

252
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,940
How could the head of Norons make such a concession?

253
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,340
It was not a concession, but politics.

254
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,300
Because that choice was a better political move.

255
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,410
However, as the head of Noron, I ought not to have chosen it.

256
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:07,730
Since I don't deserve to lead you anymore, I will resign.

257
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,160
Are you satisfied now?

258
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,300
- Your Excellency!
 - Your Excellency!

259
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,880
- Your Excellency!
 - Your Excellency!

260
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,990
What on earth is he doing?

261
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,420
Call Saheonbu Inspector General now.  Hurry!

262
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,300
Yes, Your Excellency.

263
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,970
We have heard the palace news, Lord Inspector General.

264
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,210
Summon all high-ranking officials of Saheonbu now!

265
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,320
Yes.

266
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,340
It must be Saheonbu.

267
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,220
Saheonbu, which has judicial powers, will move first

268
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,460
and Offices of Censors and of Special Advisors will bring up the rear.

269
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,100
We Norons have monopolized the Three Offices for that exact purpose.

270
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,890
Inwardly, I am prepared.

271
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,100
I have put you in a tough spot, Left State Councilor.

272
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,920
You thought wrong.  That is not the case, Your Majesty.

273
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,590
I am rather feeling as if a heavy burden has been lifted.

274
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,730
The one in a tough spot is you, Your Majesty.

275
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:17,010
Impartial hiring irrespective of factional affiliations...  Magnificent Harmony policy...

276
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:25,180
It is a dream that I, too, dreamt at one point.

277
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:32,200
But I learned that it was impossible in reality.

278
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,770
Impossible?

279
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,280
You too will learn it soon enough, Your Majesty.

280
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,270
That you might be able to go forward briefly, very briefly,

281
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:49,520
but politics regresses to its original place.

282
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,030
So in the not too distant future, Your Majesty, like me,

283
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,560
will also come to know that you dreamt

284
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,270
an unrealizable dream.

285
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,950
Wait.

286
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,350
Wait a moment.

287
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,880
You may advance a very brief moment, but

288
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,980
you'll retreat at the end.

289
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,210
Yet...

290
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,050
what's the reason you helped me?

291
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,280
You think it's no use in the end.

292
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,510
Why?

293
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,880
That is...

294
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,790
The reason is, Your Majesty...

295
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,910
Min Jin Heon.

296
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,170
The man whom we entrusted Yoon Yeong to didn't come to collect his remaining balance?

297
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,200
No, not yet.

298
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
He is crazy about money which is why he immediately took the job. But for some reason...

299
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,780
Is there any way you can contact him?

300
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,940
Well, he's a traveling merchant without a permanent home.

301
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,910
Then you don't even know where he lives?

302
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,570
He will find a ship for us. Then we can go to China—

303
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,610
Actually, you had abandoned me too, right?

304
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,560
Right?

305
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,730
Because I was pathetic and stupid, it was easy to use me?

306
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,810
Don't kid yourself.

307
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,030
Do you think I really didn't know what everyone thought of me?

308
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,550
Everyone laughed and mocked me behind my back.

309
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,300
They treated me like a bug,

310
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,970
yet because I might become king,

311
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,100
they lowered themselves in front of me, no?!

312
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,340
But it didn't matter because it would be fine once I became king.

313
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,840
Once I became king, they couldn't laugh at me behind my back.

314
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,960
Then you, too,

315
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,340
would really embrace me.

316
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,010
I'm sorry.

317
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,420
The one who made you like this is me.

318
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,380
So give me another chance.

319
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,860
So that at least to one person,

320
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,670
I can pay forward the forgiveness I have received.

321
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,190
I'm certain that court officials won't show up to the royal palace tomorrow.

322
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,230
If that happens, then I will issue this statement as is.

323
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,210
I will follow your order.

324
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,070
I am thankful for your decision as well, Right State Councilor.

325
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,060
Starting tomorrow, another decisive battle will start.

326
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,770
How about you go to bed?

327
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,870
- No, I still have more to— 
- I am

328
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,370
fatigued, that's why.

329
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,860
I apologize. I didn't realize that.

330
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,880
You're working an old court official too hard until the end.

331
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,400
Pardon me, would it be possible to meet Court Lady Ha for a moment?

332
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,170
Yeo Ji.

333
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,990
What are you doing here at this hour?

334
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,410
Really?

335
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,520
You made dasik yourself to give to me?
 (Dasik: a Korean confection)

336
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,850
It's just that you seemed to be up until late, so...

337
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,140
I was going to hand it to Court Lady Ha, but...

338
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,160
Let's see. Let me take a look.

339
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,240
No, Your Majesty. I'll just give it to Court Lady Ha—

340
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,530
Why? You said you made it to give to me.

341
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,710
However, I'm embarrassed, so... Your Majesty.

342
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,870
These...

343
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,880
Did you really make these?

344
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,300
Th-They're a bit weird, right?

345
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,690
It's my first time making them, so their shape is—

346
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:48,020
No. You seemed to be a bungler,

347
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,570
but you're quite skilled.

348
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,450
Really, Your Majesty?

349
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,790
Do they look decent enough?

350
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,220
They're not just decent enough.

351
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,230
This...

352
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,070
What is it, Your Majesty?

353
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,090
No, it's not that...

354
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,530
A-Are you choking?

355
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,320
Should I get you some water?

356
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,360
No, it's okay.

357
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,660
I-It's endurable.

358
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,470
E-Endurable?

359
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,340
What to do? The taste must be very weird.

360
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,990
Wh-What should I do?

361
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,130
Yeo Ji, before coming to the palace,

362
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,830
didn't you say that you prepared in all things?

363
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,540
Yes. I did prepare, but...

364
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:59,870
You said that your cooking skills are on par with the palace cooks, didn't you?

365
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,010
That's what I thought, but...

366
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,730
What you thought?

367
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,090
I apologize, Your Majesty. I won't do this kind of thing ever again.

368
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,540
I'm sorry.

369
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,420
Yes.

370
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,170
This is what I liked

371
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,460
when I was with you.

372
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,180
Pardon?

373
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,080
Do you remember

374
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,700
the day when I told you

375
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,400
what it means to become a palace maid?

376
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,440
 I will teach you

377
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,080
 what it means to become a palace maid.

378
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,630
 That means this is possible

379
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,240
 and this too.

380
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,360
 What you did to me that night...

381
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,750
 What I heard is true, right?

382
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:24,080
 You meant "Let me fight you!" Something like that, right?

383
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,630
But you were wrong.

384
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:40,390
I wasn't trying to ask for a fight.

385
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,330
To you...

386
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,030
Like this.

387
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,140
And...

388
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,890
Like this, too.

389
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,170
And always like this.

390
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:06,560
I wanted to keep you by my side.
