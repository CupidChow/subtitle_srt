1
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,030
Return, Your Majesty!

2
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,660
Return, Your Majesty!

3
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,090
Return, Your Majesty!

4
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,950
Your Majesty!

5
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,900
Your Majesty!

6
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,980
Your Majesty!

7
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,280
 I'm dying soon, Prince Yeoning.

8
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,020
Your Majesty!

9
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:25,160

10
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,980

Get out!

11
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,330
Let me go!

12
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,190
There is nothing suspicious about Inspector Han's death.

13
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,690
How can the likes of you act up at a time like this?

14
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,410
The government is facing a huge crisis due to His Majesty's passing.

15
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,620
It must be a crisis only to you

16
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,210
because the crown prince the Norons objected to will become the king.

17
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,630
Don't run your mouth. Do you seriously want to die?

18
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,150
I am going to survive this with my eyes wide open

19
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,420
until I catch that bastard... that bastard who killed my lord inspector.

20
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,310
This bitch... still dares toâ€”

21
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,840
Yeo Ji!

22
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,850
- Are you okay?
 - Hyung-nim.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,330
Saheonbu?

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,250
How can trash like you keep law and order?

25
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,470
You just wait and see.

26
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,170
I am going to enter this place without fail and wipe out all of you!

27
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,050
The ones dying then

28
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,810
will be you!

29
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,620
Do I have to keep listening to their sob story?

30
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,990
Never allow them to set foot in Saheonbu again.

31
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,710
Yes!

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,770
Let this go!

33
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,600
Lead Inspector!

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,550
Hey, you, Lead Inspector!

35
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,020
In the end, you left the court in a mire, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,650
The useless, heirless crown prince succeeds to the throne.

37
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,430
What do you think this country will come to?

38
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,930
 - No, you cannot!
 - Out of my way!  I shall see the Minister of the Interior!

39
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,940
Your Highness!

40
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,590
Leave us since he seems to have come to see me.

41
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,290
Prince Yeonryeong, Hwon, did not die suddenly due to an unknown cause.

42
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,760
He was murdered by Prince Milpoong.

43
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,650
That may be.

44
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,140
Are you saying you covered it up even then?

45
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,290
The one who backed Prince Yeonryeong was you, Minister of the Interior!

46
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,300
I did.

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,600
But would catching Prince Milpoong undo the cracks in this pottery?

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,790
- Minister of the Interior.
 - Your Highness.

49
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,920
Whether Prince Yeonryeong died a mysterious sudden death or was murdered,

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,500
whether there is another reason or not,

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,200
politics is what determines the answers as needed.

52
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,610
As needed, you say?

53
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,810
Who? Who dares to decide that as they want?!

54
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,370
- We do, Your Highness! As we have always done.
 - With what authority?

55
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,250
Because we have preserved this country through the past centuries, shedding much blood.

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,510
Because we have preserved it.

57
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,560
You shall live, Your Highness.

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,450
Even in this state, because you're a royal.

59
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:51,210
But if you dare to go further out, what do you think will happen to your playmates?

60
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,020
Not them, they are all I have left.  Don't touch the remaining ones.

61
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,460
If it weren't for you, Inspector Han could have lived.

62
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,860
Didn't that thought ever occur to you?

63
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,750
Why didn't you at least dream of becoming the king?

64
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,880
If you became the king,

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,150
even if just a little bit of it, you might have gotten something called power.

66
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,590
Why?

67
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,170
Even if you have lowly blood running in your body,

68
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,230
nominally you are a royal too, aren't you, Your Highness?

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,790

70
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,200

71
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,630

72
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,570
Hyung-nim Jeong Seok!

73
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
 Are you really fine with

74
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,490
 not one of your own getting beaten, robbed, and killed?!

75
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,770
 Is that why you let others get hurt instead?

76
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,300
Excuse me, some nobleman asked me to give this to you.

77
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,130
 After all, didn't you do the same, Your Highness?

78
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:21,050
 Rather than retreat and pretend not to know, facing it was easier.

79
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,590
 It's fun to be teased like this.

80
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,030
 I am happy to see you again, Older Brother!

81
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,570
 - Your grace is immeasurable!
 - Your grace is immeasurable!

82
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,130
 But you're the bigger pushover, so what am I supposed to do?

83
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,940
 What?  This punk...

84
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,990
 Why didn't you at least dream of becoming the king?

85
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,110
Why didn't you at least

86
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,200
dream of becoming the king?

87
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,080
 - You are the king.
 - What?

88
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,660
 That's right.

89
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,780
 You are really the king.

90
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,310
 If you became the king,

91
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,070
 - even if just a little bit of it, 
 - Even if just a little bit of it,

92
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,220
 you might have gotten something called power.

93
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,060
you might have gotten something called power.

94
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,750
Something called power...

95
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,720

96
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,080

97
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,490

98
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,540
- Hurry up! Hurry!
 - Hey, how did you...

99
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,740
Is this the time for figuring that out?  Let's run first.

100
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,060
Let's go!

101
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,530

102
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,020
Oh my, what do I do about this?

103
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,120
What happened?  Why is the royal robe small?

104
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,440
Thousand apologies.  His royal figure has changed lately and...

105
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,080
What?

106
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,650
My Queen.

107
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,050
But Your Majesty...

108
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,310
The morning colloquium will be on the Analects of Confucius, led by the chief scholar.

109
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,030
Since you have prepared for it well, do not feel nervous, Your Majesty.

110
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,930
Your Majesty, regretfully,

111
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,860
the morning colloquium needs to be canceled.

112
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,650
Here comes His Majesty.

113
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,740
Your Majesty!

114
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,330
This

115
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,910
d-d-dawn,

116
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,090
a d-do-dozen prisoners

117
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:19,370
b-broke down the prison gate

118
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,020
and e-escaped, I hear.

119
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Insolent things!  You dare to humiliate His Majesty and even titter about it!

120
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,690
In whose presence do you dare?!

121
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,400
That is enough, Queen.

122
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,410
This is where you stop.

123
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,420
Your Highness Queen Dowager.

124
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,980
I have heard about this morning's incident.

125
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,990
However, this is not the time for having any cries be heard from inside the palace walls.

126
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,800
How can you ask me to overlook even these things now?

127
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,640
It means even the court maids look down on His Majesty.

128
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,920
Is this not all because His Majesty has no heir?

129
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,750
They are saying he is a powerless king.

130
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,670
Queen...

131
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,710
A prison break?  When has something like this ever happened in a civilized world?

132
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:30,370
How can you call this the shape a proper country should be in, Your Majesty!

133
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,690
I will take that into consideration.

134
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,380
The southern parts of the country are suffering from a draught day in and day out, and in the northwestern part, the earth jolted.

135
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,520
The subjects are blaming all these on Your Majesty's inadequacy

136
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,820
and saying things that ought not to be uttered.

137
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,790
If those ought not to be uttered, then don't say them!

138
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,450
Did I say those things?  The subjects did!

139
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,450
Don't distort the public opinion.

140
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,210
It must be Norons' opinion.

141
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,350
Why do you have to mention the faction names here?

142
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,240
Enough.

143
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,150
A-as I will

144
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,480
take everything into consideration.

145
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,910
Your Majesty!

146
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,730
Your Majesty, if you do not understand the learned opinions of your ministers, you should ask questions,

147
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,430
and sometimes you need to come up with ideas of your own, too.

148
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,320
How can you just say "I will take it into consideration" every single time?

149
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,790
Of course, I ought to... take that into consideration as well.

150
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,700
Harrumph...

151
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,520
Well, now, harrumph...

152
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,870
Why don't you reappoint the right state councilor, Your Majesty?

153
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,490
At times like these, Jo Tae Goo, who has little experience, is not the proper person for the position of the right state councilor.

154
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,870
The proper thing to do is to replace him.

155
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,020
That must not be allowed.  Do not allow it, Your Majesty!

156
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,410
His Excellency Jo Tae Goo is already on his way to Hanyang  (capital) .

157
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,170
That is not possible.  Please listen to our counsel.

158
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,540
Please listen to our counsel!

159
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,100
Please dismiss the newly appointed right state councilor this minute!

160
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Please listen to our counsel!

161
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,080
Please listen to our counsel!

162
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,200
Your Majesty!

163
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,580
I understand.

164
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,580
I shall go with the Minister of the Interior's counsel.

165
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,050
Really?

166
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,070
"I-I-I will take it into consideration."

167
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,380
Waiting for him to finish, I almost breathed my last.

168
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,760
I thought his stutter was getting better for a while. Why is he doing it again?

169
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,110
Is that because he was f-f-flustered?

170
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,050
Even a young paraplegic does not deserve to have his misfortune be laughed at.

171
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,730
That goes without saying when he's this country's king.

172
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,690
Minister of the Interior, it was just a joke among ourselves.

173
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,770
And you are this country's prime minister, Your Excellency!

174
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,690
Mind your dignity.

175
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,660
It was just one post, the right state councillor.

176
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,130
The six ministries and the three offices were all taken by the Norons.

177
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,390
We only had one post among them, the right state councilor.

178
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,230
But even that will not be allowed us.

179
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,650
If this doesn't show Noron's intent to monopolize all government posts, what does?

180
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,670
You gave it to them too easily, Your Majesty.

181
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,860
Hurry and throw open the gate to welcome the Dashing King.

182
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,890
When the Dashing King comes, there's no need to offer him any grains.

183
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,610
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

184
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,500
What on earth is he thinking?

185
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,920
How can he be so calm?

186
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,560
Seriously...

187
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,210
Aigoo, look at this drunkard.

188
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,240
Just let him be.

189
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,700
Seriously...

190
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,750
Gosh...

191
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,120
Throw it on him, quickly.

192
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,090
What are you waiting for?  I told you to throw it on him.

193
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,240
Still, he is a royal.  How can I?

194
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,470
The sun is already in mid-sky, Prince.

195
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,790
Here... my official uniform is here, right?

196
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,470
Was I entrusted with it?

197
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,230
It must be around here.  Look for it.

198
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,010
Are you done changing?

199
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,700
Insolent punk, you throw water on someone with the title of a royal?

200
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,780
Oh, that was the water I washed my feet in.

201
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,290
Next time, I am going to throw cesspool water.

202
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,620
You might have your funeral at the end of that joke.

203
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,460
Meat is there to chew on, and words are there to spit out.

204
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,590
Right, I will overlook it this time because I'm in a hurry to go act like a human being.

205
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,200
Yes.

206
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,480
You've been behaving well for a while but you got boozed up again.

207
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,440
Old habits die hard.  I just remembered a tune or two that I used to play.

208
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,880
This is the overcoat you left here the last time.  It's been starched nicely.

209
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,280
What a good boy.

210
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,380
Different from a punk who grew up roughly without observing and learning anything.

211
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,650
But I come from a beggar background as well.

212
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:29,330
Then, you must have had an ancestor who was a treasonous nobleman.

213
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,410
Keep it here.

214
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,250
It seems like a few prisoners broke out of the prison last night.

215
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,640
Really?

216
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,000
They are mostly petty criminals, and about half of them seemed to have been recaptured.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,800
But a rather interest-piquing thing seems to be among them.

218
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,590
Interest-piquing...  What do you mean?

219
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:56,960
Well, information becomes cheaper if I circulate it.

220
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,070
Of course, he won't sell even a cold for free.

221
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,570
Are you going to the Royal Clan Management Office?  Should I escort you there?

222
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,870
A horse should be waiting for me outside.

223
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,350
It's been a long while since he got so sloshed, right?

224
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,960
Lately, there's been a widespread rumor about how he even got a post at the Royal Clan Management Office and became a human.

225
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,630
It must be because that day is nearing.

226
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,860
That day... one year ago.

227
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,540
You are early, Your Highness.

228
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,430
They seem like young royals.  What are they doing at the Royal Clan Management Office?

229
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,960
I heard that there is a meeting in the palace in a few weeks.

230
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,330
You know, there is a talk about how the queen will adopt an heir to succeed to the throne.

231
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,070
They are the candidates.

232
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,340
An adopted son...  What's on the Management Office's schedule today?

233
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,750
Clerical work pertaining to the wedding of Prince Eunseon and Princess Jinyoung and...

234
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,030
Seriously, can't they get married on their own?

235
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,200
And because of the envoy from the Qing Dynasty...

236
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,630
I got it.  I'll take care of this.

237
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,750
You, go out and bring me back something.

238
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,540
What something?

239
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,510
Let's rest for a bit before continuing.  I feel like my shoulders will pop out.

240
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,580
We have to get it done now.

241
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,620
Give it here.  I will do it.

242
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,990
But this work needs strength.

243
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,060
Are you... really a girl?

244
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,310
Yes, my name is Yeo Ji.

245
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,220
Is this how you do it?  Is it good if I pound about 100 times more?

246
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,670
What a mighty child...

247
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,910

248
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,450

249
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,440
 The sound of your turning pages is too loud.

250
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
 It makes me feel uncomfortable.

251
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,460
Uh, I will do...

252
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,970
 Your breathing is too loud.

253
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,080
 It makes me feel uncomfortable.

254
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,070
It's always the bad scholars who are the fussiest.

255
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,990
We are all students prepping for the civil exam.  Eating snacks every day, isn't that having it too posh?

256
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,990
I feel uncomfortable because of a sense of comparative deprivation.

257
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,240
Hey, look here!  What do you want me to do?

258
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,670
However, I am not leaving because of you.  So don't concern yourself.

259
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,560
How can a man not withstand this kind of discomfort?

260
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,610
It's just that today is a very important day for me.

261
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,840
Who asked you?

262
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,100
They said he was a klutz but he is a viper!  A viper!

263
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,140
If luck would have it, he might just make it this time.

264
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,110
Aigoo, what do I do?

265
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,910
Big trouble!

266
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,070
What is wrong?

267
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,930
You pounded this rice cake dough, right?

268
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,090
How can you make it into a pulp?

269
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,390
How can you pound rice dough as if it's your parents' mortal enemy?

270
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,300
Wasn't it how it is done?

271
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,390
Why does this jeon  (Korean pancake that can be made with various ingredients)  taste like this?

272
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,780
Who panfried this?

273
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,640
Me!  I was in charge of making the cod jeon.

274
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,920
What is everyone doing?  What is wrong?

275
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,140
A calamity befell us.  The rice cake to be used at the banquet turned into gruel.

276
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,480
And the cod jeon turned into a salty, burnt mess!

277
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,590
I am sorry.  I will remake it quickly.

278
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,140
No, no, not necessary!

279
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,540
Well, the rick cake can be turned into rice sujebi  (rough hand-pulled dough soup) .

280
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,040
And this cod jeon...

281
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,790
is delicious!

282
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,300
This is delicious?

283
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,530
Rice sujebi?  There was such a dish?

284
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,160
You, please come and see me.

285
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,770
Take this.

286
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,800
No, Sir.  When I ruined the dishes, how can I accept money?

287
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,150
No, no, no.  You are a good worker.

288
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,920
Just like the rumor, your skills would put a court lady cook working at the suragan  (royal kitchen)  to shame.

289
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,290
I do?

290
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:41,790
So hurry and go. Didn't you say you have to leave early today?

291
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,620
When there is work to be done, I will send for you again.

292
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,200
This much?

293
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,810
This is too much for a day's wage.

294
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,040
Sister!

295
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,080
Joon Jae.

296
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,820
Why were you waiting outside?  It's cold.

297
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,580
Sister, let's hurry home.

298
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,600
Come along.

299
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,910
Uncle.

300
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,220
Do it quickly.

301
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,280
Before Yeo Ji comes and tries to help us, we have to finish this so people can eat the food.

302
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,270
What are two men doing when there is a whole woman among us?

303
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,060
I am sorry but can you keep it quiet?

304
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,170
I have the civil exam coming up the day after tomorrow.

305
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,020
He's going to fail for the eleventh time in the end.

306
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,480
- So dirty! Why would you throw a shoe?!
 - I will place first, you punk.

307
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,680
The Great Learning's three guidelines. To manifest one's bright virtue, to love the people...

308
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,260
Try it.

309
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,080
Uncle Jang Dal...

310
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,920
Ah Bong!

311
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,190
Lord Moon Soo?

312
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,440
Yeo Ji, hey dude!

313
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,930
So nice to see you, punk!  How long has it been?

314
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,050
- Ah Bong.
 - Hello, Macho Man.

315
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,330
It's been a long time.

316
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,450
Lord Moon Soo.

317
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,390
Has it been hard?

318
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,320
Punk!

319
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,410
Well, that person is here, the chief inspector  (fourth highest rank in Saheonbu)  from Saheonbu.

320
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,190
You are here, Chief Inspector Wi!

321
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,460
We meet often nowadays.

322
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,680
If we meet often, we'll grow more attached to each other and that's all good, right?

323
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,560
Let's go in.  We should have a drink.

324
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,360
I heard that you got promoted to the post of chief inspector.

325
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,860
Please go easy on me.  I cannot drink too much today because I have some business to take care of.

326
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,250
I see.  Come on in.

327
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,960
What?  Yeo Ji is going around houses holding banquets and she cooks?!

328
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,330
That is, I didn't know it myself,

329
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,870
but I must have been born with a gift.

330
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,450
They said my cooking is better than that of a court lady working in suragan  (royal kitchen) .

331
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,690
What is the kid saying?

332
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,070
I don't know.  Do the nobles have peculiar taste buds, too?

333
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,990
As for me, I can't even chew the gruel Yeo Ji makes.

334
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,400
That's what I'm saying.  Still, after every one of us got kicked out of Saheonbu,

335
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,420
the only one functioning like a human being is Yeo Ji.

336
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,600
She earns a lot from here and there.

337
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,480
Lord Moon Soo, this too...

338
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,010
Hey, Cheon Yeo Ji, tell me frankly.

339
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,920
Do you, by any chance... gamble?

340
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,570
- What?
 - Or do you beat up passersby to rob their money?

341
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,070
Dice-throwing or pickpocketing?

342
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,480
No matter how much I think about it, this is strange.

343
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,550
What do you think?

344
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,420
- Just study.
 - Yes, just study.

345
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,560
How can you say that to a nobleman?

346
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,150
Yeo Ji, you shouldn't do that!

347
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,190
No matter how hard life is, you have to be a good girl.

348
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,250
Yeo Ji...

349
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,200
How did I know, you ask.

350
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,150
Isn't it obvious?

351
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,640
Just from the list of the jailbreakers, I could tell who is behind this.

352
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,170
Your Highness!

353
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:39,970
Norons did it to do away with the right state councilor the Sorons recommended.

354
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,180
Prisoners escaping from the prison...

355
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,730
It's all His Majesty's fault that the country is in this mess.

356
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:52,470
With this pretext, the Norons must have put pressure to discharge the Soron right state councilor.

357
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,180
You must be drunk already.

358
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,510
You must have orchestrated this.

359
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,300
And the reason you have such a long face right now must be that something went slightly wrong.

360
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,060
 I will release you.

361
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,260
 In return, you have to do something.

362
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,100
 I will leave the prison gate open, so first, run away with other prisoners.

363
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,350
Among the escapees, there was a petty criminal you had arrested.

364
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,160
But once outside, he must have severed communication with you.

365
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,230
What to do...

366
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,280
If he gets caught by the police bureau, you will be in quite a sticky situation...

367
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,250
Your Highness, I think these remarks are inappropriate.

368
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,800
I will catch that guy for you.

369
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,110
Pardon?

370
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,750
As a gift to celebrate your promotion.

371
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:48,370
Because I feel like I should pay this price to grow closer to you.

372
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:56,620
Pardon me, but there's something I've been wanting to ask you for a long time.

373
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,390
Even though this is in the past, weren't you friendly with the late Inspector Han?

374
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,880
But why...

375
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,840
Was I?

376
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,310
That's when I acted up, not knowing anything about this world.

377
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,910
But when I learned what happens to those falling out of favor with the powerful,

378
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,250
I grew up.

379
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:20,840
I think a Namin who now stands with the Norons knows what I mean.

380
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,950
You never beat around the bush.

381
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,150
Of course, we are not good drinking buddies for no reason.

382
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,550
Here, have a cup.
