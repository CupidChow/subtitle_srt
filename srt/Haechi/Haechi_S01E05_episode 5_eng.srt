1
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,010
Oh dear. What to do?

2
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,890
That wretched informant is right here.

3
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,340
Prince Yeoning.

4
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,310
Even though I had a drink, I must be drunk on dreams as well.

5
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,940
Wretched?  It's not a very flattering term.

6
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,450

7
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,300
Yes, it is me,

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,830
the one who took the civil service exam for someone else at the bidding of Prince Milpoong.

9
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:27,300
The informant of Prince Milpoong's crimes is me,

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,660

11
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,990
Prince Yeoning.

12
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:46,860

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,100
Oh, the paper...

14
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,580
- Here.
 - Thank you.

15
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,440
You seem to be in a hurry. It will be less crowded through Tongindong.

16
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,430
Is that so?

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,490
You are done for!  We can catch everyone now.

18
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,280
His name is Park Moon Soo.  He is a hoobae  (junior)  of a Saheonbu inspector, Han Jeong Seok.

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,390
I heard that Prince Yeoning also showed up at the Saheonbu about half an hour ago.

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,040
Yes, an administrative clerk there is looking into the situation.

21
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,630
Haechi... Are there still people who expect the powerful to act with good will?

22
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,700

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,300
Your Highness Prince Yeoning, do you know what you are saying right now?

24
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,640
Prince Milpoong asking for a substitute exam-taker for the deceased Noh Tae Pyeong?

25
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,890

26
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,560
This is the supreme council meeting of the Saheonbu!

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,220
Perjury at this place will not be tolerated even if by a royalty!

28
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,610
I am a Joseon citizen too.

29
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,020
How can I not know of the rigid authority of the Saheonbu?

30
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,200
However, Inspector General, it is true that I substituted another at the exam

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,630
at the bidding of Prince Milpoong and provided that information.

32
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,000
It is an indisputable, headache-inducing truth.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,980
As everybody wished, the informant has come forward.

34
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,840
Is there anything more you need?

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,710
Just the substitute test-taking cannot prove Prince Milpoong's murder charges.

36
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,490
How will you prove the connection between those two?

37
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,220
That is why I propose that we arrest Prince Milpoong and investigate the matters!

38
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,970
What?!  Arrest?

39
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,520
Are you suggesting that we drag a royal to the Saheonbu?

40
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,060
For what reason wouldn't that be allowed?

41
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,460
A royal is equally a subject of this nation.

42
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,550
That is the raison d'Ãªtre of the Saheonbu.

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,160
Your Excellency Minister of the Interior.

44
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,130
What do you think you are doing right now?

45
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,730
We cannot overlook Prince Milpoong's crimes like this.

46
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,450
With the inspector's authority, we will go arrest him.

47
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,420
Are you declaring insubordination?

48
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,410
You rascals dare to!

49
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,760
Everyone, stop!

50
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,910
The supervisory right rests with me, the lead inspector.

51
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,230
Look here, Byeong Joo.

52
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,560
Yes, if the testimony is true, Prince Milpoong should bear murder charges.

53
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,550
However, how can we believe the testimony of just one informant?

54
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,890
Who can guarantee that this is not a trumped-up scandalmongering?

55
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,140
Wi Byeong Joo.

56
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,290
The Saheonbu that impeaches high-ranking officials at a mere rumor

57
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,900
and gets to the bottom of things at a hint from an unidentifiable informant

58
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,280
says, in this particular matter, that an informant who comes forward is not enough.

59
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,700
Even though that informant is a royal?

60
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,460
It is none other than that fact

61
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,270
that you are a royal!

62
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,310
Saheonbu cannot get mixed up with political maneuvers.

63
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,770
Oh, Saheonbu is just and equitable with everyone?  It ought to be.

64
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,410
Good.  Then, how about this?

65
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,700
If on top of one informant, I give you another?

66
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,620
Hey, hey, hurry.  Pack expensive stuff first.

67
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,520
Oh, Dal Moon, what is Prince Yeoning up to?

68
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,980
He's leaving the capital.

69
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,940
Of course, he must be sh*ting his pants too.

70
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,320
I will be in hiding for a while too.  While I'm gone, you...

71
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,050
 - Who are you, punks? 
 - Use the rear door.  I will take care of them.

72
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,970
Hey, hey, hey!

73
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,180
Not you!

74
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,710
Hey, look me in the eye.  Aren't you going to spill it already?

75
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,950
Hey, where is Gae Dol?  Where is this bastard?

76
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,260
Aigoo, sir, how can you do this at a place of business?

77
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,950
There is a door at the back of the rear garden.

78
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,410
The face of a boiled horse head, a huge mole on the forehead,

79
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,670
Gae Dol of the Gae Dol Gangster Branch, you are under arrest for aiding and abetting a substitute exam taking.

80
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,840
What are you, wench?

81
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,740
Let's not get rough up more and just go quietly.

82
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,160
A damo  (tea maid, female investigator) ?

83
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,980
Hey, what are you guys doing?  Remove her.  I'm in a hurry!

84
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,960
Nice meeting you, Gae Dol.  I've been looking for you for quite a while.

85
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,870
What the heck is this now?

86
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,600
Punk!

87
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,100
Come along!

88
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,740
- Lord Moon Soo!
 - Oh, Yeo Ji, give me some rope too.

89
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,480
Nice.

90
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,150
I'm getting excited.  So this is how it feels out in the field.

91
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,780
How did you know to come here?

92
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,090
This.  You got it from Prince Yeoning, too, right?

93
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,690
What the heck?

94
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,330
Let go of my arm.  My arm!

95
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,990
Go easy on me.

96
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,410
What happened?

97
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,040
Please!  Please!

98
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,130
Just once, even if just once, please.

99
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,880
Damo Cheon Yeo Ji reporting that I have captured criminal Gae Dol,

100
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,410
who aided and abetted Prince Milpoong, and have gotten a confession out of him.

101
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,390
Your Highness, how has this come about?

102
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,430
Somehow, I felt that you would be weak at making sly moves.

103
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,780
I was afraid that the supreme council might take the fun out of it, if known in advance.

104
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,380
I borrowed your underlings.

105
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,210
Your Excellency Inspector General...

106
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,820
Now,

107
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,580
we should wrap this up.

108
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,990
You in your way, and I in my own way.

109
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:10,650
How could this happen?

110
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,600
Lee Geum, this crazy bastard...

111
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,480
I should have torn him to death a long time ago.

112
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,520
Still, I'll be okay, right?

113
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,220
We are all Norons after all.

114
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,260
If the Norons keep pushing their ways, the court or Saheonbu won't pose any problem.

115
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,360
Why me?  Why, of all people, do I have to decide this?

116
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,390
No, catching Prince Milpoong now will come back as a huge burden to the Saheonbu.

117
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,210
However, if we cover up even this, what will the public say?

118
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,220
Public?  We're talking about Prince Milpoong here!

119
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,340
The nation's next century depends on this.

120
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,430
Under the majority rule, the Saheonbu senior officials gathered here can vote nay.

121
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,000
Then I will take away the rights of the inspectors with my authority as inspector general.

122
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,080
Mobilize all your assistant investigators and meet up at Prince Milpoong's house.

123
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,980
Understood.

124
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,250
We will get ready, too, My Lord.

125
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,500
Let's go.

126
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,480
Traitor.

127
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,320
Hey, you punk, hey.  Aigoo, that dude...

128
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,680
Why call a traitor a traitor?

129
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,030
Hey, dude, hey!

130
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,710
Is that why you suggested a jejwa hearing  (Saheonbu's supreme council meeting) ?

131
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,780
To invalidate it officially?

132
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,820
It's not late.  Stop here.

133
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,500
Not in a million years.  The one who should stop is you.

134
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,640
The senior officers will stop you in the end.  You won't be able to do anything.

135
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,790
In the end, the powerful win.

136
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,950
The Norons are the masters of this world.

137
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,450
I'm advising you to side with them and choose to live.

138
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,560
How can I do that, Byeong Joo,

139
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,930
when the worlds we see are so far apart?

140
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,860
Inspector Han!

141
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,890
 Enough with this nonsense!

142
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,390
These are lies unworthy of our ears.

143
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,460
This is a conspiracy targeting Prince Milpoong, do you understand?

144
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,190
We have to uncover the ulterior motive behind it.

145
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,300
What do you mean a conspiracy?  Why would Prince Yeoning do such a thing?

146
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,950
Prince Yeoning is Prince Yeonryeong's half brother.

147
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,660
Do I need to say more?

148
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,260
I am not saying Prince Yeonryeong has an ulterior motive.

149
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,620
Even if there is one, it must be Prince Yeoning's doing alone, out of his brotherly concern.

150
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,490
If it isn't, that would make this a serious situation.

151
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,160
There is no need to squabble more over this.

152
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,260
This is a matter of the  anyway.

153
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,560
We just need to wait for its senior officers' decision.

154
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,190
What happens if I, the king, cannot trust the Saheonbu's judgment?

155
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,320

156
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,870
The monarch not trusting the Saheonbu...

157
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,720
that's a dangerous statement, Your Majesty.

158
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,520
On what basis are you making that statement?

159
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,610
In that case, on what basis are you doubting Prince Yeoning?

160
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,850
Why are you claiming that Prince Yeoning is slandering Prince Milpoong with disadvantageous lies?

161
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:46,070
Because he will not be punished for a mere substitute exam taking.

162
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,790
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?

163
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,540
Will you punish your own son for such a minor transgression?

164
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,050
However, the charges framing Prince Milpoong are different.

165
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,780
Those are serious crimes deserving severe punishment.

166
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,460
What if Prince Yeoning falsely accused Prince Milpoong while sidestepping penalties himself?

167
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,260
Even mere subjects in the streets would see the strangeness of this matter.

168
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,200
Your Majesty, His Highness Prince Yeoning requests your audience.

169
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,540
Prince Yeoning.

170
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,650
Your humble subject Yeoning is greeting you, Your Majesty.

171
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,350
Break down the gate.

172
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,210
Suddenly, I had this concern.

173
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,240
That some might suspect me of an ulterior motive, which does not even exist,

174
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,490
just because of my brotherly relations with Prince Yeonryeong.

175
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,470
However, there is neither an ulterior motive nor a mastermind.

176
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:01,620
I, who have led a dishonorable way of life, in the midst of such behavior,

177
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,910
just came across Prince Milpoong's criminal activities.

178
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:12,980
Is it true that you took the civil service exam in another's place at the bidding of Prince Milpoong?

179
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,780
That is true.

180
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,090
I made the deceased Noh Tae Pyeong pass the exam.

181
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,920
Moreover,

182
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,980
the one who chased Milpoong's henchmen last night and found the dead body was me.

183
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,860
None other than I am the witness for all of Prince Milpoong's crimes.

184
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,730
Your Highness Prince Yeoning, what are you saying?!

185
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,480
That is why I voluntarily request to be exiled, Your Majesty.

186
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,640
What?

187
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,180
I entered the palace to make that request before Your Majesty and all the government officials.

188
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,820
Even if committed unwittingly, my actions aided and abetted Prince Milpoong's crimes.

189
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,960
Please punish me sternly

190
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,660
and send me away to the most remote land, Tamra.

191
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,470
 (Tamra is modern day Jeju Island, where the most severely punished exiled were sent)

192
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,610
Hey, you lunatics!

193
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,990
You dare to cross my doorsill?

194
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,140
To catch me?!

195
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,470
What are you waiting for?  Tie up the criminal.

196
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,570
Wipe them out.  Destroy them all!

197
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,240
What do you mean exile? To Tamra?

198
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,800
Do you realize what you are saying?

199
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,840
Of course, Your Majesty, more clearly than ever.

200
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,560
Until now, the royalty and high-ranking officials of this country went unpunished for any crimes they committed.

201
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,670
Because the laws of this nation were overgenerous to them,

202
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,080
Prince Milpoong ended up even murdering innocent subjects

203
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,760
because he knew that his power would overrule the law.

204
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:03,800
However, this opportunity should be seized to announce that all subjects are equal before the laws of this nation.

205
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:11,170
I, too, will gladly pay for my crimes and repent.

206
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,340
Are you satisfied with that, Your Excellency Minister of the Interior?

207
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:24,930
Not only you officials but also the subjects will say that this is proper.

208
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,240
I-is that rascal out of his mind?

209
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,360
Asking for his own punishment, he's trying to destroy Prince Milpoong as well!

210
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,810
You will lay out the future government yourself?

211
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,540
Prince Yeoning, how dare you.

212
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,890
Saheonbu... What is happening in Saheonbu?

213
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,750
Put down your swords.

214
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,130
If you resist, you will not be able to avoid capital punishment.

215
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,790
This country's next king is me.

216
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,960
The ones who'll die are you bastards!

217
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,770
My Lord, slay him!  Don't mind me!

218
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,340
Yeo Ji.

219
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,350
My Lord.

220
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,170
Strike!  Guard His Highness!

221
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,190
Everyone, stop!

222
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,490
I will relay the order of the Saheonbu's inspector general.

223
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,230
Everyone, drop your swords.  Now!

224
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,090
Head Inspector!

225
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,290

226
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,780
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,540
This cannot be!

228
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,020
Your Highness Prince Milpoong.

229
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,490
Hey, you blasted lazybones.

230
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,700
Why have you come only now?

231
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,310
How can you mess up this badly?!

232
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,770
Drag off all these bastards first, especially that monstrous bitch...

233
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,590
You're that little mouse from that time, right?

234
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,800
We are duly enforcing the law.

235
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,790
You have no right to obstruct it!

236
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,630
- Yeo Ji!
 - Yeo Ji!

237
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,340
Where is this lowly damo acting up!

238
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,970
Please withdraw.

239
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:28,640
You can stop us from carrying out the law only over my dead body.

240
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,790
Who said I would stop you?

241
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,380
I

242
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,360
am here to apprehend Milpoong.

243
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,900
What? Head Inspector, what did you just say?

244
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,190
Arrest Milpoong and his minions right this moment and take them away!

245
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,970
This is none other than the inspector general's order!

246
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,710
Hey!  What are you doing?

247
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,520
Don't you know who I am?  The inspector general is Lee Yi Gyeom.

248
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,280
So why would he arrest me?  How can he arrest me?!

249
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,400
Let go. Let go of me, you bastards!

250
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,020
Let me go!

251
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,020
Unhand me!

252
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,660
Caught!

253
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,110
I am Prince Milpoong!

254
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,230
Finally got that bastard!

255
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,230
Hey, hey!

256
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,480
As if a thing like that is king material.

257
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,770
The next century of this nation, my butt.

258
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,400
Head Inspector, my lord.

259
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,260
All the head and chief inspectors of the Saheonbu

260
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,530
with the exception of the inspector general and deputy inspector general have agreed to the arrest.

261
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,360
From now on, the senior officers will take over this case.

262
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,690
We are still the Saheonbu. We don't ignore a matter of this kind.

263
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,700
I'm sorry. Get it treated.

264
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,390
No, My Lord. The likes of this is nothing.

265
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,950
Hyung-nim! Yeo Ji!

266
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,290
Lord Moon Soo, you're here.

267
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,750
Prince Milpoong is finally caught! We did it!

268
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,930
Yes.

269
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,580
The senior officers of the Saheonbu came forward, at last.

270
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,450
Yes, this is how the Saheonbu should run. Isn't it so?

271
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,280
This is what a true  haechi  is.

272
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,010
Right, Hyung-nim?

273
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,240
Yes. It's the Saheonbu after all.

274
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,250
We work for the place that keeps this nation's laws, right?

275
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,250
My Lord.

276
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,190
Prince Milpoong is being transferred to prison.

277
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,520
I thought you might be curious.

278
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,160
Is it true?

279
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,470
So the Saheonbu came forward, after all.

280
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,160
What was the reason?

281
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,190
I had a way to protect you.

282
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,560
You could have feigned ignorance, to look the other way.

283
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,310
But why?

284
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,770
What use will come out of protecting the likes of me?

285
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,060
A punk who is useless anywhere.

286
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,750
Rather, if I could be a piece that lights the firewood,

287
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,780
then at least I have had a reason to live this life, right?

288
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,770
Was it for Prince Yeonryeong's sake?

289
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,750
So you reported your own misdeed and asked for punishment.

290
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,750
Do you truly not know what Tamra is like?

291
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,390
I have wandered all my life.

292
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,770
That will also be a great travel destination.

293
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,380
Geum.

294
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:14,380
I wanted to serve filial duty to you as you requested, but in the end, I failed to do so.

295
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:20,980
It seems I am someone who cannot fulfill anybody's expectations of me, Your Majesty.

296
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,300
Why can't it be you, Geum?

297
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,670
You are a prince too.

298
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,070
More than anyone else, it should be you.

299
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,850
Why can't you be king?

300
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,940
Geum.

301
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,960
Say it again. What did you say?

302
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,100
Madam, please spare me.

303
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,110
No, what you said just now.

304
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:12,160
I said I saw Prince Milpoong getting dragged away.

305
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,660
That's not it though. Again.

306
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,830
Madam, I don't know why you're doing this.

307
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,890
You smiled.

308
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,690
The corner of your mouth went up as you said that.

309
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,370
Were you slightly happy?

310
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,860
Since Prince Milpoong and I are in that kind of relationship, were you delighted?

311
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,740
"So that wench has it coming too!"

312
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,130
You were so excited, right?

313
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,040
How can you make it so obvious though?

314
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,140
How can we let the old fart of this house  (her husband)  catch on too?

315
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,730
Take her away.

316
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,950
Madam! Madam, spare me! Spare me, Madam!

317
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,330
I'm worried if the higher ups will shake out Prince Milpoong properly.

318
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,600
They will do well. The high officers of Saheonbu take pride in their work.

319
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,780
Hyung-nim, not everyone lives on pride like we do.

320
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,000
Individual advancement. Family glory. Those things come first.

321
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,880
You rascal should pass the test first, I said.

322
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,010
I'm the one who lent decisive force in arresting Gae Dol.

323
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,850
Yeo Ji, you acknowledge it, right? Hurry and tell him.

324
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,750
Nope. Honestly, you were a bit of a hindrance.

325
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,380
What? Hindrance? How ridiculous!  That's not it!

326
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,560
I flew like a butterfly and stung him like a hornet!

327
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,040
You should quit this losing act and go now.

328
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,870
The madam slaughtered a chicken!

329
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,090
- Sister-in-law made whole chicken soup? 
- She probably prepared wine too.

330
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,170
Wow! That's a great nighttime snack!

331
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,990
So are we becoming dogs again  (means getting wasted)  after a long while?

332
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,250
Hey, Ah Bong, let's play the "Seung Gyeong Do" game  (a fantasy promotion board game) . How about it?

333
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,950
"Seung Gyeong Do" game? Yes!

334
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,080
But shouldn't we have one more person here?

335
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,690
- Your Highness. 
- With whose consent?

336
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,650
To Tamra Island? Says who!

337
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,220
Do you see it?

338
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,080
I've become this wretched woman now.

339
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,840
An evil wife who hurls her own husband's clothes!

340
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,220
Did I ask you for spousal love?

341
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,660
Did I ask you for a grand lifestyle?

342
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,900
But because of you, I have to be chased to Tamra Island?

343
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,200
I can't live that way.

344
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,140
I can't fall any lower.

345
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,790
I'm sorry. I have felt this way towards you all along.

346
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,350
Of course, there is no reason to go to Tamra together.

347
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,290
I will give you a certificate of divorce before that.

348
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,370
Certificate of divorce?

349
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,970
You will dissolve our marriage?

350
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,020
Yes. I won't go.

351
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,660
What am I to you that I would go there with you?

352
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,830
Go. Go alone!

353
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,880
I think I should take these, since it's said it's very windy there.

354
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,500
Cho Hong.

355
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,430
I'll pack the things we need, so don't worry.

356
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,680
What did you just say?

357
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,090
Since I will go with him.

358
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,790
If you're throwing these away, I can take them, right?

359
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,040
What?

360
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,390
Who is it?

361
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,300
You're...

362
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,000
The front gate was open, so I just came in.

363
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,850
What is this wench now?

364
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,380
Who is it?

365
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,550
- That's...
 - If it's alright, I came to ask you to drink together.

366
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,460
If you're occupied, perhaps I should come much later, late at night?

367
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,580
What?

368
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,600
Did you just say to drink together? With me?

369
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,900
Yes. With whole chicken soup.

370
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,890
Whole chicken soup.

371
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,630
Take this inside.

372
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,830
Yes, Mother.

373
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,150

374
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,860
Yes!  A gyori  (ninth high counselor of the senior 5th rank)  of Hongmungwan  (Office of Special Advisors) .

375
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,940
You're aware that Hongmungwan can dismiss high officers from their positions too, right?

376
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,720
Ah Bong, I have regarded you as my own son.

377
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,730
And I'm your boss.

378
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,970
Do you want to die?

379
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,470
Not me. You know how I finally made a secret royal inspector after much toil.

380
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,650
I'm Lord Moon Soo.

381
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,070
Secret Royal Inspector Park Moon Soo. Dismissed.

382
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,760
You bastard!  I hold a secret royal inspector position only in a board game and you wreck that?

383
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,550
- But you're the bigger pushover, so what am I supposed to do? 
- Pushover?

384
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,960
Just wait, my lord. I will give you a Saheonbu inspector position if I become a jeonrang  (a low-ranking but powerful official within Ministry of the Interior who could appoint Saheonbu officers) .

385
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,940
What? An inspector of the Saheonbu? You'll really appoint me?

386
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,810
Sa-heon-bu...

387
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,610
- Got it! 
- Hooray, an inspector! I finally got into the Saheonbu.

388
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,950
Nonsense.

389
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,870
Wait, arrest Ah Bong.

390
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,580
- Yes, Sir. 
- I'm a Hongmungwan special advisor.

391
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,910
- I'm sorry. 
- Oh, right.

392
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,750
Wait. Move this.

393
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,160
My turn, you rascal!

394
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,500
Get out, rascal!
