1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,240
Your Majesty, what you have just said is...

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,650
It must be a difficult decision,

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,910
but I thought you might be a person who would accept it.

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,670
Does Older Brother, Prince Yeoning, know about this, too?

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,160
I haven't told him yet.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,070
Because I need you to decide first.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,750
Determining the succession line is your business.

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,060
How come you are asking for my decision?

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,320
Because you are my son, too.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,520
Like the crown prince and Prince Yeoning, you are also

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,430
a precious child to me.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,570
It is just that I think

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,760
Prince Yeoning will become a king who's different from me, a lacking monarch.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,110
That the people's blood running in his veins

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,840
might be the real royal blood.

16
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,170
Will you give me just a few days?

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,000
The Sorons will surely oppose the idea.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,510
Even though small in number, my followers...  Please give me time to persuade them.

19
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,900
If they would lend their support, it will be of help to Older Brother, Prince Yeoning.

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,170
Father.

21
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,040
Hwon.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,160
Yeo Ji, he's here.

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,500
Prince Yeoning is here now.

24
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,210
It's not, right?

25
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,540
Retracting your testimony was not by your will, right?

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,130
Hyung-nim, you were a real manly man.

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,370
There is no way you'd corner Hyung-nim Jeong Seok like this.

28
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,190
Am I not right, Hyung-nim?

29
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,360
It's not too late yet, Your Highness.  Please help my lord.

30
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,230
Lord Inspector Han must still trust you as well.

31
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,180
Please clear his name of the false charges.

32
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,220
He trusts

33
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,820
me still?

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,770
Perhaps it is not too late yet.

35
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,420
Right, there may still be something I can attempt with you two.

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,840
Your Highness.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,500
Hyung-nim!

38
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,510
Shall we begin, Your Highness?

39
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,680
Inspector Han is denying that he tampered the testimonial evidence.

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,320
Please be understanding of the fact that I had no choice but to ask for your presence.

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,860
First, Your Highness, this person...

42
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,310
Has His Excellency, Min Jin Heon of the Noron Faction, put you up to this?

43
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,480
Look here, what are you saying right now?

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,250
Please tell me.

45
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,770
It surely was not your choice.

46
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,500
Please do not mind him.  Cornered, he's spitting out whatever words...

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,510
I remember the day you came looking for me, asking me to catch Prince Milpoong with you.

48
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,860
You said in all your cases,

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,580
the perpetrator of all those crimes was Prince Milpoong, but that you had no evidence.

50
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,550
You started to say all sorts of things, trying to cajole me.

51
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,140
You were trying to take advantage of the strained relations between Prince Milpoong and me.

52
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,020
Your Highness!

53
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,860
Prince Milpoong Tan's "Record of the Dead."

54
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,870
I heard that for the first time from your mouth.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,340
Didn't you say that we must find the "Record of the Dead"

56
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,870
where Tan tallied the number of people he killed?

57
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,620
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,880
I never said...

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,840
If only that could be found, all crimes would be proven.

60
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,750
Do you still believe that, Inspector Han?

61
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,840
Answer me.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,420
I am asking you whether you still believe that the record exists?

63
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,720
Yes, Your Highness.

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,080
I still believe that.

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,180
That the record exists and with that, all crimes can be proven.

66
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,170
This is Hyung-nim Yeoning's villa?

67
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,360
He asked me to bring you to the most secluded villa of his to avoid detection by others.

68
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,760
Then, he must have more houses elsewhere.

69
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,770
Yes, he has about ten more.

70
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, throughout the country?

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,220
No, just in Hanyang  (capital) .

72
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,120
What?!

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,440
Just in Hanyang,

74
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,840
ten houses?

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,160
Just a second. Then how many all over the country?

76
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,740
His Highness probably does not have a clear idea himself.

77
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,060
He has very little interest in riches.

78
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,610
Is it your first time seeing a house?

79
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,100
We've got no time to lose.  Let's hurry inside.

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,620
Seriously, I almost peed in my pants.

81
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,480
Let's go, let's go.

82
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,910
At this rate, I'm going to start feeling distant from my hyung-nim.

83
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,570
These are very close to the information we've gathered on Tan's activities.

84
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,340
There's even information that is a lot more sensitive.

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,800
Can you eat this, too?

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,110
It's yongsudang  (Chinese cotton candy) , a kind of dessert from the Qing.

87
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,680
Oh...

88
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,740
This came from overseas.

89
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,660
Then, do you think this information related to the "Record of the Dead" is true, too?

90
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,080
That it may be here at Yongheon Temple.

91
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,930
This temple is near Tan's house.

92
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,030
It's laughable, but supposedly he's a devout Buddhist who frequently visits this temple.

93
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,870
A buddhist committing murders?

94
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,920
Prince Milpoong has huge ambition but he's such a big scaredy-cat, too.

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,910
He wants to commit crimes, but he wants to be pardoned as well.

96
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,470
What a nutjob.  I should've known from the way he collected flowers after killing people

97
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,410
that kind of psycho must be arrested and put behind bars.

98
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,580
He always goes around with his "Record of the Dead" in his bosom.

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,000
But when he leaves Hanyang,

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,570
he supposedly leaves the ledger here at Yongheon Temple.

101
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,420
 And the bastard is leaving Joseon tomorrow together with the Qing envoy.

102
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,020

103
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,280
Take special care that none of this is leaked.

104
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,220
Thank you for making me trust you again.

105
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,940
I don't know why, but strangely, I really did not want to hate you, Hyung-nim.

106
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,250
Hyung-nim?

107
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,120
So this is such a relief.

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,130
Because I can keep calling you Hyung-nim. I'm leaving.

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,060
When did you become so close to His Highness that you have "until death do us apart" relations with him?

110
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,550
He betrayed our lord first.  Would it be really okay to trust him?

111
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,720
Of course, you punk.

112
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,570
He's worthy of our trust.

113
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,320
Tan is a dangerous villain.

114
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,040
Tell Prince Yeonryeong to beware until he leaves town.

115
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,050
Be safe on your way.

116
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,990
How about going home now and taking some rest?  It'll get dark soon.

117
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,400
If you are scared of the nightfallen roads, well... I can come with you.

118
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,650
No...  How can mere nightfallen roads be scary?

119
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,450
But of course, you wouldn't be.

120
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,510
What were you doing?

121
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,730
I examined the terrain and landmarks around the temple.

122
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,950
Prince Milpoong might leave his men there.

123
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,300
If a close range fight breaks out, I have to be prepared.

124
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,810
You?  What can you do alone?

125
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,120
Not only among the damos  (tea maids, female investigators)  of the Saheonbu, but also among all the assistant investigators,

126
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,950
the most outstanding martial artist and case investigator is me.

127
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,740
What?

128
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,370
A master of all forms of disguises and infiltration skills, that's a given, and fluent in Mandarin and Japanese.

129
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,710
Some refer to me, who's all that, as a macho man, a human weapon,

130
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,230
or a walking cho  (a military unit made up of approximately 100 soldiers) .

131
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,650
Oh... Are you bragging?

132
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,260
No, it's the truth.

133
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,960
Definitely, you are not normal.

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,380
Do you have any self-awareness as a woman?

135
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,640
Oh, right!  I've heard that

136
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,120
you and Lord Moon Soo have become pledged brothers.

137
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,680
Oh, that...

138
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,900
I heard that I'm the youngest. What should I do?

139
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,790
Call you Hyung-nim?
  ("Hyung-nim" is a term males use)

140
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,890
What?  Hyung-nim?

141
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,070
You wouldn't like Orabeoni   (archaic term for oppa) .

142
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,600
I don't know why, but when I use that term, everyone acts awkward.

143
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,590
You don't know

144
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,400
why they feel uneasy when you call them orabeoni?

145
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,480
No.

146
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,250
Orabeoni is the right term for a younger woman to call older males,

147
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,310
but strangely, when I use that term, they freak out.

148
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,310
You don't know the reason? You really don't know it?

149
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,740
Really, you are not normal.

150
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,980
Hyung-nim is fretting over me again.

151
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,320
The envoy is leaving between 1 - 3 PM, so he asked you to be cautious until then.

152
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
I understand.

153
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,490
Actually, I have something to say to Hyung-nim, too.

154
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,600
If you give me a letter, I will take it to him.

155
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,410
No, it must be said face to face.

156
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,480
Are you going outside to play?

157
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,750
You're having the time of your life.

158
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,820
On my way to the Qing, I've come to say good-bye.

159
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,540
Affectionately between royals.

160
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,700
I felt that a good-bye is a must when I owe all this to you, Hyung-nim.

161
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,040
When we meet again, I hope you are more human.

162
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,530
Even though I'm not sure whether you can return.

163
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,420
You think you've won, right?

164
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,910
Not at all.  Because I never competed with you to win or lose in the first place.

165
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,220
That is why I say you're stupid.

166
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,840
How is this a competition?  It's a dog fight.

167
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,240
Because a competition has rules.

168
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,690
But there is nothing like that in a dog fight.

169
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,140
What is the bullsh*t you're getting at?

170
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,710
My rule is that any fight I'm involved in ends only when I win.

171
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,740
So I'm telling you to wait for me, bastard.

172
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,890
Prince Milpoong Tan is finally getting lost.

173
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,070
Still, we must not let down our guard until the end.

174
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,430
That goes without saying.

175
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,520
Thank you, My Lord.

176
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,750
This is nothing.  I'm sorry I cannot help openly.

177
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,840
My Lord!

178
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,930
Yeo Ji!

179
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,600
So I guessed right.

180
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,420
That meant His Highness knew the whereabouts of the "Record of the Dead."

181
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,210
When the sun sets, we will attack Yongheon Temple between 7 - 9 PM.

182
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,080
Everything will work out.

183
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,510
Isn't there any message you want me to take to My Lady and Joon Jae?

184
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,040
We will meet soon.

185
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,340
When I get out of this place, I want to hold Joon Jae first.

186
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,710
That child's cry remained stuck in my heart.

187
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,600
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

188
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,020
An even number again.

189
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,970
What are you doing?

190
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,670
It's a superstition from where I used to live.  You have to finish crossing a bridge

191
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,960
at an odd number for your husband to live a long life.

192
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,710
Let's try crossing just one more time.

193
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,300
That person...

194
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,080
Are you sure he was the one you met?

195
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,750
There are many storytellers in the capital.

196
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,890
I used to be a liquor peddler.  I never forget a face.

197
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,560
It was definitely the storyteller I gave the story to.

198
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,740
Where was the place?

199
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,000
You know the band of beggars living under Gwangtong Bridge?  He was there with them.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,810
A band of beggars?

201
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,490
He was there with a burly guy.  They looked pretty serious.

202
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,550
Wait.  If a band of beggars...

203
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:11,080
A band of beggars!  Come to think of it, there was no beggar at the gisaeng house that day.

204
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,150
How come, when free alcohol was given?

205
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,680
- What did you find out? 
- I think Ahjussi was right.

206
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,710
There are people who've seen him in Angookbang.

207
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,580
I told you so!

208
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,920
But how did he come back?  Why?

209
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,090
Angookbang, you say...

210
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,260
Surely over there...

211
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,200
That's right.  It surely was strange.

212
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,570
Why didn't the beggars show up there?

213
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,740
This happened a few days ago.

214
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,720
I hired an entire gisaeng house and invited over all the ragtag of the capital.

215
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,690
But not one beggar showed his face there.  Isn't that strange?

216
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,960
Why weren't there any beggars where free food and free alcohol overflew?

217
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,090
Oh, was that at the bidding of the head of the band?

218
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,160
Your Highness... Prince Yeoning.

219
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,770
We've met before, right?

220
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,620
Your name was probably... Dal Moon.

221
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,830
So it was you, the dealer of gossip and scandals in the capital.

222
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,040
Wow, amazing.

223
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,850
A band of beggars taking over even Gae Dol's gisaeng house.

224
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,580
You must have secured a rather dependable and corrupt backer.

225
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,790
What does it matter, the manner of the sponsor...

226
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,430
as long as I can support my family?

227
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,010
Is Min Jin Heon the one behind you?

228
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,700
You will not gain the answer you seek.

229
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,200
An innocent person might get hurt.

230
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,190
Unless that is one of my own, I do not care.

231
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,720
Then, how much would be sufficient for you

232
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,120
to reveal your dealings with the Minister of the Interior?

233
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:03,440
Yes, if I can catch him, I will give you even my all.

234
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,310
No.

235
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,610
It's power, Your Highness,

236
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,690
that can protect the likes of us.

237
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:19,040
Money?  Law?  Government?  No.

238
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,870
What can protect the powerless is, ironically, power.

239
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:29,480
I mean, the power that a person like you, Your Highness, can never give us.

240
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,220
I am saying my family can stay safe only under the aegis of that power.

241
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,240
Is that why you let others get hurt instead?

242
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,670
Are you really fine with

243
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,090
not one of your own getting beaten, robbed, and killed?!

244
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,260
I guess you cannot answer that.

245
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,270
Merely trying to appeal to your conscience...

246
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,500
What waste of time.

247
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,180
You don't have time for this, Your Highness.

248
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,760
Hurry and go to Angookbang.

249
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,030
This one thing, I will tell you.

250
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,060
At least this one thing that I know.

251
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,410
Step out briefly.  Today's my turn to stand guard and nobody else is here.

252
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,260
At least get some fresh air.  You must've been feeling cramped.

253
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,820
Friend.

254
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,140
Go to Angookbang? What do you mean by that?

255
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,540
Prince Milpoong is in Hanyang right now.

256
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,340
He might be aiming at Prince Yeonryeong.

257
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,860
That is impossible.  Prince Milpoong left for the Qing today.

258
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,440
No, he came back.

259
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,110
To none other than Angookbang, where Prince Yeonryeong's abode is located.

260
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,460
I will visit Older Brother Yeoning's house.

261
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,960
I will bring a lantern, My Lord.

262
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,380
It's alright.  It's late.  Go inside and rest.

263
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,250
Dear Bodhisattva of Compassion.

264
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,610
When practicing the Prajnaparamita deeply, one perceives that all five skandhas are empty.

265
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,780
O Shariputra, form is emptiness. Emptiness is form.

266
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,440
 No, please don't!

267
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,890
 Hwon.

268
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,690
 Hwon!

269
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,070
So odd.

270
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,910
Why is Hyung-nim Yeoning not here yet?

271
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,750
See?  What did I tell you?

272
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,340
If he's betrayed once, what's stopping him from a second time?

273
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,680
Hey, punk, won't you keep your mouth shut?

274
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,310
Yeo Ji, what do we do?

275
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:52,390
Just half an hour more.  After that, we must go in.

276
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,670
So the Minister of the Interior sent me a letter?

277
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,880
I put it in your room.

278
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,840
- He just told me to deliver it to you without fail.
 - I see.  You can go.

279
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,910
Inspector Han!

280
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,520
After all, this is how you turn out?

281
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,770
How... did you...

282
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,590
Prince Milpoong!

283
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,720
Looking back, I realized I hadn't bid you farewell.

284
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,760
How did you... get here?!

285
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,710
A dog, watching over the powerful's yard,

286
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,040
that barks and bites at their command?!

287
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,660
That's why I've come back.

288
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,460
So that I might feel better.

289
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,260
The one who allied with the Minister of the Interior and framed me for taking bribes was you.

290
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,420
No, no, Jeong Seok.  Listen to me.

291
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,430
You're done for.  Your master Min Jin Heon is finished, too!

292
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,170
Isn't there anyone outside?  Inspector Jang!  Inspector Jang!

293
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,400
Inspector Jang!

294
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,460
Remember, you're dying because of your older brother.

295
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:02,820
The same is true of feelings, perceptions, impulses, consciousness.

296
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:10,960
Therefore, in emptiness no form, no feelings, perceptions, impulses, consciousness.

297
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,910
No suffering, no origination, no stopping, no path, no cognition, also no attainment with nothing to attain.

298
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,310
Yeo Ji, how about there?

299
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,720
It's not here either.

300
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,930
 (Reciting the Heart Sutra)

301
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,330
Jeong Seok.

302
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,530
Oh no, Jeong Seok.

303
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,800
 (Reciting the Heart Sutra)

304
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,550
Hwon!

305
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,570
Who are you?

306
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,070
Did you find it?

307
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,480
Tan's "Record of the Dead" is not here.

308
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,030
Yeo Ji, it's not here?

309
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,610
Hwon. Hwon.

310
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,960
No.

311
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,210
No, Hwon.

312
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:42,300
Older Brother, do you... even remember?

313
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,440
No.

314
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,770
Is anyone here?!

315
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,130
Hwon!

316
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:00,140
Older Brother, it's you.

317
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,110
This nation's... this nation's...

318
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,900
Hwon.

319
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,050
Hwon!

320
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,710
Hwon!

321
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,540
No.

322
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,890
No!

323
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,850
No!

324
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,110
What do you mean?

325
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,070
Prince Yeonryeong died?

326
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,340
Your Majesty.

327
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,630
Tell me!

328
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,970
Someone answer me! Why?

329
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,650
Why did Prince Yeonryeong—

330
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,920
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

331
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,570
- Please be calm.
 - Your Majesty!

332
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,490
Your Majesty!

333
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,130
What in the world happened?

334
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,130
Minister of the Interior.

335
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,050
Why did Prince Yeonryeong... How?

336
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,080
We don't know. According to the doctor, he suddenly died without a reason.

337
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,060
How did... how can this happen?

338
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,500
You released Han Jeong Seok who was tied up?

339
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,490
I didn't know he would flee. I really didn't.

340
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,210
What happened? What do you mean Inspector Han died?

341
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,510
I apologize.

342
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,370
While trying to get over the wall to flee, he must have faced his death.

343
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,110
What about the body?

344
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,870
We handed it over to his family.

345
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,830
Father!

346
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,910
- Father!
 - Honey!

347
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,940
My Lord.

348
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,130
Father...

349
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,830
Hyung-nim Jeong Seok.

350
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,230
Escape? No way.

351
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,000
Our Lord wouldn't have done that.

352
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,800
He was waiting for the "Record of the Dead," right?

353
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,670
He was killed by someone.

354
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,490
Someone... killed him.

355
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,310
Wake up...

356
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,100
Oh, Joon Jae.

357
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,900
My Lord.

358
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,490
This can't be.

359
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,570
You said we would meet soon.

360
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,310
You said you will hold Joon Jae, too.

361
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,510
My Lord. My Lord!

362
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,420
Father!

363
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,280
Wake up.

364
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,150
Wake up!

365
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,590
Oh, Joon Jae.

366
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,570
My Lord.

367
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,090
My Lord.

368
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,180
 You secretly escaped from the procession of the ambassadors?

369
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,920
 I will kill Prince Yeonryeong.

370
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,140
 I will kill him who coveted my place and leave a lifetime scar on Lee Geum's heart.

371
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,300
 So I even brought back my ledger that I hid away.

372
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,060
 You have to write down Prince Yeonryeong's name in here, too.

373
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,940
What would have happened if that nutjob didn't come back?

374
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,640
Please have an easy passage into eternity.

375
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,940
Don't become a ghost.

376
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,890
Either way, fate is on my side.

377
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,760

378
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,030

379
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,520
Your Highness.

380
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,090
How is the king? How severe is his illness?

381
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:38,190
Right now... he cannot even speak.

382
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,010
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

383
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,500
Your Majesty!

384
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Crown Prince.

385
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,690
Your Majesty!

386
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,360
Return, Your Majesty!

387
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,990
Return, Your Majesty!

388
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,710
Return, Your Majesty!

389
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,970
Your Majesty.

390
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,110
Your Majesty.

391
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,960
Your Majesty.

392
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,000
Your Majesty.

393
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,930
Like this, will the crown prince rise to the throne?

394
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,120
Your Majesty.

395
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,980
Your Majesty.

396
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,490
Your Majesty.

397
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:15,850
 I'm dying soon, Prince Yeoning.

398
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,070
 Before that happens,

399
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:24,780
 won't you reveal to the world the side of you that I know?

400
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,240
Your Majesty.

401
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,760

402
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:06,110

403
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,010
 There is nothing suspicious about Inspector Han's death.

404
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,510
 How can trash like you keep law and order?

405
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,270
 Who dares to decide that as they want?!

406
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,520
 We do, Your Highness!

407
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,360
 Why didn't you at least dream of becoming the king?

408
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,970
 For me, the power to become king...

409
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,260
 The state of affairs will become very loud soon.

410
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,250
 Isn't it about time you stepped forward?

411
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,650
 When our hyung-nim died because of Prince Yeoning...

412
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,510
 But at least tell this to His Excellency Min Jin Heon.

413
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,670
 - It can't be.
 - So before he is put in a hard spot, tell him to come to find me.
