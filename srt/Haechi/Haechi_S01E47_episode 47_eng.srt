1
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,430
The reason I have personally come to Saheonbu's jejwa hearing room today

2
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,680
is because I want to tell you that the new Joseon

3
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,870
needs to start here at Saheonbu.

4
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,480
This nation's Three Offices, and particularly Saheonbu,

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,950
have long been rotten to the core with evil customs and traditions.

6
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,360
Who of this nation would trust Saheonbu,

7
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,710
and who would believe in the fairness of Saheonbu?

8
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,760
Your Majesty, I am sorry but—

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,140
Stop!  I have not finished speaking.

10
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,080
However, I will not overlook Saheonbu's long history of corruption any longer.

11
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,090
This is for the sake of this country and all officials of Saheonbu.

12
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,110
As of today, from this place,

13
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,030
I proclaim to the whole world that I will abolish

14
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,080
the Ministry of the Interior's section chief system,

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,100
- Abolish...
- which has long held the appointment rights over Saheonbu,

16
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,250
and I will completely reform that system.

17
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,460
Section Chief of the Ministry of the Interior... who is in charge of Saheonbu's personnel?

18
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,560
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,610
Abolish the Ministry of the Interior's section chief system?

20
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,110
That is what I said.

21
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,590
From this moment on, I will abolish

22
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,640
the Section Chief of the Ministry of the Interior's right to select key government officials and to recommend his own successor,

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,770
and I will completely reform the personnel policies of the Three Offices including Saheonbu.

24
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,310
Prime Minister, announce my decree.

25
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,320

26
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:46,250
Until now, the Section Chief of Ministry of the Interior had the right to select personnel

27
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,440
of the Three Offices of Saheonbu  (Office of Inspector General) , Saganwon  (Office of Censors) , and Hongmoongwan  (Office of Special Advisors) .

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,130
This cannot be, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,060
This is an outrage!

30
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,250
- At the same time...
 - Even if you are the king, you can't do this!

31
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,920
This is suppression of free press! This is oppression against Saheonbu! Oppression!

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,790
Please retract your decree!

33
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,330
Stop it! You are in His Majesty's presence!

34
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,960
His Majesty's royal command and its decree are being announced. Everyone stop!

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,290
- ...the corruption and evil...
 - Your Majesty! Please retract your decree immediately!

36
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,700
- Your Majesty! 
- Please stop, Your Majesty!

37
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,300
- Please stop, Your Majesty!
 - Quiet!

38
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,610
- Please retract your decree!
 - Stop this!

39
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,240
- Stop! You're in front of His Majesty!
 - Please, Your Majesty!

40
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,180
You are in front of His Majesty!

41
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,630
...shall abolish the Section Chief of the Ministry of Interior's rights of appointment

42
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,200
and his right to recommend the succeeding section chief will also be reformed...

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,560

44
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,650

45
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,670
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,670
Saheonbu now will face the biggest turmoil it ever faced.

47
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,090
But it's the time we've been waiting for more than any other time.

48
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,680
Your Majesty, your grace is immeasurable.

49
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,150
Yes, please let us take care of Saheonbu now.

50
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,150
I leave it in your good hands.

51
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,370
Your Majesty. I think you should go to the palace quickly.

52
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,860
Prince Milpoong came into the palace and is causing a ruckus now.

53
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,910
What?

54
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,340
Lock this person up right now! Hurry!

55
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,130
Yes.

56
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,060
How dare you hold me?

57
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,000
Open up the way to the king's palace.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,670
I will go to the king's palace, to the royal throne.

59
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,440
I am going to sit on the throne!

60
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,220
No...

61
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,230
I am the king.

62
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,960
I am the king, I said.

63
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
Prince Milpoong.

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,500
Your Majesty.

65
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:15,400

66
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,650

67
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,830
Lee Geum.

68
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:38,150

69
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,750
 We are all living lives hanging off the edge of a cliff.

70
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,900
 A slight push and we will plummet instantly.

71
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,290
 Do you know what one realizes when that instance comes?

72
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:08,470
 To lose power is akin to imminent death.

73
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,130
 It's Prince Milpoong! Prince Milpoong walked into the palace on his own!

74
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,530
Protect the royal throne! Guards, surround the royal palace!

75
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,870
- Yes!
 - Station yourself there!

76
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,430
- Queen Dowager. 
- What's happening?

77
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,530
I hear Prince Milpoong came into the palace with a weapon.

78
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:41,470
- What?
 - Something might happen so stay in your palace.

79
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,300
Lee Geum.

80
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:03,380
Prince Milpoong. How dare you...

81
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,770
- The rebels might be scheming something, so quickly move—
 - Wait!

82
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,090
You need to hear me out.

83
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,280
I came to see you.

84
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,810
You should at least hear me out.

85
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,400
How dare you! Close that mouth of yours.

86
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,420
Truthfully,

87
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,510
I still don't really know

88
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,490
why it's you and not me.

89
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,240
Min Jin Heon, Sorons, and Namins...

90
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,250
Why do they all end up on your side?

91
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,730
The things I can't have,

92
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,660
why can you have them all?!

93
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,480
- What are you doing? Quickly, get this bast—
 - Why!

94
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,410
Why did you come to the palace on your own?

95
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,370
Answer me, Prince Milpoong!

96
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,830
You could have run away, so why?

97
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,140
I came to die as the king.

98
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,140
I'll get caught as a fugitive anyway.

99
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,720
An end befitting a king...

100
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,310
Proudly...

101
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,030
to die.

102
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,780
Because that's the king.

103
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,820
Because that's what the king does!

104
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,730
You are afraid, aren't you?

105
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,670
Very much.

106
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:55,550
Yet, you came to die proudly as the king?

107
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,010
Okay. The scarier choice...

108
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,620
The harder choice...

109
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,350
If you could've made that in the first place,

110
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,850
perhaps the throne would've been yours.

111
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,590
What?

112
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:25,680
But you are too late and have been wrong.

113
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,760
You've done unforgivable evil deeds for far too long.

114
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:42,830
This time, I will definitely keep my promise to make you pay for your sins.

115
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,070
Without delay,

116
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,920
you'll pay the price with death.

117
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,230
-  Commandant of the Royal Guards!
 - Yes.

118
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,700
Take him away!

119
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

120
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,450
No. I won't die.

121
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,480
I won't die by your hands.

122
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,950
Lee Geum!

123
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,720
Your Majesty!

124
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,870
Your Majesty!

125
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,940
Tan.

126
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,500
Prince Milpoong.

127
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,350
Okay.

128
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,730
You won. You did.

129
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,910
I...

130
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,790
I...

131
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,910
lost.

132
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,350
 I will wait for you from there,

133
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,060
 so don't be too afraid to come.

134
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:50,660
 I will be waiting... as your queen in the other world.

135
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:57,560
 You must come... as king.

136
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,270
 As king...

137
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
As the king...

138
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,120
My end...

139
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,920
As the king...

140
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,960
Ultimately...

141
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,060
you become like this

142
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,120
in the end.

143
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,250
Tan...

144
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,670
Are you saying Prince Milpoong committed suicide?

145
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,360
That is what I heard.  His body was collected.

146
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,170

147
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,830
How could this be?

148
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,430
To put him up as Noron's puppet king, I brought him.

149
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,160
I needed a king whom I could control.

150
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,030
It was my misjudgment, Ha Gok  (Jo Tae Goo's pen name) .

151
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,550
I thought I lived my whole life for the court.

152
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,320
Why is the last thing left regret?

153
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:49,300
They say the regret never comes first. This feels so empty.

154
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:56,910
Well, perhaps a life without any regrets... isn't that even more terrifying and frightening?

155
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,960
Life is so fleeting and vacuous.

156
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,220
Even a person fawned on to become the next king exits like this.

157
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,100
He annoys me until the end.

158
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,380
Who the heck is he to take his own life

159
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,990
when he should be quartered to death?

160
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,780
He is no longer of this world.  What use is talking behind his back?

161
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,000
Soon, Lee In Jwa and Wi Byeong Joo will pass on as well at the execution ground, right?

162
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,060
Your Majesty, there are traitors still waiting to get their just desserts.

163
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,280
You must hand down their sentences.

164
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,570
April 1728. I, the king, hand down the sentences

165
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,070
against the traitors who, through a horrifying revolt,

166
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,830
murdered the people and caused chaos in the court.

167
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:15,020
The rebel head Lee In Jwa staged a rebellion and soaked this land with blood,

168
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,230
taking away countless lives of the people.

169
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,540
As such, his heinous crimes will be dealt with by capital punishment.

170
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,590
Moreover, Wi Byeong Joo, who murdered Inspector Han Jeong Seok

171
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,120
and joined the rebellion after escaping from his place of exile,

172
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,490
shall also be beheaded to pay for his egregious crimes.

173
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,120
Carry out the sentences against the criminals immediately.

174
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,110
Now, now, now, everyone, make haste.

175
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,580
Listening to my story is not important today.

176
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,830
Today is the day when the traitors' necks will be chopped off!

177
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,280
Let's see how well our executioner performs his death dance with our own two eyes.

178
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,760
Now, let's go!

179
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,360
- That's right!
 - Heaven punish those bastards!

180
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,360
Lee In Jwa, this is all your fault.

181
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,490
- Because of your arrogance—
 - Shut up.

182
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,330
As much as the grand aspiration you had in your heart, face your death with dignity.

183
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,170
Dignity?

184
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,650
What use is that when I am dying?  The world I wanted...

185
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,670
When Hyung-nim Jeong Seok held out his hand to you...

186
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,260
At that time, if you had chosen the human path rather than that of a beast,

187
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,620
you might have been standing here on the other side today.

188
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,670
Doesn't that occur to you?  I mean, in this world where Namins like you

189
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:13,530
get hired and get opportunities commensurate to their ability.

190
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:19,130
Yes, you are right.  But keep this in mind.

191
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,070
Do you think you would be different?

192
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,600
Someday, you will also be made to kneel down

193
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,310
on an execution ground just like me here.

194
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,690
Of course, that is a possibility, too.

195
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,880
But at least I will not tremble in fear like you,

196
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,080
because I won't have any regrets.

197
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,780
Start the criminals' execution.

198
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,600
 You won't be able to do anything.

199
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,100
 In the end, the powerful win.

200
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,270
 The Norons are the masters of this world.

201
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,760
 I'm advising you to side with them and choose to live.

202
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,270
 How can I do that, Byeong Joo,

203
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,870
 when the worlds we see are so far apart?

204
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,300
 At that time, if you had chosen the human path rather than that of a beast,

205
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,060
 you might have been standing here on the other side today.

206
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,300
 Doesn't that occur to you?

207
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,040
Farewell, Bok Dan.

208
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,440
In your next life,

209
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,840
wanting nothing, regretting nothing,

210
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,770
be reborn as the silk-clad

211
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,430
Chae Yoon Yeong that you yearned for.

212
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,470
You've had a hard time.

213
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,090
You must have undergone a distressful time.

214
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,220
I thought you might need some solace.

215
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,490
Fear.

216
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,510
I, too, feel afraid.

217
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,670
As long as I sit on this seat,

218
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,510
times like this will come again,

219
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:12,420
when I must punish some and

220
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,150
put others to death.

221
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,480
Whether I will be right at every such occasion,

222
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,660
whether I can manage not to be wrong,

223
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,150
whether I will once again

224
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,060
qualify as a king, I mean.

225
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:38,020
Excuse me for my insolence, but if I may say this to you,

226
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,750
just the fact that you are asking that question

227
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,450
qualifies you to be the king.

228
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,430
At times, you might make wrong decisions.

229
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:58,760
However, you will not cease to ask yourself the same question,

230
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,480
and for that reason, you will always be able to find the right path again.

231
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,670
That is why people trust you and follow you.

232
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,770
And that is why I love you, Your Majesty.

233
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,880
Yeo Ji.

234
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,430
♫  You whom I love  ♫

235
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:34,220
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

236
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,830
♫  You whom I love  ♫

237
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:46,900
♫  Shine on me again  ♫

238
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:54,080
♫  So that I cannot forget you, so I cannot erase you  ♫

239
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,360
♫  So I would have to remember you even in my dreams  ♫

240
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:08,670
♫  I break down inside of you  ♫

241
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:16,810
♫  I cannot erase  ♫

242
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,250
He is declaring war on us.

243
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,800
His Majesty turned the Saheonbu into an angry swarm of bees.

244
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,150
What does he mean by abolishing the Ministry of Interior's section chief system?

245
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,500
When he named Lee Gwang Jwa as the prime minister,

246
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,130
shouldn't you have expected that His Majesty would make this move?

247
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,360
- Pardon?
 - Now, His Majesty has successfully put down even the rebellion.

248
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,570
Currently, even the popular sentiment favors His Majesty.

249
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,330
On your side, what cause is there for you to fight?

250
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,870
That is why we are saying you must come forward.

251
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:52,140
Why would I?  Didn't you guys tell me I don't deserve to be the Noron head?

252
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,750
There is no place for my servants to put the books down.

253
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,520
Will you make way?  Or you guys can help them.

254
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,340
Are the agendas for the regular audience session being finalized?

255
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,500
Yes, they are almost done.

256
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,580
Are you all ready?  Soon, the regular audience will be held.

257
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,330
It will be ready right away.

258
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,220
And His Majesty?

259
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,110
He stayed up all night in his office and went to sleep about an hour ago.

260
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,510
Again?

261
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,940
Then maybe we should put off the regular audience for a little bit...

262
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,370
What do you mean, put it off?

263
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,300
I can't have my reputation ruined for something like this.

264
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,180
Your Majesty.

265
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,840
Now, everyone, let us be on our way if you are finished preparing for the regular audience.

266
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,220
However, Your Majesty, how many days has it been already?

267
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,880
If you ruin your royal health this way...

268
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,930
What nonsense.

269
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,890
When a wolf hunts down its enemy,

270
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,070
he ought not to afford the prey a chance to catch its breath.

271
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,600
 Here comes His Majesty.

272
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,810
Your Majesty.

273
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,520
Now, then, we shall hold this morning's regular audience.

274
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,840
Today, again, the issue under consideration is the abolishment of the Ministry of Interior's section chief system

275
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,410
in connection with the reorganization of the personnel policy of the Three Offices.

276
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,310
This is a joint petition to support the new personnel policy announced by His Majesty.

277
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,250
Many inspectors and high-ranking ministers who served in Saheonbu in the past

278
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,800
have already signed on.

279
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,330
Of course, I am well aware what a difficult decision it is.

280
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,780
However, if we truly want Saheonbu to change,

281
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,920
then shouldn't we be the ones to bear the burden first?

282
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,370
What are you sitting on the fence for?

283
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,190
If the Ministry of Interior's section chief system is repealed,

284
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,370
then we don't need to kiss up here and there but can simply do our jobs to the best of our abilities!

285
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,360
But you... Can it be you also signed on already?

286
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Of course.  As for me, I have passionately longed for Saheonbu's change for a very long time.

287
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,310
I must follow the lead inspector's wish.

288
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,000
Look here, Inspector Joo.

289
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,860
Thank you so much.

290
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,540
Wait.

291
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,280
But I don't see Inspector Joo's name here.

292
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,850
What?

293
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,520
You are right.

294
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,930
There is a Joo Yeong Hoon, but no Joo Yeong Han.

295
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,570
How can that be?

296
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,950
This guy seriously!

297
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,830
Oh my. Wh-Why is it like this?

298
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,090
But I definitely wrote down my name as Joo Yeong Han,

299
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,660
but why is there a Joo Yeong Hoon?

300
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,940
Now, here.

301
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,310
Here. Write it again.

302
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,710
A-Again?

303
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,790
Of course.  It can be written again as many times as needed.

304
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,590
Is that how it is?

305
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,870
I worried for nothing.

306
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,160
Then, of course, I should.  Again.

307
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,060
Again...

308
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,490
- The brush is, though... 
- Harrumph!

309
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,400
I will write it.

310
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,970
However, Your Majesty, the reason the appointment rights were given to the section chief of the Ministry of the Interior

311
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,040
to begin with was to prevent abuse by high-ranking ministers.

312
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,220
Because the system to prevent abuse itself got corrupted and turned bad,

313
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,220
I am suggesting its abolishment.

314
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,890
Then, how can you guarantee that the newly reformed system won't get corrupted again?

315
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,860
Detailed provisions were made to guard against that possibility.

316
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,500
Deputy Inspector General of Saheonbu, are you sure you have come to this meeting after studying those provisions?

317
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,300
Oh dear, has the morning regular audience session been dragging on for too long?

318
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,970
Two hours or so seems to have passed already.

319
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,710
That is right, Your Majesty.

320
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,520
I was excessive.  All of you must be tired from standing up,

321
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,290
and I failed to take that into consideration.

322
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,130
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

After a short recess of half an hour,

325
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,440
let us continue with our discussion in the afternoon seminar.

326
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,380
Yes, Your Majesty, we will do so.
