1
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,020
A pretty-looking rat lives on the mountain.

2
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,200
What a cute boy. So little.

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,030
How can I catch him when he's so pitiful?

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,010
Then let her go since she's not a boy.

5
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,900
You've got pride too, right?

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,180
Twisting a girl's wrist is a bit much.

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,650
- A girl? 
- Come, Tan.

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,200
Go at it with me instead.

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,940
Look here! What are you trying to do?

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,100
This is a wench?

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,980
So you're going to make yourself look cool?

12
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,250
That's how all the males work, isn't it? They can't help it when it comes to pretty women.

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,880
With just that one? Do you see the boys as just a folding screen  (decoration) ?

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,280
Of course. Since I only need to shoot one down.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,210
Don't get involved and step away. Are you dying to die together?

16
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,660
No way. We are not in any relations to die together yet.

17
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,660
Are you nuts?

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,440
Can't be that you're actually going to shoot, right?

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,490
Yes, it's true.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,160
He missed? Why this, wide off the mark!

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,630
Are you in your right mind? You can't even shoot an arrow properly, so why?

22
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,590
Over there! Are you pretty good at sprinting?

23
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,990
But why is there a strange noise coming from the forest?

24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,540
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,570
What noise is that?

26
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,330
It's a boar!

27
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,170
It's a big one, right? Tan! Your gold toad is mine!

28
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,020
Crazy punk.

29
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,240
It's now! You're not going to run off?

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,540
Wait. I need to get something.

31
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,930
Those things!

32
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,070
Hey, catch! Catch them!

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,570
Move.

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,410

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,070
I'll lure them, so you pull out from the back.

36
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,660
You want me to flee alone? Are you joking right now?

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,460
I'm not sending you off because you're pretty.

38
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,640
It's because I'm curious about what's in there too.

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,100
No matter the reason, it seems both of us have that item as our goal.

40
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,370
We'll meet at the hour of pig (9 - 11 PM) at the gisaeng house by Gwangtong Bridge.

41
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,000
Can you deal with them all alone? Earlier, there.

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,450
Oh, thanks to you? Since you hit me so lightly.

43
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,440
When we were running earlier, it seemed like you were limping.

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
I wasn't, alright?!

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,730
But there's no way you're fine after getting hit by me.

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,960
- That should work better since your torso is more agile.
 - Torso?

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Make sure you come at the hour of pig. I don't want to be the coward all alone.

48
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,520
Hey!

49
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,800
Chase him!  Halt!

50
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,970
Prince!

51
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,140
Do you get it, Tan? This is always your problem.

52
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,250
That you don't know you're an idiot.

53
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,970
Prince Yeoning!

54
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
You dare to make my nose bleed?

55
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,690
To me, the next king, you dare?

56
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,740
His Majesty arrives.

57
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,950
Your Majesty.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They said it would be a sight since it's the hunting competition.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,810
So that assurance was correct.

60
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,380
Indeed, it is the first spectacle of its kind in my life.

61
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,160
There must be a reason for it, Your Majesty.

62
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,160
- Y-Your Majesty, let me explain in detail.
 - No.

63
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,980
It can be known without hearing it, so why bother?

64
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,850
Was it you again?

65
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,840
Yes.

66
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,380
It's always you.

67
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,240

68
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,350
If you're born a male and you can't let your name be known to the world,

69
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,680
it's better to go and live in the mountains, he said.

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,680
What? That person placed first?

71
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,430
It's right at the top, clearly on the post.

72
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,350
That's what's more shocking than the fact that my name isn't there.

73
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,390
You not making it on the roster is a given, so that's not shocking.

74
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,420
But even so, you can't just pull off the exam poster.

75
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,470
He had the face of a pimp and reeked of alcohol too.

76
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,450
And even his brush was made of dog-hair.

77
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,550
So in the end, a man who possesses everything?

78
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,780
He is so slick-looking too.

79
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,590
He didn't just pass the exam either.

80
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,220
He placed first. What kind of a life is that?

81
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,360
Huh? Ah Bong!

82
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,130
Is he illegitimate? For a man of this skill to be a substitute test-taker is strange indeed.

83
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,170
It's not just strange, it's very suspicious.

84
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,450
But this Noh Tae Pyeong who hired him as his substitute has skipped town and left.

85
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,700
I said it's enough so why do you keep bringing me stuff?

86
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,890
Since this is all I can give you.

87
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,450
It's enough for last month's turf tax.

88
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,010
But if you give me just a few more days, I can somehow—

89
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,640
- The broth is fishy.
 - Pardon?

90
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,580
This is why your business isn't thriving.

91
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,350
You know the fish shop up front by the intersection, right?

92
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,360
Go and tell them Dal Moon sent you.

93
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,090
Then they will give you good anchovies without pulling the wool over your eyes.

94
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,150
Wait, then this?

95
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,770
If you give punks like me whatever they ask for, what are you going to eat to live?

96
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,140
You'll just die?

97
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,110
For the noodles.

98
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,670
But he made first place, so he'll show up, right?

99
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,800
- What if he doesn't show up?
 - Nothing we can do about it.

100
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,270
 So I'm starting.

101
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,120
Hyung-nim Dal Moon. Oh, were you collecting money?

102
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,480
You see those two in front of the noodle shop, right?

103
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,680
Those two?

104
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,400
Find out what those items are about.

105
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,870
Yes.

106
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,610
His Excellency the Prime Minister arrives.

107
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,660

(Office of the Inspector General)

108
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,090
Is was you? The impertinent one who put up the fence of yadasi around my house?

109
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,650
Since you obstructed the investigation on Prince Milpoong, I had no  other way.

110
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,110
Obstruction? When did I?

111
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,350
Your Excellency the Prime Minister.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,500
I apologize for making you come all the way here, Your Excellency.

113
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,350
What is this humiliation on me!

114
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,610
Please come first. The inspector general is waiting.

115
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,760
That would pose as an issue. We need to investigate first—

116
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,120
So you drag out the prime minister after all?

117
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,510
How dare a meager inspector come forward here!

118
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,810
Please send him to the investigation room after half an hour.

119
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,600
Why this—

120
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,050
First, you need to escort the prime minister, Chief Inspector.

121
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,900

(Royal Investigation Bureau)

122
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,600
Since you're a prince, you think we'll cover it up.

123
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,080
If things get bigger, it'll only disgrace the royal family.

124
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,050
You are not bold enough to touch the royal family.

125
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,450
Well, since we can understand each other's position, let's stop here.

126
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,880
What about the woman who disguised herself?

127
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,390
Who is that wench?

128
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,390
She disguised herself as a man and stole something from Prince Milpoong.

129
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,040
Even if we let you go because you're a prince, we must catch that wench.

130
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,290
It's better to just drop it.

131
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,510
If she is caught and opens her mouth, that will also disgrace the royal family.

132
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,550
What?

133
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,000
A strait-laced official like you wouldn't understand,

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,430
but if you play around like I do,

135
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,160
sometimes you face a turning point.

136
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,390
How should I say this?

137
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,750
Women... become a bit boring.

138
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,950
I do not understand what you are saying...

139
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm saying that my eyes wander to the sex that is not woman.

140
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,770
As a member of the royal family, I shouldn't feel this way towards men.

141
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,970
You mean...

142
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,160
Yes, I had her dress that way.

143
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,790
By making her disguise herself as a man, I thought I could restrain my heart.

144
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,300
What?

145
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,880
Oh my, is my preference making you uncomfortable?

146
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,570
Now that I look at you, you look good in your uniform.

147
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,940
I like it.

148
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,890
This is Prince Yeoning's answer?

149
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,830
He did that because he desires men?

150
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,270
Immense regrets, Your Majesty.

151
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,440
Fool!

152
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,940
That fool.

153
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,360
Are you waiting for Prince Yeoning, Your Highness?

154
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,390
Minister of the Interior.

155
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,940
I understand that you must be worried.

156
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,450
Prince Yeoning, who is close to you,

157
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,880
brought dishonor to Prince Milpoong.

158
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,760
Won't there be repercussions?

159
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,680
But isn't your side the ones making up the nonsense?

160
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,050
Like that our Royal Highness is trying to harm Prince Milpoong through Prince Yeoning.

161
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,050
Please lower your voice, Minister. We are in the royal palace.

162
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,300
Don't try to use what happened today as justification for a political battle.

163
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,240
In addition, Prince Yeoning is "His Highness" to you.

164
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,590
My older brother is not merely Prince Yeoning.

165
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,060
Indeed, your character is as straight as a carpenter's ink line, Your Highness.

166
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,950
I have always found that regretful.

167
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,850
What you find regretful is not very important to me.

168
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,870
It is so difficult for us to understand each other.

169
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,720
This is why it's difficult for us to work together,

170
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,680
since the king's way

171
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,960
cannot be walked alone.

172
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,850
Older Brother.

173
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,820
I've had dirty water thrown upon me since birth.

174
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,760
But you, because of me...

175
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
I am sorry.

176
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,830
It is not your fault, Older Brother.

177
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,850
Do not worry about it.

178
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,970
You should learn to blame others sometimes.

179
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,150
That's what politics is, and you lack too much political sense.

180
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,270
The Minister of the Interior, Min Jin Heon...

181
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,890
won't it be better for you to join him?

182
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,140
- Older Brother.
 - Hwon, politics is a fight for who has more people.

183
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,970
- In the end, the one who has more numbers—
 - That is disloyal.

184
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,640
There is already a crown prince.

185
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,220
You already know that seat will have to change its owner soon.

186
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,850
And if you lose that fight, what waits for you is death.

187
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,950
You know that, too.

188
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,180
Even so,

189
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,300
I can't go with the Noron Faction that pursues a one-party monopoly of power while ignoring the king's authority.

190
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,010
Of course, that is how you are.

191
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,670
Tan's "Record of the Dead." You've heard of it too, right?

192
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,980
The rumors of him going around committing murders.

193
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,820
Older Brother, how did you know?

194
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,010
- Perhaps I may get a hold of his weak point.
 - Pardon?

195
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,000
I may be a little bit useful.

196
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,510

197
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,220
Crazy! Does this make sense?

198
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,210
Does this make any sense?

199
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,440
Bloody hell!

200
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,360
What foolishness and madness!

201
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,610
Why would a man dry flowers?

202
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,280
Why would he preciously carry this around?

203
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,080
Some say Prince Milpoong is crazy.

204
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,420
It might be true then.

205
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,470
This is what I carried out after all that fuss?

206
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,510
I am an idiot, an idiot...

207
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,930
Hey, you will hurt your head. Be careful.

208
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,700
I am sorry, Lord. I was desperate and looked for the wrong thing—

209
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,120
No, it wasn't there in the first place.

210
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,400
If you couldn't find it, that is what must have happened.

211
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,630
Oh, I ...

212
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,010
- I am doing such foolish things, wasting time.
 - I know, right?

213
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,190
When we are so busy that we would shit while standing up,

214
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,540
it's driving me nuts that I'm going to make such a request.

215
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,210
What request?

216
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,540
Let's find someone, Yeo Ji. You have some time now, so it's perfect.

217
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,290
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

218
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,580
Lord Moon Soo is looking desperately for this guy, more than he would a wife who ran away.

219
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,060
He saw him take the test for someone at the test grounds not long ago.

220
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,570
Why would Lord Moon Soo be looking for him?

221
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,090
You know that he is super nosy.

222
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,600
He pesters me to death.

223
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,650
What is this?

224
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,240
Are you sure it's this person?

225
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,780
Lord said his name was Noh Tae Pyeong or something?

226
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,730
Noh Tae Pyeong?

227
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,160
Can't be that Noh Tae Pyeong that lives in Majangnae?

228
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,470
Do you know him, too? Did Lord Moon Soo tell you already?

229
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,910
Where is Lord Moon Soo?

230
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,510
Where is Lord Moon Soo right now?

231
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,250
 Was it you again?

232
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,660
 It is always you.

233
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,630
So you really did come out soundly.

234
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,960
Seeing that you came,

235
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,420
you have the basic manners even though you're a thief.

236
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,280
Promises are there to keep.

237
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,140
Flowers?

238
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,230
I'm not playing a trick. You might not believe it, but it's truly—

239
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,450
No, it's plenty understandable.

240
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,530
He's an unpredictable crazy punk anyway.

241
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,520
I guess you know the owner of that really well.

242
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,460
I suppose you were quite disappointed. There's nothing valuable in here.

243
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,850
There are times in life when you meet naught.

244
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,740
By the way, what is your name?

245
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,300
What do you do?

246
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,390
Seeing how you came out soundly after causing that ruckus earlier,

247
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,030
your ranking must be pretty high.

248
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,130
You want to exchange names?

249
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,590
Well, I suppose it's about time you get curious about someone as charming as me.

250
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,960
But I'll decline. I won't pester you about who you are either.

251
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,350
I'm a lowborn woman. I'm not a thief but a damo  (tea maid, female investigator)  of the Saheonbu.

252
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,760
Saheonbu damo?

253
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,180
And you must be Prince Yeoning, Lee Geum.

254
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,510
You are His Majesty's second son, Prince Yeoning, right?

255
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,790
You are a bold girl indeed.

256
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,170
We're done with our business with each other, so let's part ways.

257
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,920
Wait!

258
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,690
Where are you going, 52-year-old Noh Tae Pyeong?

259
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,400
I finally caught you, you little rat!

260
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,230
Yeo Ji, you did well! Thanks, macho man.

261
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,430
You are unusually late, Your Excellency.

262
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,190
Everyone's waiting.

263
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,370
Prince Milpoong is like a kid who only dances when you praise him,

264
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,120
so don't be too hard on him.

265
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,050
So you don't only spill out smiles, but you spill out words too.

266
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,090
Is that how you talk to the prime minister too?

267
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,210
Can't be.

268
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,000
Your Excellency seems to be aware of my relationship with Prince Milpoong,

269
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,050
so I was just being honest.

270
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,270
The prime minister...

271
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,520
I'll coax him nicely,

272
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,590
so please guide Prince Milpoong well, Your Excellency,

273
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,920
since you're the one who raised Prince Milpoong to his current height when he was just living an ignorant life.

274
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,130
So you say you will take care of the prime minister.

275
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,930
What a grateful deed it is.

276
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,490
But next to the king of this nation,

277
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,890
there won't be a seat for a prostitute.

278
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,570

279
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,320
I'm going to kill Prince Yeoning.

280
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,460
- He's gone mad!
 - I'm going to kill him for sure.

281
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,810
Why are you smashing things around in my house?

282
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,780
If he's going to throw a fit, he should break his own items.

283
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,770
Look here. What are you doing? Try to stop him.

284
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,100
- This is your home, Your Excellency. So you should—

285
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,920
Why this...

286
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,490
That's Goryeo celadon pottery!

287
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
Your Excellency.

288
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,250
Your Excellency.

289
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,600
Prince Yeoning was released?

290
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,770
You can't even clean up the likes of that?

291
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,580
It's a matter of the royal family.

292
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,660
To cover it up and move on is the proper course.

293
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,150
Proper course.

294
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,490
He humiliated me and what the hell were you doing?

295
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,920
What are all these things useful for?

296
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,990
Wait and see.

297
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,300
When I become king, do you think it's only Prince Yeonryeong that I will kill?

298
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,070
All the useless things will be wiped out!

299
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,880
- Y-Your Excellency. 
- I will advise Prince Milpoong.

300
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,110
You all go outside.

301
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,460
Yes.

302
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,550
Do you know what the current king's reign was like?

303
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:08,050
In the name of reformation of the state, he purged and replaced the court ministers from time to time.

304
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,550
As a sweet-sounding excuse to strengthen the king's authority,

305
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,740
he took the nobles of this nation, who are the pillars of this nation,

306
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,190
and with one word, knocked them out.

307
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,400
We can never have another king like him again.

308
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,230
A man like that cannot be king.

309
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,920
Furthermore, do not disdain Noron ever again.

310
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,050
Little punk!

311
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,790
Hey, use words. It seems ignorant to show off your physical might.

312
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,560
Hey.

313
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,680
Heaven and earth know I'm ignorant.

314
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,560
But the whole world will also find out soon that you're screwed.

315
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,780
Let's go easy and let's contain the cussing too.

316
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,920
What are you saying? I want to beat him, but my good disposition is keeping me back.

317
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,450
How do you know Noh Tae Pyeong who lives at Majangnae?

318
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,060
Why did you take the test as his hired substitute?

319
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,930

320
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,870
Noh Tae Pyeong? Substitute test-taker?

321
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,100
I am pretty bright but I have no idea what you're saying.

322
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,250
I just knew it! I knew it!

323
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,380
Hey, you're going to keep on acting like you don't know?

324
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,480
Hey, punk, I saw you clearly at the test ground.

325
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,650
You will get in trouble acting this way. Go easy on him, I said.

326
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,570
I don't think this will do.

327
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,160
A punk like this needs to be beaten to get a confession out.

328
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,620
Noh Tae Pyeong is the maternal uncle of the young widow Yoon Yeo Ok who died last month.

329
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,380
That woman

330
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,310
was raped by Prince Milpoong whom you know very well, Your Highness.

331
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,770
The woman Milpoong raped?

332
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,600
Hey, what did you just call that punk?

333
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,160
Yoon Yeo Ok committed suicide in the end.

334
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,560
However, the Saheonbu is looking at the case as a murder case by Prince Milpoong.

335
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,940
Yeo Ji, you don't hear me? What did you call him?

336
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,170
- So please answer me, Your Highness. 
- Your Highness?

337
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,860
How do you know Noh Tae Pyeong?

338
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,730
- Where is that disappeared man, Your Highness? 
- Can't be.

339
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,860
- Yes! I am a prince.
 - Really?

340
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,750
So you should already know the likes of you can't touch a prince like me.

341
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,810
Prince?

342
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,280
For the same reason, even if his words are right,

343
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,690
they will cover up the little substitute test-taking act.

344
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,530
The royal family is very capable in those matters.

345
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,120
If you understand now, step aside.

346
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,910
I will be generous and forgive your indiscretion tonight.

347
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,710
He's a prince so he can get out of this?

348
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,150
This messed up world.

349
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,380
He's really a prince?

350
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,970
That pimp is?

351
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,980
He's Prince Yeoning. The king's second son.

352
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:04,750
Hey! How can you just tell me that now? You should've told me in advance.

353
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,440
That's what I did. I told you to go lightly and watch the cussing.

354
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,090
But you should have told me clearly and precisely

355
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,710
that the bastard is a prince so I shouldn't act up!

356
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,050
He clearly had a knowing look.

357
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,040
Why exactly is he chasing after Prince Milpoong?

358
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,360
How can this be?

359
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,560
My life was already a no-go, and now it's really finished.

360
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,170
I didn't even pass the exam,

361
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,570
but my rope to officialdom is already blocked.

362
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,300
 Noh Tae Pyeong is the maternal uncle of the young widow Yoon Yeo Ok who died last month.

363
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:48,010
 That woman was raped by Prince Milpoong whom you know very well, Your Highness.

364
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,120
 Yes, now I can see the big picture.

365
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,640
 Prince Milpoong hired the substitute test-taker in order to muzzle Noh Tae Pyeong's mouth.

366
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,870
But why did he...

367
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,960
He passed the test like he wanted, but he disappeared.

368
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,240
Why?

369
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,990
 You have heard the rumor about Tan's "Record of the Dead," right?

370
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,350

371
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:20,860
 You know how dead bodies pile up around Prince Milpoong Tan!

372
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:59,530
You seem to take medicine more frequently now.

373
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,590
I saw you laugh internally

374
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,910
that this king will finally die.

375
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,260
Those are ill-fitting words, Your Majesty.

376
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,630
Will Prince Milpoong's wild temperament be fitting for a king?

377
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,060
A king is a human as well.

378
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,010
They too can possess some flaws, of course.

379
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,420
If Noron can clench power,

380
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,560
even if a hellion becomes the king, it is no issue is what I hear.

381
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,120
A good person doesn't make a good king.

382
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,860
Your Majesty didn't cause so much slaughter in the past with evil intentions, right?

383
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,600
They were unavoidable sacrifices in order to rectify state affairs.

384
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,420
Or perhaps retaliation against your subjects.

385
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,700
At the very least, Prince Milpoong will go through the motions of taking advice and govern well.

386
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,050
So you will support Prince Milpoong in the end?

387
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:00,860
I am also aware of the rumor in the world about Tan's "Record of the Dead."

388
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,150
That Prince Milpoong has committed murders.

389
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,500
It is not proven. With what evidence do you speak?

390
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,800
Hey, you retarded idiot!

391
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,150
Who said to place first?

392
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,510
What am I supposed to do if you place Noh Tae Pyeong first in the exam?

393
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:43,040
But you said to show good result so I did that.

394
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,350
That's back then. But we're here now, you bastard!

395
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,040
You don't know what adaptable means?

396
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,090
Hey, you'll have to silence that substitute test-taker first.

397
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,740
By tonight, catch him and kill him.

398
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,120
And bring him to me.

399
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,810
It won't come off! So filthy!

400
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,760
The highest passer will draw everyone's attention.

401
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,660
If Noh Tae Pyeong doesn't show up, then the problem...

402
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,570
could get bigger.

403
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,560
So you're telling me this in case I don't know?

404
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,130
Pardon?

405
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,790
So what the hell were you doing on the side?

406
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,200
You should've stopped me when I killed that bastard. How could you just watch?

407
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,530
I'm sorry.

408
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,410
That bastard Noh Tae Pyeong.

409
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,990
I made you pass the test!

410
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,440
But why did you ask for money too, to piss me off and cause this trouble!

411
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,640
Seriously. Minister of the Interior told me I couldn't cause more trouble after all this.

412
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,520
What do I do?

413
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,700
So filthy! Ack!

414
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,500
The first place finisher didn't show up at the roster ceremony?

415
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,740
Yes, there was quite a ruckus since no one knew about the top scorer.

416
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,300
Indeed.

417
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,080
But what's this all about, Your Highness?

418
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,570
You are not involved in any dangerous matter, right?

419
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,060
I will explain to you later, but more urgent is what I asked.

420
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,730
Wow, are you just leaving your house now, Your Highness?

421
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,560
Wow, what a great house.

422
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,230
Indeed, you are royalty.
