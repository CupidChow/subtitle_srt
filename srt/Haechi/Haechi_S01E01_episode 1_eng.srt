1
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,420
 Year 1719. Latter end of King Sukjong's reign.

2
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:37,700
 Ill-talk that the crown prince could not beget an heir was spreading widely among the land.

3
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,420
 With that, the Seoin Faction (western faction) that had clenched the royal court

4
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,760
 was divided into Noron (old learning) and Soron (new learning) factions.

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,770
 Each were trying to enthrone a different prince to the royal seat.

6
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:54,240
 And on the crown prince's side, only the powerless, minority-numbered Namin Faction (southern faction) remained.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,070
 Amid this chaos that engulfed the entire nation,

8
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,290
 Joseon had an institution called the Saheonbu (Office of Inspector General)

9
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,920
 which had the highest authority of the judiciary branch.

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,030
 When practicing the Prajnaparamita deeply,

11
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,110
 one perceives that all five skandhas are empty

12
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,500
 and is saved from all suffering and distress.

13
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,190
 Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form.

14
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,240
You... you're...

15
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,780
We are all living lives hanging off the edge of a cliff.

16
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,600
A slight push and we will plummet instantly.

17
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,480
Do you know what one realizes when that instance comes?

18
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,280
To lose power is akin to imminent death.

19
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:10,610

20
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,210
His Majesty arrives.

21
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,290
It's certain.

22
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,500
The crown prince will never beget an heir, Your Highness.

23
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,620

24
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,560
Your Highness, it means the crown prince could be replaced.

25
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280

26
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,490
However, it's not just at that time, of course.

27
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,810

28
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,390
It's possible someone's life is plummeting right at this moment too.

29
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,090
In life, what goes around comes around.

30
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,760
I will hear you first.

31
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,900
Why have you summoned me, an inspector of the great Saheonbu, Your Excellency?

32
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,450
You are a dragon from a stream. 
 (Means a big shot with meager origins)

33
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,020
Even though you placed first on the exam to your current ranking,

34
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:06,140
since you are from the Namin Faction, you already know you cannot go high in your officialdom.

35
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,510
The reason you are not taking that cup is due to another engagement?

36
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,280
For example... a yadasi?
 (Yadasi: when inspectors mobilize together to charge a high-ranking official of a crime)

37
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,270
How did you know?

38
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:24,590
A few low-grade inspectors like yourself plan to stir up trouble tonight,

39
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,100
without understanding which way the world is turning.

40
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,330
The world sometimes calls Saheonbu officers, haechi.

41
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:44,060
Haechi, the legendary animal that judges good and evil.

42
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,760

43
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,040
But do you know why that animal only exists in legends?

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,810
It's because, in reality, it's impossible to judge good and evil.

45
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,050
Byeong Joo!

46
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,770
You came!

47
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,580
I knew you'd show up.

48
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,210
 That's because,

49
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:38,060
 in reality, only winner and loser, survivor and dead exist.

50
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,870
Today, the reason why we, Saheonbu inspectors, gathered,

51
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,750
is not for politics or current trend.

52
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,220
Instead, it's to keep law and justice.

53
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:11,450
Even if it's the weakest arm, if that arm wields the sword of justice, that power is strong.

54
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,350
 But in this world, there are fools who believe otherwise.

55
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,570

56
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,360
We're here. They say it's Hanyang  (capital city) .

57
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,760
The liquor-peddling country bumpkin has succeeded in life,

58
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,660
to have come to this grand Hanyang.

59
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,620
The city is still full of bigger losers than you.

60
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,010
It's time to leave and you just won't tell me until the end?

61
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,670
What do you do?

62
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,100
A wealthy merchant? The son of a minister?

63
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,420
The most useless man in the royal court too.

64
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,010
I told you already.

65
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,580
But still, you are the first person who ever treated a wench like me as a person.

66
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,970
Since I came out anyway, I'll check out the capital and go back.

67
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,730
When you get off the ferry, get the porters and go there.

68
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,690
Go first.

69
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,010
I might be late.

70
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,870
Where is it?

71
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,010
Can't be... is it your home?

72
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,180
Are you in your right mind?

73
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,170
I'm not even a gisaeng. I'm a liquor-selling wench off the streets.

74
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,780
If you go around with a thing like me, fingers will point at you.

75
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,130
Don't worry if it's that.

76
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,270
In this land of Hanyang,

77
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,500
that's the role I play anyway.

78
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,110
This way, here.

79
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,870
This horse was originally picked out by Deputy Minister's madam to gift to their son-in-law,

80
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,370
but that son-in-law suddenly passed the civil service exam.

81
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,700
You know how the nobles can't get promoted easily if they ride an expensive horse

82
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,930
because of that "upright official" policy.

83
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,560
So what if one's a noble? They can't show off their wealth.

84
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,840
That's right. It's better to wear the middle-tier hat.

85
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,520
Those with the royal winged cap are shaky in their position right now.

86
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,140
Hey, find him suitable stirrups.

87
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,210
Yes. This way.

88
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,800
The punk doesn't know much about horses anyway, so just wrap it up.

89
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,900
I'll start the price at 300 and end at 200.

90
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,350
Hey, did you finish trying it?

91
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,230
Your butt feels titillated, right?

92
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,640
What's the occasion for you to show me a genuine one?

93
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,240
Well, we adjust the game for the player.

94
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,030
Who'd mess with a man who cons the frauds?

95
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,460
This is hard to get even when you pay a thousand.

96
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,910
Take this punk and please save me once.

97
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,820
How did you bite that one?

98
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,050
I didn't bite it. I got bitten!

99
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,520
He told me to find a suitable one, out of nowhere.

100
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,580
Which bookworm would dare to take on such a big task?

101
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,510
But since my life's over already, it's no matter to me?

102
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,330
Such heartbreaking words from you. It's not that, but your skills...

103
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,640
Give me a brush and an inkstone. You said the exam is at the hour of snake (9-11 AM), right?

104
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,730
You're going to let me live then?

105
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,940
It's late so I'll ride this punk there.

106
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,580
Avoid Gyedong as you go.

107
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,580
Last night there was that chaos, so the roads are a mess.

108
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,670
Chaos? Why?

109
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,560
Yadasi. Overnight, the prime minister was served yadasi.

110
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,530
What? The prime minister?

111
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,980
Move back. Move back!

112
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,600
Gosh, the Saheonbu inspectors served yadasi to the prime minister.

113
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,520
Then what is this? It means he did commit a crime.

114
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,600
 I told you to take this out immediately, so why aren't you?!

115
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,640
Yadasi?

116
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,660
How dare you rascals from the Saheonbu! Do you know who I am?

117
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,750
Are you curious about what yadasi is?

118
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,180
Pardon?

119
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,300
It's when the Saheonbu inspectors reveal the secret crimes

120
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,290
- of high-ranking people like him to the world.
 - I won't leave them alone.

121
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,460
That's why a rampage is happening like this.

122
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,330
- Isn't it fun?
- You deserve to be bitten by dogs.

123
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,010
Hey you bastard, go ahead and say it again.

124
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,680
Even a tiger

125
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,730
gets bitten by a dog sometimes.

126
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,570
Even so, how can your scream be heard over your fence?

127
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,300
Minister of the Interior, why are you showing up there suddenly?

128
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,970
 The inspector general is coming!

129
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,730
Inspector General.

130
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,790
Do you not realize the political timing?! The rumor that the crown prince might change is all over the place.

131
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,750
Why mess with the prime minister who is the head of the Noron Faction?

132
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,460
Have you heard? I heard the next crown prince will be decided

133
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,750
between Prince Milpoong and Prince Yeonryeong.

134
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,630
Of course, Prince Milpoong has the advantage.

135
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,890
Because of that, there are Namin Faction gatherings supporting the crown prince.

136
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,060
That's why! Why at a time like this, did we, the Saheonbu, specifically pick

137
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,090
the prime minister who is the head of the Noron Faction?!

138
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,070
Do you not know that the Noron Faction is supporting Prince Milpoong?

139
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,630
I am not taking sides here, but I am saying if this is correct politically.

140
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,220
Just how have you been managing the lowly officials?!

141
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,170
What do inspectors mean in Saheonbu?

142
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,480
Some say we are swords keeping the laws, but we are not.

143
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,050
We are just 24 underlings.

144
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,370
Do you understand?

145
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,820
Underlings like us are just following orders and

146
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,510
catching petty thugs corrupting public morals!

147
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,310
But last night,

148
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,850
some undisciplined bugs, who don't know their place, caused trouble—

149
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,930
It wasn't trouble but yadasi.

150
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,850
And we inspectors can report high-ranking officials' corruption!

151
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,880
So you guys planned it without your leader's knowledge

152
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,800
and made me into a fool in the eyes of my superiors!

153
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,330
You are going too far.

154
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,080
Inspector Han did tell you, but you ignored him.

155
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,080
Why are you there?

156
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,710
Weren't you the one who was trying to climb the ladder quickly?

157
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,610
Because you're Namin,

158
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,560
you want to hurt the Norons since the crown prince you're supporting is swaying back and forth in power?

159
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,770
Is this the kind of justice you were talking about? It's fraud!

160
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,690
Don't distort this as a faction specific issue.

161
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,040
The only Namin here is Inspector Wi, and we weren't trying to practice politics

162
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,200
but were doing our jobs as Saheonbu inspectors.

163
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,380
So you will continue to poke at the prime minister?

164
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,700
The prime minister put pressure on the police bureau

165
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,340
to hide the murder investigation that I was holding.

166
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,840
What do you think the reason is?

167
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,810
It's certain that it's because Prince Milpoong, whom the Noron are supporting, is involved—

168
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,960
He said to drop it because there is no evidence!

169
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,680
If he hadn't interfered like that,

170
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,050
we wouldn't have gone through with a yadasi.

171
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,670
- Hey, Han Jeong Seok! You bastard! 
- Stop, sir.

172
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,440
Then I will leave now to do my job.

173
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,960
Hey! Stop right there.

174
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,960
Job? That's not your job.

175
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,310
Stop meddling in that and go on rounds.

176
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,920
What good timing. There's a test for government officials being held at Sungkyunkwan.

177
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,110
- Why don't you inspect the testing grounds?
 - Lead Inspector.

178
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,670
Yes! Lead Inspector, that's who I am!

179
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,860
The one who hands out job assignments!

180
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,090
I'm warning you. Insubordination is not allowed in Saheonbu.

181
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,010
If you want to act on your own will,

182
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,050
resign and leave.

183
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:32,690
Aigoo, am I late?

184
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,360
Look at the quality of this brush.

185
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,110
If the rain hadn't stopped, we would have been in big trouble. Right?

186
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,770
Your face looks pretty dry.

187
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,820
You couldn't sleep either, worrying about if the tests would be postponed?

188
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,960
I slept well and there is no way that my face looks dry.

189
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,320
No, you're wrong. Your face is darkened all around.

190
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,270
Or maybe you have a chronic illness.

191
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,570
Wait!

192
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,210
What is this?

193
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,860
What are you doing?

194
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,810
Alcohol? You gave up early and drank all night?

195
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,750
Why did you do that? It's not over until the end, so why did you do that?

196
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,790
Not your business. There are lives that have already ended the moment they start.

197
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,250
You've failed the test quite a lot.

198
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,200
That's why your face looks rotten.

199
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,430
Let's just say that's why.

200
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,070
Well actually, my fail count is in the tens.

201
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,990
All the people here are like that.

202
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,370
It's not just you.

203
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,000
Right! There is a saying that goes "You must fail a thousand times to become top."

204
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,680
So let's...

205
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,530
until the end, okay? Persevere until the end.

206
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,230
Okay. But I didn't ask and I'm not curious, so...

207
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,400
Here. This is a brush made of yellow-throated marten fur.

208
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,990
A new brush.

209
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,070
You came riding on a nice horse.

210
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,380
But why does your brush look like this?

211
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,110
No, I don't need—

212
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,710
I am Park Moon Soo.

213
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,260
And you?

214
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,060
What is your name?

215
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,150
You've been inspecting for so many years, so how dare he put you on rounds!

216
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,630
That Joo Yeong Han! Can he do whatever he wants because he's the lead inspector?

217
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,150
Are you really going to stop investigating that case like a coward because the target is the prime minister?

218
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,830
Ah Bong, how many years has it been that you've worked under me as an assistant investigator?

219
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,280
- Five years. Why do you ask? 
- You fool!

220
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,790
He's saying stop your nonsense.

221
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,250
Do you think our sir will tuck his tail between his legs?

222
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,560

223
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,160
 52 years old, Noh Tae Pyeong?

224
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,850
Hey mister, isn't it a bit awkward?

225
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,460
You, what is it again this time?

226
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,490
You told me that you were a Jang, but you wrote "52 years old, Noh Tae Pyeong."

227
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,190
You must have lived a very eventful life. 
 ("Tae Pyeong" means uneventful, peaceful)

228
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,010
Even if you look rotten, you're saying your face is one of a 50-year-old's?

229
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,680
- You're taking the exam for someone else, right?
 - Taking exam for someone else?

230
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,100
Not knowing that, I even lent you a brush.

231
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,250
Inspector! Here, there is someone who is taking an exam for another person!

232
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,900
What are you doing?

233
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,980
I used it well, but this is not a brush made with yellow-throated marten fur but hog fur.

234
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,100
I thought you should know.

235
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,730
A hog?

236
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,580
Pig fur? Hey!

237
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,300
You! This, this is mine.

238
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,070
Hey! You stop there!

239
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,270
I'll come for you soon.

240
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,970
You, stop! Stop right there!

241
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,770
Hey you!

242
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,820
Stop right there!

243
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,390
- Hey you!
 - Get him!

244
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,110
I'm telling you to stop!

245
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,660
Get him! Hey!

246
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,500
Isn't that Hyung-nim Moon Soo?

247
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,190
What's going on? What's the problem?

248
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,650
Huh?

249
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,130
Where do you think you're going?

250
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,400
Wow, pretty good.

251
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,460
Punk!

252
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,910
I'm tired.

253
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,450
Let's go now.

254
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,810
Already? But I'm fine.

255
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,060
You take money to be a substitute test-taker?

256
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,420
Some people wager their lives there, you punk!

257
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,220
I give you a warning. You shouldn't wager your life on it.

258
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,790
I saw it fleetingly and in this life, you're a no-go.

259
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,750
What?

260
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,920
Why this pimp-looking thing!

261
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,910
Hey, you just stand there. Stand there!

262
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,430
Stand? I am standing already.

263
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,030
You!

264
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,350
Fifty-two-year-old Noh Tae Pyeong!

265
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,560
That crazy...

266
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,190
Step aside.

267
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,280
This is Prince Yeonryeong's entourage.

268
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,850
Move aside.

269
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,090
This is Prince Yeonryeong's entourage.

270
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,500
Hey! Are you nuts?

271
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,730
It's the prince's entourage.  He is a prince.

272
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,100
- Moon Soo.
 - Huh?

273
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,300
Hyung-nim Jeong Seok.

274
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,630
What are you doing? Why are you here?

275
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,450
You came just in time.

276
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,480
Some punk was taking the state test for someone else at the test grounds,

277
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,240
and I was chasing after him but the prince...

278
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,340
Wait a minute. The test grounds?

279
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,140
Why did you go there?

280
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,470
It can't be that you took the state test?

281
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,210
Again?

282
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,650
Well, so I think I might have.

283
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:46,280
Just ignore me, I said. Just pass by me like everyone else.

284
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,270
Why do you insist on acknowledging me?

285
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,430
So you are still boisterous,

286
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,370
Older Brother, Prince Yeoning.

287
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,100

288
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,480
That was magnificent.

289
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,830
Indeed.

290
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,870
That was wonderful.

291
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,040
I wonder if it was a worthy sight for you all.

292
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,340
What a treat to the eyes.

293
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,390
I've never seen a dance like that!

294
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:35,050
Indeed, you are Prince Milpoong who possess all the six virtues of a gentleman.

295
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,770
Since everyone has such high expectations of me, I gave it a try at sword dance.

296
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,510
But as it turns out, when I give it a try, it works!

297
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,650
I made up each and every move!

298
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,810
But isn't a sword dance a bit too much?

299
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:57,530
The guests are having to suffer outside in this weather because of you, Prince Milpoong.

300
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,250
By the way, I don't see the crown prince.

301
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,580
That's...

302
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,370
Did something happen overnight, Crown Princess Consort?

303
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,170
Not at all.

304
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,940
He has a stomachache so he's resting.

305
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,930
Oh no.

306
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,830
I wonder if he's lying down too often.

307
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,420
Since the seat of the national foundation  ("national foundation" means crown prince)  shouldn't be left vacant even for a moment.

308
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,900
I thank you for your concern, but His Majesty and the current royal family will

309
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,580
look after the national foundation well, right?

310
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,150
By "current" royal family, you mean?

311
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,300
I mean, it's not a concern to you, Prince Milpoong, as side family.

312
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,540
I apologize that I'm late, Your Highness.

313
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,850
Prince Yeonryeong!

314
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,060
I was waiting for you for so long. What took you so long?

315
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,030
I met someone welcoming so I came with him.

316
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,190
Since it's Your Highness's birthday, the whole royal family should come.

317
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,540
By royal family, I think everyone's here already.

318
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,450
Of whom do you speak?

319
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,270
Can't be. Prince Yeoning?

320
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,900
When in Hanyang?

321
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,730
Where does he think this place is, to come?

322
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,380
He thinks he's royalty too?

323
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
I bid you my greetings, Your Highness the Queen.

324
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,510
Have you been well?

325
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,240
Well, yes.

326
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,100
What an occasion for me to see you too.

327
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,970
Summon the chief royal secretary right this moment.

328
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,880
Do you know what I hate the most?

329
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,930
Someone selfish. Someone exactly like you who gives others trouble for your own benefit.

330
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,220
And I'm a prince no less!

331
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,180
And one who is about to become the king too!

332
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,570
You think I can't slash you because this is the palace, right?

333
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,550
I did wrong. Please, Your Highness.

334
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,910
You're wrong, bastard!

335
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,680
This is all going to be mine!

336
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,590
So your habit of doing things personally remains the same.

337
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,090
You'll end up in trouble doing that one of these days.

338
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,270
Inner palace guards are at Jinseon Gate.

339
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,850
You'll get caught doing this.

340
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,200
Remove him and go take a look.

341
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,040
Just ignore it.

342
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,830
Prince Yeoning. Hyung-nim.

343
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,230
This is why you're amusing to me.

344
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,890
Your attitude changes so fast. You called me Hyung-nim?

345
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,100
You're not an easy feat. To come to a place like this too.

346
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,750
I guess you do your sniffing around.

347
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,640
Are you going to cling to Prince Yeonryeong's side?

348
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,500
Stop your concern about me who has no interest in the happenings of the royal palace. It's tiring.

349
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,950
What interest? More like you don't qualify since your mother is a low-born.

350
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,570
That's why everyone finds you uncomfortable, Hyung-nim.

351
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:42,890
A royal prince with low-born blood flowing in him.

352
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,980
It's embarrassing no matter what, no?

353
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,460
Why do you cling to Prince Yeonryeong?

354
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,960
You're both sons of the king but one's king material and the other's a lost cause.

355
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,560
Doesn't it make your stomach knot?

356
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,910
Since you're singing about blood, let's skip the "Hyung-nim" calling, Tan.

357
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,080
You're not even a son of the king.

358
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,740
So in other words, the collateral family line?

359
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,510
I am the direct descendant of Crown Prince Sohyeon!

360
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,380
The royal throne was supposed to be my father's and mine!

361
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,170
Stop your whining.

362
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,480
What law is that? Whoever swallows it gets to keep it.

363
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,820
I hear Prime Minster Kim Chang Joong was served yadasi.

364
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,890
That was because of you, right? It's obvious.

365
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,310
You caused some trouble and the Noron who are supporting you had to stop it.

366
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,100
And so that's how that disturbance came about.

367
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:45,550
What? Did you, by chance, get yourself caught killing someone?

368
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,390
Shut up, punk!

369
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,610
A thing like you as a king?

370
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,450
The next reign will be Prince Yeonryeong's so stop your vain efforts.

371
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:02,010
Since he's a kind punk, he'll spare you, so don't cower too much either.

372
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,640
Shove that aside.

373
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,230
Or you'll get hurt too.

374
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,230
Prince Milpoong.

375
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,390
You need to come quickly.

376
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,040
His Majesty is sending a royal edict to you right now.

377
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,680
What?

378
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,200
Me?
