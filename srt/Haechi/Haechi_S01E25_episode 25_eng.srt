1
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,280
This petition is written very well.

2
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,910
Sentence after sentence, it is written beautifully.

3
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,280
Prince Milpoong has made a move. What should we do, Hyung-nim?

4
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,860
Who dared to write this subversive petition?

5
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,320
Does this man wish to die, accused of treason?!

6
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,700
Your Excellency, we have to submit this petition to His Majesty.

7
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,320
I knew this day would come in the end

8
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,380
the more power the crown prince gained!

9
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,540
In the end, this actually happened!

10
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,830
 You believe that you are different from the others.

11
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,000
 "It will be nice to do just as well as the Norons did."

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,960
 "Doing just as well as them will keep this nation safe."

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,560
 Soon, you will know that to be true.

14
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,830
 No, Min Jin Heon. I will never become like you.

15
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,040
Crown Prince, you were here.

16
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,410
Prince Milpoong.

17
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,630
I entered the palace to see you,

18
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,120
but you weren't at your quarters, so I have been looking for you for a while.

19
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,870
Pavilion where the wind blows...

20
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,650
Don't you think you're being too leisurely?

21
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,050
I'm not free enough to listen to your nonsense at any time.

22
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,570
For that to happen, don't you think our statuses are too different?

23
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:43,990
However, it would be best

24
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,840
if you listened to the rest of what I have to say.

25
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,980
Human beings are all the same, Your Highness.

26
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,970
How could this be?

27
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,940
How could there be such a terrible petition as this?

28
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,620
That is why I told you before to not protect the crown prince.

29
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,580
In the end, it becomes a dagger like this and returns to you, Your Majesty.

30
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,750
 When what is theirs or their lives are threatened,

31
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,050
 there is nothing they won't do.

32
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,200
 If Prince Milpoong does not gain the throne,

33
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,620
 then I will die, too.

34
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,060
 So please.

35
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,490
- Hyung-nim, what should we do about Prince Milpoong?
 - Nothing.

36
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,490
What?

37
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,640
 When engulfed by passion and desire,

38
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,880
Nothing.

39
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,490
 they can't see anything else.

40
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,410
Just like me in the past.

41
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,230
All other human beings as well.

42
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,530
What are you daring to babble, Prince Milpoong?

43
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,520
Headwind.

44
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,160
Soon at this palace, there will be a headwind that will blow you away.

45
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,220
What?

46
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,460
It's not a gentle spring breeze.

47
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,510
That wind...

48
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:31,570
reeks with the rancid smell of blood, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

49
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,940
What on earth are you people doing?

50
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,620
We were on our way to the crown prince's tutorial—

51
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,410
Crown Prince! Crown Prince! His Highness the Crown Prince!

52
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,870
Do you know what is happening?

53
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,020
To whom do you owe your allegiance?

54
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,820
Is it His Majesty or the crown prince?

55
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,330
The tutorial has been canceled?  All of a sudden?

56
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,190
His Lord Lee Gwang Jwa only sent words of apology.

57
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,590

(Part of Chinese classic I Ching “Book of Changes”)

58
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,010
 There will be a headwind that will blow you away.

59
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:53,550

60
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,940

61
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,600
He's not in?  Again?

62
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,090
How many times do I have to tell you?

63
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,870
Then please give this to Lord Yoon Hyeok when he comes back.

64
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,030
It's ginseng from Punggi that I procured after much trouble.

65
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,220
No, no, it's not allowed.  He ordered us not to receive anything.

66
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,150
Hey, come here!  Hey, come here!

67
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,200
Come here.  Come here.

68
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,070
How can even Yoon Hyeok's servants give off bad impressions and be so difficult?

69
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,930
Aigoo, you are...

70
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,890
Chief Inspector, why are you...

71
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,620
Yoon Hyeok is not in today, either?

72
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,520
That's right.

73
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,910
Let's pretend that we didn't run into each other here.

74
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,460
Wait.

75
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,120
They seem identical.  How much did you pay for yours?

76
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,570

77
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,380
Section Chief of the Interior.

78
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,020
My Lord, you didn't go home yet again?  It's been ten days already.

79
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,020
Just in time.

80
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,300
This is a new instruction regarding the appointment of officials to the Three Offices  (Saheonbu, Saganwon, and Hongmoongwan) .

81
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,670
Don't lose time to hand it down to the Three Offices.

82
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,210
Yes, Lord.

83
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,030
This makes no sense!

84
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,720
This means he'll turn everything upside down at all Three Offices!

85
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,960
Excuse me. Excuse me.

86
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
Section Chief of the Interior's new personnel policy.

87
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,240
As of today, March 25, the qualifications of all officials

88
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,980
at Saheonbu, Saganwon, and Hongmoongwan

89
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,730
will be re-examined.

90
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,520
Hey, Inspector Park, it's begun.

91
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,730
- Finally!
 - We did it!  We did it!

92
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,380
Accordingly, if any corruption related to appointment of high-ranking officials

93
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,220
or corruption or negligence related to carrying out their jobs comes to light,

94
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,880
they shall be demoted immediately.

95
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,020
If he tries to destroy the press under the pretext of righting wrongs,

96
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,640
- that's nothing but political retribution. 
- You are right.

97
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,480
Where have you seen such a violent act that will shake the entire nation from its roots!

98
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,310
 Moreover, in the event the corruption and wrongful conduct are found to an exceptional degree,

99
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,240
irrespective of the highness or lowness of the rank,

100
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,590
they shall be fired from their job and criminally charged.

101
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,790
Yoon Hyeok, is this person crazy?!

102
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,670
How can he do this even to Saheonbu?  This was the office he used to belong to.

103
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,850
We can't possibly all be fired?

104
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,750
Don't you know Yoon Hyeok?

105
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,120
He is a stuffy person who doesn't know how to compromise with reality.

106
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,600
He means to brag that he has His Majesty and the crown prince behind him.

107
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,110
That bastard relying on that...

108
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,900
I heard that Section Chief Yoon is here.

109
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,820
Yes, Your Highness.  Please go inside.

110
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,370

111
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,970
Re-examine the qualifications of the high-ranking officials of all Three Offices?

112
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,400
Yes, Your Majesty.  I first announced this personnel policy to the Three Offices.

113
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,890
Your Majesty, the crown prince is here to see you.

114
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,200
Crown Prince?

115
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,420
I sent an invitation to him,

116
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,920
because I felt that His Highness must know about this too.

117
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,570
You are here, Your Highness.

118
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,220
Your Majesty.

119
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,570
Yes, you are here.

120
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,450
Suspecting the crown prince of an ulterior motive?  Isn't that too much?!

121
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,510
Yes, it was just one petition arguing for regency.

122
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,370
What do you mean "just one"?  What does regency signify?

123
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,700
It means telling His Majesty to take a back seat.

124
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,280
It is treason asking for transfer of the throne to the crown prince.

125
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,530
However, the crown prince I saw is not a person who'd threaten His Majesty's throne.

126
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,670
Since when have you believed in a person in politics?

127
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,160
What you have to look at is the whole placement, not one person.

128
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,000
The more potential the crown prince shows and wins the popular opinion,

129
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,820
the more perilous His Majesty's throne becomes.  That's what I am saying.

130
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,240
So you are of a different opinion?

131
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,020
If I may add my opinion, that is right.

132
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,350
Section Chief Yoon's policy is a necessary step toward reform.

133
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,410
However, before it's implemented, how about we give them time to clean up themselves?

134
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,890
Do you mean that we should make them change themselves?

135
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,570
Especially, Saheonbu is an organization with a high sense of pride and cohesiveness.

136
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,310
The stronger the pressure put on them, the more rebellious they will become.

137
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,270
This will come back to weigh down His Majesty.

138
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,690
This, because you're worried about me...

139
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,040
Therefore, what do you think about taking a step back and giving them a chance, Your Majesty?

140
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,850
Since you've warned them that they would not survive without changing,

141
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,370
first give them time and then Section Chief Yoon will implement the policy.

142
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,680
Are you saying Section Chief Yoon should herd from the front and I should open a back door for them?

143
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,410
I, too, think His Highness Crown Prince's judgment is correct.

144
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,130
Indeed, your political sense is superb.

145
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,950
So I would look like a laughable king to you.

146
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,400
That's inconceivable, Your Majesty.

147
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,950
Do it as you wish, Crown Prince.

148
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,980
Moreover, report straight to the crown prince in the future.

149
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,330
He can sign off on everything.

150
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,300
But... I am extremely sorry, Your Majesty.

151
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,860
However, Your Majesty, this is unacceptable.

152
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,060
I am telling you to do it because you will do well.

153
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,090
Because I think you'll be better than me.

154
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,020
I am sorry, Your Highness, but is something the matter?

155
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,080
Why is His Majesty...

156
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,530
I must be on my way.  Work hard.

157
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,530
I will explain the details to you later.

158
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,130
Are you saying a petition was submitted to the king,

159
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,360
and right after that, the Sorons began to behave strangely?

160
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,850
Yes, however, nobody can find out the content of the petition.

161
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,000
Can't find out?

162
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,350
It's something that must be hidden.

163
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,820
It means it's problematical.  Who in the Royal Secretariat is on our side?

164
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,400
Hurry and find out the content of the petition submitted to the king.

165
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,130
Whoa, whoa.

166
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,790
Your Highness, you are here.

167
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,610
How about Dal Moon?  Is he in?

168
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,220
Y-Yes, he is but...

169
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,120
Prince Milpoong to you?

170
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,950
He came and warned me that there would be a headwind.

171
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,690
Definitely, he was scheming something.

172
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,190
But is Prince Milpoong really not up to anything suspicious?

173
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,280
No, nothing.

174
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,460
All he did was visit gisaeng houses and get drunk.

175
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,060
Is that so?

176
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,640
In that case, the strange air flowing in the palace today...

177
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,030
has nothing to do with Prince Milpoong?

178
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,730
Did you say the king seemed ominous?

179
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,690
His Majesty definitely had his guard up against me.

180
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,170
I will collect all secretive information from the palace right now

181
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,560
and let you know as soon as I find out.

182
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,150
Thank you.

183
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,470
I am always in your debt.

184
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,240
 What do you mean do nothing?

185
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
 But His Highness definitely asked you to check on Prince Milpoong's moves.

186
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,330
 I will take care of it.

187
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,140
 You are my underling, not His Highness's.

188
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,930
 Why?  Why is Hyung-nim Dal Moon...

189
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,340
Officials of Saheonbu and the Three Offices should be having a meeting here.

190
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,460
Go over there.

191
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,480
What is with your attitude just now?  Who do you dare to...

192
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,530
Saheonbu's Deputy Inspector General,

193
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,550
Lord Wi Byeong Joo.

194
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,980
Hurry up.

195
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,360
To survive, your butthole must feel like it's sitting on an explosive  (extremely anxious) .

196
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,100
Lord Deputy Inspector General, over here!

197
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,430
Wi Byeong Joo, Saheonbu's Deputy Inspector General.

198
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,500
He is yet another horse who'll take me to the throne.

199
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,230
You're super busy, aren't you?

200
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,780
I guess you've been hatching this for a long time.

201
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,920
I've been looking forward to this day to catch that crown prince bastard.

202
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,860
Keep a good eye on Wi Byeong Joo and relay my message to him.

203
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,640
Who are we to the Three Offices?  The best human resources they've got.

204
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,980
We can't just lose out to His Majesty and the crown prince like this.

205
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,620
But there is news about how His Majesty has taken one step back.

206
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,690
That he would give us time to clean up ourselves.

207
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,750
Clean up ourselves?

208
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,460
The guidelines have been handed down to Saganwon and Hongmoongwan already.

209
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,250
If we eliminate corrupt officials first, somehow we can have them adjusted—

210
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,600
That is none other than the divide-and-conquer tactic!  Will you be taken in by an obvious scheme?

211
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,390
It's their scheme to split us up.

212
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,580
Now we have to come together and find a way for everyone to survive.

213
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,520
What? Who?

214
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,590
Throw Wi Byeong Joo under the wagon?

215
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,300
His Majesty and Crown Prince have give us a signal

216
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,660
that if we offer them a scapegoat then they will spare the rest of us.

217
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,320
Still, Deputy Inspector General Wi...

218
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,530
We can't all die together, My Lord!

219
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,590
After all, if we really think about it,

220
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,130
the reason Saheonbu became their target

221
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,700
is because Deputy Inspector General Wi provoked the crown prince.

222
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,380
That is what I am saying!  We can't all die when we are innocent.

223
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,620
Please expose Deputy Inspector General Wi's corruption and save the Saheonbu, My Lord.

224
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,320
After all, Wi Byeong Joo is not even a Noron, but a bat-like Namin.

225
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,320
Namin?

226
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,030
So in the end, they can discard me, originating from Namin, anytime?

227
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,090
No matter how faithful I have been to them...

228
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,540
Lord Deputy Inspector General, what are you doing?

229
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,340
Take all of these outside and burn them.  Hurry up.

230
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,720
Aren't these the files of the cases you were in charge of?  Why?

231
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,840
Why do the likes of you need to know?  Just burn them if I tell you so.

232
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,970
Lord Deputy Inspector General!

233
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,100
Wow, I knew it.

234
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,510
You must have done some really stinky things, so you even have to burn up files.

235
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,000
Aren't you going to put that down now?!

236
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,950
That will be difficult because it's evidence to prove your corruption.

237
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,620
I will deliver the Inspector General's order to you.

238
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,030
From this moment on, I, Inspector Park Moon Soo,

239
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,920
have been ordered to investigate Deputy Inspector General Wi Byeong Joo's corruption.

240
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,800
- What?
 - Take Deputy Inspector General Wi Byeong Joo

241
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,610
to the interrogation room and confiscate all his case files.

242
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,450
Whose person do you dare to touch?

243
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,350
What do you mean whose?  It's the person of a suspect under corruption charges.

244
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,090
Ahey, and how dirty would these be?

245
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,660
It's as if I'm picking up a pile of poo.

246
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,130
I think the higher-ups are

247
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,560
throwing you under the wagon to cut off any ties leading back to them,

248
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,530
but don't worry too much.

249
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,000
You won't go down alone.

250
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,680
I'll tie you all up and send off all of you together.

251
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,040
Let me go!

252
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,960
Joo Yeong Han.

253
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,570
Let me go!  Let me go!

254
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,200
Are you in your right minds?

255
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,430
I am the deputy inspector general of Saheonbu!

256
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,710
Yes.

257
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,950
Keep him under tight surveillance until the investigation is over so that he won't sneak away like a rat.

258
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,890
Yes!

259
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,300
Move aside.

260
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,920
Move aside!

261
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,310
So they are moving as we expected.

262
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,070
Yes. The higher-ups of Saheonbu discarded Wi Byeong Joo before anyone else.

263
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,030
You should've seen him being dragged away, Your Highness.

264
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,620
My insides felt unclogged as if I drank dongchimi broth  (a kind of kimchi with cold zingy broth) .

265
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,260
Deputy Inspector General Wi will, of course, have to pay for his misdeeds.

266
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,790
Still, I feel bittersweet

267
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,550
since the reason he was discarded was probably because he was not of Noron origin.

268
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,720
Do not worry, Your Highness.  It will never end with just Wi Byeong Joo alone.

269
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,290
Please let me deal with Saheonbu.

270
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,840
You must not let down your guard until the end, Moon Soo.

271
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,770
This flow must lead to structural reforms.

272
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,810
Yes, because otherwise, this flow will become a countercurrent any time.

273
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,250
But, Your Highness,

274
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,880
by any chance, has something happened at the palace?

275
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,720
I heard at Son and Mother Pawnshop that they are collecting intelligence from the palace.

276
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,700
What do you mean intelligence from the palace?

277
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,300
Your Highness, how come...

278
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,130
It's nothing special.  Just as a matter of course.

279
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,830
But, Your Highness, according to what I heard—

280
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,300
You worrywart.

281
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,980
To begin with, the palace is the noisiest place on earth.

282
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,980
Wow, this frown.

283
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,990
A sure sign that you are a macho man.

284
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,320
What are you trying to do?

285
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,630
What do you mean what?  I am verifying that you are such a macho man,

286
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,400
that you're my younger brother, our youngest one.

287
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,020
- What?
 - So...

288
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,290
I hope we can just remain pledged brothers like this.

289
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,130
You and me and Hyung-nim as well.

290
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,290
When were we not pledged brothers?  Why all of a sudden?

291
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,000
But what were you thinking so hard about

292
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,530
that you didn't even notice me coming in?

293
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,940
Because I keep worrying... about His Highness.

294
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,610
I am so upset that all I can do is worry about him.

295
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,660
What you said to His Highness earlier, is that about something really serious?

296
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,350
His Highness is currently collecting intelligence from the king's quarters.

297
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,680
- The king's quarters?
 - Through Head Merchant Dal Moon, he is spying on the king.

298
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,830
Why would His Highness do that?  What on earth for?

299
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,800
 His Majesty refused to receive my nightly greeting?

300
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,920
I am sorry, but tonight he has a hint of indigestion and he would not receive you...

301
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,430
He is not feeling well?  That's even more reason why I should see him.

302
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,590
Preparing medicine for His Majesty is the job of the crown prince.

303
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,930
I will do it in your stead, Your Highness.

304
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,810
Your Excellency Right State Councilor.

305
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,610
Since I am the controller general of the king's physician's office,

306
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,910
from now on I and the king's physician will prepare His Majesty's medicine.

307
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,560
Let us go, Royal Physician Jang.

308
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,260
Wait a moment, Right State Councilor.

309
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,160
Is this His Majesty's command?

310
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,560
That is right, Your Highness.

311
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,590
Moreover, you can never stand above

312
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,360
that royal command, Your Highness.

313
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,900
- Let's go.
 - Yes.

314
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,030
Are you saying, in the end, I will have to make this matter known?

315
00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:00,300
You must punish the crime so that treason can never again raise its ugly head.

316
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,490
My brother might get hurt.

317
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,880
He may not know about the regency matter.

318
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,370
Who can guarantee his innocence and how, Your Majesty?

319
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,490
The role of the crown prince is to uphold the king's authority,

320
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,460
not to threaten it.

321
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,420
However, the fact that talks of regency started means that the crown prince

322
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,140
has already become an existence that threatens the king's authority.

323
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,430
"The royal seal is in a precarious position and the people's hearts are scattered."

324
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,430
 Your Highness.

325
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,670
 Look here, stand up already.

326
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:44,660
 You will surely become a great king in the future.

327
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,990
"At such times as these, the crown prince gently strokes the people's hearts"

328
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:54,280
"and shows marvelous ability to govern this nation."

329
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,390
"Please answer the fervent wish of this nation's people."

330
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:07,270
"I believe it is right to permit regency by the crown prince."

331
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,410
 Therefore, what do you think about taking a step back and giving them a chance, Your Majesty?

332
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,820
The atmosphere in the king's quarters is ominous?

333
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,490
Yes, he refused to receive the crown prince's good night greeting.

334
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,250
I see.  You can leave.

335
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,890
Yes.

336
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:41,690
His Majesty and Crown Prince... His Majesty...

337
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,100
and Crown Prince...

338
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,090
Hyung-nim!

339
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,310
The intelligence has arrived from the palace?

340
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,450
Yes, Hyung-nim.  But that is...

341
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,980
What on earth is this?

342
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,260
Hurry and inform the crown prince.

343
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,950
- Now!
 - Yes!

344
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,070
Regency?  Who dared to...

345
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,660
Who submitted this unspeakable petition?

346
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,550
I am sorry, but even Head Merchant Dal Moon does not know that far.

347
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,280
Your Highness.  Your Highness!

348
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,770
What is regency to turn His Highness's face deathly white?

349
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,220
That means to ask the crown prince to govern the nation in place of the king.

350
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,880
This can be viewed as treason.

351
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,080
Treason?  That doesn't make any sense.

352
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,330
It's not even a petition written by His Highness.  It's not what he wants, so how—

353
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,170
No, this is how palace politics works, Court Lady.

354
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,470
Things that are not His Highness's will turn into his will.

355
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,150
What?

356
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,600
Are you saying that this petition was really submitted to the king?

357
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,980
I scribed the petition exactly as it is.

358
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,190
Your Excellency Left State Councilor!
