1
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,940
Over here.

2
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,430
You didn't do anything suspicious, did you?

3
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,060
Of course not.

4
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,500
I was at the gisaeng house on purpose, all day before coming here.

5
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,930
What about the key to the armory?

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,990
Thanks. You know how horribly we've been treated as Namin.

7
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,570
If this plan succeeds, your position will be made in the central government, too.

8
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,550
Wi Byeong Joo, indeed you are...

9
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,430
You came right back. I was expecting you tomorrow.

10
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,930
The situation in the capital isn't good. Soâ€”

11
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,510
I heard the king has beaten the plague.

12
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,420
Ah, I heard your minions talking.

13
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,330
You need to control them.

14
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,860
The guys are uptight because they think the plan might not work.

15
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,130
It's nothing to worry about.

16
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,670
The guys are nervous before the mission.

17
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,950
Watch them carefully so they don't waver.

18
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,090
Yes, General.

19
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,960
Keep up with your impudence.

20
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,920
The one who needs me... is you after all.

21
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,080
Crazy bastards.

22
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,940
What's all this?

23
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,320
Check the capital's situation again.

24
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,690
Yes, General.

25
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,390
What is this?

26
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,540
This is the key to the armory at the Cheongju Government Office.

27
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,310
He's a hoobae  (junior)  from the same hometown, so it was easy to get him onboard.

28
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,490
Since we are both Namin, like us, he has a deep resentment for the government.

29
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,730
It was worthwhile to get you out.

30
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,410
I didn't know you would become useful like this.

31
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,560
However, I heard that the plan at the capital didn't go so well.

32
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,520
Why? Are you worried that the rebellion will fail?

33
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,800
Then why don't you leave now before it's too late?

34
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,650
No. Of course not.

35
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,470
Do you know how long we've been preparing for this?

36
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,130
We won't ever fail.

37
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,670
This mountain stronghold isn't the only one. Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Pyongan.

38
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,550
Once the rebellion starts,

39
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,790
fallen noblemen and subjects who are tired of being exploited

40
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,510
will all rise together.

41
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,810
Do you think that's the end? The capital and even inside the palace.

42
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,610
There isn't a place without our allies.

43
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,280
What is this?

44
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,450
Hey there. Is anyone here?

45
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,700
Damn it.

46
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,950
I said is anyone here?!

47
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,940
What is this sound?

48
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,400
General, outside right now...

49
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,610
What is going on?

50
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,280
You're doing a great job.

51
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,640
You say you're preparing a rebellion, yet you don't even know that a mouse has been poking around.

52
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,910
What have you been doing?!

53
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,300
What are you doing?

54
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,070
Find out who it is right away.

55
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,130
Yes, General.

56
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,170
He can't have gone far. Search the surrounding area thoroughly.

57
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,520
Yes!

58
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,280
- What are you doing? Hurry! 
- Yes!

59
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,620
I'll be borrowing your horse.

60
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,860
Oh, no!

61
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,710
Hey!

62
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,960
If someone saw this mountain stronghold,

63
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,000
the rebellion plans have been discovered, no?

64
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,390
- General!
 - Have you found him?

65
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,690
I apologize. It seems that we've lost him.

66
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,360
- If the person who disappeared heard any informationâ€” 
- Stop.

67
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,140
I'm the one who will do the thinking.

68
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,090
- The rebellion plans are going to change.
 - Okay.

69
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,610
Send my command to everyone right away. The rebellion will start sooner.

70
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,740
Firstly, tonight we will execute what we have been planning at the capital.

71
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,170
Yes, General.

72
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,400
Chief Royal Secretary, are you there?

73
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,800
Tell all of the Border Defense Council members to come by 3 PM.

74
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,790
Dal Moon! Dal Moon!

75
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,990
Is anyone inside? Dal Moon!

76
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,490
Lord Moon Soo, how are you here?

77
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,020
Is Dal Moon inside? I have something urgent for him.

78
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,810
Are you saying the rebels have infiltrated the capital and the palace?

79
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,880
The current police commissioner is one of them.

80
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
I saw and heard it myself at Cheongju.

81
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,360
We have to send word about the rebels' mountain stronghold

82
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
and their plans to His Majesty immediately.

83
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,520
Is anyone out there?

84
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,710
Ask the Left and Right State Councilors to come immediately!

85
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,900
Rebel armies?

86
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,900
Is that really true, Your Majesty?

87
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,040
Lee In Jwa from a fallen Namin noble family in the region of Cheongju.

88
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,710
None other than he enabled Wi Byeong Joo and Prince Milpoong to escape their places of exile.

89
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,040
And with Cheongju as his base, he is attempting a rebellion right now.

90
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,590
Moreover, there is intelligence that his spies have infiltrated even the palace and capital.

91
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,760
Spies inside the palace?  How is that possible?

92
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,090
That is why I have asked you two here.

93
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:28,160
I have a confidential favor to ask in order to expose them.

94
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,120
 Here comes His Majesty!

95
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,180
But aren't they Lee Gwang Jwa and Jo Hyeon Myeong?

96
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,070
Everyone, be seated.

97
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,970
There is an urgent piece of intelligence so I need to discuss it with you.

98
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,040
These are the newly appointed Minister of Defense, Lee Gwang Jwa,

99
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,490
and Commander of the Five Supreme Military Headquarters, Jo Hyeon Myeong.

100
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,230
Those two are the minister of defense and commander of the supreme military headquarters?

101
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,710
But, Your Excellency, what is going on?

102
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,850
Did you know about this, Right State Councilor?

103
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,400
I don't know.

104
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,610
I just don't know what's going on.

105
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,750
Your Excellency, is it true that there are signs of treason?

106
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,490
It is still just a possibility,

107
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,820
but His Majesty seems to consider this plague episode the doing of traitors.

108
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,990
How disconcerting!

109
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,790
Anything else?  Are there other signs of the treason?  Do you have any information?

110
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,760
If there were, would I stay quiet?

111
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,370
So far, that's all I know.

112
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:59,940
Because of that, His Majesty called back his closest aides, Lee Gwang Jwa and Jo Hyeon Myeong, out of insecurity.

113
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,630
The king is getting close to the truth of the mysterious disease.

114
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,890
Fortunately, that is all he knows.

115
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,100
But he is also suspecting treason.

116
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,370
Speaking of which, a message from the mountain stronghold has just arrived.

117
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,070
Because of a small problem, the plan in regards to the capital has changed.

118
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,030
What?

119
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,910
You have not gone home yet, Police Commissioner?

120
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,950
I ran into the Royal Messenger of the Ministry of Defense,

121
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,780
so I was briefly discussing the worries over this situation.

122
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,360
You are working hard.

123
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,490
At times like these, your responsibility becomes even heavier.

124
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,070
Please do your best.

125
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,060
I will keep that in mind, Your Excellency.

126
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,470
Yes, Your Excellency.

127
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,890
Go on with your work.

128
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,930
Your Excellency.

129
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,460
Everyone, hurry!  We will evacuate the mountain stronghold now!

130
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,910
Yes!

131
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,760
Hurry, hurry, pack this up.

132
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,890
Have you delivered my commands to Gyeongsang, Jeolla, and Pyongan?

133
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,410
Yes, even the ones for the capital must have arrived by now.

134
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,450
- Check one more time. 
- Yes.

135
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,470
We have to finish off the king in the capital before deploying the armies.

136
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,930
- Your Majesty.
 - How is our plan progressing?

137
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,560
We are getting ready as you have commanded.

138
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,460
The Ministry of Defense and Five Supreme Military Headquarters will do all they can do.

139
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,600
However, there might be danger even from inside those organizations.

140
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,020
- Pay particular attention to security.
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,940
Spies from the rebellious band have infiltrated even the palace.

142
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,980
How could this happen?

143
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,940
We must discover them all and catch them at all cost.

144
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,650
Just in case, make some soldiers tail the Deputy Ministers of Works and of Defense.

145
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,590
Excuse me?

146
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,520
Tell Lee Gwang Jwa, the newly appointed Minister of Defense,

147
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,740
that right after the Border Defense Council meeting, Police Commissioner Nam Gyeong Jin

148
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,550
secretly contacted Ministry of Defense Royal Messenger Lee Sa Cheol.

149
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,870
Yes, Your Excellency.

150
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,210
- My Lord.
 - Are you ready?

151
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,560
Yes, we can roll out right now.

152
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,060
- Let's go!
 - Yes.

153
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,010
Did a big case break out?  Why are you armed?

154
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,650
Hey, Ah Bong!  Why is the lead inspector acting like that?

155
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,740
- Aish, when I'm so preoccupied!
 - Aish?!

156
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,200
You are getting in the way... sir.

157
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,800
G-Getting in the way... sir?

158
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,270
Hey!  You guys tend not to take me seriously lately.

159
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,000
I guess you guys are all busy.

160
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,170
- Inspector Park. 
- My Lord.

161
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,700
How long has it been, My Lord?

162
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,560
What do you mean treason and espionage in the capital?

163
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,230
There is no time to elaborate.  Let's go for now.  We have to hurry.

164
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,840
Inspector Park, you must need this.

165
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,320
Get in line.  Everyone, check your weapons.

166
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,560
Is something up, Commandant of the Royal Guards?

167
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,500
There's intelligence about treason.  Spies are hiding in the palace.

168
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,940
What?  Spies?

169
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,360
You have to be extra vigilant to maintain palace security.

170
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,270
I am going to guard His Majesty.

171
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,300
Yes!  I will take my soldiers and guard the east part of the king's palace.

172
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,120
- Let's go!
 - Yes!

173
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,980
Assemble all the police force right away.

174
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,550
Tonight, they must invade the palace and behead the king.

175
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,670
Yes, Lord.

176
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,740
- What is going on?
 - Huh?

177
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,690
The movements of the royal guards seem unusual today.

178
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,290
What would we, palace maids, do with that knowledge anyway?  Let's go.

179
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,290
- Why are you guys still here?
 - Pardon?

180
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,030
Haven't you received the order?

181
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,210
There is suspicious activity around Gwangheui Gate, so go there immediately!

182
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,310
- Howeverâ€”
 - What are you waiting for?!

183
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,640
Just two remain here and the rest, move out!

184
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,440
I will take charge of guarding the king's palace.

185
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,350
Yes!

186
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,600
However, Lord, the commandant of royal guards told me not to, even for a secondâ€”

187
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,940
Lord!

188
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,200
Lord Police Commissioner!

189
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,800
Lord, we are in big trouble.

190
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,950
- The king seems to know about our involvement.
 - What?

191
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,700
Lee Je Moon, a Royal Guard lieutenant, sent word.  We must come up with a way to deal with this quickly!

192
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,880
 What are you doing?  Where do you think you are?

193
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,130

194
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,970
You will go head to head against the elite soldiers of the Ministry of Defense

195
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,000
with mere underlings of the Police Bureau?

196
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,500
Anyone who resists will be struck down without mercy.

197
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,680
Arrest Police Commissioner Nam Gyeong Jin and Ministry of Defense Royal Messenger Lee Sa Cheol.

198
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,880
Yes!

199
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,020
For now, we must escape and join the main force.

200
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,980
Main force my butt.

201
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,920
You are all finished.

202
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,980
It'll be better if you lay down that sword.

203
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,600
The front yard of the police station is already surrounded by the soldiers of the Ministry of Defense.

204
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,000
Strike!

205
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,730
Stop right there!

206
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,470
Who are you, wench?

207
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,330
Let her go right now!

208
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,860
Don't you hear me?  Now!

209
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,950
Your Majesty.

210
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,260
Your Majesty!

211
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,760
Are you alright, Yeo Ji?

212
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,390
Yes.  And you, Your Majesty?

213
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,690
Your humble servant, Minister of Defense Lee Gwang Jwa

214
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,510
and Inspectors Yoon Hyeok and Park Moon Soo

215
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,930
have received your royal command and arrested the traitorous bunch.

216
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,410
Your Majesty.

217
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,800
- Right State Councilor!
 - Yes, how did it go?

218
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,940
Both Deputy Ministers of Works and Defense who had joined the rebellion were apprehended.

219
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,560
They are branches of the same Soron Faction.

220
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,790
To cut them out must have been a difficult decision, Ha Gok  (Jo Tae Goo's pen name) .

221
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,790
Rotten branches will kill the tree.

222
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:06,330
What we must safeguard are not the little branches, but a big tree called Joseon.

223
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,550
How big is the rebellious force led by Lee In Jwa?

224
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,350
I could not ascertain the exact number, but roughly they seemed more than several thousand.

225
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,740
Several thousand rebels?

226
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,060
More importantly, they are not all.

227
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,100
From Gyeongsang, Jeolla, and Pyongan Provinces, too,

228
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,170
they were going to rise up simultaneously.

229
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,460
As soon as I got your message,

230
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,640
Commander of Supreme Military Headquarters Jo Hyeon Myeong headed to Cheongju with the elite troops.

231
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,640
If they were caught unawares, soonâ€”

232
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,930
 Your Majesty!

233
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,150
Your Majesty!

234
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,740
Find out the detailed status now!

235
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,650
Yes.

236
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,030
- Minister of Defense!
 - Your Majesty.

237
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,720
The situation got worse.

238
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,780
Commander of the Supreme Military Headquarters seems to have gotten there one step behind them.

239
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,300
This is...  This!

240
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,390
The Cheongju fortress has been seized.

241
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,230
It fell into the hands of the rebels in the end.

242
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,190
Your Majesty!

243
00:25:52,020 --> 00:26:01,920

244
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,160

245
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,370
Lee In Jwa, in the end, he had to...

246
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,710
To this nation!

247
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,040
â™«  Since we met saying hello  â™«

248
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:46,060
â™«  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  â™«

249
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,230
â™«  Now the gentle and gentler wind hurts too  â™«
