1
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,540
Whoa.

2
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,120
The government soldiers must have headed to Jiksan after all.

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,820
I can't see even a mouse stirring around the Anseong Fortress.

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,140
Then what are we diddling around for?  We have to seize Anseong right away and proceed to the capital.

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,390
Everyone, seize Anseong!

6
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,010
- Attack!
 - Attack!

7
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,140
But why is it so quiet?

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,080
Isn't it about time that they are here?

9
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,200
My Lord, it can't be...

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,120
No, they will come.

11
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,270
The bastards will definitely come through here.

12
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:22,280

13
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,700
Wait a second.

15
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,250
Isn't that the horse one of our scouts rode?

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,780
You are acting like this because of that one horse?

17
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,500
We will resume our march, now!

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,190
Wait!

19
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,040
Look here, General, this is a royal command.

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,220

21
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,530
I said wait.

22
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,510
It's an ambush!

23
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,940
Don't run away but fight!  Fight, I said!

24
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,630
Rearrange your lines and move forward!

25
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,560
Hey!

26
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,260
The head of the traitorous bunch, Lee In Jwa!

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,670
Park Moon Soo.

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,750
That son of a bi*ch is...

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,570
You are all dead today.

30
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,760
- Everyone, charge!
 - Charge!

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,250
Charge!

32
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,610
We didn't plan for this fight.  Your Majesty, it'll be better if you take cover...

33
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,310
If we get pushed back here, we'll all die anyway.

34
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,210
Do you get it now?  One false movement and you are a goner.

35
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,940
Wi Byeong Joo!

36
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,420
- Wi Byeong Joo, you— 
 - Park Moon Soo.

37
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,980
Our long tiring relationship comes to an end now.

38
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,040
Dal Moon!

39
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,290
The enemies are getting dispirited.  Push them back harder!

40
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,080
General, we are at a disadvantage right now.

41
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,820
We'll retreat for now and rearrange the troops.

42
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,490
No, what do you mean retreat?  Fight!  I said, fight on.

43
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,810
I have to go and behead that bastard Lee Geum!

44
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,940
Retreat!

45
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,880
Everyone, retreat!

46
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,100
Don't let even one escape!  Catch them!

47
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,580
Fall back, fall back...

48
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,350
General!

49
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,560
How can this be?!  They even thought about our retreat route.

50
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,820
It's over... just like this?

51
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,190
With the throne just before my eyes...

52
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,480
They are the traitorous armies.  Capture Prince Milpoong and their head Lee In Jwa alive.

53
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,540
It's okay to kill anyone who puts up a fight.

54
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,830
Attack!

55
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,000
General, our retreat path is...

56
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Everyone scatter around and meet up at the gathering point.

57
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,890
- Scatter!
 - Everyone, scatter around!

58
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,820
Come to your senses!  We must leave now!

59
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,560
I am the king.  The subjects called me "Your Majesty"!

60
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,610
Listen up!

61
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,790
Pursue Lee In Jwa and Prince Milpoong.  They must be captured!

62
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,460
Yes.

63
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,910
- Lord Moon Soo!
 - Lord Moon Soo.

64
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,480
Lord.

65
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,100
Victory!

66
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,550
Victory!

67
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,830

68
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,410
Your Majesty, it is a report from the battlefields.

69
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,180
It's news of victory.

70
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,620
The government soldiers have demolished the rebel forces at the battle of Anseong.

71
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,030
Your Majesty, congratulations!

72
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,350
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

73
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,540
All this is due to your royal grace.

74
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,720
Thanks to your royal grace.

75
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,890
That is undeserved!  This is thanks to everyone's efforts.

76
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,150
This court came together as one so we could overcome this calamity.

77
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,730
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

78
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,970
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

79
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,590
Left State Councilor!

80
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,440
You have achieved a big feat, Your Majesty.

81
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,220
 Left State Councilor.

82
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,040
 Why don't you summon the Namin inside the capital, Your Majesty?

83
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,930
 What you said about how that is the only way

84
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,040
 to overcome this rebellion and also to prevent any future one

85
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,580
 is correct.

86
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,770
 Is that really true, Your Majesty?

87
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,460
 Are you saying we Namins will be truly guaranteed opportunities in the government?

88
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,160
 You, too, must know who I am.

89
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,710
 Will you be satisfied if I promise you Noron's cooperation?

90
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,960
 Impartial hiring of the talented regardless of the political affiliations.

91
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,040
 Once again, I promise you that.

92
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,490
 What do you say?  Can you support this court?

93
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,750
 I am extremely sorry to say this, but, Your Majesty,

94
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,870
 I have something to inform you about.

95
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:28,140
 There may be spies of the rebel armies still inside the government military.

96
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,330
 What?  Who is that?

97
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,930
 What is the current status regarding the defense of the capital?

98
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,980
 The Five Military Garrisons led by the Governor's Military Aides were placed at main gates.

99
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,020
 According to the latest report from the district governor,

100
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,300
 our military will form the final line of defense at Jiksan.

101
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,860
 Wait.  Did you just say Jiksan?

102
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,080
 Is something wrong, Your Majesty?

103
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,280
 Send a herald to the District Governor as soon as possible!

104
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,110
 If there is a spy within the government military,

105
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,510
 that means all our information is at risk of exposure.

106
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,430
 Then, how about doing it this way, Your Excellency?

107
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,450
 Why don't we make them lower their guard and lure them out?

108
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,520
 Yes, it is Jiksan.

109
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,050
 They will definitely use the wide road from Cheongan to Jiksan

110
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,730
 because that will afford the easiest access to the capital.

111
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,860
 Jiksan...

112
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,350
 Jiksan, you say...

113
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,580
 Everyone will lie here waiting to ambush the enemies.

114
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,730
 The bastards will definitely come through here, Anseong.

115
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,900
 Everyone, hide and wait.

116
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,570
 What are you doing? The district governor ordered us to go to Jiksan. So why...

117
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,010
 Why? Are you scared witless?

118
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,700
 Afraid that your side will come through Anseong?

119
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,290
 Excuse me?

120
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,650
 Your life will be dealt with under martial law after this is over.

121
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,700
 - Drag him away!
 - Yes.

122
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,550
 Unhand me! It's not me! I am not one of them!

123
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,790
 The bastards will definitely come through here.

124
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,190
Thank you.

125
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:47,760
All this was thanks to your decision, Left State Councilor.

126
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,860
No, this country Joseon is graced with a great king.

127
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,040
District Governor!

128
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,870
District Governor!

129
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,570
It's a landslide victory!  The rebel forces were mostly routed.

130
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,600
What happened to the head of the rebels, Lee In Jwa, and Prince Milpoong?

131
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,600
They escaped, but they couldn't have gone far.

132
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,170
Don't you think this one knows

133
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,480
where Lee In Jwa and Prince Milpoong are?

134
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,190
Lee In Jwa and Prince Milpoong escaped?

135
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,100
However, Wi Byeong Joo was captured alive,

136
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,540
so we will be able to find out their next rendezvous point.

137
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,410
What are the situations in Gyeongsang and Jeolla Provinces?

138
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,610

139
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,870
No one, back down!  We must recapture the fortress at all cost!

140
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,440
Don't back down!  Stop the government soldiers!

141
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,830
There are too many casualties among the government armies.

142
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,490
You should order a retreat.

143
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,020
We've gotten this far after three days and nights of fighting.

144
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,180
Like this... we can't retreat like this.

145
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,620
But we've lost too many soldiers!

146
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,900
Any more will be too much to bear!

147
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,490
Over there!  Look over there!  Soldiers are coming!

148
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,890
Soldiers are flooding in, General.

149
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,460
Finally, General Lee In Jwa must have sent us reinforcements.

150
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,760
G-General...

151
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,080
Which side are they for?

152
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,270
Commander, they are government soldiers!

153
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,830
Backup forces!

154
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,580
They are the reinforcements for the government armies.  What do we do?

155
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,930
How can this be!  What happened?!

156
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,710
How about Lee In Jwa and His Majesty?

157
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:13,430
Why aren't our reinforcements here yet?

158
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,290
We are a bit late because of a traffic jam.

159
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,810
You'll put turtles to shame.

160
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,520
But thanks all the same for coming like this.

161
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,720
All the bases of the rebel armies have been subdued.

162
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,420
The only ones remaining now are the dregs inside that fortress.

163
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,360
Have you all heard?  Let us go!

164
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,550
Let's wipe out all the remaining rebel dregs to the last one!

165
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,620
Charge!

166
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,700
Charge!

167
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,240
The fortress gate has been breached.  Let's go, Ah Bong.

168
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,910
Yes.

169
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,700
Let's survive this no matter what.

170
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,310
Why is he like that?  As if he's going to die soon?

171
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,090
We won!

172
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,250
All the rebels in Jeolla have surrendered.

173
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,860
Their morale suffered when they found out how the main rebel forces got beaten.

174
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,650
Immediately dispatch a messenger and inform the court of this news.

175
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,050
How about Gyeongsang Province?  How is it going over there?

176
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,450
Inform His Majesty of this joyful news,

177
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,570
that we have regained Gyeongsang Province!

178
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,070
Uncle.

179
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,210
Uncle Jang Dal!

180
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,100
Uncle Jang Dal.

181
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,890
After saying let's survive this no matter what...

182
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,020
I am here, Ah Bong.  I am here.

183
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,520
Uncle!  Uncle!

184
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,250
You are alive!

185
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,890
We said we'd see each other again, punk.

186
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:13,280
I told you. I told you we would meet again alive.

187
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,920
I told you so...

188
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,910
Why are you crying?

189
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,820
We won.  We won!

190
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,530
We won.  We won!

191
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,660
We won!

192
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,000
Wow, you were a pretty sharp shooter.

193
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,770
You were a pretty good archer.

194
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,940
You worked hard.

195
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,860
Right before they reached the capital, they all got wiped out.

196
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,970
His Majesty won over the Namin at the last minute and gained information from them.

197
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,210
I really thought there'd be no other way but to die.

198
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,470
Me too.

199
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,860
Such flippant things.

200
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,240
When was it when they wore the expressions of the ones who'd die soon?

201
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,720
But Palace Maid Cheon is nowhere to be found.

202
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,650

203
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,770
I sent her to the one who needs her.

204
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,520
Pardon?

205
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,650
What are you doing not tying the shoulder pieces?

206
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,410
Oh, well, that is...

207
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,080
 Your Majesty, Palace Maid Cheon has arrived.

208
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,900
Please, please show her in now.

209
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,520
Ja Dong, what is going on?

210
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,600
Why is Yeo Ji...

211
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,880
Palace Maid Cheon will finish this up for you.

212
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,010
Dull me will show myself out.

213
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,850
Me, too, after successfully accomplishing my mission.

214
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,380
Ja Dong?

215
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,790
Court Lady Ha!

216
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,450
The two of them did a useless thing...

217
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,600
when you must be busy at the queen dowager's palace.

218
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,510
The shoulder pieces are put on like this here, right?

219
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,470
How did you learn about things like these?

220
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,220
Before entering the palace, I have learned everything about the king's accouterments and regalia

221
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,520
so that I can serve you anytime.

222
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,470
Next come the protective arm pieces, right?

223
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,070
I will finish the job til the end.

224
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,110
Since I have fully familiarized myself with them,

225
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,300
I have the confidence not to stop in the middle like you.

226
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,120
What?

227
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,260
When you used to live outside the palace, didn't you do that a few times?

228
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,360
You stopped in the middle of tying my hat ribbons,

229
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,590
and you stopped in the middle of applying medicine to my arm.

230
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,150
Was it because you didn't know how to do them well?

231
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,060
No, Yeo Ji, that was not because I didn't know but—

232
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,030
Turn around.  I have to tie the side pieces.

233
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,890
Oh, okay, I got, I got it.

234
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,640
I am not done tying up, Your Majesty.

235
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,740
Inspector Park.  Inspector Park!

236
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,600
Lord.

237
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,040
You came back safe and sound.

238
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,810
I've heard all about your prowess.

239
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,420
I trust nothing bad happened in the capital while I was away?

240
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,030
That goes without saying.

241
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,120
You've had a real tough time.

242
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,530
- Now, let's go.
 - Yes.

243
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,290
Hey, Punk! Ah Bong! Jang Dal!

244
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,670
Egad, there's Inspector Joo.

245
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,060
You were alive!

246
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,990
Attachment can be created out of a love-hate relationship, too.

247
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,160
Seeing you two all right makes me tear up.

248
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,430
Why are you really acting like this all of a sudden, as if we are close?

249
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,240
No, this feeling was an affection after all.

250
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,250
I must have liked you in my heart.

251
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,740
 Here comes His Majesty!

252
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,910
Your Majesty!

253
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,650
I report to you.

254
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,030
Your humble subjects District Governor Lee Gwang Jwa and your soldiers

255
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,130
have demolished the traitorous armies

256
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,990
and present to Your Majesty, our sovereign, news of triumph.

257
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,890
We won!

258
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,550
We won!

259
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,440
Thank you for returning safely.

260
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,420
"Return alive no matter what" was your solemn order to us.

261
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,290
Your Majesty.

262
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,830
Your Majesty!

263
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,670
Your Majesty.

264
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,470
Your Majesty.

265
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,700
Your Majesty.

266
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,070
Your Majesty.

267
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,130
Your Majesty.

268
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,780
This nation's soldiers and people, listen.

269
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:37,670
You have safeguarded this country and court with your lives on the line.

270
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,250
How afraid you must have been.

271
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,260
How painful it must have been.

272
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,280
I, the king, shall never forget

273
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:58,550
the blood and sweat you have shed.

274
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:06,700
I shall never forget the precious lives sacrificed

275
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,000
by those who fell in the battlefields.

276
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,670
Today's triumph over the routed rebels

277
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,760
will now become Joseon's triumph.

278
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,110
Trust in your king.

279
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:43,750
From now on, I shall, together with the ministers

280
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,490
and all the people of this nation,

281
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:54,870
build a truly

282
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,110
new Joseon.

283
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,600
Long live the king!
