1
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,500
 Return, Your Majesty!

2
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:46,300

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,680

4
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,160
 I also know

5
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,320
 that I can't do it.

6
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,440
 This position is not mine.

7
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,030
 Why are you living like that?

8
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,660
 Why can't you amount to more than this?

9
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,740
 I'm dying soon, Prince Yeoning.

10
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,920
 No. No, Hwon.

11
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,110
 Do you even remember?

12
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,440
 Older Brother, it's you. This nation's...

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,500
 Why didn't you at least dream of becoming the king?

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,970
 Why didn't I at least dream about it?

15
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,530
 If you became the king, even if just a little bit of it,

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,520
 you might have gotten something called power.

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,290
 Even if just a little bit of it, I might have gotten something called power.

18
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,030
 Something called power...

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,100
 You also have nowhere to go.

20
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,160
 Of all people, only you and I remain.

21
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,410
 In this tumultuous palace,

22
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,320
 our father and Hwon have left,

23
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,510
 and of all people, just we two...

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,830
 Do away with your tears.

25
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,160
 I am the sinner but why are you being punished?

26
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,700
 This may be the case.

27
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,330
 Perhaps Your Highness and I are not the survivors.

28
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,960
 But they may just have let us live

29
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,850
 so that we can punish the real sinners.

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,460
 What do you think about that?

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,730
 Of all people, Your Highness and I, such as we are,

32
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,430
 what if we can turn this world upside down?

33
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,950
You really achieved it. You did.

34
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,950
As I promised you, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:07,860
Now the Norons will be shaken and will begin to split.

37
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,040
Cracked pottery...

38
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,210
For the reason, it will break even more easily.

39
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,290
Is it now my turn?

40
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,480
Sirrah!  Won't you move aside this minute?

41
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,780
The ones who should move aside are

42
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,210
the high officials trying to put pressure on Saheonbu.

43
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,160
Hear all!  Jeong Jae Ho, Secretary of the Interior,

44
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
Choi Hyeong Jeon, Deputy Chief Scholar of the Office of Special Advisors,

45
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,880
Jang Tae Seong, Minister of Taxation,

46
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,740
Lim Seung Yong, Second Deputy Director of the Bureau of Royal Decrees.

47
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,270
Arrest these men right this moment and drag them off to the interrogation rooms!

48
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,990
Yes!

49
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,980
Unhand me!  These rascals!

50
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,790
- Minister of the Interior!
 - Inspector General!

51
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,770
- Let me go!
 - Your Excellency!

52
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,740

53
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,380
Is this a real declaration of war?

54
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,470
Don't you know who I am?

55
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,230
What on earth are you doing right in your post?

56
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,070
- I will try to rein in Saheonbu somehow. 
- Shut up!

57
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,730
The last time you were flustered.  Today you're fuming.

58
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,670
I happen to catch these sides of you often nowadays.

59
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,080
How amusing.

60
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,070
Prince Yeoning!

61
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:31,230
After all, civil exam wrongdoings involving high Noron officials and scions of their families.  How scandalous!

62
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,760
What a big blow this will be to Noron.

63
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,410
Can you possibly be the one behind all this?

64
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,430
Once you said to me

65
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,660
that you must plant fear in your opponent's heart to win.

66
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,490
How do you feel?  Are you a little... fearful now?

67
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,630
Conscience without power is just weak.

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,470
Just as you advised me,

69
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,700
I intend to gain that power now.

70
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,300

71
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,820
 Since you disrespected the king's procession through a clamorous protest,

72
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,040
you will be dealt a sentence of paddling according to the law.

73
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,590
Do you have any objection?

74
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,970
No.

75
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,740
Execute the sentence of 30 strokes.  Give him stern beatings!

76
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,830
Yes!

77
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,270
Stroke one.

78
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,820
Stroke two.

79
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,960
Stroke three.

80
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,580
- Lord!  Lord Moon Soo! 
- Lord!

81
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,260
I told you to get lost this minute!  Where do you think you're  raising a ruckus?!

82
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,150
We are saying we'll take some of the beatings on his behalf!  Please!

83
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,060
- Yes, beat me instead. Thirty strokes will kill a man.
 - These rascals, you still...

84
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,340
What is this wench?  Won't you let go?

85
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,790
Don't "wench" me.  I, too, am this country's subject who knows the law.

86
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,000
Even the great kings Myeongjong and Hyeonjong said the clamorous beseechers should not be punished too severely.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,650
Isn't that because the monarchs also know that it is not a serious crime?

88
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,800
Right, well said.  That's why without the royal command,

89
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,770
we'll never let him go unpunished.

90
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:34,030
So... are you saying all you need is a royal command?

91
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,450
Release Student Park Moon Soo right this moment!

92
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,770
I am asking for his person.

93
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,080

94
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,400

95
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,880
Easy, Lord.

96
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,190
Walk slowly.

97
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,140
He's coming over there.

98
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,130
Hyung-nim.

99
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,300
Are you alright, Moon Soo?

100
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,440
This time, you came.

101
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,980
If you were going to come anyway, you should've come sooner.

102
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,960
In that time, I already took ten beatings.

103
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,750
My pretty ass is all torn up.

104
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,570
I will say...

105
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,800
That was the only tolerable part of your body.

106
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,260
I wronged you big time.

107
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,930
That stings!

108
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,760
He saved you when you were almost beaten to death.

109
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,330
Instead of thanking him, how dare you speak to him like that?!

110
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,380
What are you doing?

111
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,600
I apologize in his place, Your Highness.

112
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,320
Lord Moon Soo is childishly singing about his butt in the middle of this hardship.

113
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,810
But, Yeo Ji, that's not it.  I was pulling his leg...

114
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,220
Hey, Cheon Yeo Ji, that's not it.

115
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,050
- The bottom line of what I was saying was not my butt, but...
- But your bottom line was the butt.

116
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,100
- The bottom line was not the butt.
 - It was.

117
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,130
I'm going crazy here.  No, it wasn't!

118
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,490
Arguing over butts...

119
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,630
Yes, it's you guys.

120
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,870
Like this, I am again

121
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,120
able to stand before you guys.

122
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,610
So you found the evidence of civil exam corruption, Your Highness?

123
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,800
Doesn't the civil exam give you, in one glance, the whole picture of what sad shape this country is in right now?

124
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,420
When you were merely thinking of your own ass,

125
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,590
His Highness dug through the matter by himself.

126
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,310
Hey!  I told you the bottom line was not my butt.

127
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,380
It started because of you, Moon Soo.

128
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,130
I was trying to find a way to help you in your preparation for the civil service exam.

129
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,220
 What do you mean you can't even dream of passing the exam with passable skills?

130
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,750
 Because all sorts of illegalities are rampant.

131
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,400
 Get out of my way!

132
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,100
 Substitute exam taking and seat grabbing do not even count as wrongful acts nowadays.

133
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,430
 Sneaking in books, exchanging answer sheets,

134
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,940
 and hiding cheat sheets up in one's nostrils are all carried out by poor noblemen.

135
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,660
 Do you know what this is?

136
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,150
 A tunnel has been dug up to connect with inside the walls

137
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,100
 so the answer can be attached here and piped all the way to the exam grounds.

138
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,720
 How innovative! Truly groundbreaking!

139
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,980
 But even this is an inferior move.

140
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,120
 Because if you know the exam question ahead of the time, you are all set.

141
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,360
 Are you, by any chance, saying someone is leaking the exam question before the exam date?

142
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,310
 What can't the powerful do?

143
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,320
 Do you think question leaking is all?

144
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,010
 There are even talks of the exam graders

145
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,190
 switching the names of testers on the well-written answer sheets and fudging the results.

146
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,260
 The talks were mostly true... no, more than that.

147
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,210
 The second counselor of the Office of Special Advisors leaked the exam questions to the scions of Noron families.

148
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,250
 He didn't hesitate to take bribes and switch the names on answer sheets.

149
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,990
 Moreover, civil service exams afforded Noron opportunities to take kickbacks.

150
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,610
 They were even making a big profit by stealing the paper used for answer sheets.

151
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,340
 As you instructed, I have found the paper used for civil exam answer sheets.

152
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,980
 I also secured the evidence. I will send it to Saheonbu by 9 AM.

153
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,180
So that's why I kept failing the exams!  When I should've passed a long time ago!

154
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,760
They deserve to be skinned alive and fried to death!

155
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,610
How can they be this rotten?

156
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,170
This country's civil service exam has been clearly showing, all along, how rotten this country is.

157
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:28,620
How the power-hogging Norons corrupted the civil service exam that ought to have remained the fairest system.

158
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,370
Those things...

159
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,080
started while you were trying to help me.

160
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,710
Ah, not knowing how it was...

161
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,670
I've been mean to you for a long time, Hyung-nim.

162
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,810
Nonsense.

163
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,740
The one who made you that way

164
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,410
was me.

165
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,970
Anyhow, because of this, we got together again,

166
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,640
and we even caught the rotten corruption of Noron.

167
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,380
We should get a drink on a day like this.

168
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,070
No, I still have business to take care and I must be on my way.

169
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,730
What business?

170
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,070
Business that you don't need to concern yourselves in.

171
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,660
No,

172
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,070
perhaps business that you ought not to know about.

173
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,450
Hyung-nim, how can you say such a heartbreaking thing?

174
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,310
I must go now.

175
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,170
As for catching up, let's do it later

176
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,660
when an even better time comes.

177
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,130
What was he saying?  Business we ought not to know about?

178
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,350
What is going on in Saheonbu right now?  What is Min Jin Heon up to?

179
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:11,080
I am looking into it.  But are you really going to finish this business all alone?

180
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,540
Please ask for help.

181
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,700
Min Jin Heon will never let you be in peace.

182
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,480
That is why I must do it alone.

183
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,480
I cannot put Moon Soo and Yeo Ji

184
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,750
in danger again for my sake.

185
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,400
I got it.

186
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,150
Good job.

187
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,730
Summon all the related parties and make sure all the preparations for the interrogations are complete.

188
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,640
Yes.

189
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,220
Inspector Yoon,

190
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,910
immediately transfer this matter to the Daejangcheong  (office of higher ups of Saheonbu) .

191
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,960
You must know that's impossible.

192
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,450
Are you saying you will disobey?

193
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,380
I am saying I will handle it according to the Saheonbu rules.

194
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,090
As a matter of principle, matters related to civil exam corruption are investigated by inspectors, aren't they?

195
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,520
As I'm busy, I'll take leave of you, then.

196
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,440
In the past, too, there was an inspector just like you.

197
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:25,500
A foolish one who forgot his basic duties and rushed into fire.

198
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,120
Do you know what his end was like?

199
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,690
How miserable that end was.

200
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,480
I haven't asked nor am I curious.  Do I have to keep listening?

201
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,780
As I'm busy.

202
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,710
I thought it reeked of inexperience.

203
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,500
And it turns out Prince Yeoning was behind it after all.

204
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,620
It's not definite.

205
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,680
Concluding so just from the way he looked into the civil exam corruption—

206
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,850
No, it must be him.

207
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,460
He must have planned entering the Royal Clan Management Office to blow away Prince Angye and

208
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,230
taking aim at Noron through the civil service exam corruption.

209
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,680
The lowly prince that he is, he's aiming for the throne.

210
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,190
The throne?  Are you saying Prince Yeoning is aiming to be the next king?

211
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,590
Leave now and wait for my instructions.

212
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,560
Your service is not needed right now.

213
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,380
Yes, Your Excellency.

214
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,790
Soon, your service will be needed.

215
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,490
 How do you feel?  Are you a little... fearful now?

216
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,680
 Just as you advised me, I intend to gain that power now.

217
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,830
It's regrettable but it cannot be helped.

218
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,530
Whoever forgets his rightful place deserves it.

219
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,500
What is the situation in Saheonbu?

220
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,650
I heard that even the Chief Scholar of the Office of Special Advisors was summoned today.

221
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,170
On the charges of stealing exam paper and appropriating the proceeds of its sale, Secretary and Assistant Officer of Taxation

222
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,240
as well as the Minister of Works will soon have to present themselves at Saheonbu.

223
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,590
There must be no undue pressure allowed on Saheonbu while they are investigating.

224
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

225
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,860
How are the Noron responding?

226
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,400
I think

227
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,490
you are about to get that answer, Your Majesty.

228
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,590
I was coming to request your audience, Your Majesty, but we happen to meet here.

229
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,390
Please take your tea.

230
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,050
I see that your hands are shaking, Your Majesty.

231
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,970
I guess you are uncomfortable with this one on one meeting I requested.

232
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,570
Perhaps I might even be fearful.

233
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,750
I am still ill at ease on this throne.

234
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,120
Such a king that I am, to face Your Excellency who is more seasoned than anyone else

235
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,580
would be enough to make me shake in my boots, don't you think?

236
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,790
You are overly straightforward.

237
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,390
Or perhaps I am well aware of my situation.

238
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,730
Therefore, I think I am also aware of what you are about to say.

239
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,840
Why don't you close the matter at this point, Your Majesty?

240
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,390
That is not possible.

241
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,480
It will benefit neither this country nor this court.

242
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,160
We seem to have different opinions.

243
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,310
There is no place in this country where Noron's power cannot reach.

244
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,020
That is

245
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,180
the problem this country faces now, don't you think?

246
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,370
I guess you'd rather trust Prince Yeoning, Your Majesty.

247
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,490
How have you come to this?

248
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,190
Why are you asking me such a question?

249
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,280
Your mother might as well have been killed by Royal Concubine Suk,

250
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,880
Prince Yeoning's biological mother, when she tattled on her.

251
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,060
When you know that better than anybody else,

252
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,760
when you have lived through a tormented life because of that,

253
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,440
do you truly not know of the sinister ambition Prince Yeoning is hiding inside him?

254
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,860

255
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,540
I am here to see Her Highness the Queen.  Please announce me.

256
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,390
What do you mean it will be hard to discuss the matter of succession line for the time being?

257
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,140
You must have heard of it and know.

258
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,560
Because of the Noron's civil exam corruption, the palace is—

259
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,490
So what does that have to do with Prince Milpoong becoming your adopted son?!

260
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,360
Look here...

261
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:28,280
Your Highness, you must consider the situation.

262
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,900
Right now, when the Noron Faction is splintered,

263
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,880
isn't it the perfect opportunity to put forward the successor you desire?

264
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,380
Is that so? Is that what you think?

265
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,740
How much longer are you going to stay in the background just because you are a woman?

266
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,880
You must engage in the politics allowed to you.

267
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,890

268
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,820
The queen dowager did not come by today.

269
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,530
I understand.

270
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,690
Last time, it was this woman too.

271
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,630
Look into who that woman is.

272
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,260
Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,450
But her words are correct.

274
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,940
Women cannot just stay in the background.

275
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,370
There is no place that the Noron's power cannot reach.

276
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,380
I guess he means that he won't just take the beating.

277
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,230
Isn't that a given since they have that kind of power?

278
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,970
Didn't the Minister of the Interior say anything else?

279
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,920
I will look into what they plan to do next.

280
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,680
You cannot.  His Majesty is...

281
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,150
Move aside.  I have an appointment to see His Majesty.

282
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,960
Your Majesty.

283
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,020
How are you with Prince Yeoning...

284
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,310
I will take leave of you.

285
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,780
Hyung-nim, why are you in the palace?

286
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,540
Lower your voice.  In whose presence do you think you are?

287
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,090
Your Majesty, how can you let Prince Yeoning approach you?  Prince Yeoning is—

288
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,130
Today, I feel distracted in many ways, Prince Milpoong.

289
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,990
Come back another day.

290
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,020
What the heck are these bastards up to?

291
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,590
Thinking that they are the two children of the predecessor king,

292
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,660
can they possibly be in cahoots?

293
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,170
You rascals, do you know who I am?

294
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,900
The former minister of justice is my grandfather!

295
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,940
Now, now!  Please cooperate for now.

296
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,730
We will let you go home soon enough.

297
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,090
Look here, Yeong Han!

298
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,370
Yoon Taek?

299
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,170
- How long has it been?
 - I will say.

300
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,920
But how come you're here?

301
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,060
Did you get caught, too?

302
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,870
What a disaster.

303
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,440
Since when did Saheonbu get into civil service exam corruption?

304
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,180
What is the matter?

305
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,540
No matter how I look at it, I think the king is behind this.

306
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,530
What?  His Majesty?

307
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,110
For sure, this is a plot to destroy the Norons.

308
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,500
If things go wrong, the entire Noron Faction could be decimated.

309
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,100
How do the censors at Saganwon feel?

310
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,560
Everyone is livid.

311
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,920
No matter who looks at this, isn't this clearly a political persecution directed toward the Norons?

312
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,010
- In that case, carry out your duty as Saganwon, Chief Censor.
 - Yes.

313
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,850

314
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,030
We should right the wrong direction.

315
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,590
You are right.

316
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,350
If this country is headed in the wrong direction, making it turn its head to see the right path,

317
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,180
isn't that the role of the press?

318
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,890

319
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,980
What is going down?  Aren't those the censors of Saganwon?

320
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,510
Darn it.  Now it's their turn to blow their horns  (clamor) .

321
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,630
They are all in on it together anyway.

322
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,680
Inconceivable this, persecution that, they will cause a huge uproar.

323
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,760
With the passing of time, laws and government institutions will develop loopholes, as a matter of course.

324
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,970
The government is also to blame for not addressing the abuses in time.

325
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,120
How can we only blame the abusers?

326
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,800
The scions of powerful Noron families passing the exams en masse cannot be considered a coincidence.

327
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,590
What if the children of eminent families had a good education

328
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,980
and produced good results after applying themselves hard?

329
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,210
For the sin of having Noron fathers,

330
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,730
are you saying they must be investigated without cause?

331
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,000
 The Saheonbu is wielding absolute power right now.

332
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,610
If this isn't a proposal to drag away and investigate anyone they are displeased with, what is?

333
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,100
They are reviling the tradition of the talented children of noble families

334
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,120
following in their fathers' footsteps and serving their kings.

335
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,490
Your ministers are wronged by the persecution and threats

336
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,120
directed toward Norons to the point of feeling great agitation and mortification.

337
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,240
Your Majesty, please grant our request.

338
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,810
Please grant our request, Your Majesty!

339
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,320
Hyung-nim, His Excellency Min Jin Heon is looking for you.

340
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,960
His Excellency is?

341
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,320
He was urgently looking for you for a pressing matter.

342
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,850
Frankly speaking, are the foul plays made at the civil exam grounds just recent happenings?

343
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,330
Who, among your masters, secured government posts through studying?

344
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,290
Everyone got there through the rear hole! 
 (backdoor - by unfair means)

345
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,130
It's over there, Lord.

346
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,300
- That is right.
 - Of course.

347
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,470
But why now, out of the blue, is what I'm saying.

348
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,900
The king means to blast the Norons.

349
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,730
Gee whiz, by golly, if Norons are rags, are Sorons aprons?

350
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,200
They are all same-o same-o.

351
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,240
We can't even find enough to eat, but they are fighting over the sizes of their pies!

352
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,150
Am I right?

353
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,460
Right, right, right.

354
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,860
Darn it, what is this mood?

355
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,670
Why is the public sentiment flowing this way?

356
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,520
What use is studying hard?

357
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,720
Only those who can make it make it, and those who can't will never make it!

358
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,940
Ptooey, this darned world!

359
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,520
Out of my way!

360
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,370
What the heck is going on?

361
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,580
- Let's go.  We must see His Highness. 
- Yes.

362
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,780
Ain't I right?

363
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,020
Right, who cares?

364
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,800
For us, just having one warm meal is on our minds.

365
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,050
Excuse me.

366
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,810
Right, right, right on you are.

367
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,010
Let's not worry about the country but just do our work well.

368
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,740
Disband!

369
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,240
Thanks for a good story.

370
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,800
How is the mood in the streets?

371
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,520
Public sentiment turns this way and that way as manipulated.

372
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,360
It will probably keep on flowing as you want.

373
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,610
But Hyung-nim, must I do these things?

374
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,320
I think uprooting all these shenanigans at this time...

375
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,330
Uproot?

376
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,030
Who can accomplish that?

377
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,700
This is not our business.  Don't worry yourself.

378
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,330
Yes.

379
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,280
- Your Highness!
 - Indeed, it was you, Dal Moon, who has been swaying the public sentiment

380
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,690
as behooves Min Jin Heon's dog.

381
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,800
I know.  It must be noblemen's business that has nothing to do with you,

382
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,590
even if Saganwon turns the tables under the pretext of fulfilling the role of the press,

383
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,170
and public sentiment in the streets flows towards indifference.

384
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:56,890
Even these turns of events can change nothing in the end.

385
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,040
But is it really the case?

386
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,100
The brutal rule of the nobles who attained government posts through corruption,

387
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,860
wouldn't it eventually reach you and your family and the subjects you beguiled in the streets today?

388
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,940
I, too, thought it had nothing to do with me

389
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,060
until that sword was pointed at my younger brother.

390
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,160
Is that... a threat?

391
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,280
I, too, have a conscience.

392
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,690
I won't ask you to side with me, an unremarkable nobody.

393
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,250
But at least be on the side of the people.

394
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,060
At least don't stab people like you in the back.

395
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,780
Are you aiming at the throne?

396
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,540
You won't be able to attain it.

397
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,190
Even if you become the heir by a stroke of luck...

398
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,730
no, you will never become the king.

399
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:03,230
Someday, you will end up being killed by some assassin infiltrating the palace walls.

400
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,760
Even if you barely survive and become the king, what can you accomplish?

401
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,490
Board of Defense Council?  Saheonbu?  Saganwon?

402
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,130
Even the Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau)  that is the king's organization is not in the king's hands.

403
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,220
Keep your life instead.  If that is your goal, I will...

404
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,760
What if I accomplish it?

405
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,550
What will you do if I accomplish that?

406
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,200
Your Highness.

407
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,760
The thing that you and everyone else is telling me that I cannot accomplish...

408
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,100
If I become the most kingly of all kings of this nation Joseon...
