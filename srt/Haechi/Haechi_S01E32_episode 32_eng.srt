1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,990
I heard that you haven't eaten anything in a few days.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,850
Huh?

3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,350
You'll die at that rate.

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,600
You have to take revenge on me.

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,470
You are kind

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,950
both in the past and now

7
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,290
to a bitch like me.

8
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,780
Do you have a strong stomach or are you a fool?

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,810
You know I don't appreciate mere things like these.

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,400
How ungrateful I am!

11
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,000
Thankfully, you still have energy.

12
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,110
I should take this back—

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,830
Did you forget? I am a bitch who abandoned you.

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,810
No matter what happens to me, let me be.

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,960
From now on, I will.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,510
Because you are alive.

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,860
Like you said,

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,980
I don't have any intention to hold onto someone who has left me.

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,880
It's just... I just...

20
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,070
couldn't let you die.

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,300
Make sure you eat.

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,570
You will regret

23
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,540
having saved my life.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,370
Don't you know?

25
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,610
In the end, I will hurt you.

26
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,360
I don't care about things like that.

27
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,940
I am fine

28
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,750
as long as you are alive like this.

29
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,530
Are you leaving the palace now, Your Highness?

30
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,050
I need to see Moon Soo and Dal Moon for a bit.

31
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,580
You must be in for a good time after such a long time.

32
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,350
Just because Damo Cheon is not there, it won't be boys' wild night out, right?

33
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,600
Me?  I've long since cleaned up from such a lifestyle.

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,900
Can't even remember that life.

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,690
Yeah right, dog habits  (bad habits)  die hard.

36
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,410
Dog?  What language to use to the crown prince!

37
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,800
It would've been nicer if Damo Cheon was with you at a time like this.

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,130
I heard she's in Yangjoo on Saheonbu business.

39
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,280
You must be missing her, Your Highness.

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,460
Saying such useless things...

41
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,960
But what about Ja Dong?  Isn't he back yet?

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,720
He said he had a business to take care at Aekjeongseo  (Palace Custodian's Office) .

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
He will be back after taking care of it quickly.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,980
Really?  In this night time?

45
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,980
So you're saying that a certain blood mark appeared, right?

46
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,170
Yes.  Whether it's an animal's or something else, it's ominous and disconcerting.

47
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,340
How come something like this is in the King's Physician's Office?

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,740
I will tell the Aekjeongseo to wipe it clean as soon as the day breaks tomorrow.

49
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,310
Yes.

50
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,410
Let me introduce this concoction.  Among the most stinky, shi*ty alcohols of all time,

51
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,880
Wi Byeong Joo  (Joo can mean alcohol) . Glug, glug, glug.

52
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,900
It sure smells stinky.

53
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,130
That tasted dirty.  The alcohol lives up to its name!

54
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,540
Aigoo, pour Head Merchant Dal Moon a cup of Wi Byeong alcohol.

55
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,370
What?

56
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,570
Lord, like a man, you apologize to him first.

57
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,210
What apology...

58
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,020
Accept a cup from me, if you want.

59
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,360
Is that allowed to this traitor bastard?

60
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,010
This dude... But that wasn't just my fault, was it?

61
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,750
If you had told me sooner, I wouldn't have misunderstood you.

62
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,140
Aigoo, if you misunderstand me one more time, you'll kill me.

63
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,870
I thought my neck would break.

64
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,570
Aigoo, for a man to be so extra whiny...

65
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,580
Now, where does it hurt?  What do you want me to do?

66
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,150
Should I blow on it for you?  Here, here...

67
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,100
What are you doing?  Why are you blowing wind into my ear?

68
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,860
When did I blow wind into your ear?  I just "hoed" where you hurt.

69
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,810
Wh-Why are you doing this?  I said I was okay.

70
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,920
Were you just feeling it, huh?

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,040
Moon Soo, you still have that bad habit?

72
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,110
- Crown Prince. 
- Your Highness.

73
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,080
You are not the only one who had that done to you.

74
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,100
He blew into my ear too a long time ago.

75
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,090
I have already heard of the rumor that Your Highness likes men.

76
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,210
But that means...

77
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,140
this person also shares the same preference—

78
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,240
He-hey!

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,570
Not me, though.  It's just a rubbishy rumor.

80
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,580
But as for Moon Soo, the reason he's not married yet...

81
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,100
Can it be...

82
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,160
Your Highness, why are you doing this to me?

83
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,000
Why are you nodding on?

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,090
I'm not that kind of person!

85
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,110
Seriously...  Ah Bong and Jang Dal, you need to explain to them.

86
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,280
Well, now that I've heard this, I am becoming suspicious.

87
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,320
What?

88
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,170
That's right!  The only woman around him

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,940
is Macho Man Yeo Ji.

90
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,280
How can even you guys be like this?  Huh?

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,040
Stop it already.

92
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,910
Stop!  Seriously!

93
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,750
So ridiculous that I even have to ask this.

94
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,510
Goon Tae and Storyteller, in your eyes, too, do I look...

95
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,150
Don't bring me into this.

96
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,560
Hey!

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,730
I am also a married man with children.

98
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,580
Hey, seriously, are you all going to be like this toward me?!

99
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,290
I said no!  I am a man through and through.

100
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,550
How now!  Do you want me to prove it to you?

101
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,490
Nah...

102
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,440
I think we were too much.

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,910
Lord Moon Soo doesn't seem like he'll get over this.

104
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,950
That's why it's so fun to tease him.

105
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,980
Just one nudge, and he is all fired up.

106
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,000
This time too I have learned a lesson from the king of the streets.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,900
Thank you.

108
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,310
I am sorry for not informing you about this before.

109
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,840
And actually, I still have a secret that I have not told you.

110
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,290
But in the end, I don't think

111
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,920
I will ever be able to tell you that secret.

112
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,040
It does not matter.

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,950
If you must do so, there must be a good reason.

114
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,950
Because you said you needed to tell me something separately, I thought it was something big.

115
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,700
Let's return.  It's been a long time.  We should get a drink.

116
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,250
But, Your Highness, about Prince Milpoong...

117
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,700
when will his execution be carried out?

118
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,270
The sooner the better, isn't it?

119
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,570
He's been exiled already.  Is there a reason to speed it up?

120
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,970
It's because I feel a bit uneasy about something.

121
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,440
On the day he was exiled,

122
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,240
Prince Milpoong's expression...

123
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,920
Prince Milpoong's expression?  What do you mean?

124
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,410
 Your Majesty, are you all right?

125
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,570
 It is nothing much.

126
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,900
 But why is my room lit?

127
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,870
 Who on earth are you?

128
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,220
 C-Crown Prince!

129
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,530
Was I merely... afraid?

130
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,100
Just because of that, I put the crown prince through...

131
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,690
Your Majesty, what is going on? I'll call the royal doctor immediately.

132
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,620
- No! The chief royal secretary first.
 - Pardon?

133
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,180
Tell the chief royal secretary of the Royal Secretariat to come immediately.

134
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,850

135
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,820
Have you really made up your mind?

136
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:00,780
Perhaps... like last time, you want to test the crown prince?

137
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,460
Because you might worry that way, I came to see you first.

138
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,340
Also there is a favor I would like to ask.

139
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,930
To me?

140
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,210
What brings you all the way here?

141
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,490
You should have called me to your palace.

142
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,830
It does not matter if I'm the one coming.

143
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,120
Today, I am here as His Majesty's messenger.

144
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,050
Pardon?

145
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,540
Left and Right State Councilors, the reason I called both of you

146
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,730
is because there is something I need to specially request.

147
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,230
Please give us your command, Your Majesty.

148
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,210
Today, through the Royal Secretariat,

149
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,840
there will be a decree sent out stating that the crown prince will have regency.

150
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,710
Your Majesty, you can't do this. That would mean—

151
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,770
I have already made a firm decision, Right State Councilor.

152
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,170
Plus this isn't to put the crown prince in a tough spot like last time.

153
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,210
Your Majesty.

154
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,510
Therefore, as Noron and Soron's leaders,

155
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,550
I expect both of you to get the others on the same page.

156
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,750
Through this, I want to unify the atmosphere

157
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,580
of the state of affairs that has been in confusion.

158
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,120
But, Your Highness, I cannot accept this.

159
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,710
Because you would respond like this,

160
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,230
His Majesty has asked me

161
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,420
to persuade you instead.

162
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,450
 You probably know too

163
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,000
 that the person to whom Father wanted to pass down the throne

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,020
 was not me, but the crown prince.

165
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,160
 Your Majesty, that was...

166
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,950
 I want to teach the crown prince about political affairs

167
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,370
 and discuss the affairs of our nation together.

168
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,950
 I was born and raised in the palace,

169
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,720
 and though I am lacking, I am doing my duty as a king.

170
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,720
 As a king, there must be a little I can teach the crown prince, don't you think?

171
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,090
His Majesty is sincere, Crown Prince.

172
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,630
So don't think of regency as a disloyal act

173
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,050
but return his decision with your sincerity.

174
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,150
Your Highness.

175
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:40,040
This probably is the preceding king's will.

176
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,290
I also want to see brothers, not as enemies but as allies,

177
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,320
discuss the affairs of our nation together

178
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,980
in this royal family.

179
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,900

180
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,170
 It was you, Brother.

181
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,930
 The one whom Father selected as this nation's king.

182
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,340
 What is it that you want me to say?

183
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,320
 "I'm sorry for not dying" or—

184
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,960
 So are you happy?

185
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,930
 I am asking whether you're happy to have ruined yourself just as this father of yours had sneered?

186
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,570
Father.

187
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,500
 You could have proven me wrong by living differently.

188
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,940
 No matter how much lowly blood flows through half of you,

189
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,000
 you could have lived a decent life had you wanted to.

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,530
 So then why are you living like this?

191
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,790
 Why is this all that you've let yourself amount to?

192
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,970
 You want to know why I live like this?

193
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:26,220
 Fine. I was born so high and mighty that this is the only way I can live, Your Majesty!

194
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,900
 Even if I wanted to try to do something, there's nothing I could ever do!

195
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,800
 Indeed. That's how you were, Prince Yeoning.

196
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,680
 That's what made my heart hurt even more,

197
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,610
 every time I saw the makings of a king in you.

198
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,640
 I'm dying soon, Prince Yeoning.

199
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,710
 Before that happens,

200
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:15,880
 won't you reveal to the world the side of you that I know?

201
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,260
 I am asking whether you can restrain yourself just a little more

202
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,200
 and show the rest of the world that worthy and respectable side of you.

203
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,960

204
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,380
Here comes the crown prince.

205
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,400
Crown Prince, take your seat in attendance of the king to start your regency.

206
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,830

207
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,440
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

208
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,830
Starting today, under His Majesty's command,

209
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,630
I am seated here to discuss

210
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,530
the nation's affairs with you all.

211
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,090
Of course, I will be lacking.

212
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,300
I expect great teachings from all of the court officials.

213
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,960
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

214
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:34,890
Then shall we start with the first affair?

215
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,160
As the first affair in my regency,

216
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,550
I want to endorse what Section Chief of the Interior Yoon Hyeok proposed

217
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,640
under the command of His Majesty, which is regarding the staffing policy of the Three Offices,

218
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,050
and reform the personnel of Saheonbu.

219
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,440
Accordingly, the current inspector general Im Jae Heon will be removed from office

220
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,710
and following Section Chief of the Interior's recommendation,

221
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,950
I will appoint Deputy Minister of Taxation Lee Gwang Jwa

222
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,910
as the new inspector general.

223
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,730
However, Your Highness, what do you mean?

224
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,230
- The position of inspector general is—
 - There's no way

225
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:36,070
that you are trying to pick a fight from the first day, right, Left State Councilor?

226
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:46,120
Newly appointed Inspector General Lee Gwang Jwa, step forward and receive the king's decree.

227
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,700
Newly appointed Inspector General Lee Gwang Jwa, listen.

228
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,270
This nation's long history of systematic evils and corruption is because, in the end,

229
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,140
Saheonbu, which should be watching over the officials

230
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,990
and justly carrying out the law,

231
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,340
was not able to fully perform its duty.

232
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,550
Therefore, I want to entrust you with the important task

233
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,380
of reforming the Saheonbu.

234
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,160
So please do your best.

235
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,720
Your grace is immeasurable.

236
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,530
I will give my life to fulfill the given task.

237
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,830
 Lord Inspector General is coming!

238
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,780
Is Joo Yeong Han's life on the downhill now?

239
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,560
- Please be quiet, Inspector Joo. 
- What?

240
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,810
Inspector Joo?

241
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,920
Got it, Inspector Park.

242
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,260
 Everyone, greet the new inspector general.

243
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,140
Forget it!

244
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,370
Let's do away with these empty shows from now on.

245
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,320
However, our Saheonbu's formal greeting culture—

246
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,710
In half an hour, promptly at the hour of the dragon (7-9 AM),

247
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,620
I shall hold a high officials' meeting at their office.

248
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,830
What is it? What is he going to do?

249
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,260
What else?

250
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:55,060
He means not to waste time on useless things and do the work properly.

251
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,920
Lord Yoon Hyeok.

252
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,580
Inspector Park.

253
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,590
What happened?

254
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,690
How are you wearing the inspector's uniform again?

255
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,290
Is that the Lead Inspector's robe?

256
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,800
- Your uniform... 
 - Ah, it happened that way.

257
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,150
This is how the new inspector general gave me his first order.

258
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,440
I was getting used to the Ministry of the Interior but I got called back again.

259
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,820
Lee Gwang Jwa is the inspector general?

260
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,400
Yoon Hyeok is the lead inspector.

261
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,270
We are doomed. We are properly doomed.

262
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:32,240
Welcome back. I think Saheonbu will become a more interesting place now.

263
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,030
- I missed you all. 
- Welcome back.

264
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,710
Congratulations.

265
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,460
For the crown prince starting his regency,

266
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,140
cooperating with his first affair is the court's custom.

267
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,960
I didn't know you'd use it to strike Saheonbu.

268
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,760
What do you mean strike? Your words are quite strong.

269
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,190
I am trying to set Saheonbu straight.

270
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,800
An organization doesn't change just because its head changed, Your Highness.

271
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,870
- I thought you'd know at least that much. 
- Of course I'd know.

272
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:18,920
That's why I won't end this with just changing the head.

273
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,590
This is why Prince Milpoong...

274
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,650
shouldn't have been caught that night.

275
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,870
I am telling you this because I saw Prince Milpoong in the palace that night.

276
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,620
Why he didn't run away when he had the chance?

277
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,950
I am disappointed about that.

278
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,430
You saw Milpoong that night?

279
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,660
Officially I didn't know Prince Milpoong's crime.

280
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,570
Hence, I had no reason to report him.

281
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,120
Hold on! Wait, Left State Councilor.

282
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,150
What do you mean Prince Milpoong had a chance to run away?

283
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,930
Just what does it mean?

284
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,270
- Your Highness. 
- The night when Prince Milpoong got arrested,

285
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,930
when did the state tribunal's clerk came across Prince Milpoong?

286
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,010
Was it during the hour of the dog (7-9 PM)?

287
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:34,870
Pardon me? It seems so, but why...

288
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,410
Then Left State Councilor is right.

289
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,800
Your Highness, what are you talking about?

290
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,900
Prince Milpoong entered the palace during the hour of the dog (7-9 PM) that night,

291
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,150
but he got arrested during the hour of the pig (9-11 PM). Do you understand?

292
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,690
Even though Prince Milpoong had plenty of time to escape,

293
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,160
he remained within the palace.

294
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,990
But why? To do what?

295
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,670
Yoon Yeong, you understand

296
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,720
what you need to do now, right?

297
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,910
We are not... done yet.

298
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,350
Where are you going?

299
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,510
I am going out for a minute.

300
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,310
- But Hyung-nim Dal Moon— 
- I'll be back, so don't worry.

301
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:49,390
Would I have any place to go now?

302
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,060
Your Majesty!

303
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,420
Your Majesty!

304
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,530
Because we got excited by the fact of Prince Milpoong's arrest that night,

305
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,580
we may have missed on his acts.

306
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,190
Get Uigeumbu in gear and gather every piece of intelligence.

307
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,090
Yes, Your Highness.

308
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,710
 You are here.

309
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:40,820
 I knew you'd come find me.

310
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,560
 Why he didn't run away when he had the chance? I am disappointed about that.

311
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,880
 It's because I feel a bit uneasy about something.

312
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,500
 On the day he was exiled,

313
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,330
 Prince Milpoong's expression...

314
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,880
What is it, Tan?

315
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,110
Just why?

316
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,180
What are you after?

317
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,730
Your Highness!

318
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,990
What happened?

319
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,320
What do you mean His Majesty collapsed while drinking his medicine?

320
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,020
I am sorry but...

321
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,420
I don't know what exactly caused it. I checked his pulse...

322
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,680
Is that your excuse?!

323
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,110
How could the king's physician not even know about His Majesty's illness?!

324
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,640
Your Highness.

325
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,670
What brought you here to the King's Physician's Office?

326
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,030
Blood.

327
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,860
There was a blood stain here?

328
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,970
Yes. Over here.

329
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:56,690
Aekjeongseo  (Palace Custodian's Office)  cleaned it at the request of the King's Physician's Office a few days ago.

330
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,610
King's Physician's Office?

331
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,270
 There hasn't been any report of him leaving the palace.

332
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,020
 That means he's definitely still here.

333
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,810
Just why? To do what?

334
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,670
No way...

335
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,760
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

336
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,580
Are you alright, Majesty?

337
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,300
Can you recognize me?

338
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,510
Q-Queen...

339
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,530
Who's out there? Call the physician at once!

340
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,890
Yes, Your Excellency.

341
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,580
Your Majesty, you must drink this medicine.

342
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,750
Hurry.

343
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,730
No!

344
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,590
Stop right now, Your Highness!

345
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,140
- Crown Prince, what are you doing? 
- Your Highness!

346
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,790
You must get that medicine away from him.

347
00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:00,460
We must not let His Majesty drink the medicine from the King's Physician's Office!

348
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:10,980

349
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,950
♫  Since we met saying hello  ♫

350
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:26,970
♫  Should we break up while saying goodbye?  ♫

351
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:34,100
♫  Now the gentle and gentler wind hurts too  ♫
