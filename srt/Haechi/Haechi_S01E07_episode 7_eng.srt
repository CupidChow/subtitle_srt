1
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,670

2
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,190
 At first, I was taken aback

3
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,380
 wondering why Your Highness was stepping up for Prince Yeonryeong.

4
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,140
 You who were living well without declaring your existence.

5
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,580
 That's when a memory came to me.

6
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,530
 An image of Your Highness when you were young and extremely bright.

7
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,480
 If I felt that way, I wondered how you must have felt.

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,840
 If you were ever resentful of your lowly blood.

9
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,450
 So perhaps you at least wanted to live vicariously through Prince Yeonryeong.

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,490
 I don't care about whatever you say.

11
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,350
 Don't touch Inspector Han who is innocent!

12
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,760
 The one who lured him into a trap was not me but you, Your Highness!

13
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,810
 What did you think you could do?

14
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,260
 You who don't have even a sliver of power to protect a mere inspector. What could you possibly do?

15
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,180
 Conscience without power is weak.

16
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,130
 You should have known these things before you picked a fight, Your Highness.

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,700
Your Highness, what's going on?

18
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,370
Why are you like this?

19
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,790
He is right.

20
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,800
It was something someone like me could not achieve.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,910
I apologize, but I do not understand what you mean.

22
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,440
Why seat Prince Yeoning on the royal throne?

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,680
He, too, is of royal blood. He carries my blood and is rightfully a prince!

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,730
The prince I approve and choose to lead after me is Prince Yeoning.

25
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,830
The only thing is this country's Noron, Soron, Namin,

26
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,910
nor any other powers do not support him.

27
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,600
What is the reason for telling me this?

28
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,910
I, too, am a part of Noron which is one of those factions.

29
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,310
Do you think I don't know of your doings?

30
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,770
Among Norons, your power has weakened

31
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,380
because you didn't succeed in fully covering up Prince Milpoong's doings.

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,770
Your Majesty!

33
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,490
So what do you think, Inspector General,

34
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,240
about being on Prince Yeoning's side?

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,230
Pardon?

36
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,260
 I'm telling you to make the next king with your own hands.

37
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,300
 Give Prince Yeoning the royal throne, and with that power, become the leader of Noron.

38
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,110
Your Majesty, this is...

39
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,750
Take care of it quietly.

40
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,220
No one can know about my condition yet.

41
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,670

42
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,770
This? It is for me.

43
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,140
Do you know what it is?

44
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,810
Yes, it's from Head Merchant Jang of the silk shop at the market.

45
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,960
He's telling me to add to the fund that the inspectors created.

46
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,630
You mean the relief fund that was created from a part of the inspectors' wages?

47
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,200
You must know, too. You delivered famine relief crops before.

48
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,290
Yes, now that I think about it.

49
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,650
Since a few years ago, Head Merchant Jang has been chipping in.

50
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,890
When the time came, he always sent it to Saheonbu,

51
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,810
but for some reason, he sent it to my house this time.

52
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,360
Then you mean it's not a big deal, right?

53
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,830
- Perhaps... 
- Perhaps what?

54
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,670
 Something you could not achieve?

55
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,130
 What do you mean by that, Your Highness?

56
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,400
 Curse me all you want

57
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,050
 but protect that person, Inspector Han, no matter what.

58
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,200
 What does it mean? The words he said.

59
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,550
 Something I need to do? What is it?

60
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,330
 With that, the Noron Faction will truly protect Prince Yeonryeong?

61
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,290
 You just need to state that you lied as an informant.

62
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,730
 That it was all a scheme plotted by Inspector Han Jeong Seok.

63
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,000
 Why would anyone choose the more difficult path?

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,910
 After all, didn't you do the same, Your Highness?

65
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,870
 Rather than retreat and pretend not to know, facing it was easier.

66
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,810
 Then will you abandon Prince Yeonryeong?

67
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,370
Become what? Pledged brothers?

68
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,610
Yes. Prince Yeoning and I did.

69
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,230
We decided to let you in as well.

70
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,340
Specially as the maknae  (youngest) .

71
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,410
I did well, right? You're happy, right? I'm the only one who thinks of you, right?

72
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,310
No, I don't want to.

73
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,500
Why would I become brothers with people I don't know at all?

74
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,000
What are you saying? Hey, then isn't Hyung Jeong Seok's family complete strangers, too?

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,060
They're my family.

76
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,700
So it's the same in that you're not related by blood at all.

77
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,060
If people share the same will and walk on the same road, then they're brothers.

78
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,240
Why does blood matter?

79
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,980
Did he agree?

80
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,900
Did His Highness say that he will become your hyung?

81
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,520
Well he did hold out a bit, but he was just doing that.

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,180
That's our hyung-nim's charm.

83
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,440
Hey, it's our hyung-nim.

84
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,330
Hyung-nim!

85
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,070
Wow, I was just on my way to your place.

86
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,710
I meet you here instead.

87
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,720
You haven't had your lunch yet, right?

88
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,190
The soup and rice here is amazing. If you have time, join us.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,480
No. I don't want to at all.

90
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,070
- Let's go. 
- Okay.

91
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,560
- Hyung-nim. 
- One moment, Your Highness.

92
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,980
I have something to ask you about yesterday.

93
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,230
Why did you say that about Inspector Han?

94
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,260
Curse you? What do youâ€”

95
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,640
Yes. We won't be meeting again,

96
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,350
so I will say one more thing.

97
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,250
Go to Saheonbu.

98
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,780
You don't have a moment to waste by talking to someone despicable like me.

99
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,890
But Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim!

100
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,890
Why is our hyung-nim being like that?

101
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,180
What do you mean by yesterday?

102
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,070
Bring all the alcohol and open the doors to let anyone in.

103
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:28,220
Today, I and the rest of Hanyang will let go of our minds.

104
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,800
Prince Yeoning as the king...

105
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,730
Prince Yeoning as the king?

106
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,660
Does that make sense?

107
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,340
How could a lowly blood?!

108
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,660
 I'm telling you to make the next king with your own hands.

109
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:47,140
 Give Prince Yeoning the royal throne, and with that power, become the leader of Noron.

110
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,790
 However, it's true.

111
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,080
 If I can succeed,

112
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,260
 Min Jin Heon will bow down before me.

113
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,860
Inspector General, there's a huge issue.

114
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,930
Look at this.

115
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,450
What did you say, Minister of the Interior?

116
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,960
I said that the Noron will sincerely protect Prince Yeonryeong.

117
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,430
Additionally, we will re-strengthen the discipline of this nation that was shaken.

118
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,280
Your Majesty, it's Chief Royal Secretary.

119
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,150
He urgently requests a meeting regarding the Saheonbu.

120
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,030
Let him in since it seems urgent.

121
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,960
Why are you being like this?

122
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,820
I'm asking, what's the reason?

123
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,570
Last night, Prince Yeoning came by Inspector Han's place.

124
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,390
He said something strange like he did a moment ago.

125
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,540
What do you mean?

126
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,590
Please go to Inspector Han. I'll return to the Saheonbu. Hurry.

127
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,500
- Back off.
 - What are you doing?

128
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,370
Why are you investigating Inspector Han? Why!

129
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,390
Hey, hey! Don't touch that! They're all files from investigations!

130
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,730
Search thoroughly.

131
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,210
You will need to open up everything, even brush cases like this.

132
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,780
So what have you found?

133
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,870
Back off.

134
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,470
Answer me. What are you looking for by doing this?

135
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,980
Why? If I tell you, will you hand it over?

136
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,860
- Sir!
 - I received a letter exposing

137
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,160
that your boss, Han Jeong Seok, created a false testimony.

138
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,380
Whose letter is it?

139
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Prince Yeoning wrote it.

140
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,930
A letter by Prince Yeoning?

141
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,760
He retracted his testimony?

142
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,520
Yes.

143
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,000
Saying that he fell for your boss's enticement.

144
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That he was convinced momentarily because of his feelings against Prince Milpoong.

145
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,730
You actually believe the likes of these words?

146
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,780
But you all are well aware of the kind of person Inspector Han is!

147
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,670
Like you, they must have all believed in Inspector Han,

148
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,460
since he acted like he was the most virtuous one in the world.

149
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,950
But Inspector Han was merely a corrupt official.

150
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,600
As if coercing a false testimony is not enough,

151
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,000
he was taking filthy bribes secretly.

152
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,200
Bribes?

153
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,460
What in the world are you saying?

154
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,870
Do you have anything to say?

155
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,520
I hear Prince Yeoning retracted his testimony.

156
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,310
That's why I should have been made an even more corrupt inspector,

157
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,870
so that the tables can be turned more smoothly

158
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,530
and they can make a good example out of me.

159
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,360
Father. Father.

160
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,830
I want to believe you, but there's nothing to support your claim.

161
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,730
The testimony and evidence are too clear.

162
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,210
Father.

163
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,610
Carry it out.

164
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,170
- Husband. 
- Father!

165
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,650
- Father. 
- Husband.

166
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,070
Hyung-nim! What are you guys?

167
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,760
Get lost! Don't you hear me?

168
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,210
Shove this dog crap right away!

169
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,710
Move aside, Moon Soo.

170
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
You cannot block the enforcement by Saheonbu.

171
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,670
Hyung-nim, why can't I?

172
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,130
They are the ones who actually defied the national law.

173
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,740
The ones who broke the law and fabricated this crime are elsewhere.

174
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,120
Why can't I block them?

175
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,630
So will you be like them too?

176
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,220
Will you disregard the law as a joke and stand above it too?

177
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,610
One day, for sure, you will become a righteous officer of the Saheonbu, Moon Soo.

178
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,890
At that time, you must be a man who wins, not with power, but with the law.

179
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,850
In this world, to those who will do anything for power,

180
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,200
you must show them

181
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,180
that the law wins in the end.

182
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,380
Hyung-nim.

183
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,890
Drag him away.

184
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,790
- Husband. 
- Father.

185
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,070
- Husband! 
- Father!

186
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,340
Father!

187
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,730
Father!

188
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,390
Why is this so messed up?

189
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,810
But we were winning!

190
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,870
We almost won it all!

191
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,650
Saheonbu is in a wreck.

192
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,560
Is that so?

193
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
There must have been another way.

194
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,960
It should've been enough to give just Prince Yeoning a dressing-down.

195
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,670
But fabricated testimony and bribery too?

196
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,550
Why did you have to touch Saheonbu's prestige too?

197
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,150
Be careful now.

198
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:20,010
Someone might misunderstand you and think someone did this on purpose.

199
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,600
We had no choice but to abandon Prince Milpoong and choose Prince Yeonryeong.

200
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,880
Will it really suffice if Prince Yeoning is the only one learning a lesson from this debacle

201
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,940
when he's a meaningless man whose existence makes no difference?

202
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,670
Cut if off. The stump is rotten so the other ones will die too.

203
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,870
Yes, Your Excellency.

204
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,770
Inspector Han's case will serve as a good example.

205
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,490
Other officials who've made grave miscalculations

206
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,440
will realize through this example

207
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,430
that they can be cut along with a rotten tree if they hang around one.

208
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,770
Still, as the inspector general of the Saheonbu, I should've known about this.

209
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,580
- At least clue me in on it firstâ€” 
- Why?

210
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,880
When it's no issue that you didn't know.

211
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,850
Even if you knew, you wouldn't have been able to do anything about it anyway.

212
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,110
What did Minister of the Interior say?

213
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,730
Was he aware of it?

214
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,940
Is he someone who would say he knew if he knew?

215
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,340
Why do you ask me something obvious?

216
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,700
But even then, My Lord, without a single word to you,

217
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,530
he's put our entire Saheonbu down!

218
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,230
I think this is a warning to us.

219
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,680
He wants to show us what will happen if we are defiant.

220
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,260
As if we don't already know you're distinguished scholars, you sure are so smart!

221
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,110
You know so well but you disobeyed an order?

222
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,780
It was you who arrested Prince Milpoong!

223
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,720
Enough of that. You're all noisy so get out.

224
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,700
Aren't you getting out? So you disobey on this too now?

225
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,670
Your Majesty.

226
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:53,160
In there should be a way to break through the current trouble.

227
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,930
Do you mean a report from the Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau) ?

228
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,890
But Saheonbu cannot move based on intelligence from Uigeumbu, an agency reporting directly to the king.

229
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,520
- In doing soâ€” 
- No, I mean, give it to Prince Yeoning.

230
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,930
If it's that child, he will get it done. To Prince Yeoning.

231
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,760
As soon as daylight breaks, have Prince Yeonryeong come into the palace.

232
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

233
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,570
Geum. Please.

234
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,660
Your Highness, don't just drink like that.

235
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,860
Your Highness, please stop drinking now.

236
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,870
Where are you going?

237
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,710
- Oh, Your Highness, are you alright?
 - No!

238
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,940
What I need now isn't you.

239
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,890
I didn't get drunk merely for that!

240
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,220
Your Highness.

241
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,250
Your Highness...

242
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,640
Here. Take a drink from me too.

243
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,600
Drink until you die. Enjoy to your heart's content!

244
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:54,940
Hooray!

245
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,100
Really? Prince Yeoning, you mean?

246
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,150
Yes, he's hired and opened up a gisaeng house for free, and all the idle turds in the capital went there.

247
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,440
What about our boys? Did they go too?

248
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,390
No, no. I told them not to even show their face around there in case trouble arises.

249
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,020
Alright. You did well.

250
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,860
But isn't that Prince Yeoning so funny?

251
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,990
Funny? What about?

252
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,640
He is. He went and testified by himself,

253
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,600
then he flipped it and made a total fool out of that one inspector.

254
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,490
What happened to that inspector then?

255
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,930
It seems Head Merchant Jang of the silk shop confessed, as ordered, that he gave him bribes.

256
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,060
What can a powerless merchant do?

257
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,560
Fabricating testimony and bribery on top of it?

258
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,420
It will be hard for him to be spared.

259
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,330
He was too naive.  What's there to trust about a royal to cooperate with him? Seriously!

260
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,500
Where in the world did he go?

261
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,460
Your Highness?

262
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,610
Your Highness, are you alright?

263
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,620
Your Highness.

264
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,600
Ja Dong.

265
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,560
Your Highness.

266
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,970
It's you.

267
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,150
You have a master like me.

268
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,450
How pitiful.

269
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,650
Your Highness, you are bleeding.

270
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,890
I'll get a physician.

271
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,160
For what?

272
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,430
For a thing like me? For what?

273
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,590
Your Highness.

274
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,570
It'll just be a brief moment. Please allow us to see His Highness.

275
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,140
I'm not lying. He really isn't here. He didn't come home.

276
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,040
Does that make sense right now?

277
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,560
It's already past the hour of the ox (1 - 3 AM).

278
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,180
He's that kind of person by nature.  He's a consummate libertine.

279
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,440
Did you mingle with him, unaware of that?

280
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,750
Then, please relay a message to him.

281
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,960
They scheduled the cross-testimony between our lord and the prince at Saheonbu tomorrow.

282
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,470
There, he must reveal the truth again.

283
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,520
Hyung-nim. We still believe in you, Your Highness.

284
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,890
We believe you wouldn't do this for no reason. There must be a reason for it.

285
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,020
Alright. I will be sure to tell him.

286
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,530
I plead of you.

287
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,850
Let's go.

288
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,230
We've been discourteous at such a late hour.

289
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,290
Throw some salt after them. 
 (to erase the bad luck, traces of unwelcome visitors)

290
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,890
Why are they bemoaning their own grievance here?

291
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,310
As long as it's not her business?

292
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,600
Madam, your life must be so carefree.

293
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,700
It's alright. You can go tattle.

294
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,990
No, no.

295
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,280
I have something to give to the master.

296
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,580
But it's right, Your Highness.

297
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,880
It's fine as long as the hardships in this world are not on you.

298
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,340
See nothing and hear nothing.

299
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,450
That's how you can survive.

300
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,320
I'd rather you knew nothing then.

301
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,330
It's thanks to you, Prime Minister, that I am out safely.

302
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,740
I bid you my gratitude.

303
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,180
Why are you behaving in a way that's against the social norms and mores  (a royal bowing down to a non-royal) ?

304
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,850
A royal bidding greeting to a subject?

305
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,440
Prince Milpoong's face is looking quite pale.

306
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,330
Should I bring out some restoratives?

307
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,490
Why at my house?

308
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,330
We just ate breakfast not long ago.

309
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,450

310
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,070
His Highness must be busy too, so we should tell him to go now.

311
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,860
Minister of the Interior!

312
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,360
You came out, Prince Milpoong, and we meet here.

313
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,160
Minister of the Interior.

314
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,350
Yes. You stopped by my home too?

315
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,310
I went to you first, of course. Without delay.

316
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,510
How great it would have been had you at least feigned this humility before.

317
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,490
What?

318
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:02,030
If you knew you couldn't amount to much, you shouldn't have thrown such a fit.

319
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,610
Your Excellency, what did you just say to me?

320
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,950
You must have heard from the prime minister's concubine

321
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,800
who the next king is.

322
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,720
No. No.

323
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,230
It can't be.

324
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,950
Noron can't abandon me.

325
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,130
This nation belongs to my grandfather, Crown Prince Sohyeon.

326
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,380
Not the old geezer on the throne now, but my grandfather, my father!

327
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,480
And another thing I said to you!

328
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,840
That the pillars supporting this nation are the Norons!

329
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,240
If you wanted to play the king still,

330
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,980
you should have kept your surroundings tidy,

331
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,520
even if we were the ones doing everything.

332
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,930
Minister of the Interior!

333
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,150
An envoy entourage will leave for the Qing Dynasty tomorrow.

334
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,810
Go with them.

335
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:03,200
In the future, you can beg for leniency from the new king and open a way for you to survive.

336
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,520
No, no. You can't!

337
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,790
Don't abandon me.

338
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,200
Please! Please! I will do anything you tell me to do, so please!

339
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,910
When I see the likes of you...

340
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,420
Status is only a delusion.

341
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:29,850
Humans are just talking beasts.

342
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,070
That's what you find out.

343
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,430
And the world still has to go on.

344
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:41,900
So a thing like you will be spared to live too.

345
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,310
Get up. That's not your seat, Your Highness.

346
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,750
Don't you hear me?

347
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,760
You can't sit on the dirt ground like that.

348
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,710
Yoon Yeong, it's all over.

349
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,640
It's all over, Yoon Yeong.

350
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,070
No! It's not over.

351
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,470
Who says it's over?

352
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,830
Look at me. You said you'd make me the queen.

353
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,400
That's why I chose you.

354
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,830
That's why I even became that old geezer's concubine.

355
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,960
Yoon Yeong.

356
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,100
This nation is yours. You're going to let them snatch it from you like this?

357
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,450
Show them who you are!

358
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:45,720
Show them just what will happen to them if they try to snatch yours.

359
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
Prince Yeoning.

360
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,950
This is all because of that scum!

361
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,580
That scum ruined me.

362
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,630
You're not ruined.

363
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:04,900
You can reclaim the royal throne anytime!

364
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,730
Please put it in the prince's room.

365
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,030
What is this? Who put this in my room?

366
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,140
Your Highness.

367
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,080
I put it there at night. Sam Wol said she received it.

368
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,160
Your Majesty.

369
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,560
I heard you were looking for me.

370
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,420
Your Excellency, this is...

371
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,750
Intimate intelligence on Prince Milpoong.

372
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,890
His conduct in private and the corpse record of his murders.

373
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,810

374
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,330
Perhaps something of this nature is from the Uigeumbu.

375
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,190
Why do you have these? Who on earth gave them to you?

376
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,840
Whoever it is, it's someone who shares my conviction.

377
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,580
Someone who wants to turn this situation around.

378
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,090
Someone who wants to protect the innocent before it's too late.
