1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,480
Ah Bong, Jang Dal.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,470
- What about His Highness?
 - He got the message and came.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,140
He's in the storage room.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,860
Let's go.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,050
Over the past 100 years, Norons have been doing this extremely well,

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,920
turning the tables to create situations that favor them.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,590
If the Saganwon and the popular opinion at the market are both to this extent, then will it just get buried?

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,880
The people might be like this because they just don't know, but how can the Saganwon be like this?

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,340
They should be putting their lives at risk and stating the truth.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,660
Gosh, I'm so mad. Does this make sense?

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,310
Fairness, justice. Did all of these things become bullshit now?

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,580
I understand those who already have a government position,

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,090
but what about the tens of thousands across the nation who are preparing to take the civil service exam?

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,080
There are so many just in Hanyang.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,370
Do they separate themselves as Noron, Soron, or Namin?

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,290
Jang Dal, Ah Bong. Do you think I am the only person who should feel wronged and be foaming at the mouth?

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,870
The table that they turned, we might be able to turn it back.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,690
Do you think it's as easy as flipping a pancake? How would we do that?

19
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,640
Not us but those who have complaints about this situation.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,080
What?

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,300
By chance, you mean what I said?

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,740
Like what you said, those who already have a position probably want to let this issue pass by quietly,

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,100
but there will be those who don't want that.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:29,360
The average scholars. Not those from powerful Noron families, but the average Noron, Soron, and Namin scholars.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,160
The scholars?

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,560
Just in Hanyang, there are probably ten thousand scholars who prepare for the civil service exam.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,710
What if they all come out to the streets?

28
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,810
- To the street?
- There is no doubt about how the Soron and Namin feel.

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,670
For this matter where their best interests hang in the balance...

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,680
Like Lord Moon Soo, they would be foaming at their mouths out of fury, don't you think?

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,250
Anyway, yes. It makes sense, right?

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,300
That's it. Yeo Ji, you understand precisely what I said.

33
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,280
Even though I blabbered like a fool. Good job.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,520
Yes, perhaps we can find the key to fighting back.

35
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,980
Everyone, you've worked hard.

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,520
Now you guys can stay out of this plan.

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,130
What? But...

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,220
Stay out? You're saying that you will carry it out alone?

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,850
Yes, I'll take care of it. This canâ€”

40
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,280
Get dangerous, that's why.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,140
Because of me, you guys will face danger.

42
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,270
Why speak in a roundabout way?

43
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,970
We heard your plan, too.

44
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,550
What?

45
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,120
- By chance, did you?
- Yes! I spilled it all.

46
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,640
We will go together.

47
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,130
- Moon Soo.
- Don't you remember?

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,770
The dream we had a year ago at this place.

49
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,430
You ascended to the throne despite all the odds against you.

50
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,650
 You are the king.

51
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,560
 A king can do anything he wants to.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,720
 Just give the royal command.

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
 So I am the king.

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,390
 Then what shall we start with?

55
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,000
 Your Excellency Prime Minister!

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,050
 Hyung-nim, you are the prime minister!

57
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,880
Now instead of being a king on a game board,

58
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,290
you plan to become the real king of Joseon, don't you?

59
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,280
So we're saying it will be difficult to achieve alone.

60
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,160
We will go with you until the end.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,840
I do want to be in charge of the Capital Bureau.

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,130
You can't forget about me, either.

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,340
- You guys...
- We will go together, Hyung-nim.

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,480
Mere lives? We will put them on the line, too.

65
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,630
Please pack this and the other clothes that His Highness used to wear.

66
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,330
Yes.

67
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,310
What are you doing right now?

68
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,590
Oh right, you have to bring out all of the gats  (Joseon men's hat) , too.

69
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,660
There's no way His Highness is going to set up a separate abode with you.

70
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,400
Is that why you're packing his clothes and leaving?!

71
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,480
How come that's the way your thoughts run, Madam?

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,510
W-wh-what do you mean?

73
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,860
He is great with words, but he doesn't have much interest in untying a woman's top.

74
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,270
How could you not know what kind of person your husband is to this extent...

75
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,150
What did you say? Then what are you?

76
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,900
I don't want to tell you.

77
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,180
You're getting more and more...

78
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,020
No, no, that's not it.

79
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,910
Noblemen do not talk and act that way.

80
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,680
How many times must I tell you for you to understand?

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
After drinking, you do not lick your mustache and beard.

82
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,190
When you smoke, you must not create wells in your cheeks.

83
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,850
You must not display too much emotion.

84
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,390
Showing emotion on your face is for low-borns and is forbidden.

85
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,790
When you read, your gaze must stay at the tip of your nose and your heels must touch when you sit.

86
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,960
I am trying what you said, but am I not doing it correctly?

87
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,800
If you cross your eyes like that, can you even see the letters?

88
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,000
Being a nobleman is tiring, I see.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,480
It's so annoying that even if someone lets me, I won't do it.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,960
Try to learn diligently, please!

91
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,720
Now can you finally feel the difference between our classes?

92
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,840
You can understand how hard it has been for me, right?

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,080
Yes, yes, Noble Lord.

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,320
You little!

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,270
Now what should we do?

96
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,370
This is Banchon, a town attached to Sungkyunkwan.

97
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,010
So most of them are either students at Sungkyunkwan or those who are preparing to take the civil service exam.

98
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,850
So you're saying we just have to stir them up, right?

99
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,530
Exactly.

100
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,210
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

101
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,000
Hurry, hurry.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,650
Gosh.

103
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,400
Are you students?  If it's okay, let me have a cup, too.

104
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,100
By the way, have you heard and do you know already?

105
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,620
About the severity of corruption on this civil service exam.

106
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,450
From the beginning, those who will pass have already been chosen.

107
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,670
Without any backing, even if you try, what good is it?

108
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,260
This year was my 15th year. I had some hope for this year.

109
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,150
- I'm on my 20th year.
- Oh no.

110
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,710
What the. Are you f***ing serious?

111
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,720
Is what the people at the markets said.

112
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,480
T-the low-borns did.

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,450
T-t-the low-borns. Yes, low-borns could have said that.

114
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,340
Well... We are noblemen, so we can't say that.

115
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,390
Still, are we going to just watch this happen?

116
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,700
We've worked hard for many years, many decades, but we can't pass without a backing or connections.

117
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,690
- This kind of nation... What kind of nation is this?!
- I agree!

118
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,490
- Yes! It's true.
- The state of this nation is a mess. Must we be patient?

119
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,940
- Agreed! Agreed!
- Let's just drink.

120
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,170
- Here.
- Have a cup.

121
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,770
The nation is in a mess. Only poor noblemen like us lose out.

122
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,090
Even the Noron students?

123
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,800
Definitely. If what is important to the Noron isn't this nation but their political faction,

124
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,550
what is more important to those men isn't their faction but their individual future.

125
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,910
Plus this won't stop at the students, Ja Dong.

126
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,050
Pardon?

127
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,250
Hey, hey.  Upon listening, this doesn't seem like something just to be tolerated.

128
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,740
Let's gather our wills and at least go on a strike. What do you think?

129
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,020
- Yes!
- Agreed!

130
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,460
Let's meet at Sungkyunkwan by 1 PM tomorrow.

131
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,570
Today, to re-right the nation's fallen law,

132
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,310
we decided to go on a strike.

133
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,670
Sungkyunkwan students are on a strike? The student president is a Noron, so how could that happen?

134
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,890
That is... the student president, too, has participated in the strike.

135
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,200
A Noron student joined them?

136
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,430
Wait a second, Your Excellency. I'm not done yet.

137
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,700
We might not be able to do anything about illegal answer grading,

138
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,470
but leaking the exam question is a small offense by comparison.

139
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,250
My nephew-in-law is involved in it, so couldn't you...

140
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,000
Inspector General, how can you say that in this situation?!

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,570
This is not the time to worry about your nephew-in-law.

142
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,810
Your position is not safe either.

143
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,560
Pardon?

144
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,400
Your Excellency. Your Excellency!

145
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,890

146
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,400
Just what is going on? Who the heck are they?

147
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,300
I am told they are the fathers of the scholars.

148
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,670
They all are saying their kids got treated wrong.

149
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,370
What a crazy bunch...

150
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,410
How can they put their personal needs before the greater good?

151
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,190
You should talk...

152
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,530
The petition for requesting a fair investigation was filed with Saheonbu.

153
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,790
This, too, will be processed according to the Saheonbu rules, Chief Inspector.

154
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,790
Stop.

155
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,790
They are the fathers of the scholars who lost their chance due to the exam corruption.

156
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,890
I saw quite a bit of people from Noron.

157
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,400
What tearful displays of fatherly affection.

158
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,840
Why wouldn't it be since their family's rise or fall is on the line, too?

159
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,670
Is this also Your Highness's doing?

160
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,200
You're not the only one who can turn the tables.

161
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,230
I made a mistake, sorry.

162
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,070
I underestimated Your Highness.

163
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:12,580
Do you think you can take the throne by doing it?

164
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,720
Indeed, threatening is more suited for you.

165
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,600
You will greatly regret it.

166
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,830
That may be.

167
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,750
People who pursue great power always have a huge regret.

168
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,150
But even so,

169
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,760
I will become the king.

170
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,180
Even if I regret it,

171
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,340
I'll do it as I look down on you from the throne.

172
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,320
 Did you say you wish to seat Prince Yeoning on the royal throne?

173
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,540
 That's right.

174
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:00,790
 Not Prince Yeonryeong, but Prince Yeoning. I believe he must be the one to become king.

175
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,000
Prince Yeoning.

176
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,110
Prince Yeoning?!

177
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,480
Did you say Prince Yeoning?

178
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
Who did you recommend as the heir? Prince Yeoning?

179
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,910
Your Excellency, please listen to me.

180
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,280
What more do I have to listen to?

181
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,040
Stop with your nonsense and leave immediately!

182
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,320
The weather isn't even hot yet, but I already need a fan.

183
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,190
Just hear me out.

184
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,990
If we put Prince Yeoning on the throne, then we can backstab Minister of the Interior, Min Jin Heon.

185
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,620
- What?
 - Think about it.

186
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,590
Right now, the Minister of the Interior controls the Norons.

187
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,700
You are the leader of the faction. Does this make any sense?

188
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,590
But if you succeed in pushing Prince Yeoning as the heir,

189
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,750
you can take over the royal court.

190
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,990
If we strike preemptively, then we'll become the king-makers.

191
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,640
No. Even so, we can't.

192
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,920
Prince Yeoning is lowly born.

193
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,000
Even if we can endure that sickening fact,

194
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,780
what rationale do you have on our side?

195
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,900
What about the previous king?

196
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,850
What?

197
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,550
What if the previous king appointed Prince Yeoning as his successor?

198
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,700
- Where's Father?
 - He's waiting for you, Madam.

199
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,040
Father, you wanted to tell me something urgent about His Highness?

200
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,960
A while ago, Inspector General Lee Yi Gyeom came to see me.

201
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,110
He brought up a very uncomfortable story.

202
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,040
Why would the Inspector General...

203
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,600
What's going on?

204
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,500
What did you do?

205
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,860
He was useless, so I just took care of him.

206
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,380
Because of the exam corruption, Min Jin Heon and the Norons

207
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,490
are no longer interested in this prisoner.

208
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,400
Even so, if you kill someone at homeâ€”

209
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,650
I've already held it in for a long time!

210
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,080
At your request, I diligently

211
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,780
saved the bastards I wanted to kill

212
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,110
and did as much as I could.

213
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,760
King material! King material!

214
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,020
So I could prove that I'm king material!

215
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,590
Pull yourself together.

216
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,530
Yes, you've already done really well until now.

217
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,540
Now, the throne is right before your eyes.

218
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,140
Don't bulls*t me!

219
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,390
That bastard Prince Yeoning is about to take away my throne!

220
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,270
Give me the 	"Record of the Dead."

221
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,310
Now we're doing things my way.

222
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,190
King material?

223
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,680
Don't make me laugh.

224
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,770
If I become the king no matter what method I use,

225
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,590
that makes me king material.

226
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,580
Is anyone there?

227
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,350
Oh, you're here. Come in.

228
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,820
Come inside. It's very pretty.

229
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,740
What is?

230
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,370
Here, this is it.

231
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,850
What is this?

232
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,640
Your clothes.

233
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,770
Didn't you say you have to act like a nobleman for your work?

234
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,800
He said his clothes were too big and looked uncomfortable on you, so he asked me to make it smaller to fit your body.

235
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,440
It seems it bothered him.

236
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,790
I'm fine though.

237
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,140
His Highness is not fine with it though.

238
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,200
Hurry and try it on.

239
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,040
I really don't have pride.

240
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,960
When the man I like asked me to tailor clothes for the woman he is attentive to,

241
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,020
I'm smiling and doing this.

242
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,920
A woman he's attentive to?

243
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,880
Who is that?

244
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,840
Seeing that you don't understand these words, you are really dense.

245
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,900
I do hear that I'm dense pretty often, but...

246
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,550
Cho Hong, hereâ€”

247
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,290
How could you enter without signaling first?

248
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,410
Just turn around and leave.

249
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,970
Yes. Understood.

250
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,880
Gosh.

251
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,890
Give it to me.

252
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,510
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were there.

253
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,930
It's okay. You didn't mean to do it.

254
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,780
What?

255
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,230
Even though you're a well known philanderer, you didn't mean to do that.

256
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,460
Aren't we pledge brothers?

257
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,120
Pledge brothers?

258
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,270
So that's why it's okay?

259
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,070
Yes. I will forgive you.

260
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,410
Okay. Thank you so much.

261
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,280
Then I'll get going.

262
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,460
I'm drinking with Sungkyunkwan students.

263
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,240
I'm going to scope out their movements a bit more.

264
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,480
Hold on. Wait a second.

265
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,940
You put your gat on wrong.

266
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,680
To a nobleman, his clothes represent his status.

267
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,490
Did I wear it wrong?

268
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,720
Come over here.

269
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,220
I can fix it myself.

270
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,880
You have to learn first.

271
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,990
A gat must be put on like this,

272
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,850
aligned to your headbaâ€”

273
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,120
Tying it... It'll be better if you did it.

274
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,930
You said you will properly teach me.

275
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,290
This much... is everything you need to know.

276
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,190
I don't think so.

277
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,380
Then, go on.

278
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,350
Be careful.

279
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,610
Then, is this okay?

280
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,910
You said you would properly teach me.

281
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,320
What's wrong with me?

282
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,630
They're not even the ribbons on a top, but ribbons on a gat.

283
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,890
And that kid's Yeo Ji.

284
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,530
Am I going crazy?

285
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,890
You must hand this directly to His Majesty.

286
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,410
Yes, Your Highness.

287
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,200
It's me. I will come in for a moment.

288
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,030
- What is it?
 - Is it true?

289
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,440
That you will become His Majesty's heir.

290
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,660
Did you really make up your mind?

291
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,030
Where exactly did you... Who said such a thing?

292
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,150
Answer me. I should know about this too.

293
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,170
- I will need to quickly enter the palace and see His Majesty.
 - I will take you.

294
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,840
No, check on what the Norons are up to,

295
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,240
why Inspector General Lee Yi Gyeom stepped up, and who is behind it.

296
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,640
Yes, Your Highness.

297
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,630
Hyung-nim, Prince Yeoning is on the move.

298
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,390
What are you going to do? You have to make a decision.

299
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,960
 But is it really the case?

300
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,870
 The brutal rule of the nobles who attained government posts through corruption,

301
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:27,010
 wouldn't it eventually reach you and your family and the subjects you beguiled in the streets today?

302
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,610
 But at least be on the side of the people.

303
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,600
 At least don't stab people like you in the back.

304
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,480

305
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,650
But that... that...

306
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,410
Please help us, Your Highness.

307
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,630
If you, the elder of the palace, step up, then that will be reason enough.

308
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,350
But Prince Yeoningâ€”

309
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,040
The one I cared for is the late Prince Yeonryeong.

310
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,110
Prince Yeoning... does not have the right qualifications.

311
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,620
Then are you going to support Prince Milpoong?

312
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,280
It's undeniable that His Majesty cannot bear a son.

313
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,590
If you don't make a decision now, Prince Milpoong will ascend the throne.

314
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:31,250
Did the preceding king really say those words?

315
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,720
That he would give the throne to Prince Yeoning?

316
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,830
I swear with my life and my family's name upon it, Your Highness.

317
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:47,280
I am certain that he commanded me so during our private conversation.

318
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,640
It's impossible.

319
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,050
His Majesty did not even seek you, yet you wish to enter the king's palace at this hour?

320
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,080
There's not a minute to waste!

321
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,410
Do you not hear me telling you to step away, Chief Royal Secretary?

322
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,850
When the day breaks, formally request a meeting and greet him.

323
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,110
This is against the law!

324
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,720
Get out of the way!

325
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,800
Let's go, Your Excellency.

326
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,150
Must I... call the guards?

327
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,570
Step aside, Chief Royal Secretary.

328
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,250
Q-Queen Dowager.

329
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,760
Let the prime minister and inspector general in.

330
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,700
This is a crucial matter that influences the future of the royal family.

331
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,440
Did you say the prime minister and inspector general? At this hour?

332
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

333
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,820
Turn them away!

334
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,240
How dare they? This is the king's palace!

335
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,770
This is against the law.

336
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,810
His Excellency Kim Chang Joong and Lee Yi Gyeom at the king's quarters?

337
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,240
I'm not sure what it is at this hour, but I thought Your Excellency should know so I ran over.

338
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,380
For what reason are they meeting the king? Why?

339
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:07,220
Wh-What did you just say?

340
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,680
Enthrone whom?

341
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,740
Prince Yeoning, who is the second son of the preceding king.

342
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,840
Please make him your royal brother who will become the crown prince.

343
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,940
I am saying this for the royal family and this nation's safety and prosperity, Your Majesty.

344
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,230
Prince Yeoning?

345
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,430
You, who are Noron,

346
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,990
are recommending Prince Yeoning as my heir?

347
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,490
Who are you guys?

348
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,980
Who are you?

349
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,650
He's crazy, that man!

350
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,870
Take cover!

351
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,860
You there! What the heck are you doing!

352
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,700
Stop!

353
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,480
Kill.  Kill.

354
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,670
You... you're...

355
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:59,560

356
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,670
Kill...

357
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,700
Dal Moon.

358
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,690

359
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:31,050
â™«  You whom I love  â™«

360
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,740
â™«  Become the moon light  â™«

361
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,330
 We can't leave the crown prince position open any longer.

362
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,660
 How can the nobles of Joseon bow their heads before the offspring of a low-born?

363
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,220
 In the end, you will be after my neck in this palace.

364
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,570
 I can only think about the safety of Joseon.

365
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,960
 Will you just stand by and watch Prince Yeoning become the heir?

366
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,930
 You can't be it. Even if it's not me, at least you can't be it!

367
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,610
 You will die or I will die.

368
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,530
 Treason? From the beginning, you wanted to become Noron's king!

369
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,380
 - What are you doing?
- You should hide for now.

370
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,490
 I won't do that. Tonight, a fight that will put everyone's life at risk will start.
