1
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,260
Blood. There was a blood stain here?

2
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,410
Yes. Over here.

3
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,900
Aekjeongseo  (Palace Custodian's Office)  cleaned it at the request of the King's Physician's Office a few days ago.

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,170
King's Physician's Office?

5
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,500

6
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,870
 There hasn't been any report of him leaving the palace.

7
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,790
 That means he's definitely still here.

8
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,530
Just why? To do what?

9
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,100

10
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,360

11
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
No way...

12
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,630
Madam!

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,770
How's the palace?  How's that matter going?

14
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,390
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

15
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,910
Are you alright, Majesty?

16
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,890
Can you recognize me?

17
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,360
Q-Queen...

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,230
Who's out there? Call the physician at once!

19
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,470
Yes, Your Excellency.

20
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,940
Your Majesty, you must drink this medicine.

21
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,160
Hurry.

22
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,740
No! Stop right now, Your Highness!

23
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,320
Crown Prince, what are you doing?

24
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,300
- Your Highness!
 - You must get that medicine away from him.

25
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,140
We must not let His Majesty drink the medicine from the King's Physician's Office!

26
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,940
Your Majesty!  Please try and rouse yourself.

27
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,190
It's me, the crown prince.

28
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,450
Your Highness, get away from him.

29
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,400
You are not allowed to touch His Majesty willy-nilly.

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,240
I can't let him be, Right State Councilor!  This is not the time for this!

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,280
Then what time is this for?

32
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,300
When His Majesty is deathly ill,

33
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,570
are you saying we should be throwing away the medicine to cure him?

34
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,580
Why?  For what?

35
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,290
I am asking you whether you used the herbs as Prince Milpoong instructed you.

36
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,530
Please give me what you promised me first.

37
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,240
I have to put my life on the line, too.

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,070
I have to check the payment first.

39
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,710
 Please step back, Right State Councilor!

40
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,350
There may be a problem with His Majesty's medicine.

41
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,330
What do you mean?  A problem with the medicine!

42
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,710
What are you basing your statement on?

43
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,660
It is not certain, but the night Prince Milpoong was arrested,

44
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,050
he might have gone to the King's Physician's Office.

45
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,300
- Prince Milpoong?
 - Do you understand?

46
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,710
So until everything is clarified, he must not drink the medicine.

47
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,300
Your Majesty.

48
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:33,930

49
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,810

50
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,520

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,550
I am a Saheonbu inspector, Park Moon Soo, here to answer the crown prince's call.

52
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,830
Please enter.

53
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,030
Your Highness.

54
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,180
His Majesty lost his consciousness?  Why suddenly?

55
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,050
- Your Excellency Left State Councilor. 
- Call the king's physician right away.

56
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,330
We must find out what this is about, why the crown prince forbade the medicine.

57
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,640
Yes.

58
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,400
It was surely human blood?

59
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,980
Yes, I wasn't sure when I saw it at night time.

60
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,880
But when I saw it the next day, it definitely was not animal blood.

61
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,770
Of course, we cannot be certain just based on that.

62
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,940
However, if that night, Prince Milpoong who pushed to the edge

63
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,800
headed toward the king's physician's office...

64
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,560
Tan bought a most potent prison from Qing.

65
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,150
There is a possibility that he passed it on to someone in the King's Physician's Office.

66
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,870
You are saying His Majesty's sudden illness

67
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,420
may have something to do with Prince Milpoong.

68
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,210
Because that cornered bastard might actually have put that poison to use.

69
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,310
So you must investigate Prince Milpoong, Wi Byeong Joo, and Do Ji Gwang again.

70
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,700
There is one more.

71
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,070
Prince Milpoong's mistress who ran away.

72
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,720
You mean that woman called Chae Yoon Yeong?

73
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,910
Yes.  She knew everything about Prince Milpoong, and now she's nowhere to be found.

74
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,780
That woman, Chae Yoon Yeong.

75
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,470
Where have you been?

76
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,500
Outside.  It was so stuffy so I went for some fresh air.

77
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,050
The capital is still dangerous.  Soldiers are looking for you...

78
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,130
You said you'd protect me.

79
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,660
You said you'd help me.

80
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,090
Frankly, that day

81
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,270
I blamed you,

82
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,390
because I thought you ruined everything for me.

83
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,960
But a human heart is so frail.

84
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,070
What would have happened to me if I stayed by Prince Milpoong's side?

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,820
I am glad I am alive.

86
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,700
Hope springs eternal.

87
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,060
Thanks to you.

88
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,760
 His Highness the Crown Prince is coming.

89
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,580
Everybody must have heard that His Majesty took to bed because of a sudden illness.

90
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,410
Therefore, until His Majesty gets better,

91
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,730
for lack of a better option, I will have to preside over

92
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,220
the court meetings for the time being.

93
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,010
The most urgent thing for now is to discover the cause of the illness and to treat it.

94
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,180
- Moreover, for the confused court—
- Pardon me, Your Highness.

95
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,940
May I ask you a question before that?

96
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,340
I have heard that His Majesty is gravely ill right now.

97
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,430
What is the reason the medicine prepared by the King's Physician's Office is not being used despite the grave situation?

98
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,520
According to strange rumors being passed around, the one who prohibited the medicine was you—

99
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,450
That is correct.  I gave such an order.

100
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,960
The reason is because of a suspicion that His Majesty's medicine might have been poisoned.

101
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,200
Poison?

102
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,380
He is conducting an emergency investigation of the King's Physician's Office for that reason?

103
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,910
Those suspected of being involved in the matter will be reinvestigated as well.

104
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,840
Right... In that situation, use of poison may be suspected.

105
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:17,840
But is His Highness aware of what burden this matter might put on him?

106
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,620
What do you mean by burden?

107
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,120
Of course, I, too think that kind of suspicion is plausible.

108
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,070
However, if it turns out not to be the case,

109
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,210
then what happens, Your Highness?

110
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,030
If the medicine has not been poisoned,

111
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,390
if the chance to treat His Majesty's illness is lost because of that, I mean.

112
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,260
I handed down an order summoning all physicians not only of the capital but also across the country.

113
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,830
They will be able to look after His Majesty's illness.

114
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,300
What do you mean by using private doctors when there are royal physicians?

115
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,570
That is not at all appropriate.

116
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,670
There have been numerous precedents where skillful private doctors have successfully treated the royal family.

117
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,380
With all due respect, Your Highness,

118
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,050
do you even have the intention to get His Majesty's illness treated?

119
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,630
Whether I have the intention to get His Majesty's illness treated?

120
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,730
Did you just ask me that question, Right State Councilor?

121
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,770
I am sorry, but yes.

122
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:42,410
As for me, whether Your Highness is purposefully not using any medicine,

123
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,720
even such an unspeakable suspicion is occurring to me.

124
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,320
Purposefully?

125
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,400
That is such a demeaning, offensive accusation

126
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,680
to the point that, even if I were to punish you here and now for uttering it,

127
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,640
there would not be any problem.

128
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,720
Don't you agree, Right State Councilor?

129
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:31,060
However, for now, I will let it go

130
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,660
because that too must come from your loyalty to His Majesty.

131
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,510
Because right now,

132
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,170
it is as paramount to me as it must be for you

133
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,340
to save His Majesty first.

134
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,670
Your Highness.

135
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,800
How about you follow Right State Councilor Jo Tae Goo's word?

136
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,680
I have seen the king's physician.

137
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,180
He said His Majesty did not show any particular problem with his heath until lately.

138
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,080
Like you said, use of poison could be suspected.

139
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,040
But still, I should follow Right State Councilor's word?

140
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,050
What if you cannot prove the use of poison?

141
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,360
What if you cannot prove Prince Milpoong's involvement?

142
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,500
What if you cannot cure His Majesty's illness even after prohibiting the royal physicians

143
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,170
and using private doctors instead?

144
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,140
I know it will become my fault, my responsibility.

145
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,480
Then, numerous people will doubt me like Jo Tae Goo.

146
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,740
However, I am not doing this merely to be well-regarded in others' opinions.

147
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,930
Even if people misunderstand my intention,

148
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,050
I cannot overlook anything that might threaten His Majesty's...

149
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,230
No, to some things you need to turn a blind eye.

150
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,040
Taking responsibility is not the right thing to do in all occasions.

151
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,660
At times, you must learn to evade it.

152
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,630
That is what the ruler must do, Your Highness.

153
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,200
If you want to become the future sovereign,

154
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,180
you must avoid sure fire pits.

155
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,730
Being able to ignore even self-evident truths...

156
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,720
Because at times, doing that is taking real responsibility.

157
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,880
Left State Councilor...

158
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,170
Your Majesty.

159
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,450
Please, you must recover.

160
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,520
I can neither understand nor permit the crown prince's actions.

161
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,200
How could he forbid the King's Physician's Office in the midst of this?

162
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,880

163
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,330
Private doctors have gathered, so let us trust him and wait.

164
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,970
Trust him?  How?

165
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,090
Should His Majesty pass away like this, who becomes the king?

166
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,350
Is it not the crown prince?

167
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,830
Queen!  Are you saying the crown prince is doing this on purpose?

168
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,060
Yes, because I would do the same if I were him!

169
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,680
I said stop.  People are listening.

170
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,250
Queen!

171
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,160
 Queen.

172
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,850
Crown Prince.

173
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,980
Do not concern yourself with what the queen said.

174
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,730
What won't she be able to say in such a state of shock?

175
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,410
No, do not worry about my feelings.

176
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,680
What matters now is His Majesty's health.

177
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,190
If the current suspicion over the King's Physician's Office is true, would that be all?

178
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,670
Anyone can turn out to be an enemy here.

179
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,540
Go find a person from the crown prince's quarters.

180
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,710
Someone near the crown prince, who is the most trustworthy.

181
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,340
Yes, Your Highness.

182
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,400
I am going to Son and Mother Pawn Shop to see Dal Moon

183
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,750
and then leave for Prince Milpoong's place of exile.

184
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,290
Lord Yoon Hyeok will go see Wi Byeong Joo.

185
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,810
Uncle Jang Dal and I will make Do Ji Gwang open his mouth even if we have to half kill him.

186
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,830
Wow, whose men are you to be so reliable?

187
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,810
I am counting on you.  I'll see you when I return.

188
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,600
- See you later.
 - Yes.

189
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,980
- Let's go.
 - Yes.

190
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,150
Did you just say Chae Yoon Yeong?

191
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,090
Yes, Saheonbu, Capital Bureau, and even the Police Bureau are looking for her, but still, she is nowhere to be found.

192
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,850
You need to scan the back alleys for us.

193
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,740
The reason you are looking for that woman is because of what's happening in the palace now?

194
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,980
If this suspicion turns out to be true, the one who must know the details best

195
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,680
must be Chae Yoon Yeong, who ran away.

196
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,910
I will count on you, Dal Moon, to get this done.

197
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,740
What do we do, Hyung-nim?

198
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,540
Neither the crown prince nor Lord Moon Soo knows about your relationship with that woman.

199
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,390
 I am glad I am alive.

200
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,160
 Hope springs eternal.

201
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,200
 Thanks to you.

202
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,300
Bring out all medical records and medicinal ingredients right now.

203
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,330
Yes.

204
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,310
I am the head medical maid Yoon Deok.

205
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,110
These are the ingredients and vehicles used for the king's medicine.

206
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,270
I am going to seize them all and all medical maids will get investigated.

207
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,500
Yes, I will get them ready.

208
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,540
- Are they the summoned private doctors?
 - Yes.

209
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,920
Only the most competent ones were selected.

210
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,170
I have asked for your assistance since you are the most knowledgeable among us when it comes to medicine.

211
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,240
I will look this over and recommend the most suitable doctor to His Highness.

212
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,730
Yes.

213
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,530
Is he the one?

214
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,510
He is a great doctor who had treated the predecessor king's smallpox and measles.

215
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,300
I am Doctor Choi Seong Jo.

216
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,380
I, too, have heard of your renown.  Hurry and feel His Majesty's pulse.

217
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,060
Yes, Your Highness.

218
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,750
 How about you follow Right State Councilor Jo Tae Goo's word?

219
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,200
 What if you cannot prove the use of poison?

220
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,640
 What if you cannot prove Prince Milpoong's involvement?

221
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,760
 What if you cannot cure His Majesty's illness

222
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,160
 even after prohibiting the royal physicians and using private doctors instead?

223
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,860
What is wrong?

224
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,730
I am sorry but I will attempt again.

225
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,910
 Taking responsibility is not the right thing to do in all occasions.

226
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,560
 At times, you must learn to evade it.

227
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,680
 That is what the ruler must do, Your Highness.

228
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,910
 No, if I have to shirk responsibility...

229
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,460
 if that is what becoming a king is about...

230
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,690
 I would rather not set out on that road.

231
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,750
Excuse me. Is this the village where former palace ladies live?

232
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,170
Yes, it is.

233
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,170
Court Lady Han?

234
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,380
Who might you be?

235
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,440
You have a trainee named Cheon Yeo Ji here, right?

236
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,370
May I see her for a minute?

237
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,560

238
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,130
Damo Cheon.

239
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,400
Court Lady Ha.

240
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,270
Enter the palace as a maid?

241
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,920
So quickly and without going through the procedures?

242
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,780
I'll explain it on the way. We don't have time now.

243
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,740
You've been training to be a palace maid secretly.

244
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,180
You not only mastered embroidery but even mastered women's disciplines and palace rules, so this is enough.

245
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,250
It's true but...

246
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,400
If you are not ready emotionally—

247
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,850
No.

248
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,030
It is not like that.

249
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,970
My mind was made up a long time ago.

250
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,250
I'll go change. Please wait for me a bit.

251
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,540

252
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,480
Since Damo Cheon worked at Saheonbu for a long time,

253
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,800
she'll be of much better help for you and His Highness than me, a simple court lady.

254
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,700
So your name is Cheon Yeo Ji?

255
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,130
Yes, Your Highness.

256
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,670
You have a precious set of eyes.

257
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,760
They are deep and clear.

258
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,520
Living in the palace, you learn to read people.

259
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,740
I see the crown prince had many good people around him like Court Lady Ha and you.

260
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,430
Please don't mention it, Your Highness.

261
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,590
I'll take you in as my palace maid.

262
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:16,060
With my order, you can skip the procedure and move into the palace.

263
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,840
The palace is a cold place where at any time,

264
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,130
you can have a dagger thrown at you or have your neck squeezed.

265
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,740
I hope you'll spend all your energy

266
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,840
to stay next to the crown prince and protect him as you wished.

267
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,770
I will also help you with whatever I can.

268
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,670
I'll heed your words, Your Highness.

269
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,960
I will never forget your grace.

270
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,780
Don't you think you ought to tell His Highness?

271
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,010
No. I don't think it's time yet.

272
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,220
Please keep this to yourself, Ma'am.

273
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,320
You came.

274
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,980
- Your Highness. 
 - As you ordered, I gathered capable physicians from all localities.

275
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,480
His Majesty's condition is grave, so do your best.

276
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,710
Understood, Your Highness.

277
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,080
 I am saying I will become a palace maid.

278
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,130
 That's how I can get into the palace.

279
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,510
 What do you mean a palace maid? Do you even know what it means?

280
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,490
 I do.

281
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,950
 I want to

282
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,900
 protect you.

283
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,630
 But you still can't be a palace maid.

284
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,700
 As it has been, women should be protected by men.

285
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,020
For not obeying your words,

286
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,250
I am sorry, Your Highness.

287
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,070
 Before I'm a woman, I'm a damo (tea maid, female investigator).

288
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,740
 Before I'm the crown prince, what if I'm a man?

289
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,380
 Pardon me?

290
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,720
 Yes.  Even if it is like this, it's nice.

291
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,860
 Feeling the same wind as you.

292
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,090
I, too,

293
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,200
like it even if it is like this.

294
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,630
Being next you...

295
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,020
and able to do something for you.

296
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,010
No!

297
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,690
Who's out there?

298
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,980
No!

299
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,370
No! I can't go.

300
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:53,520
I can't die. I won't die. I can't die just yet.

301
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,720
I won't die, won't die.

302
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,450
No, no. I did wrong.

303
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,800
Go, go away.

304
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,150
You are pathetic.

305
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,230
You are a small man without the will to fight.

306
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,170
Who are you?

307
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,660

308
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,040
What to do?

309
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,120
Should I take this pathetic man with me... or not?

310
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,660
Wi Byeong Joo.

311
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,190
Yoon Hyeok?

312
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,540
Inspector Yoon!

313
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:52,400
Is it true His Majesty is gravely ill?

314
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,910
Is that why you came here?

315
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,810
How do you know that?

316
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,350
I've told you everything...

317
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,710
How many more times do I need to tell you?

318
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,310
You expect me to believe that the poison doesn't have an antidote?!

319
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,710
You better tell me the truth!

320
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,740
Forget it if you don't want to believe me.

321
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,020
Prince Milpoong wanted the poison,

322
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:28,320
and I only handed him the strongest poison without antidote.

323
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,960
I think he's telling the truth.

324
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,510
So what you are saying is that Prince Milpoong put that into His Majesty's medicine?

325
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,390
How could I know that when I only ran the errand?

326
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:56,120
Hold on. So... our King is about to die?

327
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:01,110
Then I guess Prince Milpoong put it in there.

328
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,950
What?

329
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,780
There's nothing you can do about it.

330
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,750
It's all over now.

331
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,640
Uncle...

332
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,090
Tell me. No one will care if you die here.

333
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,740
So tell me.

334
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,040
You are the one who used the poison, aren't you?

335
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,500
Through whom and where did you use it?
