1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,150
Is it you, Min Jin Heon, who made this political maneuver?

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,820
Answer me, Left State Councilor.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,340
The petition for regency...

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,250
I'm asking if that was your doing.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,080
You can leave now.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,620
Do you know who that is?

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,080
It's the Royal Secretariat's transcriber.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,490
If I made this political move,

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:50,150
then why would I have received and read a transcribed petition?

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,360
It means that it isn't me, Your Highness.

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,180
It means that I, too, cannot tell who is behind this.

12
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,270
- Dal Moon.
 - I was scoping out what Prince Milpoong was up to.

13
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,770
I found out that he was working to trap the crown prince in a corner.

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,380
Was that it? Regency.

15
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,430
Starting with that, you want to bring the crown prince down?

16
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,810
But why did you... not warn him?

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,560
Even though you knew, you didn't tell the crown prince.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,460
Seduction.

19
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,900
I could have been entranced by something again and have lost my mind.

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,070

21
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,940
Looking at your face, it seems that you have not found a way to live.

22
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,370
 Sometimes because of desire,

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,740
Execute as the royal command states.

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,270
 sometimes because of fear,

25
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:24,640
human beings always get seduced, even though they know it will go wrong.

26
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,840
It is also for you as well.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,590
I am being sincere.

28
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,200
The crown prince will not become king.

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,290
Standing on Prince Milpoong's side is your path to live.

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,650
Thankfully because the crown prince trusts you, you can use it to—

31
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,730
Yes, the crown prince probably trusts me.

32
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,180
No matter what I say.

33
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,110
At last, has it become possible for me to give you what you want?

34
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,470
Yes... It's not Min Jin Heon.

35
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,110
His face showed as much shock as mine did.

36
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,980
 But is Prince Milpoong really not up to anything suspicious?

37
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,570
 No, nothing.

38
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,080
 All he did was visit gisaeng houses and get drunk.

39
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,260
Dal Moon.

40
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,870
There is no way he is wrong.

41
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,770
Then if it is not even Prince Milpoong, who would?

42
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,660
Who would do such a thing?

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,850
Please move out of the way.

44
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,100
I'm sorry. Please move out of the way.

45
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,840
Gosh, are you okay?

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,990
Darn it.

47
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,400
It was going so well, so what is this out of the blue?

48
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,630
Just what is this?

49
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,250
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,830
Lord Moon Soo.

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,840
This is a list of people who were removed from office by Wi Byeong Joo all these times.

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,820
- What is special about it?
 - They are all Soron.

53
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,620
Mostly, they were removed from office due to manipulated charges.

54
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,690
It smells extremely rotten.

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,540
It won't be a problem to punish Wi Byeong Joo with just this.

56
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,560
No. There definitely are bribes that he received.

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,280
We must reveal that as well to its end.

58
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,280
You are saying let's make sure that he won't be able to hold office again, right?

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,110
Of course. This kind of person should be stripped naked even down to his underwear.

60
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,030
Lord Moon Soo! Yeo Ji!

61
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,520
What's wrong, Ah Bong?

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,370
Th-There's a big problem, My Lord.

63
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,080
At the palace... regency... Crown Prince is...

64
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,100
What are you talking about, Ah Bong? What about the crown prince?

65
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,100
Your Highness!

66
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,070
Your Highness! Crown Prince!

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,550
You... really did not know either?

68
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,850
Of course not. Regency?

69
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,610
Your position and your power are still at a disadvantage, so how would we?

70
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,000
It is true that we placed you in that seat, but honestly, you did not even recognize our loyalty.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,940
Yes, we feel wronged.

72
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,250
If anything, I would regret recommending you to be the crown prince, but I—

73
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,240
Your Excellency!

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,080
Your Highness.

75
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,180
Crown Prince, at the palace right now...

76
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,830
Left State Councilor, it seems that the Sorons are making a move.

77
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,210
We knew this would happen in the end.

78
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,000
Why wouldn't it?

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,230
It's the crown prince that the Norons Kim Chang Joong and Lee Yi Gyeom put up.

80
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,230
We must give a severe warning to the crown prince

81
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,030
to show what happens if the crown prince dares to look towards the king's throne!

82
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,850
Of course, we must.

83
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,140
His Majesty feels the same way.

84
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,140
Did you read through the whole petition?

85
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,610
What do you think, Crown Prince?

86
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:01,350
About the statement that says that I should hand over the nation's affairs to you.

87
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,240
Your Majesty, this is nothing but the most depraved form of treason.

88
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,880
Do not confuse your heart with these backstabbing lies.

89
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,200
Backstabbing lies?

90
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,660
How is this so?

91
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,940
I think that this advice is appropriate.

92
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,900
You actually gained the hearts of the people at the giro party  (annual party held in honor of retired high government officials) ,

93
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,130
and tried to reform the Three Offices' corruption

94
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,250
in place of me, the king.

95
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,270
Your Majesty, that is preposterous.

96
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,150
- I merely— 
- Therefore I

97
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,350
am going to accept this advice, Crown Prince.

98
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,550
I am thinking about giving you regency to control the nation's affairs.

99
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,340
- Your Majesty.
 - Head Eunuch, enter!

100
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,960
Now sit here

101
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,480
and take over the nation's affairs, Crown Prince.

102
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,480
I, as all have wished,

103
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,740
will be a step behind you.

104
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,990
How does this make sense?

105
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,150
Because of this mere petition, the crown prince is backed into a corner?

106
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,580
His Majesty has lived all his life worrying about if and when he would get dethroned.

107
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,920
Suspecting the crown prince was probably bound to happen.

108
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,750
However, our Crown Prince is not someone who would do this!

109
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,720
You know that those words have no meaning at the palace.

110
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:23,270
So... the crown prince... What did he say he will do now?

111
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,790
There is no other way but to beg and beg again

112
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,120
to retract the command of regency.

113
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,700
Hoping that this misunderstanding will clear,

114
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,580
there is no other way but to bow down and beg.

115
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,500
Seokgodaejwoe?

116
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,180
Are you talking about that?

117
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,230
What did he do wrong?

118
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,640
Why must His Highness show himself crumbling down and pleading in front of everyone?

119
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,130

120
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,280

121
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,990

122
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,630
Have you heard?

123
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,090
The crown prince has started seokgodaejwoe in front of the king's quarters.

124
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,880
He wouldn't have any other way.

125
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,010
At this juncture, when His Majesty's distrust has become fierce,

126
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,780
in what other way would the crown prince be able to overcome the crisis?

127
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,930
- What should we do, Your Excellency?  Should we seize the chance and with Sorons, expel—
 - No.

128
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,530
Let's leave this up to Sorons this time.

129
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,650
Where this wind comes from,

130
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,890
before we find that out, we cannot make a hasty move.

131
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,510
Even if we don't step forward,

132
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,470
His Majesty and the Sorons will make plenty of attacks on the crown prince.

133
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,340
Do you suspect me as well, Teacher?

134
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,050
That I covet the throne and

135
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,720
aim for His Majesty?

136
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,430
Like what you said to me

137
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,140
on the day we first met.

138
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,810
"That is the reason why I cannot trust you."

139
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,870
 That is the reason why I cannot trust you.

140
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,020
 The fact that

141
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,150
 - you might covet the king's authority. 
- I might covet the king's authority.

142
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,680
 Does that mean if I can prove ability, at least you can accept me?

143
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,400
 What if I show you the qualities of a king governing his nation?

144
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,580
 What hurt her so much!

145
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,450
 For what reason did she have to hold that dagger in her hand!

146
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,960
 Before making her pay for her crime

147
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,990
 I wanted to know that first.

148
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,590
 May I tell you about my idea?

149
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,300
 I mean a method that can make this rarely seized chance

150
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,520
 work out the way His Majesty wants.

151
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,730
 The reason I cannot accept you is not because you are a lowly born prince.

152
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,370
 Ability rather than blood

153
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,710
 comes first for the sake of this country.

154
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,250
 However, is this the inevitable end?

155
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
 Does it mean

156
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,330
 in the end I can do nothing?

157
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,310
Court Lady.

158
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,370
I was waiting for you.  I thought you'd come.

159
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,420
How is His Highness the Crown Prince?

160
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,360
You won't be able to see him today.

161
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,650
No, even if from afar,

162
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,720
even if just to see how he's faring...

163
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,130
I am not trying to defy the royal command.

164
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,260
However, as his teachers,

165
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,090
shouldn't we at least

166
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,510
try to protect the crown prince?

167
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,590
Are you asking me to persuade His Majesty right now?

168
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,690
I am extremely sorry, but we are lacking and we cannot think of any other solution.

169
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,510
Please persuade His Majesty to change his heart.

170
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,110
His Majesty is not a hard-hearted person to begin with.

171
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,160
It's just that he's being extra alert because of the confused state of the nation—

172
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,550
How would we not know that, Your Highness?

173
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,730
However, this is not the time for it.

174
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,080
Those who want to alienate His Majesty and the crown prince will run even more rampant.

175
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,660
Even if just for the sake of this country and the royal family, that must be stopped at all cost.

176
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,540
It is raining.

177
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,800
Darn it, they say when it rains, it pours.

178
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,450
Then is His Highness getting soaked by this rain?

179
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,260
Your Highness...

180
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,630
Even though you told me not to ask you anything,

181
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,100
still I must know.

182
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,450
Yes, if that is your decision, Hyung-nim, I should follow it.  I will.

183
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:01,490
But are you really abandoning His Highness?

184
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,160
No matter what rootless beggar bastards we are,

185
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
still, this isn't right.

186
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,130
Hyung-nim Dal Moon!

187
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,730

188
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,720
Who can it be?

189
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,890
The one who planned this.

190
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,550

191
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,130
Will this be the end?

192
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,870
Is that really true, Prince Milpoong?

193
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm telling you yes.  Regency?

194
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,080
It's all clever strategy that came from this head.

195
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,590
Even so, what is the reason you are telling me this?

196
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,400
What will you do if I report you to the Saheonbu?

197
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,430
Because you won't be able to do that, Deputy Inspector General Wi Byeong Joo of Saheonbu.

198
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:36,060
You've been thrown under the wagon already.

199
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,220
You just came out of getting investigated for corruption.

200
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,070
Soon, you will be stripped of that uniform that you're so proud of.

201
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,100
I am very familiar with the light in your eyes.

202
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,530
It resembles mine that I can see

203
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,360
in the looking glass.

204
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,780
Considering how you clambered up there, you won't just let yourself fall from there.

205
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,680
Like me, you must want to chew up the crown prince, too.

206
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,750
What do you plan to do?

207
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,000
You won't be able to drag him down merely through the regency petition.

208
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,970
But it is not merely just that one that I prepared.

209
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,510
How's your family reacting?  What does His Excellency Lee Yi Gyeom say?

210
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,150
Gloomy as if we have a death in the family.  He doesn't seem to have a solution.

211
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,330
How about His Excellency Kim Chang Joong?  Is your grandfather the same way?

212
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,420
How did they get involved with the crown prince to bring this calamity?

213
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,850
I'm afraid our families might be negatively affected at this rate.

214
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,910
Hey, this guy, saying such unlucky things...

215
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,810
Here comes more alcohol.

216
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,610
- Drink your fill.
 - Oh, this expensive alcohol...

217
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,290
Get drunk to your heart's content.

218
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,560
Oh, thank you.

219
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,220
I will hand over this nation's Saheonbu to you, Deputy Inspector General Wi.

220
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,120
If you become my lackey and destroy the crown prince with me, that is.

221
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,120
Everything is here.

222
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,470
All the preparation to behead that bastard, Crown Prince Lee Geum.

223
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,450
Your Highness!  With this, you can immediately blow...

224
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,260
No.

225
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,620
Not today.

226
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,070
Maybe around tomorrow?

227
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,210
This thing called seokgodaejwoe  (prostrating oneself on a straw mat and awaiting the king's disposition) ,

228
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,190
I hear undergoing it just for an hour will bring pain that seems to break down your whole being

229
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,520
to the point that you would rather cut off your own limbs.

230
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:54,020
At least through tonight, the crown prince should stay before the king's quarters.

231
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,690
Lee Geum will have to experience true blood-boiling pain

232
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:05,560
for that bastard to also realize the final truth.

233
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
King?

234
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,430
Not in a million years.

235
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,040
He should know he's nothing but a lowly critter.

236
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:40,140
Your Highness, please stand up already.

237
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,800
At this rate, you will ruin your health.

238
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,610
Leave me.

239
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,850
Your Highness, please.

240
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,860
Please!

241
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,140
What are you doing?

242
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,420
Hurry...

243
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,150
Your Highness.

244
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,960
Your Highness, no.

245
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,070
Your Highness!  Your Highness!

246
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,020
Queen Dowager!  But what you are saying is...

247
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:32,370
If I may speak, I think I know how you feel

248
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,450
and also how the crown prince feels.

249
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:41,480
You lived through the fear and constant threat of being deposed any time.

250
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,630
So, Your Majesty, how come you, who know that pain better than anyone else,

251
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:51,480
are about to inflict the same pain on the crown prince?

252
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,140
Are you saying I am tormenting my brother?

253
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,430
Your Majesty, you know the right path.

254
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,590
Right now, your royal heart is simply misguided by malicious words.

255
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,330
Queen Dowager.

256
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,710
Your Majesty, I have an urgent message.

257
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,640
What is it?

258
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,240
Your Majesty, I think you need to hurry over to a place.

259
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,830
What on earth is this information on treason?

260
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,100
It came from Saheonbu.  Deputy Inspector General Wi of Saheonbu...

261
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,950
Assistant Officer!

262
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,930
Your Majesty!

263
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,010
What is all this being said?

264
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:46,120
Treason?  Traitors have been caught?

265
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,830
Why are the Saheonbu soldiers on the move?

266
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,510
Lord, have you seen?  Wi Byeong Joo has been released.

267
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,470
What?  How could he?

268
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,740
After investigation, while he was waiting for the disciplinary action, he got his hands on a tip-off

269
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,950
and that is supposedly about a case of treason.

270
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,710
Wi Byeong Joo, what on earth are you scheming!

271
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,150
- Arrest them all.
- Yes!

272
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,500
Who are you?

273
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,170
Let me go.  Let go of me!

274
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,850
Let me go.

275
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,250
Father!

276
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,040
What are you doing?  What are you doing to my son right now?

277
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,000
Father, what is going on?

278
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,490
You scoundrels dare to!

279
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,460
Grandfather!  Grandfather, it wasn't me!

280
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,290
Hey, you rascals!  Stop that already!

281
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,690
Rascals!  What do you mean my grandson plotted treason?

282
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,570
This is a false charge!

283
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,940
I said a false charge.

284
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,130
You rascals...

285
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,660

286
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,040
Why don't you have some water before continuing on?

287
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:58,820
I, your humble servant, am afraid that you might ruin your health this way.

288
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,680
Tan...

289
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,180
You have to endure this, Hyung-nim.

290
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,510
You have to get chased out by me in a humiliating way.

291
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,750
But what am I going to do if, before that, you go and die on me?

292
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,710
No.

293
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,750
Then I will be too disappointed.

294
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:40,300
Why don't you worry about yourself first, Prince Milpoong?

295
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,220
So that you won't feel disappointed,

296
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:54,480
I will for sure

297
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,420
do you the favor of killing you.

298
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,360
Here comes His Majesty!

299
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,860
Your Majesty.

300
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,310
Still, I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt.

301
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,260
That you might not be my political enemy but be my younger brother.

302
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:02,980
However, you tried to point a sword at me!

303
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,280
In the end, coveting the throne, you planned treason!

304
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:38,290

305
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:44,700
♫  You whom I love  ♫

306
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,570
♫  Become the moon light  ♫

307
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,720
 Since he planned to assassinate the king and usurp the throne,

308
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,460
 I command the installation of a special prosecuting unit, the State Tribunal.

309
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,300
 The crown prince is not the predecessor king's son?

310
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,000
 Here and there, everywhere is plastered with these scandalous bulletins.

311
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,830
 Tell me. When you f__k up like this, there must be a reason.

312
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,710
 The head of the treasonous bunch is the crown prince!

313
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,820
 Until that name comes out, keep torturing them!

314
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,700
 Can the crown prince still hang on?

315
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,280
 I can't let things work out the way Prince Milpoong planned it .

316
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,940
 This fight that he picked with me... I am going to win it no matter what.
