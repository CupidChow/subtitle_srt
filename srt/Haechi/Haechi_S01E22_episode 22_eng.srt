1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,590
Where is His Majesty?

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,450
It's been almost an hour already.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,690
Is the king trying to consult with us or not?

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,730
Your Excellency Right State Councilor.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,430
 Here comes His Majesty.

6
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,960
Because of business, I did not have time to put on my royal robe.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,650
Then, shall we begin now?

8
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,720
 Here comes His Highness the Crown Prince.

9
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,020
Crown Prince?  Why would he come here?

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,490
Now, now, let's at least rise.

11
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,430
Crown Prince?

12
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,070
Why is he here?

13
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,470
 Did you just ask me to participate in the giro party? 
(Annual party held in honor of retired high government officials)

14
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,790
 Yes, go and show them that you are still going strong as the crown prince.

15
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,340
 - However, Your Majestyâ€”
 - I am going to fend this off,

16
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,290
 so meanwhile, you guard your own position.

17
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,900
 How do you propose to do this?

18
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,440
 I am going to bear responsibility as the king.

19
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,950
 Because when I allowed you to do what you proposed, it became the king's command.

20
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,290
 Your Majesty!

21
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,890
I shall not take that under advisement.

22
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,620
I shall not allow any counsel related to deposing the crown prince.

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,090
- Your Majesty!
 - The crown prince

24
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,440
knew of the master-killer band's existence but still shielded it.

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,910
How can the country's noble class serve such a crown prince?

26
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,400
What the heck is going on?

27
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,870
 Show them that you are still going strong as the crown prince.

28
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,620
 However, if I do, Your Majesty will...

29
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,660
Does that mean you support the master-killer band, too, Your Majesty?

30
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,920
Shielding the master-killer band

31
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,370
is as good as considering this country's noble class as your enemy.

32
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,690
The crown prince did not try to shield the master-killer band.

33
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,900
If not, then what is it?

34
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,120
Were you privy to what was going on, too, Your Majesty?

35
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,840
Did you allow it, Your Majesty?

36
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,590
What nonsense.

37
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,900
Your Excellency the Mayor of Hanseong, watch what you're saying!  You're in the presence of His Majesty!

38
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,450
I am asking whether this nation's king has discarded the noble class!

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,200
 If it will fade away, anyway...

40
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,140
This giro party is held for the purpose of honoring the retired high government officials.

41
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,770
But, today, I would like to talk about a slightly different subject.

42
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:21,040
Master-killer band.  I mean the case I am allegedly involved in.

43
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,680
He's talking about the master-killer band?

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,080
What?

45
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,830
Master-killer band?

46
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,580
I knew that the children who made up the master-killer band

47
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,660
were being sold off to Qing through human traffickers.

48
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,610
Despite the poverty and starvation,

49
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,800
the children wanted to live in this land.

50
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,800
Unable to endure the noblemen's exploitation and harsh taxes,

51
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,370
their own parents sold them.

52
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,180
I am sorry, Your Highness,

53
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,580
but such a topic does not fit the occasion!

54
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,390
No!  I'm not finished yet.

55
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,990
In the midst of it, a question occurred to me.

56
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,400
The landowners are the nobles.

57
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,230
The people even have to pay rent to work the land.

58
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:25,880
So why is the country levying harsh taxes on the people?

59
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,280
You must not, Your Highness, say such things...

60
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,840
Isn't that strange?

61
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,410
Why do we ask the people sharecropping that land

62
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,330
but not the landowners to pay taxes?

63
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,010
Then, are you proposing that the nobles have to pay taxes?

64
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,880
Thanks to whom do you think the common and lowly people can feed themselves?

65
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,890
That's right!  They can subsist because of our land.

66
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,510
No way!  If there is no one to work that land,

67
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,530
how will you feed yourselves

68
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,440
and clothe yourselves?

69
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,070
Truly, who is living thanks to whom?

70
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,270
That's right!

71
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,320
Sheesh, what nonsense!

72
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,210
Therefore, I want to have this intention of mine clearly known.

73
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,170
Such exploitation must be done away with.

74
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,670
If I, the crown prince, get to succeed to the throne,

75
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,930
I shall levy land taxes

76
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,060
from landowners.

77
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,390
What the heck is he saying?

78
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,830
 Truly, who's living thanks to whom?

79
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,510
 Land taxes from landowners...

80
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,040
Why do you attempt to shield the crown prince, Your Majesty?

81
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,920
For a greater cause...

82
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,480
What did you teach me when I was the crown prince, Teacher?

83
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,340
The princely man must be ashamed of shamelessness.

84
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,300
Politics is for helping the poor,

85
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,750
not for adding riches to the rich.

86
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,150
I cannot turn away from

87
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,280
the crown prince who knows shame and who wants to help the people.

88
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,590
Your Majesty!

89
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,070
Your Majesty, I have an urgent report.

90
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,020
The crown prince at the giro party?

91
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,900
Yes, he said he'd tax the nobles.

92
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,760
Is this something a person in his right mind would say?

93
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,600
When even begging to us won't be enough, he's counterattacking us?

94
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,150
Immediately send messages to all private and local educational facilities.

95
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,670
If His Majesty won't remove the crown prince,

96
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,390
we can make him do it.

97
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,390
As you can see, I am still the crown prince.

98
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,390
Shouldn't you show me the proper courtesy?

99
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,870
So was that why?

100
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,320
Lest I might defend you till the end, you just wanted to finish yourself off?

101
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,970
You have even bigger responsibility.

102
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,170
How can you place me, just one person, in the center?

103
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,000
Brother!

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,150
Finally getting to utter the words I truly wanted to say

105
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,710
was possible because I was, albeit briefly, the crown prince.

106
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,330
That alone makes my time as the crown prince

107
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,760
plenty meaningful, Your Majesty.

108
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,810
Open it.

109
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,510
- Now, you're free.
 - Why let us go?

110
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,680
The crown prince is done for anyway.

111
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,940
What's the use of frying even the small fishes?  The higher-ups said you can go.

112
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,860
What?

113
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,310
His Highness is done for?  What do you mean?

114
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,420
Get out. Just take one step outside, and you will know.

115
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,140
Your Majesty!

116
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,660
Please grant our petition!

117
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,850
Depose the crown prince!

118
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,980
How can the royal family regard the noble class as their enemy?

119
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,020
Punish the crown prince, Your Majesty!

120
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,970
- Please grant our petition!
 - His Highness...

121
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,330
- Out of the way.
 - My Lord!

122
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,420
- Yeo Ji!
- His Highness himself caused this to protect His Majesty.

123
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,600
No!  This can't be!

124
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,700
After all that he went through to get to the position!

125
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,160
What on earth were you doing?

126
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,270
You should've stopped him.  Yeo Ji, you should've held him back.

127
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,940
I couldn't do it.

128
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,020
I wanted to.

129
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,200
I should have.

130
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:57,810
But I was so overwhelmed by someone in power saying such a thing for the people.

131
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,990
At that moment, without realizing it myself, my feet remained stuck to the ground.

132
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,470
Depose the crown prince!

133
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,030
Your Majesty!

134
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,340
In the end, he'll get deposed, right?

135
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,320
When the nobles are up in arms like that, how can the king hold out?

136
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,620
So why did he go so far as saying those things?

137
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,590
The whole world knows that he's just there to look pretty without much power.

138
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,220
He should've just kept his mouth shut.

139
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,730
But how bad must it have been for him to do so!

140
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,630
And he didn't say anything wrong.

141
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,910
Thanks to whom are the nobles able to live?

142
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,620
I'm asking what falsity the crown prince spoke.

143
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,710
This leg of mine, too, was the doing of my master.

144
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,360
I, too, was sold to become a bond servant.

145
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,850
A pockmark-faced girl won't make it even as a gisaeng.

146
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,470
My father sold me instead of paying the rent money.

147
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,330
Why would they chase away the crown prince?

148
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,170
What did he do wrong?

149
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,710
What are you standing there looking at?  I said move out of my way now!

150
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,470
I have a long way to go.

151
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,320
Can't you hear me?  Give back my ID stick and make way!

152
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,020
Hurry and let him pass.

153
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,210
Your Highness!

154
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,680
Why tears?

155
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,280
When we'll get to leave the palace and have a great time again, why are you crying?

156
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,550
Not only the petitions but also the palace walls

157
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,240
are plastered with noblemen's posts.

158
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,520
In the end, His Majesty will give up on the crown prince, too.

159
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,580
Now, he won't have any other way.

160
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,780
Look here, just a moment!

161
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,630
This... What is this?

162
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,030
Who on earth did such a thing?

163
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,290
Lord, why...

164
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,450
Look here.  It is a common person's argument defending the crown prince.

165
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,670
Excuse me?

166
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,320
Can you see it?  For the crown prince, someone posted a vindication.

167
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,400
Even his ID stick is here!

168
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,960
He put his name on the line!

169
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,710

170
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,850
They say someone put up a post for the crown prince last night.

171
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,180
- A post?
 - What was the content?

172
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,960
To reinstate the crown prince...

173
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,330
This is the post put up on the palace wall near the main gate.

174
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,430
The owner of the ID stick is Maseonnomi, a low-born probably.

175
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,120
But this is not all.

176
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,820
Ja Dong, what are you saying?

177
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,500
So unlike yourself, why are you so flustered?

178
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,840
Your Highness, that is... an ID stick... I mean an ID stick.

179
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,520
ID stick?

180
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,890
You are saying other subjects' ID sticks are piling up there too?

181
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,790
Yes!  They've been flooding in since last night.

182
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,890
How many?

183
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:51,950
So far, hundreds... and the number is only growing steadily.

184
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,420
Your Majesty!

185
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,000

186
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,570
What the h*ll, just let them arrest every one of us!

187
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,390
Without us, who's going to plow the land and who's going to transport the manure?

188
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,700
He's right.

189
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,150
Will we get arrested?

190
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,590
Uncle, how many, on earth, do we have there?

191
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,220
Let's whip out our ID sticks, too.

192
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,840
Yes, catch us if you can.

193
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,270
You're telling me that it really isn't your beggar band behind this.

194
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,430
I can't believe it even while I am looking at it.

195
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,680
They are all subjects stepping forward with their names on the line.

196
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,610
This is the real public opinion

197
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,970
that nobody in the world can manipulate.

198
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,430

199
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,620
How about the Capital Bureau and the police bureau?

200
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,810
What are they doing not stopping the subjects?

201
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,160
But the palace is under the Royal Guards' jurisdiction.

202
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,370
The Royal Guards, following the king's order, are protecting the rabble.

203
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,850
Here is mine.

204
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,670
Go ahead.

205
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,190
Ours, too.

206
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:16,660
We should do this.

207
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,720
Even women who don't have ID sticks!

208
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,610
Aren't these things all crazy?

209
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,780
Excuse me, Lady Damo.  Just a moment.

210
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,140
Kkotnim...

211
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,950
It's that child's name, Your Highness.

212
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,840
The child of the master-killer band.

213
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,040

214
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,910
 This is my name.  I'm seeing this for the first time.

215
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,440
 Kkotnim... It is a pretty name.

216
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,980
 This is mine.

217
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,790

218
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,060
 With your name,

219
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,160
 I will make sure to put it next to yours.

220
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:03,420
 Can I ask you for one more favor?

221
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,210
And that she's grateful to Your Highness,

222
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,850
that she won't forget your caring heart...

223
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,810
She asked me to relay the message to you.

224
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,280

225
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,510
Put it here.

226
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,550
Here.

227
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,700
This is the least we can do.

228
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,000
We should help the crown prince.

229
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,100
We've misunderstood him.

230
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:57,790
The crown prince is on our side.

231
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,430
I wish him well.

232
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,310
It led not to the nobles but the riled up people's popular opinion.

233
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,340
You are not going to repeat the cliche about how the people's will is heaven's will, right?

234
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,850
What do you think?

235
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,870
If the real people, rather than their ID sticks, start spilling out into the streets, it will be hard for you to rein them in.

236
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,660
You will trust the people's opinion that can turn away in an instant as well...

237
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:30,450
Only with that to anchor you, you will continue with the crown prince...

238
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,630
Even if very briefly, winning like this can be a method, too.

239
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,790
Who knows?

240
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,470
If he wins like this a few times, maybe he will end up surviving.

241
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,590
Take care of a few matters that Noron wants.

242
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,680
That goes without saying.  We should preserve each other's faces.

243
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,620
The crown prince is rather... unlucky.

244
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,590
This was his last chance to at least save his life.

245
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,580
My, my, a person in the government

246
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,930
doing a thing that might cause a huge problem.

247
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,920
I've already committed the act as well.  We've become partners in crime.

248
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,640
At least we won't tattle on each other.

249
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,960
A limping person, a hunchback...

250
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,500
Slaves' ID sticks have these descriptions

251
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,320
of features written on them so they can't run away.

252
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,380
May I come to the crown prince's tutorial office as well?

253
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,460
You?

254
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,170
I am curious about what kind of person the crown prince is.

255
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,510
Maseonnomi, born 1699, a limping leg.

256
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,330
Gokdani, born 1697, pockmark-faced.

257
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,970
 The crown prince was the first person to think of the lowly ones like us.

258
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,860
 It's certain that the crown prince is a really nice person.

259
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,970
Kang Ji Paeng, born 1693, nine fingers.

260
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:44,590
 So please don't chase out the crown prince.

261
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,730
 I leave my ID stick here so if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

262
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,360
 But even if my remaining healthy leg is broken,

263
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,850
 - I will side with the crown prince.
 - I will side with the crown prince.
 - I will side with the crown prince.

264
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:05,760
Sihyangyi, born 1703, a blotch on the hand.

265
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:14,360
Kim Shin Dong, born 1649, uneven eyes.

266
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,420
Did you spend the whole day lying around again?

267
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,480
Yes, because I don't have any particular thing to do now.

268
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,320
How can you be so calm after seeing the crown prince getting off scot-free?

269
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,440
What on earth are youâ€”

270
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,890
Yoon Yeong, do you know what karma is?

271
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,600

272
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,770
It's a big teaching of Buddha

273
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,040
that I have etched into my heart at the temple.

274
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,130
Karma?

275
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,930
That is a sacred ritual carried out to prevent evil and to attain goodness.

276
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,720
That is karma.

277
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,070
So?

278
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,740
This time, I devoutly prayed that bastard would be okay.

279
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,600
Why do you ask?  Driving off the crown prince and taking his seat.

280
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,030
Preventing evil and attaining goodness.  I must carry out the karma ritual myself.

281
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:43,310
I have to do it with my own hands to make it a real karma ritual.

282
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,580
I will get hurt.

283
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,860
Wait, what did you just say?

284
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,590
For karma, I will drag down that bastard Lee Geum...

285
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,030
No, not that.

286
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,390
Say hi to each other.  You know each other, right?

287
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,750
It's been a while, Dal Moon.

288
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,460
Just now, that name...

289
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,990
You said you sent Do Ji Gwang to draw in the beggar band.

290
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,350
D-Dal Moon, you said.

291
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:25,230
To a person named Dal Moon.

292
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,590
Dal Moon...

293
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,390
- Your Highness, are you ready?
 - Yes.

294
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,570
But, this time...

295
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,580
What?  Are you asking if I'm sneaking out again and getting into trouble?

296
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,610
I have even advised His Majesty about my outing today.

297
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,510
Happy now?

298
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,190
This, seriously...

299
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,060
Me daring to stretch out my leg before Your Highness...

300
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,530
Please excuse my rudeness.

301
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,550
Why all of a sudden?  You were rude to begin with.

302
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,230
But that's from my swashbuckling days when I ran wild all directions,

303
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,920
not knowing the sky from the earth and wearing my heart on my sleeve.

304
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,900
So now you can tell them apart?

305
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,770
A little.

306
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,010
I now know that I'm nothing as of yet.

307
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,200
I thought becoming a Saheonbu inspector would solve everything.

308
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,970
But it was blocked off by walls on all sides.

309
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,250
I cannot accomplish anything with just my heart.

310
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:06,730
Now I've come to know that a little.

311
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,300
It feels like you're saying that to me.

312
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,370
It means let's not get worn out still.

313
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,070
Your Highness.

314
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,900
Yeo Ji!

315
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,780
When did you come?

316
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,730
I thought I would have to leave without seeing you.  What a relief.

317
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,100
This kind of incident will occur again, right?

318
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,750
I mean incidents that will target you and threaten you.

319
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,470
And your life might be in danger.

320
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,350
And?

321
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,210
I've expected as much.

322
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,770
Do you think I didn't anticipate even this much?

323
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:13,730
If a person is too outstanding, he'll easily become everyone's target.

324
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:18,730
I am smart, handsome, and on top of that, I am the crown prince.

325
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,000
I will just have to blame it all on my awesomeness. What else can I do?

326
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,700
Pardon?

327
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,780
So I'm telling you not to worry uselessly.

328
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,410
Indeed, you have a hard time understanding what I am saying.

329
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,920
That is not what I am talking about right now.

330
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,260
I don't understand?  Of all people, you're criticizing me for this?

331
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,430
Your Highness, I have something to tell you.

332
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,460
Even if I'm in this state, I should see him off.

333
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,530
When I'm My Highness's follower and younger brother,

334
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,220
does it make sense for me to do nothing?

335
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,910
Entering the crown prince's quarters?

336
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,450
Yes, I am saying I will become a palace maid.

337
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,320
Do you even know what that means?

338
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,790
I do.  To become a palace maid, certain conditions must be met.

339
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,390
I know I am lacking as a palace maid.

340
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,220
But that is not what I am saying!

341
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,520
If you don't mean that, then what do you mean?

342
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,050
Are you asking me because you don't know what a palace maid is?

343
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,850
If you become a palace maid, not only doing your master's bidding butâ€”

344
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,120
Of course.  I know it involves a lot of miscellaneous chores.

345
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,860
No, not that, but...

346
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,260
Oh, I might end up in  suragan (palace kitchen) , but that's not a problem.

347
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,530
I am a very good cook.

348
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,870
So please allow me to enter the crown prince's quarters.

349
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,450
I want to protect you no matter what.

350
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:05,480
Of course, there was no way you'd understand what I'm saying.

351
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,860
Excuse me?

352
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,420
I will teach you... what it means to become a palace maid.

353
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,490
That means

354
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,640
this is possible

355
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,350
and also

356
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,060
doing this

357
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,560
and

358
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:50,150
even doing this

359
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,320
are allowed.

360
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:21,840

361
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,310
â™«  You whom I love  â™«

362
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:34,970
â™«  Become the moon light  â™«

363
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,730
â™«  You whom I love  â™«

364
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,650
 When a man acts like that toward a woman, it can mean only one thing.

365
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,570
 Did it finally transpire? An affair?

366
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,180
 That Inspector Park Moon Soo seems to be after the secretive corruption of the section chief of the Ministry of the Interior.

367
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,630
 Foolish ones generally think that they can achieve something different than the others.

368
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,230
 Just do as well as the others did, Your Highness.

369
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,090
 I will listen to more of the arrogant words you speak.

370
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,750
 Your Highness, you will surely become a great king in the future.

371
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,440
 This chance we finally seized...

372
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,290
 How far are you determined to go?

373
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,410
 It will become a road more difficult for you.
