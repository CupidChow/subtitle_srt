found dead in his home,

the Prosecutors' Office will
update us on the investigation.

103
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,100
While the Prosecutors' Office
was investigating after

104
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
receiving a report of an illegal drug,

105
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
they confirmed of this death.

106
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,850
They'll also be announcing details
on the drug in question.

107

deaths due to the use of the same drug.

due to the use of the same drug.

109
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,210
Including former Minister Lee Won Gil,

110
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,890
it's highly probable that they
were euthanasia administered by

111
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,080
a third-party, or an assisted suicide.

112
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,290
That's the direction of
our investigation.

113
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,810
We also conducted a
search and seizure to

114
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,850
obtain information
on the illegal drug.

115
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,890
The two prime suspects
in this case

116
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,290
have fled overseas,

117
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,580
therefore we've enlisted
Interpol to find them.

118
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,940
We're also investigating
if Zinmou Rijund

119
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,590
the pharmaceutical company is
related to the manufacturing

120

and distribution of this drug.

121
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,720
My God, I guess
Zinmou Rijund is involved, too.

How could this be?

123
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,850
I heard the Prosecutors' Office

124
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,370
searched our legal
department's office as well.

125

And they told me I'll be
a reference witness.

Why would Attorney Han Myung Oh
have done something like this?

All the pieces are falling
together now.

128
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,740
An attorney who volunteered to
defend a doctor for euthanasia,

129
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,570
and a former ministry of Health and
Welfare who created a euthanasia drug.

130
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,860
What do you think these
two would've wanted?

131
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,890
For euthanasia to be
legalized in our country.

132

You weren't informed at all?

133
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,130
Had the Minister said
anything to you?

134
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,360
Do you think I would've turned
a blind eye if I knew?

135
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,700
Then Dr. Cha is certainly
unrelated to this case.

136
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,300
The Prosecutors' Office didn't come
to investigate Dr. Cha either.

Why don't you confirm with him?

But why?

139
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,030
He's not going to stay
at our hospital.

140
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,450
If you're curious, you
should ask him yourself.

141
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,270
Yes.

142
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,230
I saw the news.

143
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,200
How could such a thing...

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,500
It must've been difficult for you.

145
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,750
It wasn't that difficult.

146
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,120
You notified me of the

Yes.

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,580
By chance, what did he say
about the online post?

151
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,600
He said...

152
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,170
it doesn't matter.

Dr. Cha is not coming back?

156

But why? Why not?

157
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,220
Is it the hospital's
decision or Dr. Cha's?

158
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,890
The hospital had decided
to abide by the patients,

159
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,370
but Dr. Cha didn't accept it.

160
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,280
He said he'll wrap up
after treating a few patients.

161
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,670
Geez, this is so upsetting.
Why is he doing this?

162
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,560
Do you think he was
traumatized by Ki Seok's death?

163
