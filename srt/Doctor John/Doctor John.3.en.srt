00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:52,777
Because...

170
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:54,967
you're the first.

171
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,537
First? First what?

172
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:59,707
When I told you I was sick...

173
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,797
you didn't say I was faking it.

174
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:03,267
You're the first, Hyung.

175
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:07,167
My mom was always sick, too.

176
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,207
My dad would accuse her...

177
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:11,927
of being a hypochondriac.

178
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,807
Then she passed away.

179
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:18,827
No refills.

180
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,487
Let's get going now, sir.

181
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:24,177
Please make one more call.

182
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:29,097
That doctor from earlier
knows about 6238.

183
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,247
Dr. Lee Yoo Joon?

184
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:34,907
He usually takes care
of our patients.

185
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:38,547
But after a few misdiagnoses

186
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:40,727
and 6238 called him out,

187
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,057
his pride was
completely wounded.

188
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:44,377
No wonder.

189
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,907
He seemed to despise him.

190
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,747
They're like sworn enemies.

191
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,627
Even though they've never met.

192
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,227
Yes.

193
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:00,467
6238?

194
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,647
Put him on.

195
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,317
Yes.

196
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:08,587
They'll be conducting
a kidney biopsy,

197
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:11,957
and we're checking
his family history.

198
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:14,117
Yes. Okay.

199
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:17,557
What the?

200
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:19,747
- He just hung up?
- Why?

201
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,357
Did you have something to say?

202
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:23,967
- He didn't ask for me?
- No, he didn't.

203
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:28,177
Uncle, can you call him again?

204
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:30,367
6238.

205
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,917
You have a call.

206
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:38,787
Hello?

207
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,577
They'll do a kidney biopsy.

208
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:42,747
- Yes, I heard.
- I know.

209
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:45,397
- Huh?
- You asked me to do this.

210
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:48,047
So why ask my uncle?

211
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:49,907
Are the results out?

212
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,877
- Of course, not yet...
- Let's talk when it's out.

213
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,267
Wait a minute!

214
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:58,777
What are your instructions?

215
00:11:58,777 --> 00:11:59,807
What instructions?

216
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:02,387
You said if I went to
the hospital with him,

217
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:05,477
you'd tell me how to save his life.

218
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:07,307
You told his doctor

219
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:09,707
to check for Fabry disease
in case, right?

220
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:10,697
You told me to.

221
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,217
That's how you saved his life.

222
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:13,887
I'm sorry, but please
explain better...

223
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:15,997
If the guards would've
carried him in

224
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:18,397
and just asked for
a Fabry checkup,

225
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,867
would he have believed them?

226
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:22,927
He'd waste so much time
running all kinds of tests,

227
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:24,437
while the patient
would've worsened.

228
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:25,357
Then...

229
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:29,577
you borrowed my mouth?

230
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:31,107
Then...

231
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,157
let me borrow your
hands this time.

232
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:36,477
My hands?

233
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:38,667
We must attain the Fabry
treatment medication.

234
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,247
It's called ERT.

235
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:43,647
Going through a pharmaceutical
company will take over a week.

236
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,367
The quickest way is to find
a hospital with stage 2

237
00:12:46,427 --> 00:12:48,117
and above Nephrology Department.

238
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,667
If they have a Fabry patient,
borrow the ERT medication.

239
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,317
Oh, you don't?

240
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:56,687
Hello, the Nephrology
Department, please.

241
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:58,887
I'm looking for ERT medication.

♫ Your thoughts, they just
crash in a line ♫

246
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:20,097
Doctor! Dr. Lee Yoo Joon!

247
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:22,987
I found some ERT medication.

248
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:23,997
Where?

249
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:25,767
A university hospital
40 minutes away.

250
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,167
- If I go now, I can borrow some.
- They'll lend you?

251
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:31,097
If in the case it's not Fabry,
I told them I'll return it.

252
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:33,077
It's such an expensive medication.

253
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:35,217
But it's not confirmed yet...

254
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:37,537
So I mentioned your name, Doctor.

255
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:40,147
- What?
- You have a great reputation.

256
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:42,827
They say you're the most
skilled fellow in this area.

257
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:47,257
Well, I don't think it's my skills...

258
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,987
It's such a small town
and stories spread fast.

259
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:54,177
It's true, the elderly patients
do always ask for me.

260
00:13:57,717 --> 00:14:00,447
Could you chart it
and send it here?

261
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,927
Do you really think it's Fabry?

262
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:07,097
I told you earlier.

263
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,767
It's a 0.00001% chance.

264
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,917
But I like that ratio.

265
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,487
I'll be right back.

266
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,017
[ Thank you! Dr. Lee Yoo Joon! ]

267
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:35,307
♫ It won't be wrong ♫

268
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,397
- Be right back.
- Okay.

Tae Kyung.

271
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:48,817
What did I tell you?

272
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:51,057
I knew I had a good feeling.

273
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,147
The patient carried out earlier.

274
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,767
Has he been diagnosed?

275
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,197
No, not yet.

276
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:58,487
But they think it
could be something,

277
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,827
so Shi Young is on the
hunt for the medication.

278
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,757
The patient hasn't
even been diagnosed.

279
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:04,047
And his condition is bad.

280
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:05,577
Yes.

281
00:15:05,577 --> 00:15:07,367
You're right, but...

282
00:15:09,237 --> 00:15:11,647
- Just send Shi Young off.
- What?

283
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,707
But why?

284
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:17,517
It's her first patient after the incident.
If something goes wrong...

285
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:21,377
would Shi Young be
able to handle it?

286
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,597
Where do you buy
something like that?

287
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:41,707
I'm being released next week.

288
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,737
I'm seeing my sister
after so many years.

289
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:45,637
I want to buy her a bracelet.

290
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,697
- Uncle!
- Yeah.

291
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:01,457
What's wrong?

292
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,977
It's just that...

293
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:07,087
it's been a while since
I've seen you like this.

294
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,687
Let's go.

295
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:14,247
Shi Young.

296
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:18,137
How about leaving after
dropping off the medication?

297
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:21,357
I'll take you home.

298
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,407
Why all of a sudden?

299
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:26,317
You were dying to keep me here.

300
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,137
I don't want you to suffer, that's all.

301
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:30,307
It's a rare disease,

302
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:33,977
with a 0.0000 or something like that.

303
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:36,737
Correct.

304
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:40,857
It's only 0.00001%.

305
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:42,897
1 out of 117,000.

306
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:45,437
- Yeah, so...
- But Uncle.

307
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,257
I was like that.

308
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,257
When I left the hospital,

309
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:52,027
the chances of me returning...

310
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:54,187
That's what it felt like.

311
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:59,347
Even 0.00001%...

312
00:16:59,347 --> 00:17:01,397
seemed out of reach.

313
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:04,177
That's why.

314
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:06,967
If this patient gets better,

315
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,667
then maybe I will, too.

316
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:12,337
Something like that.

317
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,297
I even got the meds.

318
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:18,617
The chances are now
up by 0.0001%.

319
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,487
Okay, you're right.

320
00:17:22,487 --> 00:17:24,817
0.0001 or whatever.

321
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:27,987
The world is always 50/50,
heads or tails.

322
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:30,417
Life or death. All or nothing!

323
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:33,237
Let's go.

324
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:39,297
Tie your shoelaces first.

325
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:41,817
Every patient has timing.

326
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:44,357
If you miss it, then it's too late.

327
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:46,187
At the timing, the doctor...

328
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:48,757
must always be ready to run.

329
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,447
All set.

330
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,057
Let's go, Uncle.

331
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:30,617
What about his family?
Did you look into it?

332
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:31,777
Yes.

334
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:36,637
it's a disconnected number.

335
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:40,847
Truthfully, no one has
ever visited him.

336
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,537
His parents divorced
when he was young,

337
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:46,097
so he lived with
his mom and sister.

338
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,827
He seemed very
close to his sister.

339
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,717
He went to prison
because of his sister.

340
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:55,197
She was stiffed four month's pay,

341
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:58,247
so he went on her behalf
and got into a scuffle.

342
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,657
The other party got
injured during the fight,

343
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,887
but he had no money to settle.

Nope.
