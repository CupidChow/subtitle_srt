Pardon me.

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,700
I'm resident Kang Shi Young
at the Dept. of Pain Medicine.

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,310
Are you experiencing any discomfort?

4
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,830
No.

5
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,050
I know this may sound strange,

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,940
but one of our department
team members

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,990
is a fan of yours.

8
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,430
He said...

9
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,440
if there is anything you want,

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,620
he'd love to get it done for you.

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,190
So our team...

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,190
decided to fulfill your wish.

13
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,810
If...

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,710
there is anything you need or want...

15
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,240
please do let us know.

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,710
Any time.

17
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,140
Thank you...

18
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,600
for your thoughts, doctors.

[ Dept. of Pain Medicine, Yu Ri Hye,
Doctors Cha You Han and Kang Shi Young ]

20
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,470
I wanted...

21
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,480
to try everything.

22
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,800
We performed surgeries,
used medications,

23
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,270
and hooked you up to machines.

24
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,770
I thought that was my way
of fighting for you.

25
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,600
But...

26
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,700
that's not it.

27
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,870
I...

28
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,680
was afraid.

29
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,470
To admit there is nothing
I can do for you...

30
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,980
and to just let you go.

31

I'm here.

32
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,560
When will you tell the girls?

33
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,180
I'll tell them soon.

34
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,070
Forget Shi Young for a second.

35
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,710
What about Mi Rae?

36
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm thinking it over.

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,200
Our talk should go over well the
first time or else she'll be resistant.

38
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,870
I'll tell her.

39
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,390
She'll be more receptive
to me than you, Unni.

40

I want the ethics committee
closed off to the public.

41
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,360
Please consult with Attorney Han
on the legal details.

42
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,020
I understand.

43
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,000
We'll make sure everything goes well.

Yes.

I drove here.

53
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,160
Since you can't drive yet,

54
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,650
I'll take you to work.

Really? No issues at all?

Oh...

I'm a great driver.

outpatients in the a.m.

Take good care of them.

Can't I go in with you?

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,030
No.

79

Drive safely.

Don't turn on the wipers

- What is this?
- Just take it.

83
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,470
You called me over early
to give me this?

84
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,000
I called you over to feed you breakfast.

Who keeps a talisman
in this day and age?

I've had bad dreams
for the past few days.

87
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,950
Just keep it with you,

88
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,390
and always take precaution.

89
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,920
- Okay?
- Aigoo...

90
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,290
You're hopeless.

91
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,870
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

92
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,920
- I'm off.
- Okay.

93
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,540
Hey, you must really
be careful, okay?

94
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,400
Okay?

95
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,680
Stop smiling and watch
over your son.

Yu Ri Hye's older sister
called us this morning.

She said she wants to see her son.

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,200
So? He's coming?

100
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,350
Yes, he'll be here soon.

101
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,750
We must hurry and get ready.

102
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,260
Get ready for what?

103
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,730
This.

104
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,170
What is it?

105
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,270
It feels ominous.

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Kids are scared of hospitals.

107
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,280
At least, we should look friendly.

Oh, wow, good choice.

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,540
It suits you.

111
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,500
Geez, why are you doing this to me?

I'll take care of the
Dept. of Pain Medicine.

115
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,920
Dr. Heo, you just do your duty.

116
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,090
Then...

117
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,240
what should we do now?

118
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,590
Hello.

I'm Kang Mi Rae.

121
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,610
We brought you flowers.

122
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,770
The ward seemed a bit empty, so...

123
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,740
Real flowers are not allowed,
so we bought fake ones.

124
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,120
The teddy bear, too.

125
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,020
We'll put them next to you.

00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,930
Thank you, doctors.

128
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,020
I'm sorry, but...

129
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,120
I have a favor to ask.

130
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,930
Please go ahead.

131
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,750
This right here...

132
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,230
If I put this on, at least...

133
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,450
maybe I'll look less scary.

134
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,550
I'll put it on for you.

135
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,030
I'm nervous.

136
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,930
I thought...

137
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,450
it would be better if...

138
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,790
my child didn't see me like this.

139
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,850
But...

140
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,180
I missed him so much.

141
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,430
You're all set.

142
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,640
You'll see your son now.

143
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,300
Pardon?

144
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,810
What do you mean he's not coming?

145
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,920
I just received a phone call.

146
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,370
That he's scared of seeing his mom...

147
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,090
He says he's not coming.

148
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,930
He's really not coming?

149
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,950
He may never get to see her again.

150

What should we do...

159
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,720
Hey, what are you doing?

160
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,250
I shouldn't have done anything.

161
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,030
Either way, I'm of no help at all.

162
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,360
I shouldn't have done anything...

163
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,520
You didn't do it on purpose.

164
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,720
Your intentions were good.

165
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
What do my intentions matter?

166
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,010
The results are horrible.

167
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,850
I only made her feel worse.

168
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,600
But you made me realize something.

169
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,440
That we're able to do
something for an

170

incurable, terminal patient.

171
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,610
I've never thought of
something like that.

172
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,840

You can't take steroids. Never.
