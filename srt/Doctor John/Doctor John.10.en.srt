1
00:00:02,706 --> 00:00:04,986
Please wait to the side.

2
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:11,106
I have that Myasthenia gravis.

3
00:00:11,106 --> 00:00:13,286
It's got to be that.
[ Myasthenia gravis: A neuromuscular
disease that leads to muscle weakness ]

00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:17,316
For now, please write down your
name and resident ID number.

5
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,236
Geez, whatever.

6
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,886
Can't believe this.

7
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:24,636
When do you start, huh?

8
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:26,036
I'm here for my leg pain.

9
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:27,196
Should I keep standing around?

10
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:28,156
You can't come in.

11
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:30,246
We're still prepping for
examinations. Please wait.

12
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:33,136
Doctor!

13
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:37,776
Today, all the residents will be
conducting preliminary exams.

14
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:41,266
Many of the patients seem to
suspect Myasthenia gravis.

15
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:44,386
Since the symptoms are sporadic,
it's not easy to diagnose.

16
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:46,166
Check the symptoms
meticulously and

17
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,086
send the appropriate
patients to Neurology,

18
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:50,786
then separate the pain
department patients accordingly.

19
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:51,676
Yes, sir.

20
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,186
Dr. Lee Yoo Jin, you prep
the surgery room.

21
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:55,096
Yes, sir.

22
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,976
Also, most will be ones
who weren't diagnosed after

23
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,206
visiting many hospitals and clinics.

24
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:01,486
But keep this in mind.

25
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:03,086
All pains have a source.

26
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:05,036
We just need to nail the source.

27
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:11,846
Okay, let's get started.

28
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:14,006
Okay, let's go, let's go. Let's do
our "AnesthPain" cheer.

29
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,086
"All pains come from a source."

30
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:19,636
AnesthPain?

31
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:21,046
What's AnesthPain?

32
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,206
It's short for Anesthesiology Pain.
We made up a cheer.

33
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,546
"AnesthPain."

34
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:32,976
Let's do it together.

35
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:36,716
Okay, let's gather around.
All right, all right.

36
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:38,566
One, two, three!

37
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,636
AnesthPain, AnesthPain, fighting!

38
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:42,416
You're supposed to go down.

39
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:44,976
Fighting!

40
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,286
When did the pain start?

41
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:54,816
It's been about a month.

42
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:58,156
When did it hurt the most recently?

43
00:01:58,156 --> 00:02:00,036
It's been about a week or so.

44
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,626
Did you experience pain previously?

45
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,956
This may be a little uncomfortable.

46
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,466
He has knee pain.

47
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,366
How long have you had knee pain?

48
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,866
Probably around a year.

49
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,046
Okay.

50
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:18,676
Your pain level on the
scale of zero to 10. What is it?

51
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:21,546
Zero means no pain at all.

52
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:24,286
10 means dying of severe pain.

53
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:26,936
Pick one.

54
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:31,966
This one.

55
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,776
Aigoo, Grandma, your face
states otherwise.

56
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,736
What the?

57
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,556
I'm dying of pain here.

58
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:43,916
Man, don't push me!

59
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,566
I didn't push you!

60
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,286
- Yes, you did!
- Geez, this is so upsetting.

61
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,176
Ma'am, please excuse me.

62
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:54,866
What the...

63
00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:01,586
My legs are weak, and I
accidentally nudged you.

64
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,076
Nothing to be upset about!

65
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,526
I'm in pain, and you
keep nudging me.

66
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,266
Never mind, forget it.

67
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,286
Aigoo, you're in pain?

68
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,816
- You seem fine!
- Fine?

69
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,996
Are you the doctor?

70
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,236
Okay, okay, please calm down.

71
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,716
Let's be orderly here...

72
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,366
How can you tell me to calm down?

73
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,726
You don't know why I'm here!

74
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,366
Aigoo, what ailment
brings you here?

75
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,366
I have CRPS.

76
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,766
- CRPS!
- CRPS.

Okay, please, please lower your voice.

Call him for me!

83

Who is asking for me like this?

84
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:38,006
Yes, Doctor.

85
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,306
Which patient...

86
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,916
- Dr. Chan Yo Han?
- Yes.

87
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,886
If you yell like that here,
it'll disrupt the exams...

88

Doctor, please save me.

89
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,296
If not, please kill me.

90

- Yes.

99

Pardon?

100
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,266
He's not going to the ER?

101
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,666
No, he's not.

102
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,196
He's our patient.

103
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:22,926
Doesn't he feel the pain?

104
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:24,076
I know.

105
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,396
We didn't administer anesthesia.

106
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,076
No anesthesia...

What on earth?

109
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:47,816
Why did you do it?

110
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:51,626
To prove your illness?

111
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:53,846

Cut.

113

His older brother was beaten up.

114
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:04,176
So he ran outside and

115
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:06,946
asked for a beating,
saying it won't hurt.

116
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:08,916
But they didn't believe him...

117

- So he took a knife and...
- Mom.

axon reflex test.

Doctor.

126
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,176
Are you thinking...

127
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,616
I'm positive.

128
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,446
It's more than
10,000,000 to 1 probability.

129
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:39,946
And no official case
reported worldwide, either.

130

Never heard of in our country...

00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,966
No, wait.

132
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,846
Did we have one case?

133
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:48,516
Of what?

134
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:49,666
Cut.

135
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:54,386
He gets knifed, sewn up
sans anesthesia,

136

and internal damages.

to pain with anhidrosis.

- Yes, sir.
- CRPS and CIPA.

147
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:38,006
They're polar opposites.

148

feels like pain.

149

With CIPA, no pain even
with aggravated contact.

150
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:46,546
But Doctor.

151
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:49,436
Does this patient really have CIPA...
(sounds like a curse word in Korean)

I'm not sure if he knows
about the Chairman,

332
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:12,946
whether he wants to see you,

333
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:14,966
or if he's here to see
Dr. Kang Shi Young.

334
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:16,876
Regardless, could it
be a coincidence?

335
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,116
Son Seok Ki being
with Kang Shi Young?

336
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:27,656
Doctors are quite admirable.

337
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:30,616
It's remarkable to
save people's lives.

338
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:34,396
However, I'm also on the fence.

339
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:37,546
Saving lives and simultaneously...

340
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,746
they can also end it.

341
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:44,736
That's why doctors' hands
are double-edged swords.

342
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,286
They can be the hands of God...

343
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:49,736
or the Grim Reaper's.

344
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:52,106
Like Dr. Cha three years ago.

345
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:59,026
Why are you telling me this?

346
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:04,046
I know how Dr. Cha was
three years ago.

347
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,546
Since you're his current resident...

348
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:09,566
you probably know him
the best right now.

349
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:14,926
What are your thoughts?

350
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:19,116
Does he seem different
from three years ago?

351
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:34,186
If he hasn't changed...

352
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,216
what will you do?

353
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:39,406
What do you mean by that?

354
00:22:39,406 --> 00:22:40,616
If...

355
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:45,726
Dr. Cha tries to do what
he did three years ago...

356
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,796
would you report him?

357
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:52,316
Or...

358
00:22:53,336 --> 00:22:55,786
you could look the other way.

359
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:58,516
If none of the above,

360
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,996
then would you...

361
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:07,586
align yourself with him?

362
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:28,206
Hello?

363
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:31,546
Yes.

364
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:34,296
Long time, Dr. Cha Yo Han.

365
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:38,916
Long time, Prosecutor Son Seok Ki.

366
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,496
Are you here to see me?

367
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:43,686
Sure, among other things.

368
00:23:43,686 --> 00:23:45,276
But right now...

369
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:48,756
What did you say?

370
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:03,516
Get away from her.

371
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:05,506
Right this minute.

372
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,826
She's my resident.

373
00:24:12,176 --> 00:24:17,816
♫ Sometimes I try to
find a way to go back ♫

374
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:21,986
♫ Cuz it's unforgettable time  ♫

375
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:25,516
♫ It's all still in my mind ♫

376
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:35,116
♫ Closer, a little bit closer  ♫

377
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:39,926
♫ What if I walk to you  ♫

378
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:41,896
[ Doctor John ]

379
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:44,716
I've never asked for the society's
forgiveness for what I've done.

380
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,136
A criminal label doesn't
disappear over time.

381
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:50,676
Dr. Cha in his current state may
be of help to our hospital.

382
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:52,566
What do you mean by "help"?

383
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,586
Their two daughters are now

384
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:56,916
Cha Yo Han's residents.

385
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,896
- Mi Rae...
- It's more nerve-wracking...

386
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:01,306
that someone like
Dr. Cha is by your side.

387
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:03,806
If there's an identical
patient as back then...

388
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,616
Would I make the same choice?

389
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:11,296
I can only tell you
that it's impossible.

390
00:25:11,296 --> 00:25:15,686
♫ Can you hold my hand ♫
