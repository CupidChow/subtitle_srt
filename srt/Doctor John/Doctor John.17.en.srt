9
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,550
How is the patient right now?

10
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,620

making this diagnosis?

Even regarding melioidosis,

17
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,810
it'd be best to inquire with the
Department of Infectious Diseases.

18

Myeongwon University Hospital's
euthanasia incident?

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,410
It must be a sensitive
topic with the patients.

22
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,890
Has anyone refused treatment by you?

23
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,940
No, that hasn't happened.

24
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,180
Perhaps because I don't go around
saying I'm a euthanasia doctor.

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,910
Since the patients have
a right to know,

26
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,480
shouldn't the hospital inform them?

27

But he's the one who's
actually doing it.

One, two, three!

165
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,350
Hello, sir!

166
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,780
Hello.

167
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,580
Please step this way
and stand over there.

168
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,150
Looks great. Let's strike a pose.

169
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,090
Heart!

170
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,490
Thumbs up!

171
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,000
Fighting! Okay.

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,940
Two gentlemen in the
center, shake hands.

173
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,860
Let's have a round of applause.

174

Why isn't Dr. Cha here?

175
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,400
- Why these people...
- I know.

176
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,610
The Director and Chief, I understand.

177
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,170
But what's Dr. Kwon
doing over there?

178
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,290
- I agree.
- Geez, you startled me.

179
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,360
Chief asked Dr. Cha to
come over this morning.

180
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,850
But he said no.

181
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,950
Gosh, that man has zero social skills.

182
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,080
Right?

183
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,960
We should all be sociable like them.

184

Yes.

190
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,700

giving hoopla to Dr. Cha.

191
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,010
"Giving hoopla"?

192
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,800
The patients are quite
content with him.

193
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,010
Appraisals will follow naturally.

194
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,340
Of course, you are correct.

195

Our Dr. Cha is even giving a
presentation at the school tomorrow.

196
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,410
- "Our"?
- I hear the topic will be analgesia.

197
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,320
Yes.

198
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,990
Since it's so rare.

199
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,410
I had him prepare since it'd be helpful
for other doctors as well.

200
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,670
That's great.

201

I'll relay this to the PR Department.

202

I'll get going then.

203

Oh, Dr. Cha. Hello.

Please don't joke
around today, Dr. Lee.

- No, that's not it...
- Why do you keep teasing me?

- What about Dr. Cha?

Just give him one per day.

And these are vitamins for his joints.

This brush is for taking
care of his fur.

Then what's this?

It's a toy.

me pictures these days?

496
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,500
I miss you.

497
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,210
Mom, Mom...

498
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,780
After being diagnosed
in the last stages...

499
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,810
and almost losing her vision,
she stopped contacting him.

500
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,390
Then the child just found
out about her illness?

501
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,090
Yes.

502
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,330
I told him everything recently

503
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,940
and got permission from
his dad to bring him.

504
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,800
But she refuses to see him.

505
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,070
That he'll fall into shock
after seeing her...

506
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,110
and she doesn't want to
remain a horrid memory.

507
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,270
Has Yu Ri Hye been administered
additional painkillers?

508
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,470
No, she fell asleep just now.

509
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,910
If she experiences pain,
administer PRN.

510
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,430
I'm not here tomorrow
due to the conference.

511
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,650
Call me if anything happens.

512
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,880
Okay, will do.

513
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,120
You're working late, Doctor.
