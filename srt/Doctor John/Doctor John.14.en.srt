come to the hospital?

He's had chronic headaches, fatigue,
and no appetite for over a year.

his coughing, vomiting,
and fever started.

Headache, coughing,
vomiting, and fever,

302
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,580
are Nipah virus symptoms,
but not loss of appetite.

Plus, if his headaches and
fatigue persisted for a year,

304

then it could be another cause.

wrong with the patient.

331
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,000
Why?

332
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,810
He's lost his sense of direction.

333
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,750
Look him over asap.

334
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,300
What other symptoms are there?

335
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,110
Sir, please sit this way.

336
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,520
Any paralysis?

337
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,940
How do your arms feel?

338
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,310
Do you feel everything?

339
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,830
Are you able to feel this?

340
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,970
No paralysis.

341
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,900
He's suffering disorientation.

342
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,660
Then by any chance...

343
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,120
Sir!

344
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,240
Sir...

345
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,940
What was that sound?

346
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,120
Kang Shi Young.

347
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,630
What is it, Dr. Cha?

348
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,510
Kang Shi Young?

Kang Shi Young.

350
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,830
Answer me, Kang Shi Young.

351
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,950
Call Dr. Lee Yoo Joon.

352
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,900
My apologies.

353
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,400
I'm Dr. Cha Yo Han from the
Dept. of Pain Medicine.

354
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,980
The treatment room in the
center that's shut down.

355
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,640
I'd like to see it on the monitor.

356
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,960
Dr. Kang!

357
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,840
What happened?

358
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,930
What's going on?

359
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,810
Dr. Kang Shi Young is in the
treatment room with a patient.

360
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,680
But the call dropped all of a sudden.

361
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,550
What?

362
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,840
Dr. Kang.

363
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,240
Dr. Kang!

364
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,600
- Dr. Kang Mi Rae.
- Yes.

365
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,950
Dr. Kang Shi Young is unconscious.

366

Sir!

377
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,630
Inject 10cc of thiopental.

378
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,450
What?

379
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,870
I'm at the security office.

380
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm watching you on CCTV.

381
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,530
Inject it now.

382
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,950
Done.

383
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,590
How is he?

384
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,970
He's stabilizing.

385
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,130
Okay.

386
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,460

She's still unconscious!

regardless of the results...

to diagnose him before
his condition gets worse.
