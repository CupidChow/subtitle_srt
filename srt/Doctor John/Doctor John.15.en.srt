1
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,350
Yes.

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,980
Okay, got it.

3
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,210
What did he say?

4
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,120
That Dr. Kang Shi Young...

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,930
is still unconscious.

6
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,080
Chief, what should we do?

7
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,380
Get me a hazmat suit.

8
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,400
Give me a hazmat suit. I'm going in.

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,560
Going in where?

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,180
No one is allowed in the
center right now.

11
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,650
The suspected patient
was admitted for

12
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,050
headaches starting over a year ago.

13
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,800
If the symptoms are recent,

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,520
it might not be the Nipah virus.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,850
Regardless, no one's
allowed in right now.

16
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,700
Until he's diagnosed as not.

17
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,500
And there are doctors inside.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,120
Why must you go in, Dr. Cha?

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,290
The suspected patient is
showing new symptoms,

20
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,380
and it's getting worse.

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,490
Plus, one of the residents
is unconscious.

22
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,640
- Give me a hazmat suit.
- No.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,230
Director has stressed
we follow protocol.

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,570
You can't solve anything
by going in there.

25
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,460
No one may enter for
whatever reasons.

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,400
Never!

27
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,890
Chief.

28
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,890
We'll follow the protocol.

29
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,750
Dr. Kwon is right.

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,290
You can't solve anything by going in.

31
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,320
Call Dr. Lee Yoo Joon.

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,440
Now.

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,210
My baby!

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,140
What happened?

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,750
What's going on here?

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,040
My child is inside...

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,750
We suspected a Nipah virus patient.

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,070
What about my child?

39
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,300
- Is she okay?
- We'll find out.

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,250
My child has juvenile diabetes.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,210
She didn't even have lunch...

42
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,810
If she doesn't eat something soon,

43
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,390
she'll go into hypoglycemic shock!

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,030
I have to go in.

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,470
Please open it.

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,960
Right now!

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,690
I think we have a situation to resolve.

Glucagon...
[ Glucagon: a peptide hormone ]

51
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,650
and a hazmat suit. Give them to me.

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,150
Someone has to go in.

53
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,340
It's a must.

54
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,350
Passing through, please move aside.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,750
Are we going out now?

56
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,010
Can we leave now?

57
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,900
- Can we leave?
- Step back.

58
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,010
No one is allowed out.

59
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,810
If we can't go out...

60
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,370
why open the door?

61
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,340
No one is going out...

62
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,410
but someone is coming in.

63
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,470
Dr. Kang.

64
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,790
Dr. Kang!

65
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,500
Dr. Kang!

66
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,260
Dr. Kang.

67
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,780
Dr. Kang!

68
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,450
How is the patient?

69
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,570
His seizures stopped.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,890
- Check his condition.
- Okay.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,620
Kang Shi Young.

72
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,240
Are you awake?

73
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,770
Dr. Cha...

[ Doctor John ]
[ Episode 8: To understand someone ]

75
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,500
It's all right.

76
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,940
You did well.

77
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,000
- I'll be back in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
You'll be fine, okay?

79
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,510
How is it over there?

80
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,840
I don't know yet.

81
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,570
But Sunbae, why did you come in?

82
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,170
You're going in?

83
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,570
I have a reason for going in.

84
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,290
If I don't, I think I'll regret it forever.

85
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,860
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,110
I'm truly sorry.

87
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,250
Dr. Cha, why did you come in here?

88
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,220
Why are you here?

89
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,380
How is your vision?

90
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,790
Can you see well?

91
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,590
I said, why are you here?

92
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,750
I see some swelling.

93
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,340
Are you dizzy or nauseous?

94
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,890
What about your senses?

95
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,400
Do you feel this?

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,290
- Dr. Cha...
- Answer me.

97
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm okay.

98
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,390
Good. Then get up slowly.

99
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,010
But why did you come in here?

100
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm not here for you.

101
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,560
Get up.

102
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,450
Are you okay?

103
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,810
Yes, I'm fine.

104
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,210
How is the patient?

105
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,270
He fainted earlier.

106
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,840
His pulse sped up,
but it's stable again.

107
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,920
Palpitations.
[ Palpitations: Hard, fast and/or
irregular heartbeats ]

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,100
[ Palpitations: Hard, fast and/or
irregular heartbeats ]

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,580
The symptoms are
throughout his body.

110
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,180
His respiratory and circulatory
system nerves are dying.

111
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,880
What we must do now is

112
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,100
to diagnose him before
his condition worsens.

113
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,860
Of course, we assume
it's not the Nipah virus.

00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,580
You'll really do this?

117
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,820
It's a highly contagious
and lethal virus.

118
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,230
Also, you're part of the
high-risk group, Dr. Cha.

119
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,540
Think of this...

120
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,000
as a hostage situation.

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,610
A disease inside the
patient is the culprit.

122
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,170
All of us locked up in
here are hostages.

123
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,460
And I'm the negotiator.

124
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,970
Is this fun for you?

125
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,350
Does it look fun?

126
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,940
As you said, I should be

127
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,690
out of here faster than
anyone and I really want to.

128
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,810
So help me.

129
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,590
Catch the culprit as fast as we can.

130
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,570
So we can all get out of here.

131
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,010
It's the Chief.

132
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,620
Hello?

134
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,440

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,180
The results will be out in a
few hours. Take care until then.

136
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,970
Relay this to Dr. Cha.

137
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,370
Keep the medical team under
control until we get the final results,

138
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,400
and call if any emergency arises.

139
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,460
Okay.

140
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,930
Also...

141
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,710
there's a chance it's
not the Nipah virus.

142
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,890
Dr. Cha went in there?

143
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,550
During a crisis like this,

144
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,370
isn't keeping protocol
basic and the best way?

145
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,020
He has no principles at all.

146
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,300
He's always been like this.
He's totally uncontrollable!

147
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,480
If Dr. Cha hadn't gone in, the juvenile
diabetes patient would've been in danger.

148
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,840
Dr. Cha keeps saying it might
not be the Nipah virus.

149
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,070
But how can it be proven right now?

150
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,900
Yes, we have a suspected
patient at our hospital.

151
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,010
Until we have the results,
I won't tolerate rash decisions.

152
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,750
Also, Dr. Cha entering the center,
regardless of the results...

153
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,110
He must face the consequences.

154
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,360
I've thought this before, but

155
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,620
you can't draw, Dr. Cha.

156
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,160
Don't remove your
protective equipment.

157
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,850
Not until we get out of here.

158
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,880
You gave up so soon.

159
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,210
It's not like you'll leave
because I tell you to.

160
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,740
You won't sit still here, either.

161
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,310
Telling you will be a
waste of my time.

162
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,970
Then you shouldn't have fallen.

- Yes?

164

Okay. Focus.

165

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,330
How is he?

170
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,120
He had a slight fever
after coming back to Korea,

171
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,190
and it lasted a few days.
He's fine now.

172
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,500
It could be a minor infection,
or infection without symptoms.

173
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,290
We can't totally eliminate the
possibility of the Nipah virus.

174
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,610
Of course, that's still open.

175
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,300
However, he has symptoms
unexplainable by the Nipah virus.

176
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,260
But we can't run a CT
nor an MRI here.

177
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,090
- Can we diagnose him?
- We must try.

178
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,470
Us, doctors, will be the
examination equipment.

179
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,970
We become the
examination equipment?

180
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,430
Can you all hear me?

181
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,270
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Dr. Cha.

182
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,580
A 68-year old male.

183
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,400
Chronic headaches,
loss of appetite, and

184
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,640
fatigue for a year.

185
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,150
Vomiting and chest pains
started recently.

186
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,400
And now, faster pulse, disorientation,
seizure, and palpitations.

187
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,870
New symptoms have appeared.

188
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,400
Dr. Cha thinks this patient
may not have the Nipah virus.

189
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Starting now, each person
takes one system.

190
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,780
We'll figure out what could
turn into systemic disease.

191
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,440
First-year Kim Won Hee, the lungs.

192
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,400
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,740
Second-year Kang Shi Young, the heart.

194
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,490
Yes, sir.

195
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,250
Third-year Kang Mi Rae,
the metabolic system.

196
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,650
Yes, sir.

197
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,520
Third-year Heo Joon, the brain.

198
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,190
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,180
Dr. Lee Yoo Joon, the digestive system.

200
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
- Yes, sir.
- I'll oversee the entire diagnosis.

201
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,130
Let's start.

202
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,430
Yes, sir.

203
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,400
[ Chronic lung disease ]

204
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,000
Dr. Cha, could it be
a chronic lung disease?

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
It's associated with chest pains,

206
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
fatigue, and palpitations.

207
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,800
What about the heart?

208
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,010
No high blood pressure,
obesity, nor diabetes.

209
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,620
No conditions that
could affect his heart.

210
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,930
No history of myocardial infarction, angina,
nor cardiac insufficiency either.

211
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,330
What about his X-rays?

212
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
[ Chronic Lung Disease
Chest X-ray ]

213
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,510
There's a slight
pneumonic infiltration.

214
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,150
Pneumonic infiltration?
[ Pneumonic infiltration:
When an infection spreads to the lungs ]

215
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,110
Next.

216
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,750
The arteriovenous malformation in
his brain and spinal cord

217
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,470
is affecting his entire body.

218
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,840
In relation to his headaches,
seizures, and dysaesthesia.

219
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,130
Is the patient's name Yoo Deok Gyu?

220
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes. But why?

221
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,470
Does he have white hair
by any chance?

222
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,510
Is Dr. Kang in the security room also?

223
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,050
She didn't see him,
how would she know?

224
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,340
Do you know him?

225
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,500
Yes.

226
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,800
I think so.

227
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,600
This is the best news so far.

228
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,740
Do you know him well?

229
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,050
I saw him during my volunteer work,
so I don't know him too well.

230
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,790
But I do know his occupation.

231
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,880
What is it?

232
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,890
He's a Catholic priest.

233
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,860
He has a rosary ring.

234
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,270
A priest...

235
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,980
What is he like?

236
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,550
As a religious figure
or a regular person.

237
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,990
He is a good man
regardless of his religion.

238
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,530
He did more volunteer work
and good deeds than others.

239
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
This really puzzles me sometimes.

240
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,200
I don't have a religion,
but I get curious.

241
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,800
If there is a God,

242
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,330
why would he allow a good,
religious man to suffer?

243
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,850
Because that's religion.

244
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,180
Religion makes people suffer?

245
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,660
How is his build? Is he thin?

246
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,430
Yes, why?

247
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
[ Height 168cm, Weight 67kg ]

248
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,570
Here's an additional symptom.

249
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,710
Rapid weight loss.

250
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,850
He seems to have lost at least

251
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,870
20kg from six months ago.

252
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,120
He was a bit stockier back then.

253
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,680
Any ailment which could
cause weight loss?

254
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,750
No.

255
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,660
He doesn't have diabetes
or any thyroid diseases.

256
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,250
But we don't know
about cancer or infection.

257
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,500
He didn't have any
geriatric diseases, either.

258
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,470
Why would all these
symptoms start a year ago?

259
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,380
Miss, are you okay?

260
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,920
What's wrong?

261
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,240
My arm hurts so much...

262
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,740
Dr. Cha, Lee Da Hae is
experiencing pain in her arm.

263
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,420
Please sedate her first.

264
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,850

Sunbae!

269
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,430
Yes, yes, Dr. Cha. I'm here.

270

Take care of it.

271
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,150
You promised to take care of it.

272
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,020
Longer the delay, the harder it'll be.

273
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,620
For both you and the patient.

274
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,350
- Dr. Cha...
- Say it.

275
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,330
I'll subdue her pain first.

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,330
Analgesic.

278
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,300
Miss, we'll administer an analgesic.

279
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,460
What's the reason?

280
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,780
The reason you decided
to come forward.

281
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,040
If she's experiencing phantom
limb pains, it may not be your fault.

282
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,860
I know that...

283
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,610
her pain may not be my fault.

284
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,000
But if I keep hiding it...

285
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,430
then it'll be harder to diagnose her.

286
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,290
Get ready.

287
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,880
I'm going in, too?

288
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,340
I like what you said.

289
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,060
It wasn't to lessen your guilt,

290
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,360
or because you felt
sorry for the patient.

291
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,300
It was for an accurate diagnosis.

292
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,600
Sir.

293
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,820
Sir, are you awake?

294
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,910
Mr. Yoo Deok Gyu.

295
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,430
I'm Dr. Cha Yo Han of
Dept. of Pain Medicine.

296
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,920
Can you hear me?

297
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,010
Yes.

298
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,110
I'll ask a few questions.

299
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,810
You had a sudden weight
loss recently, correct?

300
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,090
Yes.

301
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,360
Why did you lose so much weight?

302
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,390
Because I have no appetite.

303
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,350
A typical loss of appetite

304
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,260
won't cause such
a rapid weight loss.

305
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,880
There must be other reasons.

306
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,470
Truthfully...

307
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,080
starting a few months ago,

308
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,870
I started taking sleeping pills.

309
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,550
That's when I...

310
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,380
started vomiting,

311
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,620
and losing weight.

312
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,830
We don't see sleeping pill
prescription in your chart though.

313
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,020
Did you acquire them
somewhere else...

314
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,320
and not the hospital?

315
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,700
Sir.

316

[ Ended group call ]

Whatever you say in here,
it'll be kept confidential.

We're obligated not to
release patients' information.

322

So please tell us.

323
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,100
Why you took sleeping pills and
why there's no prescription record.

324
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,920
I didn't get a prescription.

325
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,820
I collected them...

326
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,830
for many decades.

327
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,160
We solved one element.

328
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,700
An overdose of sleeping pills

329
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,810
could lead to vomiting.

330
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,400
But the weight loss can't be
solely due to vomiting.

331
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,510
My illness...

332
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,150

Since you were administered

you would've been immobilized...
