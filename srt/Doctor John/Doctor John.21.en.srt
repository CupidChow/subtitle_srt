1
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,660
You have a choice
with the time you have left.

2
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,750
If you give up being a doctor,
you'll have more time.

3
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,980
If you choose to stay a doctor...

4
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,660
you'll risk all the time
you have left.

5
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,580
Does living as a doctor mean
everything to you?

6
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,280
Pull ourselves together!

7
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,510
Please move aside!

8
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,800
- Please move aside!
- Excuse us!

9
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,100
How is the patient?

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,640
She's not breathing.

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,690
Saturation level is 78.

12
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,060
Intubation will be difficult
due to nasal bleeding.

13
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,700
You don't know what pain is.

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,420
What is it you feel for the
patients who do know?

15
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,630
Sympathy?

16
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,510
Is it curiosity?

17
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,950
Ri Hye. Ri Hye, it's me.

18
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,820
I'm sorry, but you can't go in.

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,910
You'll see your son now.

20
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,270
Did we do the right thing?

21
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,070
She wanted to die enough
to jump off the building.

22
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,230
Is it okay...

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,050
to keep her alive like this?

24
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,450
We're not her friends.

25
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,910
We can't decipher life
or death for her.

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,610
We're doctors.

27
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,290
What also worries me here is that...

28
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,670
if she wrote an advance
directive or a DNR order,

29
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,180
wouldn't the intubation
be of an issue?

30
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,250
Then what?

31
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,030
That we shouldn't have
done anything?

32
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,700
No, that's not it, but...

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,780
Geez, what is the "right" thing here?

34
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,850
Let's report this to Dr. Cha first.

35
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,740
Ms. Yu Ri Hye?

36
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
How is her condition?

37
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,630
Take her to the ICU.

38
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,650
Okay, I'll be right there.

[ Episode 11: Consolation ]

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,430
I heard the patient has a child.

41
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,650
No mother would think of dying
when she has a child.

42
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,920
This means something caused
her to want to jump.

43
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,120
My gut tells me...

44
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,520
that her jumping off won't
be the end of this incident.

45

Someone...

49
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,480
shut off Yu Ri Hye's ventilator.

50
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,150
What?

the ventilator was off

so the police are on their way.

like this happen?

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,050
Who else could it be? Huh?

67
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,400
- Who else would it be?
- Dr. Kwon.

68

Please don't jump to conclusions.

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,360
Find the culprit through an
investigation, not speculations.

70
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,980
Yes! The police are on their way.

71
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,340
The police are headed to
our hospital. The police!

72
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,230
Director, please stay calm.

How can I stay calm?

74
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,740
Someone turned off
a patient's ventilator!

75
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,590
This is clearly an attempted murder.

76
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,520
Fortunately, she was
still able to breathe.

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,990
This could've been
a murder case. A murder!

78

Tell everyone to cooperate
with the investigation.

82

Gosh, this is insane.

86
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,800
Should we summon
Shi Young and Mi Rae?

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,330
And ask if they know anything?

88
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,150
If they know something...

89
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,360
then it'd be a problem,
don't you know?

Well...

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,010
it was around the end of
visiting hours in the ICU.

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,070
However, Yu Ri Hye
didn't have any visitors.

But that's the time

No.

125

Visiting hours are the most
hectic time of the day.

126

- Mom!
- Mother, what's wrong?

128

While it's in front of the station,

131
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,520
it's not so visible
due to the high table.

Even if it's not visible...

133
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,240
How could you not know when
a patient's ventilator was turned off?

134
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,660
Didn't the alarm go off?

135
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,160
I'll explain that.

136
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,940
An alarm will sound if there's
a problem with her vitals.

137
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,160
However, she was
breathing on her own.

138
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,640
No symptoms would've
been detected.

139
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,460
This is why the alarm didn't go off.

140
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,420
Yes.

141
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,000
Chief is correct.

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,870
Then how did you discover
that the ventilator was off?

143
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,920
As I told you already,

144
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,950
when the visiting hours
ended at 5 p.m.,

145
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,840
and the visitors had left...

146
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,440
I went in to replace her
antibiotics, but...

147
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,020
Dr. Cha from Anesthesiology
and Pain Medicine

148
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,860
was standing next to the ventilator
which was turned off.

149
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,630
You don't have security
cams inside the rooms?

150

allowed inside the wards.

Go to the security office and check
all the security cam footage.

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,630
Fine.

166
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,600
Don't say a word until
the truth is revealed.

167
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,730
No.

168
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,940
I'll cooperate with
the investigation.

169
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,480
As I did three years ago.

170
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,140
Dr. Cha.

171
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,440
Dr. Cha!

172
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,690
Dr. Cha!

173
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,930
Dr. Cha!

174

Kang Shi Young.

175
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,260
I promise you.

176
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,750
We meet again, Dr. Cha Yo Han.

177
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,940
You know what?

178
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,800
After I took your case
three years ago,

179
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,330
all medical-related
accidents and incidents...

180
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,280
They all come to me.

181
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,700
Have a seat.

182
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,210
I'm practically a doctor,
thanks to you.

183
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,780
When someone at
my station gets sick,

184
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,470
they all come to me first.

185
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,710
I guess someone's coming?

186
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,010
Who will conduct the investigation?

187
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,560
Things are becoming more
complicated than we anticipated.

188
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,980
Starting now, all interrogation
and examination...

189
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,350
will be headed and conducted by
Prosecutor Son Seok Ki.

190
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,890
I ask of you.

191
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,190
Yes, sir.

192
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,200
You should've listened to me.

193
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,430
I had given you a warning.

194
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,610
You don't remember?

195
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,540
What I want...

196
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,510
is only one thing.

197
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,270
I'm asking you not to do anything.

198
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,110
Please don't...

199
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,450
do anything.

200
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,610
If a doctor doesn't do anything,

201
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,350
then two things
happen to a patient.

202
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,610
Either experience death-like pains,

203
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,050
or die after experiencing pain.

204
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,260
I see.

205
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,250
So you did something
today, indeed.

206
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,550
That's good. Shall we
get started now?

207
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,010
Today's investigation is regarding the
attempted murder of Yu Ri Hye.

208
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,210
Cha Yo Han has the
right to remain silent.

209
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,190
If you forfeit that right
and make a statement,

210
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,450
it could be used as
evidence against you.

211
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,060
Well...

212
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,580
Do you have anything
to say before we start?

213
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,340
No, I don't.

214
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,400
Well, I do. I'm curious
about something.

215
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,890
From about noon today to the
estimated time of the incident,

216
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,460
you were absent for
about four hours.

217
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,840
I had called in sick.

218
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,560
Are you not feeling well?

219
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,410
I don't want to answer that.

220
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,810
You're not well. That's too bad.

221
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,050
It's nothing to worry about.

222
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,350
What a shame.

223
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,050
Regardless.

224
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,830
You were absent right up
till the time of the incident.

225
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,300
Is this what you're saying?

226
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,080
Yes, it is.

227
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,020
Three years ago.

228
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,230
I recall that day.

229
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,980
The first time I sat
with you face-to-face.

230
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,430
I mean...

231
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,540
If one thing has changed
since then, this time...

232
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,410
your team members will also

233
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,270
be investigated as
reference witnesses.

234
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,630
Yes.

235
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,180
Contagion is such a scary thing.

237
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,810
If something happens to me,

238
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,130
you'll be the first to know.

239
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,890
You'll be the first person I tell.

240
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,370
I promise.

241
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,420
Don't worry, Dr. Cha.

242
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,550
I have faith in you.

243
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,850
What will you do?

244
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,470
"Do you think Dr. Cha turned off
the ventilator or not?"

245
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,110
If the police ask,

246
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,360
how will you answer?

247
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,220
Also, do we need to mention

248
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,250
that we were going to
grant Yu Ri Hye's wish?

249
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,550
What about it?

250
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,400
Since we told her we
were going to do that,

251
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,570
the patient felt hopeful
about seeing her son.

252
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,340
But when that didn't go well,

253
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,140
she jumped off.

254
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,650
That is irrelevant to
shutting off the a ventilator.

255
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,270
It's not like one of us turned it off.

256
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,650
We're monitoring her.

257
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,100
Her vitals are stable for now.

258
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,480
We don't know when
she'll be conscious, correct?

259
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,170
No. We'll have to see.

About the estimated time

You were at the scene, correct?

- Yu Ri Hye's ICU ward.
- Yes.

Why did you go there?

268
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,960
I went to see the patient.

269
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,930
I heard she tried to kill
herself. I was worried.

270

Just exactly when and from
whom did you hear this report?

271
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,530
I reported it to Dr. Cha
around 4:45 p.m.

You were notified around 4:45 p.m.,

275
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,740
and arrived at the hospital
at about 4:50 p.m.

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,230
- Is this correct?
- Yes.

277
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,580
Did you go to the ICU right away?

278
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,690
No, I didn't.

281
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,380
I saw the scene of the suicide jump.

282
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,270
I went to the rooftop right away.

283
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,750
The rooftop?

284
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,760
You were worried about the patient.

285
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,700
Why go to the rooftop
first and not the ICU?

286
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,880
Is he a fool?

Who'd fall under the most
suspicion regarding this?

Even if he wasn't at the scene,

291
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,160
Dr. Cha has a euthanasia rep sheet.

292
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,460
He knows he'll be suspected,

293
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,810
yet he unplugs the
ventilator and denies it?

294
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,870
Do you think Dr. Cha is an idiot?

295
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,010
I don't think Dr. Cha is the one

296

who turned off the ventilator.

What you're saying is,
you stood in that spot

and empathized with her, correct?

She wanted to see her son.

When she couldn't see her son,

And her next wish is for
you to help her die?

"How she must've desired death.

did you go to the ICU

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,100
The exact moment the
ventilator was found unplugged.

331
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,810
It's also the moment
someone attempted murder.

332
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,430
Today, for the first time,

333
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,600
I really felt that Dr. Cha...

334
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,710
is such an amazing man.

335
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,360
When we performed intubation
on the patient after she jumped,

336
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,910
I worried about doing
so and wondered...

337
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,570
if we should be doing it.

338
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,540
And?

339
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,290
But Dr. Cha...

340
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,950
endured everything three years ago,

341
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,880
and put the patient to rest.

342
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,440
This does not mean that Dr. Cha

343
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,830
is the one who turned
off the ventilator. No way.

344
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,510
The ventilator was already
off when you arrived?

345
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,030
Yes.

346
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,650
At the exact time and place
where the incident occurred.

347
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,230
It was a coincidence you
arrived right then?

348
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,410
Yes.

349
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,640
Sure, let's say it's the truth.

350
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,340
I'll ask you one more question.

351
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,330
This will be my final reply today.

352
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,550

353
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,410
I'm a little tired.

354
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,820
This isn't a formal
interrogation, correct?

355
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,330
Should we make it official then?

356
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,480
Be my guest.

357
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,870
After you bring an official warrant.

358
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,060
Fine.

359
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,140
This will be your final reply today.

360
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,760
Not because you're tired,

361
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,470
but there is one thing left...

362
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,330
I'd really like to know.

363
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
It's murder.

364
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,140
Pardon?

365
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,120
My father is lying in our hospital.

366
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,630
Hooked up to a ventilator.

367
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,160
But if some doctor

368
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,440
turns off the ventilator without
my or my family's consent,

369
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,510
then it's a clear cut murder.

370
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,150
Yu Ri Hye didn't have
her guardian's consent.

371
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,550
We had plenty of time
to gain consent.

372
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,880
I don't think Dr. Cha had any reason
to shut off the ventilator...

373
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,590
unbeknownst to the guardian.

374
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,080
Her days were numbered,

375
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,370
and she was facing tremendous pain.

376
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,180
She was hooked up to a ventilator

377
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,650
even though she refused
to prolong her life.

378
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,170
When you arrived at the ICU,

379
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,050
what if the ventilator
wasn't shut off...

380
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,010
Dr. Cha...

381
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,610
What would you have done?

382
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,940
What did you just say?

383
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,330

384
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,080

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,930
What do you mean by that?

386
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,740
Actually...

387
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,920

Okay.

390
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,240
You should see for yourself.

391
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,110
This truth you can't speak of...

392

footage or not.

the security cams.

after I check the footage.

405
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,830
She's a scaredy-cat.

406
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,710
And for her to jump like that...

407
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,930
She had really wanted to go.

408
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,330
I wonder if clinging on
is the right thing.

409

410

had composed an advance directive.

411

If my sister worsens
at this point, then...

412
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,080
I would like to just...

413
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,280

for her to hold his hand?

♫ Will you, will you, will you cry ♫

495
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,530
Are you Min Sung?

496
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:53,630
♫ For yesterday and feel the pain ♫

497
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,100
Min Sung.

498
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,990
Are you here for your mom?

499
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:03,910
♫ To death today,
and lose that light ♫

500
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,480
Let's go.

501
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,090
We really have to hurry.

502
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:14,040
♫ You were going through your life,
there was time to play ♫

503
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,750
♫ To fade away ♫
