lung and abdomen X-rays,

329
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,910
and CT scans show no
abnormalities, either.

330
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,590
- Well...
- A gastroscopy and

331
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,170
a colonoscopy is
scheduled this afternoon.

332
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,620
Since no abnormalities
were found previously,

333
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,550
we'll run a fecal immunochemical test,
and also a stool culture test.

334
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,380
Dr. Heo, what is it?

335
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,490
What is it you've trying to say?

336
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,910
The thing is...

337
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,630
Dr. Cha is at our hospital right now.

338
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,920
What?

339
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,190
Dr. Cha? Right now?

340
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,000
Yes.

341
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,290
Someone saw Dr. Cha at our hospital.

342
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,000
Daebak, daebak. When
did he return from the US?

343
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,720
Then will he be coming
back to our hospital?

344
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,400
I don't know about that,
but he looks even cooler.

345
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,820
He was cool to begin with,

346
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,660
but he's looking
healthier than before,

347
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,120
and super duper charismatic.

348
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,080
Of course he would be, Sunbae.

349
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,990
Dr. Cha's research project
is a huge success.

350
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,970
A big US pharmaceutical company

351
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,130
signed an exclusive
contract for the new drug.

352
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,130
I'll take on this patient.

353
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,260
But she's my patient.

354
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,110
Please let me.

355
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,300
I want to stay busy today.

356
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,760
Are you okay?

357
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,600
Miss, can you hear me?

358
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,760
Miss.

359
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,680
- Miss.
- Excuse me.

360
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,600
Miss, where does it hurt?

361
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,820
She has a sudden wave of nausea.

362
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,790
Yes, then the convulsive stomach pain...

363
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,160
Let me take a look.

364
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,820
Is she asleep?

365
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,710
What could it be?

366
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,520
- Well...
- Any ideas?

367
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,420
I don't have ideas, but...

368
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,350
how about we ask Dr. Cha?

369
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,090
- Ask Dr. Cha?
- Yes.

370
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,110
I'm sorry to interrupt, but...

371
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,520
Who is this "Dr. Cha"?

372
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,180
You guys may not know, but

373
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,420
he is the legend of the legends.

374
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,550
His nickname is "Doctor 10 seconds."

375
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,290
He sees, and he knows.

376
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,790
A throwback to the
good old days, Sunbae.

377
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,920
Back then, I couldn't even
eat chicken breast freely.

378
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,040
Since we brought it up,
should we give it a go?

379
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,950
Give what a go?

380
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,410
Aren't we capable on our own?

381
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,090
We were fine this whole time.

382
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,100
Isn't that right, Dr. Lee?

383
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,850
Huh? Sure, we were doing fine.

384
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,640
What's with her?

385
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,170
You saw Dr. Cha, huh?

386
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,390
I guess you did.

387
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,730
What did he say?

388
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,470
When did he return to Korea?

389
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,500
A year ago.

390
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,970
A year?

391
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,890
He's been MIA this whole time.
Why appear all of a sudden?

You're putting together

Yes.

401

Pain management and

We'll have a palliative care

Yes, finally.
