1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,300
Please treat my leg ASAP.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,990
I just fell, that's it.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,130
Hey, how could you...

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,330
Won't you share? Give me some.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,520
I have to eat the whole thing.
Or else I'll lose muscles.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,220
So cold-hearted.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,450
What should we do?
Dr. Cha didn't come.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,280
I don't know if I should leave.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,750
- Mr. Heo.
- Yes?

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,050
You shouldn't talk about
eating right now.

11
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,470
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,210
But we shouldn't all starve.

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,530
- Food means energy.
- Wow.

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,770
Hello?

15
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,750
Yes, go ahead and eat.

16
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,250
I'm hungry.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,310
Where's the cafeteria?

18
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,950
The spicy pork stir fry is good here.

19
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,560
Why aren't you having any?

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,270
I don't eat fatty food.

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,550
The spicy beef soup isn't bad either.

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,840
I don't eat spicy food either.

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,740
You're pickier than I thought, Doctor.

24
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,970
Carb, protein, and fat.

25
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,880
It's a perfect meal.
What's the problem?

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,270
There's a spot. Hurry up. Hurry!

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,980
What?

28
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,880
Pardon?

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,610
Why are you staring at me?

30
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,360
Because...

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,330
I find it fascinating.

32
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,960
I didn't know I'd get to
see you again.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,120
I didn't know we'd work
at the same hospital either.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,310
Can't believe we're eating
at the cafeteria together like this.

35
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,950
You mean you're happy, right?

36
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,370
Pardon?

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,580
About what?

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,450
Well...

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,840
Happy about what...

40
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,290
You think I...

41
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,210
No, right?

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,750
I'm happy, too...

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,630
that I can eat and work
at a hospital like this.

44
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,820
I heard there was an
incident. My apologies.

45
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,680
Feel free to let us know
if anything bothers you.

46
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,840
I have...

47
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,360
a favor to ask about that.

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
By the way, Joo Hyung Woo...

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,460
Right before he fell down the stairs,

50
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,650
he paused for a second.

51
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,970
He was in such a hurry and stopped.

52
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,040
- Sir!
- I thought he changed his mind.

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
And?

54
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,470
He went down further...

55
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,020
and he fell right away.

56
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,140
If him stopping and falling...

57
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,560
has to do with the pain
or hypotonia on his legs...

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,190
But he's insisting that he simply fell.

59
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,020
Yes.

60
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,350
Actually, he seemed a bit
weird in the ward as well.

61
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,550
What do you mean, weird?

62
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,500
He suddenly mentioned
that he signed a DNR order.

63
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,310
He said he has a match next week.

64
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,550
He signed a DNR order?

65
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
- Let's go.
- Pardon?

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,700
He's definitely hiding something.

67
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,980
I'll call Dr. Cha and Shi Young
and talk to them myself.

68
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,700
You won't need to call them.

69
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,630
See me for a moment.

70
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,330
Do I have to follow her?

71
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,000
I think I told you not
to cause any troubles.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,100
Why did you cause trouble stopping
a patient who wants to leave?

73
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,530
That's not why he fell.

74
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,050
- Something is wrong with his body...
- What's wrong?

75
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,320
I suspect either multiple sclerosis
or neuromyelitis optica.

76
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,780
He needs to get transferred to
Neurology and get tested.

77
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,070
The patient rejected any
treatment or checkups.

78
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,130
He asked us to keep
you away from him!

79
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,870
Why did you have to
cause trouble like this?

80
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,410
Let me persuade him.

81
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,950
Don't you think you're going too far?

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,450
This incident and what happened
three years ago are the same.

83
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,820
What do you mean?

84
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,340
Us, doctors, tend to
perceive terminal illnesses

85
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,180
and patients' deaths as a failure.

86
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,320
Especially someone
as proficient as you

87
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,360
takes pride in diagnosing
and treating patients

88
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,450
no matter what the condition is.

89
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,920
I wonder if you're doing this
because you don't want to fail.

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,040
That's a new interpretation that the
justice department didn't even bring up.

91
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,290
What evidence do you have exactly?

92
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,730
You say you're doing
this for the patient,

93
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,860
but you're making
a decision against his will.

94
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,370
If you make a life-or-death
decision for him as well...

95
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,290
the same thing could easily happen.

96
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,740
Just like what happened
three years ago.

97
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,990
So what are you saying?

98
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,150
If you were that concerned
about what happened then,

99
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,220
you should've decided
before hiring me.

100
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,550
Or why don't you complain
to the Ethics Committee?

101
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,510
And of course, there's
no reason for me to...

102
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,010
go through that to
stay at this hospital.

103
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,180
Don't you think?

104
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,830
Are you going to Joo Hyung Woo?

105
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,950
- I'll come with you.
- Stay out of it.

106
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,310
Don't come. Didn't you hear me?

107
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,920
The patient refused to be treated.

108
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,600
What if you go and problems...

109
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,500
So stay out of it.
Before you get hurt by it.

110
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,990
Do you want to learn from me?

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,740
Don't pick up these things.

112
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,250
Go away, go away!

113
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,970
Go away, go away!

114
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,960
Say no to euthanasia!

115
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,990
Say no! Say no!

116
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,040
Go away, go away!

117
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,090
Say no to euthanasia!

118
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,370
Say no! Say no!

119
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,900
What's...

120
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,930
that?

121
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,110
Go away, Cha Yo Han!

122
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,960
Go away, go away!

123
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Say no to euthanasia!

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,090
Say no, say no!

125
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,490
There's a doctor who kills
patients at this hospital!

126
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,900
Please sign the petition
against euthanasia.

127
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,480
Please sign the petition.

128
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,750
There's a doctor who kills
patients at this hospital!

129
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,670
Please sign the petition
against euthanasia!

130
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,100
Say no, say no!

131
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,820
There's a doctor who kills
patients at this hospital!

132
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,490
Please sign the petition!

133
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,270
There's a doctor who kills
patients at this hospital.

134
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,920
Please sign the petition!

135
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,320
Say no, say no!

136
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,300
Go away, Cha Yo Han!

137
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,980
Go away, go away!

138
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,050
Say no to euthanasia!

139
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,920
Say no, say no!

140
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Please sign the petiton
against euthanasia!

141
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
There's a doctor who kills
patients at this hospital!

142
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,880
This is about the brain, not the eye.

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,720
I suspect multiple sclerosis
or neuromyelitis optica.

144
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,760
We need a brain MRI and
see what's causing it.

145
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,160
Do you think we just sat
back and watched?

146
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,840
We persuaded the patient
and did a brain MRI scan.

147
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,990
So what's the result?

148
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,730
We just got it.
Everything was normal.

149
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,830
Go meet with the patient
if you're satisfied.

150
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,690
- Am I allowed to?
- The patient wanted to see you.

151
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,970
He has something to say to you.

152
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,090
- Me?
- Yes.

153
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,950
I heard you wanted to see me.

154
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,440
Joo Hyung Woo.

155
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,860
Do you...

156
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,510
come to my match often?

157
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,110
Yes.

158
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,230
It's my only hobby.

159
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,210
Violence is definitely addictive...

160
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,640
to both the fighters
or the audience.

161
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,470
I'm sorry, but I don't go
to watch violent fights.

162
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,620
What for then?

163
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,960
What accompanies violence?

164
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,710
There are spectators.

165
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,430
There's enthusiasm and shouting.

166
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,690
- And I'm there.
- That's right.

167
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,420
And there's pain...

168
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,340
that you feel.

169
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
Even if the bones
and muscles break...

170
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,450
and central nerves get damaged,

171
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,200
you fight until the end.

172
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,050
I go there to see that pain.

173
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,640
Because that's the best
place to observe pain.

174
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,000
The two of us are similar.

175
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,330
I'm interested in how to cause pain...

176
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,720
and you're interested
in how to lessen it.

177
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,330
We both only think about pain.

178
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,340
Yes, I want to take your pain away.

179
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,870
Would you do whatever
it takes if you could?

180
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,680
What did you say?

181
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,280
I fainted when I went to
South America to film recently.

182
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,020
I woke up at the hospital and...

183
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,540
I noticed a machine
was breathing for me.

184
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,950
My vision was blurry and
my limbs had no energy.

185
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,510
My body was attached to a machine.

186
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,850
I was used to controlling
my own body all my life,

187
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,070
but I was so afraid
because I felt so trapped.

188
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,950
It was terrifying.

189
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,010
Why are you telling me this?

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,220
I heard you...

191
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,050
euthanized a patient three years ago.

192
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,840
If I can't breathe nor move again...

193
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,210
If I have to live like that
for the rest of my life...

194
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,030
Could you let me go, too?

195
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,630
A fighter without vision and limbs...

196
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,200
is better off dead. He can't
live attached to a machine.

197
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,060
I'm someone who
takes your pain away.

198
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,020
I'm not here to fix your
problems in your life.

199
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,420
But that's pain.

200
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,320
There's no point in living like that.

201
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,690
You feel pain because you're alive.

202
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,740
The fact that you feel
pain means you're alive.

203
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,510
To me, pain is...

204
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,260
enduring.

205
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,730
Enduring everything even if you
get torn, broken, and beaten...

206
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,010
that's fighting.

207
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,760
I've been enduring
so I could keep fighting.

208
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,390
If I can't fight,

209
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,250
there's no reason to endure anymore.

- Yes.

Can we not intubate then?

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
We have to. He's not terminally ill.

Yes.

We're aware.

Not everyone, I bet.

- What's going on?
- It's respiratory failure.

He's your patient.
Why are you asking me?

262
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,240
How is he my patient?
He came in for his eye.

263
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,570
So what do you want?

264
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,750
I've never done that as an intern.

265
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,700
You said you called
the ER. Just wait.

266
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,420
He can't wait for that!

267
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,780
I mean...

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,650

take full responsibility?

Oh, yeah.

270
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,650
The ER said

271
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,010
he signed a DNR order.

272
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,040
He wanted them to mention
that if there's an emergency.

He's not terminally ill.

282
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,690
This is a different case.

283
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,030
It is legally.

284
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,050
But the moment you intubate,

285
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,600
he might be attached to a
machine for the rest of his life.

286
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,000
Give me the Ambu.

287

Hold on! Dr. Cha Yo Han.

288
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,850
Can you take responsibility for this?

289
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,130
Did he save him?

290
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,280
The legal condition for
following a DNR order is

291
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
when the patient can't
be revitalized and

292
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,730
when they don't recover
after treatment.

293
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,240
Only if they're about to die due to
drastic worsening of the condition.

294
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,720
The attending physician
and the medical specialist

295
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,250
both need to agree that
the patient is about to die.

296
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,700
But we don't know anything
about his condition or his diagnosis.

297
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,610
What if his illness got worse and

298
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,590
he's about to die now?

299
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,010
Are you sure he's about to die?

300
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,770
Can anyone of you

301
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,530
be sure that he's terminally ill and

302
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,320
he can't be treated anymore?

303
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,870
All patients have the right
to be treated until then.

304
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,410
And the entire medical staff is
obligated to do their bests.

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,080
mean by that?

could be used for anal cancer then.

312
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,490
participate in that clinical trial.

313
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,760

That was the day...

The fact that he euthanized him

323

was...

324
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,930
clearly a murder.

325
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,150

333

[ The doctor who killed the patient

334
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,180
- Are you going home?
- Yes.

335
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,450
The phrase, "The patient wanted to live."

336
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,950
Do you know what that means?

337
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,920
I can kind of assume.

338
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,500
By chance, are they talking about...

339
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,630
the clinical trial agreement?

340
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,100
You're working so hard
even on your first day.

341
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Are you praising or criticizing?

342
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,340
I heard about Joo Hyung Woo.

343
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,860
The chief of Anesthesiology
called us to confirm

344
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,780
if there are any legal problems.

345
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,900
What are you going to do?

346
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,380
You should know better
if you're a lawyer.

347
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,340
Did I do anything illegal?

348
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,860
No, but...

349
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,330
it's not good to cause
any controversy.

350
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,780
This is your comeback
after three years.

351
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,440
Actually, I wanted to
ask you about that.

352
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,300
Who recommended me
for this job?

353
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,090
I said it was me.

354
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,170
I'm the one who always helped
you throughout your career.

355
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,670
When you said you'd
receive any punishment,

356
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,740
I represented you and
reduced your sentence.

357
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,640
I helped you get a job when
everyone was reluctant to hire you.

358
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,710
Didn't we get closer by
going through hardships?

359
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,450
Of course, I did ask someone
much more powerful than me.

360
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,510
But the connections
can only get you so far.

361
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,010
How long you'd last
here is up to you.

362
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,220
You know what I mean, right?

363
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,210
In any case.

364
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,030
That Cha Yo Han...

365
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,310
I looked up his trial record
because I was curious about him.

366
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,470
That's when I learned
about the agreement.

367
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,150
You'd probably ask me this next.

368

"Was Dr. Cha aware of that or not?"

369
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,440
I didn't know.

370
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,970
I learned about the agreement...

371
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,170
the day after the patient died.

372
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,010
That amazing Cha Yo Han

373
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,400
made a mistake of missing
a piece of information.

374
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,670
Dr. Cha made a mistake?

375
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,990
But it probably wasn't a mistake.

376
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,370
What was it then?

377
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,850
You mean he did that
when he knew about it?

378
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,250
He probably trusted his instinct.

379
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,950
To end the patient's
excruciating pain,

380
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,240
it's better to end his
pain rather than

381
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,030
torturing with false hope
through the clinical trials.

382
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,610
Anyway, he still made a decision...

383
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,300
regardless of the patient's will.

384
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,930
Do you want to believe
that it was a mistake?

385
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,580
Or do you think he punished him
because he was a kidnapper?

386
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,720
Cha Yo Han is way too
professional to do that.

387
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,350
Put...

388

389

What if he was afraid?

390
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,270
If the patient asked to be
killed due to excruciating pain,

391
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,160
even someone like Dr. Cha...

392
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,750
would've been afraid
at that moment.

393
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,630
If a person is too scared...

394
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,860

the heat of the moment?

You mean Dr. Cha?

397
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,870
Dr. Cha I saw in jail performed
surgeries outside of ORs...

398
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,640
and wasn't afraid to do surgeries
he wasn't specialized in.

399
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,000
Why do you think he
goes out of his way?

400
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,680
Because he's fearless.

401
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,200
That's how I see Dr. Cha.

402

He's fearless and
makes no mistakes.

403
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,360
If you can't cure his pain,
then you must end it.

404
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,470
If the doctor doesn't do anything,
the patient's pain won't end.
