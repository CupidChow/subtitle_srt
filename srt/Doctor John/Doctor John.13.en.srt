00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,250
Aigoo, my son.

2
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,220
How come everyone including
your professor is so handsome?

3
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,610
I thought you were the
only good looking one.

4
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,050
Aigoo, you worked hard.

5
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,200
Go home and rest.

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,540
It was nothing.

7
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,740
Have them come over often.

8
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,930
Are you on your way home?

9
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,780
Yes.

10
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,660
It's true.

11
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,610
The family always
has it the toughest.

12
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,630
But others don't know that.

13
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,020
Geez, seriously.

14
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,430
My father collapsed from
a stroke in his 40's.

15
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,730
He was bedridden for over
10 years before passing.

16
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,370
That's why...

17
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,450
I don't have many
memories of my father.

18
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,630
I only remember him
smelling like a patient.

19
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,620
That's why I left home early.

20
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,540
But I'm back at a place
smelling of patients.

21
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,190
So, am I here because of
patients like my father?

22
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,560
No.

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,720
Well then?

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,360
Because of...

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
guardians like my mom.

26
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,070
I want to...

27
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,180
lessen their burden.

28
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,710
Because I know how hard it is.

29
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,310
Cheer up.

30
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,640
Okay?

About what?

34
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,490
I didn't...

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,320
get to say thank you
to your mother.

36

You're fine.

38
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,960
I'll relay the message.

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,770

That's why patients like me
don't live more than 20 years.

You don't know what it's
like to feel nothing...

That's why you can

to go back to how I was!

53
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,950
Since it's not cold,

54
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,880
it's not warm either.

55
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,420
Living in a sensory
deprived world.

56
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,010
A taste that's neither
cold nor hot.

57
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,190
Not only ice cream...

58
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,450
but his entire life.

59
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,430
It's not true, right?

60
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,500
Right, Doctor?

61
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,780
When I was 12...

62
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,650
my father coughed up
blood and collapsed.

63
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,450
I called 911.

64
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,560
They asked where he was hurting.

65
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,890
I don't know.

66
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,040
I didn't know.

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,710
Even if I ask, he doesn't know.

68
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,230
I said, we don't know!

69
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,850
My dad doesn't know
why he is sick!

70
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,790
My father...

71
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,360
didn't know where and
why he was hurting.

72
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,150
Me neither.

73
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,470
It's the same illness.

74
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,770
These right here...

75
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,870
were your health records, Doctor?

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,410
It's a way of survival.

77
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,070
Since my body won't talk,
I must keep monitoring it.

78
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,110
- No fever.
- Can you make a chart?

79
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,960
You don't have a fever,
why make a chart...

80
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,780
And take my pulse.

81
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,550
Are you a hypochondriac?

82
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,590
Temperature, pulse,
breathing, blood pressure.

83
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,100
Why do you measure every day?

84
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,580
That's why...

85
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,630
you checked your vitals
every day back then...

You're the first to find
out about my illness.

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,970
This means...

88
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,470
my illness has always
been a secret...

89
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,640
and you have
discovered that secret.

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Could you...

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,530
keep this a secret?

92
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,860
Why was it a secret?

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,770
A ticking bomb.

94
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,380
A doctor with a ticking bomb
that can explode any minute.
