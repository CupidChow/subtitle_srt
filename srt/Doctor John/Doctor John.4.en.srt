you could do for him?

she died before the age of 40.

By chance, did his mother die
of the same symptoms?

89
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,870
I don't know about that,

90
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,030
but his sister died recently, too.

91
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,470
His sister?

92
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,800
How?

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,100
Chronic renal failure?

94
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,790
He also has an older brother,

95
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,130
but he's not well, either.

96
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,400
His mother died before age 40,

97
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,180
and his sister has a history of CKD.

98
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,600
Could his family history
be any more clear?

99
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,360
If the mom has Fabry,

100
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,630
her sons and daughters
have a 50% probability.

101
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,910
Isn't this why an early
diagnosis is crucial for Fabry?

102
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,820
It's completely treatable,

103
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,410
but they miss the timing due
to late diagnosis and die.

104
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,510
If they would've known,

105
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,460
his mother and sister
wouldn't have died.

106
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,320
Is it definite?

107
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,600
So for the last time...

108
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,050
shouldn't we run one
more enzyme test?

109
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,010
Run another test, wait for results,

110
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,250
and suffer another shock.

111
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,530
But what if the results
still state otherwise?

112
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,500
Who will take responsibility then?

113
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,700
There's nothing more
we can do here.

114
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,080
What do you mean?

115
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,840
He'll be transferred.

116
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,680
Per his guardian's request.
I'll abide by his wishes.

117
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,990
A big hospital is the best option.

118
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,360
What if something goes wrong?

119
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,400
Since we ruled out Fabry,

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,680
they'll run tests all over again
when he's transferred.

121
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,610
What if he has renal failure and
be dependent on dialysis for life?

122
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,590
You think that makes sense?

123
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,120
It's not entirely impossible.

124
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,430
Abide by the probability.

125
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,600
Target the most probable
with our time and resources.

126

You said you're just a part-timer.

127
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,550
It's only a temporary job,

128
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,190
why obsess over this patient?

129
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,230
You're completely
different from yesterday.

130

It's too late.

138
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,120

Well, that's...

140

Um...

141
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,560
His father was adamant about it.

142
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,300
There's nothing I can do now.

143
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,230
You gave it your all.

144

You were on it since last night.

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,130
No, I wasn't.

146
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,490
Admit him to a tertiary hospital
in Nephrology. It's urgent.

147
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,530
Only if I had listened...

148
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,890
If I'd rushed him to the hospital...

149
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,140
Yes.

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,210

- Yes.

151

They decided to transfer him.

152

If you transfer him now, it's over.

153
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,000
They'll start all over again.

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,770
But there's no other way.

155
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,880
They can't help him here.

156
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,170
- You have medication, right?
- Medication?

157

Yes, Shi Young got
some yesterday.

158

I'll go over there.

161
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,110
What? Hello, hello? 6238?

162

What is he talking about...

163

What did he say?

164
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,140
He said to put the medicine
there or wherever.

165

The medicine?

166

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,490
Doctor.

171
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,980
You have more to say?

172
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,970
Prepare the ERT medication.

173
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,090
They may need it at the new hospital.

174
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,340
It'll take a while to get it again.

175
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,640
Just in case they need it.

176
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,770
That's why we took the
trouble to get it.

177
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,990
Here is the ERT medication.

178
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,710
Take it just in case,

179
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,750
and give it to the new hospital.

180
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,980
Okay, will do.

181
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,810
No.

182
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,030
We must start the
ERT treatment now.

183
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,500
He has Fabry disease for sure.

184
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,250
There are no zebra bodies.
How many times must I tell you?

185
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,900
It's rare, but the zebra bodies
don't show up in biopsy at times.

186
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,630
Says who? Did 6238 say that?

187
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,430
Are you out of your mind?

188
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,720
Listening to a doctor
who lost his license?

189
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,310
He has Fabry for sure?

190
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,750
Get out.

191
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,630
Leave now!

192
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,850
You're the famed Dr. Lee Yoo Joon?

193
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,130
Who are you?

194
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,440
Nice to meet you.

195
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,810
I'm 6238.

196
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,820
Please excuse me.

197
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,930
Wait.

198
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,960
How can you be here?

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,160
Inmate 6238.

200
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,920
As of 12 o'clock today,
he's been released.

201
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,030
A few years ago,

202
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,410
a patient was admitted to
Seoul Myeongwon University Hospital's

203
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,250
Nephrology Department.

204
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,190
While suffering from albuminuria,

205
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,770
her condition deteriorated,

206
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,080
and even required dialysis.

207
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,060
Her kidney biopsy showed

208
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,540
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

209
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,800
The same diagnosis you
gave Park Jung Bo.

210
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,760
The patient's older sister
offered to give one of her kidneys,

211
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,060
but do you know what
they found in the biopsy?

212
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,310
It was thick and clear zebra bodies.

213
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,170
It was Fabry disease.

214
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,960
Is that right?

215
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,280
- Why didn't the younger sister show...
- The zebra bodies?

216
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,380
It's not that they weren't there.

217
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,930
They were covered up by dead cells.

218
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,350
Like Park Jung Bo.

219
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,600
You can't transfer him right now.

220
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,320
While they're diagnosing him,

221
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,140
he may cross the point of no return.

222
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,590
We must treat him right now.

223
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,090
Treatment comes
after definite diagnosis.

224
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,380
Definite diagnosis?

225
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,000
What are the chances
of Fabry, Dr. Lee Yoo Joon?

226
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
You know too well.

227
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,970
It's 1 out of 117,000.

228
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,390
It's a very rare disease.

229
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,210
Au contraire.

230
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,270
Going from hospital to hospital,

231
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,570
trying alternative
medicine and going broke.

232
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,100
Including those who died
without a diagnosis,

233
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,320
there are many more...

234
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,050
Fabry patients than reported.

235
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,440
All it requires is a diagnosis,

236
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,170
but many died because
they couldn't be diagnosed.

237
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,600
Yes, the diagnosis is not out.

238
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,360
Administer expensive medication
without a definitive diagnosis?

239
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,340
Why should I take such a risk?

240
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,740
The one at risk is the patient.

241
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,900
You poured steroids
in his system, correct?

242
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,590
If his kidneys deteriorate and
can't handle a transplant,

243
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,830
who'll take responsibility?

244
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,880
How dare you threaten me?

245
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,570
It's not a threat, it's a warning.

246
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,110
Not from me, but from the patient.

247
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,510
He's my patient!

248
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,580
Whether you're a famous
med school professor or not...

249
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,690
he's my patient right now.

250
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,650
So don't meddle here.

251
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,070
Are you positive it's not Fabry?

252
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,710
Yes, you're the doctor
in charge here.

253
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,390
However, I tended to
him for almost a year.

254
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,090
In prison?

255
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,620
I won't risk...

256
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,570
my license and behave
recklessly as you have.

257
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,730
Transfer the patient.

258
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,430
What are you doing?

259
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,040
You're not a doctor!

260
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,700
Don't you know treating a patient
without a license is illegal?

261
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,320
Kang Shi Young, you're a doctor, right?

262
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,750
Yes.

263
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,530
I am a doctor.

264
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,490
What in the world...

265
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,990
- I'll take responsibility.
- Responsibility?

266
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,480
How?

267
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,550
- Plus you're an outside doctor...
- I'll accept the consequences.

268
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,240
However, if I don't do anything,

269
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,530
the patient will continue to suffer.

270
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,340
Not due to his illness...

271
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,690
but because of the
doctor's negligence...

272
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,170
he'll suffer.

273
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,210
Doctor!

274
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,420
He's the older brother.

275
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,430
- Jung Mo!
- Father.

276
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,550
Jung Bo...

277
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,820
Even you're in this state...

278
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,530
I'm sorry...

279
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,290
Why are you sorry?

280
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,460
It's because of my wrongdoings.

281
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,910
He's currently on dialysis.

282
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,440
Doctor, please save my sons.

283
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,410
I'm not scared that I'll lose them.

284
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,470
I'm scared they'll die without

285
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,600
knowing the cause like
their mom and sister.

286
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,800
Just what is this disease

287
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,550
and why is it so cruel, Doctor?

288
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,390
Please save them, Doctor.

289
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,010
Perform a biopsy on his brother.

290
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,100
You'll see it right away.

291
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,480
I see it.

292
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,990
He'll live.

293
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,300
You saved him, Dr. Kang.

294
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,190
And...

295
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,400
Doctor.

296
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,900
What happened?

297
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,360
Fabry has been confirmed.

298
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,100
Then they'll be cured?

299
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,970
Yes.

300
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,770
The patient and the brother, too.

301
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,940
They're treatable.

302
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,500
Thank you, Doctor.

303
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,890
Thank you...

304
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,240
Doctor.

305
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,110
Thank you so much.

306
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,680

Wait, we can't call him
that anymore.

309
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,720
He's Cha Yo Han.

310
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,500
He just left.

311
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,770
He left?

312
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,810
To where?

313
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,580
Wherever he wants.
He's a free man now.

Regarding our Department of
Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine's

337
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,500
second-year resident,
Kang Shi Young.

338
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,790
We're thinking of...

339
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,670
reinstating Kang Shi Young.

340
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,140
She's been undergoing psychotherapy,

341
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,020
and was recently
diagnosed free of PTSD.

342
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,700
She completed her
internship diligently,

343
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,400
and she always

344
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,910
scored high on her evaluations, but...

345
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,430
Is she ready to see patients without
being affected by that incident?

346
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,340
I'm honestly concerned.

347
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,170
But it was an accident.

348
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,440
Recovery time required
after an accident...

349
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,250
differs by individual, no?

350
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,790
Yes, it was an accident.

351
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,150
However, Dr. Kang needed to

352
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,400
work on other areas prior to that.

353
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,920
What do you mean by that?

354
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,400
Probably her extreme
empathy with patients.

355
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,130
Yes.

356
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,940
From her first year, her
examinations were so lengthy

357
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,420
that she was ordered not to talk
more than a minute with the patients.

358
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,570
However, that's her strength, too.

359
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:17,090
We tell the residents to
assess the patients thoroughly.

360
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,490
But her extreme empathy

361
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,780
often clouded her
judgment as a doctor.

362
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,010
Perhaps that's why the incident...
