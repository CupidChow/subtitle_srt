1
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:05,466
She's awake.

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,266
Are you awake now?

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,066
How are you feeling?

4
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,066
How long did I sleep?

5
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:20,526
- For about an hour.
- I see.

6
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:21,916
I didn't sleep much.

7
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,866
- I once slept for 12 hours.
- 12 hours?

8
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:25,956
Yes.

9
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:29,636
So when do I get to eat?

10
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:37,196
Please eat slowly.

11
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:39,246
Thank you, Doctor.

12
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:43,846
You said it's been over
10 years, correct?

13
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:46,566
You get abdominal pains
five times a day,

14
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:48,646
and the minimum duration
is one minute.

15
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:50,216
The maximum is five minutes.

16
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,716
But it's not accompanied by
vomiting, diarrhea, or fever.

17
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:55,636
You fall asleep after the symptom.

18
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:57,956
You never lost
consciousness, correct?

19
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,096
Recently, various symptoms
from light stomach pain and

20
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:02,396
abdominal inflation have surfaced.

21
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,536
During severe pain spells,
you also get nausea, correct?

22
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,666
Yes.

23
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,476
The test results are out.

24
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:14,276
Nothing out of the ordinary, huh?

25
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:16,326
No.

26
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,606
Your CBC and chemistry
are both normal.

27
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,566
Give it to me, give it.

28
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:28,666
Even your digestive enzyme
levels are in the normal range.

29
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:30,426
I told you.

30
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:34,046
All the test results so
far have been normal.

31
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,286
Doctors, do you believe me?

32
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:42,816
Every time I go to a hospital,

33
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:46,196
they said it's irritable bowel syndrome
or psychosomatic illness.

34
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:49,056
Some even mentioned
Munchausen syndrome.

35
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:52,166
[ Munchausen syndrome: A mental disorder
where one fakes illness to gain attention ]

36
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:53,506
It's probably...

37
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:57,396
due to the most test results not
showing any abnormalities.

38
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:58,896
I know.

39
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:01,286
Has it crossed your mind...

40
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:03,056
that I could be lying?

41
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:09,666
A professor...

42
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:13,586
who used to mentor us
used to say this.

43
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:15,026
"Remember,

44
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:17,076
we may not know the
cause of the pain,

45
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,196
but no pain exists without a cause."

46
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:30,896
Because I get sick at any given time...

47
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:33,666
I get anxious and
nervous all the time.

48
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:37,656
"Not right now."

49
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,596
"Please delay the pain
just a little longer..."

50
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,546
This is my prayer.

51
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:46,476
Doctors.

52
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:52,376
Please set me free.

53
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:55,256
Please.

54
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:02,476
We'll do everything we can.

55
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:04,896
Please stay strong, Miss.

56
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:10,436
After you finish eating,
should we run more tests?

57
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:11,626
Sure.

58
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,656
What is it?

59
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,426
It's all in English.

60
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:29,126
Sunbae, are you good in English?

61
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,066
My friend sent this, and I was
going to skip it since it's in English.

62
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,266
But here...

63
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:36,586
Dr. Cha's name, right here.

64
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:38,966
What does it say?

65
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,626
What is it?

66
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:00,346
See me for a sec.

67
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,796
Dr. Cha...

68
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:12,966
Three months after starting
research in the US,

69
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:15,966
he came down with a severe case of PCP.
[ PCP: A lung infection ]

70
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:18,346
It's around the time he
stopped calling you.

71
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:22,956
And?

72
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:26,166
He was near the brink of death,
that's why he couldn't call.

73
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,696
After he recovered, I'm sure
he focused on the research.

74
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:31,336
Since he may not have
much time left,

75
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:33,026
he gave it his all.

76
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,656
It's so like him.

77
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,716
- Everyone knows.
- But still...

78
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:39,186
Isn't it understandable
why you lost contact then?

79
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,876
At the time, yes.
What about afterward?

80
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:45,146
He came back to Korea a year
ago, and he never called...

81
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:47,706
Never mind.

82
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:49,386
No use talking about it now.

83
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,986
Did you run a brainwave
test on the patient?

84
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:23,486
Hello?

85
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:27,236
Dr. Cha, it's you, right?

86
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:29,256
Your CBC and chemistry...

87
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,866
- are both normal.
- Give it to me, give it.

88
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:37,776
Even your digestive enzyme
levels are in the normal range.

89
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,506
What are you saying?

90
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:44,536
You didn't run a general
brainwave test, correct?

91
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:45,976
Or is there...

92
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:48,496
a record of a previous examination?

93
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,936
Last year, another hospital

94
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,166
conducted a brain MRI
and a brainwave test.

95
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:56,106
And the results?

96
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:04,446
There weren't any abnormalities.

97
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:07,256
- They ran a general brainwave test?
- Yes.

98
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,446
It was a general brainwave test.

99
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:11,716
Then monitor her
brainwaves for 24 hours.

100
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:20,976
Why did you do that?

101
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:25,356
I told you to tell me
if you got sick.

102
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:28,256
You were ill to the point
of delirium...

103
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,506
yet you didn't think of me?

104
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,466
You could've died...

105
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,036
yet you didn't tell me about it?

106
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:37,706
For three years...

107
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:40,406
there were no guarantees
about anything.

108
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,126
My health...

109
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:48,426
and the time I had left.

110
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,526
But...

111
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:53,716
I was sure about one thing.

112
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:55,506
I had faith...

113
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:58,236
that our love wouldn't end easily.

114
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,836
I didn't want this to repeat again.

115
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,836
Once I regained my health,

116
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:08,596
and when I'm able to
instill faith in you...

117
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:13,356
That's when I wanted to return.

118
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,506
I'm sorry, Shi Young.

119
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,336
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,866
Sorry.

121
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:42,456
However...

122
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:46,786
you don't have time to be
shedding tears like this.

123
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:48,596
You should go to your patient.

124
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:50,446
Go and do as I told you.

125
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,236
Monitoring brainwaves
for 24 hours.

126
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:53,376
Why...

127
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,986
are you telling me to do this?

128
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:58,196
She has sudden abdominal pains,

129
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:00,146
then it suddenly disappears.

130
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,446
After the symptoms appear,

131
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:04,406
she doesn't lose consciousnesses,
but she falls asleep.

132
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:06,806
If there's no response
to any analgesic,

133
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:09,136
and all her test results
come back normal...

134
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,956
After the 24-hour brainwave test,

135
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:13,966
if we discover epileptic waves
during her abdominal pains...

136
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:16,816
Abdominal epilepsy.

137
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:18,686
I'm saying it's a possibility.

138
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:20,956
All the symptoms fall together.

139
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:23,316
Since epilepsy wasn't
in the picture so far...

140
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,946
That's why she was
unresponsive to

141
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,696
analgesics and
digestive medication.

142
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:29,766
Prescribing anti-seizure drug
will improve her dramatically.

143
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:31,866
That's correct.

144
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,626
- Dr. Cha!
- Dr. Cha!

145
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,836
Dr. Cha, Dr. Cha!

146
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:53,356
How long has it been?
We really missed you.

147
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:56,236
Why didn't you call us?
We were waiting for you.

148
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,276
Yes, I missed you guys, too.

149
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,206
I missed you, too, but...

150
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,266
We really missed you, Dr. Cha!

151
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,116
Dr. Cha, Dr. Cha...

152
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,506
Let me take a look.

153
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:07,386
You looked so
skinny in the picture...

154
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:08,786
I really missed you!

155
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:10,746
- Dr. Cha.
- We did!

156
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,666
- Yes, yes.
- We missed you.

157
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,636
Abdominal epilepsy?

158
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,746
Yes.

159
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,216
I asked the patient,

160
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:43,656
and she hasn't had a
24-hour brainwave test.

161
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:47,066
Should we consult with Neurology?

162
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,766
Yes, let's start right away.

163
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,796
Dr. Lee, Dr. Lee, Dr. Lee!

164
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:52,806
What is it?

165
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:55,636
- We just saw Dr. Cha.
- Where?

166
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,876
- Is he really here?
- Yes, he is.

167
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,866
He agreed to have dinner with us.

168

- Of course, he did.

We clung onto you, but you left
so cold-heartedly, Dr. Cha.

194

He wasn't being cold-hearted.

195
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,496
He left to partake in
that amazing research.

196

And the fruits of his labor
are so beautiful!

As this law pertains to life,

rather than "permitting..."

312
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,966
our focus should be on "limitation."

That "limitation" could obstruct
one's right to avoid pain.

Administering nutrients and drugs

Expanding the rights

Rather than drastic and
abrupt changes, our society

For terminal patients, the process
of concluding their lives

Your brainwave test

during your pain spells.

The anti-seizure medication
will subside the pain.
