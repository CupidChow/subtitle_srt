1
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:36,924
He feels pain because he's alive.

2
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:38,354
Pain states that he's alive.

3
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:41,284
A fighter without vision and
limbs is better off dead.

4
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:42,984
He can't live hooked up
to a machine.

5
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:47,484
There was nothing
you could do for him?

6
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:50,124
Aside from stopping his pain?

7
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:52,324
So you did that?

8
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:55,784
Did you stop his pain?

9
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:58,854
Can anyone of you be sure
that he's terminally ill

10
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:00,464
and can't be treated anymore?

11
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:03,004
No doctor should state
he did his duty after

12
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:05,074
murdering his patient.
There's no one like that.

13
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:06,244
There shouldn't be.

14
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:08,444
Whether it was illness, accidental...

15
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,764
of euthanasia.

16
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:13,634
Dr. Cha Yo Han!

17
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:15,094
Cha Yo Han!

18
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:16,394
Cha Yo Han!

19
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:18,754
Yoon Sung Gyu was willing
to fight until the end.

20
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,644
But he euthanized him.

21
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:22,244
That was...

22
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:24,594
clearly a murder.

23
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:26,494
Dr. Cha Yo Han.

24
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,204
What kind of...

25
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:30,344
doctor are you?

26
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:36,254
I came back thanks to you.

27
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,874
And I trusted you.

28
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:42,944
- But?
- But...

29
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:44,914
Yoon Sung Gyu...

30
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:46,864
If he really wanted to live...

31
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:48,644
- why did you...
- Do you want to know?

32
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:50,944
Yes.

33
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,424
What should I do?

34
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,904
I'm...

35
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:04,734
Joo Hyung Woo's doctor now,
not Yoon Sung Gyu's.

36
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:08,964
My patient is lying
there undiagnosed.

37
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:11,584
If you're confused about me...

38
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,684
stop focusing on me.

39
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,084
If I were you...

40
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:20,844
I'd focus on Joo Hyung Woo instead.

41
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:27,414
Doctor, we have a problem.

42
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,744
Joo Hyung Woo wants
to remove the respirator.

43
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:32,944
Remove the respirator?

44
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,284
Is he asking us to kill him?

45
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:37,124
He's not even conscious yet.

46
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,664
Who's asking to remove it?

47
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:41,564
His attorney requested
on his behalf.

48
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:43,904
He even has a recording
from the patient.

49
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:46,654
If in the case he
requires a respirator,

50
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:47,984
he wants to be discharged.

51
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:50,174
If the patient dies because of this,

52
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:52,974
won't the hospital be
responsible, Attorney Han?

53
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:56,924
Yes. Since the patient hasn't
been deemed terminally ill,

54
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:59,044
if he gets discharged and dies,

55
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:00,964
his family may file a lawsuit

56
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:03,764
and we could face murder charges.

57
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:05,104
But...

58
00:03:05,104 --> 00:03:07,694
since when did Joo Hyung Woo
fall under our department?

59
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:09,704
What do you mean since when?

60
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:12,614
After that Dr. Cha started
causing a ruckus.

61
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,634
Ophthalmology, Orthopedics,
and everywhere else!

62
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:17,734
Neither Ophthalmology nor
Orthopedics has diagnosed him.

63
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:20,074
Regardless of the
department in charge,

64
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:23,044
what's worse is that
he hasn't been diagnosed.

65
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,444
You have no diagnosis?

66
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:38,084
No. As of right now,
we can't make any guarantees

67
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,794
on his illness and recovery.

68
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:42,834
Please do whatever it takes.

69
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:45,904
No matter the cost or
how long it takes.

70
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:50,074
I cannot send my son off like this.

71
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,984
Father...

72
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:54,304
you're only concerned
about what you want?

73
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,394
If not...

74
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:57,714
yours is more important than mine?

75
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:59,994
You want to let him go.
That's of importance?

76
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,584
Not mine...

77
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:04,654
and not yours, either.

78
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:07,714
What about his?

79
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,694
Rather than what his family wants,

80
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:14,784
isn't his own will more important?

81
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:18,694
The Hyung Woo I know...

82
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:20,614
would want to live.

83
00:04:20,614 --> 00:04:22,534
Joo Hyung Woo is a champion.

84
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:25,764
He would never want
to live on like that.

85
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,874
You're the one who can't handle this.

86
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:31,314
I know that you're stressing his will
since you can't handle it.

87
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:35,034
He even left a DNR order
to make his will very clear.

88
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,034
Why else would he have prepared it?

89
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:40,234
I have never consented it.

90
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,944
Doctors.

91
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:46,874
I beg of you.

92
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:49,174
Please save my son.

93
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,634
No matter what it takes...

94
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:53,504
please save him.

95
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:54,994
I beg of you.

96
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:58,244
We feel the same way.

97
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,674
We can't discharge him like this.

98
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:02,844
Thank you, Director.

99
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,554
Then...

100
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,404
I'll put my faith in you all.

101
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:29,224
We know we can't make
concrete legal moves yet.

102
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:32,974
We'll get the family's consent
for any treatment procedures.

103
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:34,184
However,

104
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:37,564
please leave Dr. Cha Yo Han
out of this.

105
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:40,814
He tried to defy the
patient's will yesterday.

106
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:42,364
We're considering legal action.

107
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:44,544
Yesterday's incident
doesn't cross any legal lines.

108
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,334
If we'd abided by the patient,

109
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:48,774
we could've faced murder charges.

110
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:51,904
Yes. Attorney Han is correct, but...

111
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:55,564
we'll leave Dr. Cha Yo Han
out of the treatment.

112
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,284
Please don't worry.

113
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:13,134
Joo Hyung Woo will be examined.

114
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,584
But you're to stay out of this.

115
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,834
It's Chief's orders,
so don't mind this anymore.

How is he?

The lung CT states
symptoms of pneumonia.

His pneumonia had worsened,
causing respiratory arrest.

161
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:28,034
Can he be cured?

We don't have the
entire diagnosis yet.

Just the cause of respiratory arrest.

164
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:35,044
We'll administer antibiotics for now,

165
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:38,104

- Daddy!
- Honey!

168
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:49,384
Daddy...

169
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:50,784
Joo Hyung Woo, do you
know where you are?

170
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,774
Don't worry, Hyun Woo.

171
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:57,624
We didn't remove the respirator.

172
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:00,044
You had pneumonia symptoms,

173
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:02,474
but you can breathe for now.

174
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:04,664
Stay strong, okay?

175
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,664
Daddy.

176
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:43,054
Joo Hyung Woo has
an infection in his lungs.

177
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:45,994
- You came from the ICU?
- Yes.

178
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:48,254
You said you'd do nothing earlier.

179
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:50,404
His guardian consented
this examination.

180
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,504
It's not due to your orders...

181
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:06,754
I see the infection,
but not any dysthymia.

182
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:12,374
Pneumonia doesn't explain
the other symptoms.

183
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:14,444
Pneumonia?

184
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,374
Did they start the antibiotics?

185
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:17,514
Yes.

186
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:19,084
Which antibiotics?

187
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:20,264
Could it be...

188
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,034
[ Levofloxacin 250 mg bid ]

189
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:31,714
Levoflaxacin...

190
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:55,464
Here you go.

191
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,834
Yes, thank you.

192
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,134
What is it?

193
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,444
If he really has Myasthenia gravis,

194
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:20,954
he'll get worse when
administered with Levofloxacin.

195
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:24,744
You'll run a Tensilon test for
Myasthenia gravis, correct?

196
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,384
You've been studying. You nailed it.

197
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:29,334
If he has Myasthenia gravis,

198
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:31,454
then you're a remarkable doctor.

199
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:35,014
You diagnosed solely on his
symptoms, with no examinations.

200
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:36,784
However, on the flip side,

201
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:39,214
nothing's been confirmed.

202
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:41,114
There is no proof.

203
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:42,544
It's not necessary.

204
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:45,094
I ran the antibody test.

205
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:47,044
It was negative.

206
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:49,374
An antibody test isn't conclusive.

207
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:52,234
25% of the patients can test negative.

208
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:56,034
What if you're wrong, Doctor?

209
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:57,554
That medication...

210
00:12:57,554 --> 00:12:59,834
can endanger the patient.

211
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,124
You're saying...

212
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:05,134
let's experiment on the patient to see

213
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,714
if I'm right or wrong?

214
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:07,814
Honestly...

215
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,624
I'm not sure.

216
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,964
If your treatment is
meant for the patient,

217
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:16,704
or meant for yourself.

218
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:18,854
You saved Joo Hyung Woo yesterday

219
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:21,234
because you didn't want to let him go

220
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,924
or because you're not
done treating him.

221
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:27,054
Why did you save him?

222
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:28,784
Was it for the patient...

223
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:30,444
or was it for yourself?

224
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:31,874
Why do you ask?

225
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,824
For the patient or
because you want to know?

226
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,434
If it's for the patient,
we don't have time.

227
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:52,754
Dr. Kim.

228
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,554
Administer 500 mg
of Levofloxacin IV

229
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:56,864
twice a day, slowly in
one-hour duration.

230
00:13:56,864 --> 00:13:58,664
Joo Hyung Woo...

231
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:00,784
How many milliliters of
Levofloxacin were administered?

232
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:02,724
And who are you?

233
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:04,694
I suspect Myasthenia gravis.
[ Cha Yo Han ]

234
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:07,584
If I'm correct, Levofloxacin
will worsen his condition,

235
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:09,394
leading to respiratory
arrest or paralysis...

236
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:12,164
Excuse me. Aren't you from the
Anesthesiology Department?

237
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:13,764
Yes, correct.

238
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:16,294
The patient has been
administered antibiotics

239
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:18,224
and is stable without a respirator.

240
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,914
If you don't trust us,

241
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:22,984
make a request to Neurology Dept.
and conduct an exam.

242
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:24,834
If the antibiotics were administered,
no time for an exam.

243
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,524
- We must run a test.
- What's going on?

244
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:33,204
He's finding fault in my treatments.

245
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,214
I told him to request an examination...

246
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:37,464
Please, we have no time
for a discussion.

247
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:40,164
We must run a test and
stop the antibiotics...

248
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:41,194
Dr. Cha Yo Han.

249
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,514
Weren't you informed
to stay out of this?

250
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:47,194
Please leave.

251
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:48,884
Hyung Woo!

252
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:50,234
- Daddy!
- Hyung Woo!

253
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:52,034
- Honey!
- Hyung Woo!

254
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:53,024
What happened?

255
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,404
He can't move his hands.

256
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,184
Joo Hyung Woo, move your right leg.

257
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:09,224
His legs are paralyzed, too?

258
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:10,754
His pneumonia stabilized,

259
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,534
and his immune levels are up.

260
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:14,144
If he relapsed suddenly,

261
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:16,234
we must check for
other neuro disorders.

262
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,634
No, we don't have time.

263
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:20,014
Further delays will cause
another respiratory arrest.

264
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:22,794
If I'm right, we must
stop the antibiotics.

265
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,224
His blood pressure is unstable,
and vitals are weak.

266
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:29,464
If he has a cardiac arrest
with the Tensilon...

267
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:31,774
Joo Hyung Woo.

268
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:34,694
I want to test my diagnosis.
Do you consent?

269
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,914
I said I've seen...

270
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:49,214
many doctors like you.

271
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:52,584
The face that says...

272
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:55,484
you discovered something.

273
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:58,334
Are you...

274
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,164
any different?

275
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:07,254
Whether I am or not will
be deciphered by this.

276
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,884
I can be...

277
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:12,014
diagnosed with that?

278
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:15,874
Yes.

279
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,384
You can.

280
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:22,584
Let's do it.

281
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,304
- Honey!
- Hyung Woo!

282
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:28,334
- Daddy!
- Hyung Woo!

283
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:29,924
- Honey!
- Please stay back!

284
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:32,004
He may have heart failure,
so get the atropine ready.

285
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,374
Intubation, too.

286
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:35,654
- Get the atropine ready.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:13,944
His heart rate is falling.

288
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:16,224
Give me the atropine.

289
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,914
- Honey!
- Daddy!

290
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:37,014
Hyung Woo!

291
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,334
Yes, yes.

292
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,234
His oxygen levels are normal.

293
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:45,884
His heart rate is back, too.

294
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:06,284
Hyung Woo...

295
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:07,924
Doctor.

296
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:09,974
What just happened?

297
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:12,364
This shot is solely for diagnosis.

298
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:15,264
It temporary curbs the
Myasthenia gravis symptoms.

299
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:17,184
He must receive proper treatment.

300
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:19,814
Yes, yes, we understand.

301
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:22,434
Thank you so much, Doctor.

302
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:26,144
A diagnosis is important
for Myasthenia gravis,

303
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:29,404
but a long term Neurology
treatment is vital as well.

304
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:31,214
Please get treatments.

305
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,474
Dr. Cha.

306
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:42,244
Thank you.

307
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:45,294
For disregarding me yesterday...

308
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:47,194
and keeping me alive.

309
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:50,454
I didn't save you by
disregarding your words.

310
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:53,244
In fact, there were clues in them.

311
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:56,934
"A fighter who lost his
vision and limbs."

312
00:18:56,934 --> 00:19:00,194
What would cause an
MMA fighter to feel as if

313
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,894
he lost his vision and limbs?

314
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:06,724
I garnered all
circumstances and illnesses

315
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,434
which would cause those symptoms.

316
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:10,364
Then I found the answer.

317
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,194
Myasthenia gravis.

318
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,344
You found...

319
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:16,874
my illness with that?

320
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:19,884
You were suffering
enough to want death.

321
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:21,434
What could we do?

322
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:23,184
That's pain itself.

323
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,644
We have to find it.

324
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,554
No, I won't. I can't do it.

325
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,264
My apologies.

326
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,914
Why that patient but not me?

327
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:41,354
Why not me?

328
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:45,584
Must I be near death to
have my agony count?

329
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,424
If I'm suffering enough
to want death...

330
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:51,484
If I'm suffering enough
to want death...

331
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:54,694
If I'm suffering enough
to want death!

332
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:59,834
Isn't that a bigger agony itself?

333
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,634
Joo Hyung Woo,
I understand how you feel.

334
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,504
As an MMA fighter.

335
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,264
But what about your family?

336
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:08,874
What has your family done wrong?

337
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,484
Do you only think
about your own life?

338
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:14,034
Fighting till you drop is
the most important?

339
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:17,324
If you choose death, then
what about your family?

340
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:21,624
Speeding up death for relief and

341
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:23,834
speeding up death to
take a life is different!

342
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:24,934
I...

343
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,624
am not a doctor who
takes away lives.

344
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:41,324
Patient Joo Hyung Woo.

345
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,504
Process his diagnosis and
prescribe him proper meds.

346
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:46,494
Is that right?

347
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,854
So Joo Hyung Woo
has been diagnosed.

348
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:58,374
Yes.

349
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,454
See? I told you.

350
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,754
He's fearless and
makes no mistakes.

351
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,924
Are your thoughts clearer now?

352
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,604
Yes.

353
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:10,774
How?

354
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:14,684
He does whatever it takes...

355
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:18,094
to relieve people's pain.

356
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,894
He may save people at times,

357
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:24,594
but he may cause their deaths, too.

358
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:26,854
Yes.

359
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,454
But Dr. Lee...

360
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:34,864
you're completely
different than before.

361
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:35,934
Before?

362
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:37,774
At the other hospital.

363
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:40,474
Right.

364
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:43,724
Why am I Dr. Cha's
advocate all of a sudden?

365
00:21:45,124 --> 00:21:46,714
Because...

366
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:48,384
I need to make money.

367
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:49,774
And how do I do that?

368
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:52,964
I must work part-time jobs,
learn, and open up my clinic.

369
00:21:52,964 --> 00:21:53,704
That's true.

370
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:56,224
And that's when I met that man.

371
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:58,934
He's completely anti-social
and totally crazy.

372
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:00,974
But...

373
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:06,044
I think he'll teach me
invaluable things.

374
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:29,074
Kang Shi Young, you're it.

375
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:34,684
Ask Dr. Cha if we can
go home right now.

376
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,834
Is Dr. Cha...

377
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,034
- back?
- Yes, just now.

378
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:42,644
Kang Shi Young.

379
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:44,374
Kang Shi Young.

380
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:45,534
Kang Shi Young.

381
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:46,534
- Sunbaenim.
- Kang Shi Young.

382
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:47,654
- You can do it.
- Kang Shi Young.

383
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:48,834
- Show us.
- Kang Shi Young.

384
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,654
Show us the second-year power.

385
00:22:50,654 --> 00:22:52,324
You can do it.

386
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:53,994
You can do this.

387
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:21,914
Dr. Cha.

388
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,124
Dr. Cha...

389
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,394
[ Myasthenia gravis ]

390
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:51,564
What's this?

391
00:24:51,564 --> 00:24:52,884
I...

392
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:55,754
Everyone...

393
00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:59,504
I came to ask if we can call it a day.

394
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:04,584
Is it that time already?

395
00:25:11,854 --> 00:25:14,144
What are you waiting for?

396
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:15,974
Go on home.

397
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,904
I'm organizing the charts. It's okay.

398
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:20,774
Goodnight.

399
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:21,924
Work hard.

400
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:01,564
Are you feeling better?

401
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:04,844
I'll be diligent about my treatments.

402
00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:06,664
What about Dr. Cha?

403
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:08,874
He just went home.

404
00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:10,884
I'll have to greet him tomorrow.

405
00:26:10,884 --> 00:26:12,434
Your recovery comes first.

406
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,294
Please get well soon.

407
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:17,264
Doctor.

408
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:20,364
I'll go get the kids.

409
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:26,914
Thank you.

410
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:29,114
For chasing me...

411
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:30,374
and harassing me.

412
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:33,004
Don't mention it. It's my job.

413
00:26:33,004 --> 00:26:34,914
If you hadn't chased me that time,

414
00:26:34,914 --> 00:26:36,704
I would've been discharged,

415
00:26:36,704 --> 00:26:40,214
then carried back here on a respirator
after collapsing somewhere.

416
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:44,394
- Dad!
- Daddy!

417
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:48,814
Let's go to Daddy.

418
00:26:54,644 --> 00:26:57,014
My daughter is only five years old,

419
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,564
but she saw me faint
after taking medication.

420
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:06,974
Daddy.

421
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:08,854
Daddy!

422
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:10,914
Daddy, wake up.

423
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:13,844
- Mommy!
- Yes?

424
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:20,234
Honey, Honey!

425
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:24,534
My wife saved me then.

426
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,144
But I cursed and resented her.

427
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:30,434
I made her write a memorandum.

428
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:32,204
A memorandum?

429
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:36,734
That the next time I collapse...

430
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:39,674
she'll promise to do as I want.

431
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,634
I was stupid...

432
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:44,694
and selfish.

433
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:49,054
Doctor.

434
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:51,644
I thought doctors
only save patients,

435
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:52,914
but I was wrong.

436
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:55,654
You all saved my family.

437
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:58,814
Thank you.

438
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,444
- Daddy!
- Dad!

439
00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:07,604
Aigoo, my babies.

440
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,134
- You're doing good?
- Yes.

441
00:28:11,204 --> 00:28:13,274
- Shall we say bye now?
- Okay.

442
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:16,434
- Goodnight.
- Goodbye.

443
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:17,314
Thank you.

444
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:19,984
- Let's go.
- Dad, let's go.

445
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:22,774
Thank you.

446
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:25,044
Dad, let's hurry.

447
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:26,934
Okay, coming.

448
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:28,364
Nice!
