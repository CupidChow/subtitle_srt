1
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,140
It's his ears.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,390
He lost his hearing because of this.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,260
Suppurative otitis media due
to a generalized infection.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,020
As the infection is already underway,

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,370
a definite diagnosis
and treatment is crucial.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,600
We can't run a diagnostic test here.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,360
We must hurry before it
develops into sepsis.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,600
We don't have much time.

9
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,490
We have another suspected
Nipah virus patient reported.

10
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,480
The patient is a 68-year old man,

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,350
and the hospital is running
the diagnostic test.

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,480
The KCDC stated the results
will be out by midnight,

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,120
with many eyes watching.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,960
Yes.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,500
Are the results out?

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,330
- Honey!
- Are you okay?

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,600
My baby!

18
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,620
Father.

19
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,230
Yes, it's Kang Mi Rae.

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,940
After the examination and
treatment, you'll get well.

21
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,090
- Please take good care of him.
- Yes, we will.

22
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,540
Let's go.

23
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,990
Good job, everyone.

24
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,570
Thanks for your cooperation.

25
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,610
Great job, Dr. Cha.

26
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,360
You did great.

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,760
Dr. Kang Mi Rae.

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,150
You played the biggest role today.

29
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,220
My role was...

30
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,750
merely an acquaintance
to the priest.

31
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,120
At times, rather than us who observe
the patient through equipment,

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,580
a friend who observes a patient's life...

33
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,400
is a better doctor.

34
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,640
But...

35
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,150
do you think Sunbae will be okay?

most importantly,
your phantom limb pain...

I'll take responsibility and
do my best to cure it.

42
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,160
Can it be cured?

Yes.

52
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,130
As if I'm clenching my fist.

53
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,190
We'll try unclenching that fist now.

54
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,800
First,

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,080
clench your left hand into a fist.

56
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,640
Look in the mirror then
unclench your fist.

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,990
I opened the hand that isn't there.

62
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,440
Now, fold your fingers one by one.

63
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,710
Yes.

64
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,000
Good job.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,200
- Melioidosis?
- Yes.

66
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,000
Further delays would've
resulted in sepsis,

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,010
and might have resulted in death.

68
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,350
If Dr. Cha hadn't gone in...

69
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,890
what would've happened?

70
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,080
- Director?
- So...

71
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,390
Dr. Cha diagnosed solely on
observation without equipment...

72
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,800
Is that it?

73
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,410
Yes.

74
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,300
Pardon?

75
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,140
Right now?

76
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,170
I understand.

77
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,450
We have reporters at the
Dept. of Pain Medicine.

They're inquiring what was diagnosed
since it wasn't the Nipah virus.

79

Prepare the briefing again
and call Dr. Cha.

80

Pardon?

81
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,060
A doctor entered a quarantined
center risking his life.

82
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,670
He discovered bacteria which
was dormant for over 40 years.

83
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,600
How can we pass up such an
amazing and rare medical story?

Geez...

doing volunteer work?

141
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,530
From my med school days.

142

A female warrior.

149
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,120
She's charismatic and capable.

150
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,240
Plus, she's a humanitarian. Wow...

151
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,340
You're teasing me, right?

152
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,870
Teasing you?

153
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,140
No one really likes the Chief.

154
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,660
But why? I thought she's
a very rare and special lady.

155
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,150
- Really?
- Yes, really.

156

How?

157
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,670
Like you, Dr. Cha.

158
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,060
You don't understand pain...

159

but you understand
a patient's suffering.

160
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,840
I'll be like that, too.

161
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,110
As you do, I'll...

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,450
study and analyze like crazy.

170
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,880
I put my imagination into overdrive...

171
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,550
and picture everything.

172
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,330
You'll do the same.

173
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,050
But...

174
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,980
there's a difference...

175
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,770
between knowing and understanding.

176
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,880
I monitor myself on CCTV,

177
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
and check my body
with these things.

178
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,300
The pain of having to repeat
this every single day...

179
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,610
You can't understand it.

180
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,580
Why attempt such a hard feat?

181
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,400
It's impossible, so why?

182
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,030
You can't, anyway.

183
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,970
Don't do that.

184
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,260
You'll only exhaust yourself.

185
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,390
I'll get going.

186
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,810
See you tomorrow.

187
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,630
Dr. Cha has recently

188
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,330
made headlines by diagnosing
Joo Hyung Woo's Myasthenia gravis.

189
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,920
And for the first time in history,

190
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,550
he diagnosed a CIPA
patient's central sensitization.

191
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,990
And today,

192
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,870
against everyone's dissuasion,
[ A doctor sentenced three years for murder ]

193
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,410
he entered...

194
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,460
a quarantined area
without any equipment,

195
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,470
and diagnosed the
melioidosis which was

196
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,790
dormant for 44 years.

197
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,830
Can you please explain
what melioidosis is?

198
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,230
We're curious as to how
it's contracted and treated.

199
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,450
We've asked Dr. Cha Yo Han to join us.

200
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,290
He'll inform you of the details.

201
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,650
He can't make it? Why not?

202
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,710
- He went to the ICU.
- But why?

203
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,420
To see a patient.
The melioidosis patient.

204
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,370
Right now?

205
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,900
Is he out of his mind?
Where are his priorities?

206
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,460
Hurry up and bring him!

207
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,170
Dr. Cha needs a little more time.

208
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,050
Please give us a minute.

209
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,070
Yes, go ahead.

210
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,390
Is Dr. Cha Yo Han...

the anesthesiologist who was
sentenced for euthanizing a patient

212
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
three years ago?

213
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,690
I thought it was someone
with the same name,

214
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,120
but the specialties are the same.

215
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,220
I'm curious if he's the one.

216
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,590
Dr. Cha.

217
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,990
How are you feeling?

218
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,890
It's quiet now.

219
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,350
My head which used to
pound all day long...

220
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,320
is quiet as well.

221
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,640
My heart was troubled
for over 40 years...

222
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,020
but it's at peace now.

223
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,950
You did well.

224
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,260
You'll be well now.

225
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,290
God...

226
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,220
has indeed given all of us life.

227
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,640
And he also punishes us as well.

228
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,540
But...

229
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,700
you are right, Dr. Cha.

230
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,220
He doesn't cast us in suffering...

231
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,720
and look the other way.

232
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,110
Yes.

233
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,140
He is that Dr. Cha Yo Han.

234
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,210
From that incident three years ago.

235
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,840
Wasn't his license revoked?

236
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,180
Was he penalized?

237
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,730
Did you grant him special favors?

238
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,670
How was he hired
at the Hansae Hospital?

239
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,300
There weren't any issues
with Dr. Cha's appointment.

240
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,720
Hansae Hospital appointed him
based on his superior skills.

241
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,680
We had no prejudices or any bias...

242
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,100
I guess Cha Yo Han is not coming.

243

- Everyone, say hello first.
- Yes, hello.

- Nice to meet you.
- Good seeing you.

245

Sir, this is the friend I mentioned.

Oh, I see. Yes, yes.

I'm a mom of two children.

260
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,140
It spread to my bones,

261
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,840
and it's unlikely I'll recover.

262
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,810
I lost my hair after
36 rounds of chemo.

263
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,820
So I'm wearing a wig.

that it's spread to my liver.

Welcome.

One of our guests made

Hello.

a tumor called olfactory
neuroblastoma.

285

It's malignant, and
I'm a terminal patient.

Two months...

287

or...

288
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,220
in a month, I'll be gone.

289
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,940
I heard that...

290
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,380
we're to talk about death here...

291
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,790
to overcome our fear.

292
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,980
But honestly...

293
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,060
I'm not afraid of dying.

294
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,300
Then...

295
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,090
is there anything else that
we may assist you with?

296
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,740
I heard one of your attendees...

297
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,100
went to Switzerland not too long ago.

298
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,720
And he underwent
an assisted suicide over there.

299
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,580
I wanted to hear about him.

300
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,930
That's why I'm here today...

301

Just a moment.

302
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,750
That's a sensitive topic.

Yes.

to him, Prosecutor.

human saved him.

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,220
"I could demand a death penalty,

337
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,750
or stab him with my
own hands, but I didn't...

338
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,450
because murder is wrong...

339
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,180
and there can't be any exceptions."

340
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,320
That remains the same.

341
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,010
I'm doing this because
it's the right thing...

342
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,800
not because of personal grudges.

343
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,030
You're a parent first
then a prosecutor.

344
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,760
Principles come first to
a criminal who killed children,

345
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,880
and you have no personal grudge...

346
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,150
against Cha Yo Han
who gave him a mercy killing?

347
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,430
Stabbing Yoon Sung Gyu and
revoking Cha Yo Han's license

348
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,360
won't change the world.

349
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,400
The law that stops them...

350
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,680
The law that punishes them...

351
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,650
Only the law changes the world.

352
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,830
Cha Yo Han...

353
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,140
will put a stop to himself.

354
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,060
We just need to wait.

355
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,690
When Cha Yo Han meets a patient...

356
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,900
facing only death and pain.

357
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,550
I'll...

358
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,410
try to understand you.

359
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,960
You don't understand pain...

360
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
but you understand
a patient's suffering.

361
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,710
As you do, I'll...

362
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,480
try to understand you.

363
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,850
You'll do the same.

364
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,480
You'll study and analyze my illness.

365
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,950
But...

366
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,910
there's a difference...

367
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,740
between knowing
and understanding.

368
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,860
Mommy!

369
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,630
Honey, are you okay?

370
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,010
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts a lot...

371
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,990
What's wrong?

372
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,180
Mom, what's the matter?

373
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,570
What's wrong? Are you
uncomfortable, Mom?

374
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,230
- I'm okay.
- Should I call the nurse?

375
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,660
You can't understand it.

376
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,850
Why attempt such a hard feat?

377
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,900
It's impossible, so why?

378
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,690
You can't, anyway.

379
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,820
Even a parent can't suffer
in their children's place,

380
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,830
and a husband can't suffer
on his wife's behalf.

381
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,110
A child can't take his
parents' suffering, either.

382
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,450
Even if he fervently prays
for that to be.

383
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,560
You're not the only one, Dr. Cha.

384
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,410
No human being can feel
another's pain as their own.

385
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,350
We can only try to understand it.

386
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,190
To understand someone's pain...

387
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,930
is to understand that person.

388
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,550
I'm not trying to understand
your illness, Dr. Cha.

389
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,580
I'm trying to understand

390
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,250
this Cha Yo Han...

391
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,570
who has suffered from it.

392
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,870
♫ You warm my heart ♫

393
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,240
♫ We must never try to stop ♫

394
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,440
♫ We must never try to stop ♫

395
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:15,530
♫ I can't erase you from
deep inside my heart ♫

396
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,810
Dr. Cha.

397
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,440
♫ So many questions are
floating in my mind ♫

398
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,990
♫ I lost my way today as well ♫

399
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,150
♫ Your eyes that show so much pain ♫

400
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,710
♫ I'm drawn ever slowly to you ♫

401
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,800
♫ I'm sure everything will get better ♫

402
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,150
Don't worry too much.

403
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,300
- Bye.
- See you.

404
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,070
♫ The more I get to know you ♫

405
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,210
♫ The more I can't get you
out of my mind ♫

406
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,400
We all need someone.

407
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,040
Even if someone can't suffer for me...

408
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,990
at least someone who understands

409
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,920
and share my burden.

410
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,600
Dr. Cha, you were that
person to your patients.

411
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,930
However, you...

412
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,030
have endured it alone.

413
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,130
So?

414
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,220
Do you feel sorry for me?

415
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,420
- No.
- Then...

416
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,520
since you're overly empathetic
with your patients,

417
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,540
do you feel responsible as a doctor?

418
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,650
Because you know
of a patient's illness?

419
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,170
No.

420
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,020
Then why?

421
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,430
If it's not sympathy...

422
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,230
nor a sense of
responsibility, then why?

423
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,800
I have feelings for you.

424
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,710
I have...

425
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,500
feelings for you, Dr. Cha.

426
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,340
Let's go.

427
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,650
Oh, Dr. Cha.

428
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,150
Everyone,

429
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,980
this is Dr. Cha Yo Han from
Dept. of Pain Medicine.

430
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:29,110
♫ Sometimes I try to
find a way to go back ♫

431
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,260
♫ Cuz it's unforgettable time  ♫

432
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,400
♫ It's all still in my mind ♫

433
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,450
♫ Closer, a little bit closer  ♫

434
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,140
[ Doctor John ]

435
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,380
For the time being,
I'll keep an eye on both

436
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,040
- Cha Yo Han and Kang Shi Young.
- Okay.

437
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,960
Why aren't you saying anything?

438
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,630
Regarding yesterday.

439
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,060
Is it time now?

440
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,660
We'll discuss the
CEO's life prolongation.

441
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,050
You're working late, Dr. Cha.

442
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,540
♫ A way to go back ♫

443
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,370
♫ Cuz it's beautiful time ♫

444
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,890
♫ Just a little bit of breeze
colored my life  ♫
