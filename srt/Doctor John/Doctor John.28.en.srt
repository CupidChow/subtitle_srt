Ma'am, you signed the
consent form, correct?

332
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:31,234
Yes.

333
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:32,914
We'll operate on Ki Seok right now.

334
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,644
- What are you doing? Move him now.
- Dr. Cha.

335
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:39,614
As you know,
the placement is bad.

336
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,354
You must rationally think over

337
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,434
how dangerous this is
for Ki Seok, and

338
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:45,734
- what his chances of recovery are.
- Dangerous?

339
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,754
If we don't, he'll die.
What can be worse?

340
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:51,494
Switch to an Ambu.

341
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:58,914
What are you doing?

342
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:01,504
His brain pressure is rising rapidly
and causing neuro damage.

343
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:03,174
We must operate
before he's brain dead.

344
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:04,324
I saw his chart.

345
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,694
You know his chances of
recovery are low regardless.

346
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:09,154
If we don't, his chances of
recovery won't be low.

347
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:10,454
He won't be recovering at all.

348
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,694
But this is "recovery" won't
restore him to his old self.

349
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:14,734
Worst case scenario,

350
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,294
he may spend the rest
of his life in that state.

351
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,634
Is the Ambu ready?

352
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,434
- Move aside.
- Dr. Cha.

353
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:24,334
I said move. If we don't,
this patient will die!

even more pain!

Are you really doing
this for the patient?

356
00:22:41,814 --> 00:22:43,264
As a doctor,

357
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:46,044
is this in accordance with
the decisions you've made

358
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:47,594
thus far?

359
