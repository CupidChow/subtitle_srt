00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,540
"The ultimate goal of medicine
is to make people happy.

161
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,770
Simply eradicating pain or
prolonging life through medicine...

Do you agree?

00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,650
Dr. Cha, what are your thoughts

165
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,040
on what a doctor's role is?

166
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,390
Medicine has advanced a lot

and will continue to advance.

Even if one is not alive,

169
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,260
perhaps we can still
keep them alive.

170
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,450
The line between life and
death will get even thinner.

171
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:13,170
More than ever, one needs to make
the right decisions regarding life.

172
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,590
Deciphering what is most
beneficial for a patient...

173
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,340
I believe that's a doctor's role.

174
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,780
"The right decisions regarding life?"

175
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,930
- Is euthanasia a part of it?
- Of course, it is.

176
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,640
Are you saying that death
can be beneficial to life?

177
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,560
At times, a decision to die can be

178
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,920
beneficial to life in this day and age.

179
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,080
As you said, the line between life and
death is blurry in this day and age.

180
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,590
If someone is given the right
to make those decisions,

181
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,510
that right will lead to power,

182
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,300
and that power will be...

183
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,910
corrupt...

184
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,450
and will be abused.

185
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,230
People's lives will be on
the palm of their hands.

186
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,860
And after one

187
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,360
life gets...

188
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,690
sacrificed and dies...

189
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,630
They can never come back.

190
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,620
The right decisions regarding life

191
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,730
isn't always about death.

192
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,210
However,

193
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:19,380
what is the most beneficial for
a patient between life and death...

194
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,440
I must give it my all till the end

195
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,080
to think over and make
the right decisions.

196
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,310
Whether that decision
is right or wrong

197
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,840
should be judged within
the confines of the law.

198
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,140
No law can satisfy everyone.

199
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,930
As no medical treatment
can satisfy everyone.

200
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,400
The law and medicine.

201
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,030
I think they must go with
the times and seek

202
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,020
what's of the most value.

203
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,490
- Prosecutor?
- Yes.

204
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,270
As mentioned earlier, this is
regarding resident Kang Shi Young.

205
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,030
This is her statement
regarding Dr. Cha.

206
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,970
She spoke of her father.

207
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,460
Okay, good work.

208
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,860
Oh, and... That notebook.

209
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,430
Here.

210
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,420
Could you perhaps look
into what this means?

211
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,430
Yes, will do.

212
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,240
- Okay, thank you.
- Sure.

213
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,760
He should've just told
us from the get-go.

214
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,340
Why make things worse?

215
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
On top of that...

216
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,710
We're facing the Chairman
issue. It's a sensitive time.

217
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,380
Something like this shouldn't
happen in our hospital...

218
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,750
Let's hold a disciplinary committee.

219
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,210
A hospital has its own
order and regulations.

220
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,180
Dr. Cha's actions today

221
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,610
was not appropriate as a doctor
and the residents' professor

222
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,530
and caused controversy.

223
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,370
After holding a
disciplinary committee,

224
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,180
you'll have him take
a leave of absence, right?

225
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,470
Yes.

226
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,460
Due to the timing...

227
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,620
I think that's the best.

228
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,690
That kid...

229
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,050
He won't be punished, right?

230
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,520
He's only eight years old.

231
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,780
I don't think he'll be punished.

232
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,480
I'm sure they'll consider
extenuating circumstances.

233
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,670
This was possible because
he's eight years old.

234
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,840
He wouldn't know there are penalties
for shutting off a ventilator.

235
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,300
Thank you, doctors.

236
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,270
For not giving up on my sister.

237
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,310
Well, Dr. Cha is the one
who didn't give up.

238
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,960
- He's not here right now.
- Yes.

239
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,340
I'll pay my respects separately.

240
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,520
We heard Yu Ri Hye
regained consciousness.

241
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,640
How is she?

242
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,610
My sister told me

243
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,950
that as soon as she's better,
she wants to transfer to a hospice.

244
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,510
She'll finish out her days there.
