1
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello?

2
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,160
Here.

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,500
Congrats on your comeback.

4
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,410
How is it?

5
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,240
Did you save many patients?

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,430
Mom scolded me.

7
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,450
Scolded? But why?

8
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,910
It's understandable. You know me.

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,520
Aigoo, your mom. She's so
cold sometimes.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,170
But doctors should be like that.

11
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,740
If you're a schmuck like me,
it'll be trouble.

12
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,480
You're not a schmuck!

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,880
You're just very caring.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,150
Wait. Uncle, did you know?

15
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,250
About what?

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,720
6238 coming to our hospital.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,180
He did?

18
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,360
- You didn't know?
- I didn't.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,270
Warden, don't you care at all?

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,650
Shouldn't you observe to see if
he's adjusting to the society?

21
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,520
Observing is too much.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,220
I can just buy him dinner
and drinks, you know.

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,510
Yup, he's here.

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,500
You said you didn't know.
When did you call him?

25
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,730
I didn't know.

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,100
But when I invited him to dinner,
he said this hospital.

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,160
Geez, you told me not to make
eye contact or talk to him.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,110
That was then, this is now.

29
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,300
What the heck, I'm leaving.

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,720
Hey, Shi Young!

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,840
Hey!

32
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
Hello, Dr. Cha.

33
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,680
This way.

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,280
Aigoo, Dr. Cha.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,100
Welcome. Have a seat.

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,760
Whoa, you're using honorifics.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,180
Are you drunk already?

38
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,370
Drunk, my foot. I'll get
drunk starting now.

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,920
Shi Young, you sit, too.

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,400
Shi Young, be respectful to Dr. Cha.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,420
No monkeying around like before.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,800
Monkeying around? Who, me?

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,110
You said, "He's terrible!

44
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,960
Who does he think he is?" and such.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,850
Uncle!

46
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,860
What on earth?

47
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,550
What about a doctor?
Did you get a new one?

48
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,030
Aigoo, of course.

49
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,330
I'm so happy to be rid of you finally.

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,200
Next time, I'll put in
some part-time hours.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,400
Forget it, don't come.
Don't even think about it.

52
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,640
If you hate me so much,
why call me out?

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
I mean...

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,590
it's fascinating.

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,070
Who knew you'd meet again
as a teacher and a student?

56
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,560
You two first met through me,

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,610
and you're continuing
your relationship.

58
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,730
It's so nice to see, no?

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,020
You want me to be nice, huh?

60
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,220
You're a quick one.

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,500
Shi Young, be respectful
to Professor Cha.

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,590
- Got it?
- How many times must you say it?

63
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,870
Are you drunk already?

64
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,580
How many times must I say it?

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,200
I'll get drunk starting right now.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,600
Here you go.

67
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,410
Shi Young, you too.

68
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,750
All right.

69
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,500
Congrats to both of your comebacks!

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,020
Cheers!

71
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,920
Cucumber kimchi,

72
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,220
young radish kimchi,

73
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,880
plus green onion kimchi.

74
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,970
And this is rice.

75
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,150
Why should I take home rice?

76
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,040
I don't have time to cook at home.

77
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,700
If you don't have time to cook at
home, then do it at the hospital.

78
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,100
- Food equals energy.
- How can I cook at the hospital?

79
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,180
Just take it. While I'm being nice.

80
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,940
- Do you want more rice?
- I'm full, I'm full.

81
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,540
My son.

82
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,210
How's the hospital? Is it all right?

83
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,590
I'm just happy you're nearby now.

84
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,670
I'm learning, you know.

85
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,520
How are your soles?

86
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,480
They're better.

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,460
- Your back?
- It's better.

88
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,010
- Your sugar level?
- It's better...

89
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,800
It's normal.

90
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,880
- You're telling the truth, right?
- Of course, I am.

91
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,790
I wouldn't lie in front of a doctor.

92
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,940
Please don't overdo it.

93
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,050
- You can't get sick anymore, Mom.
- I know.

94
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,370
Geez, you're nagging.

95
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,670
Why did you even make these?

96
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm not taking them.
I won't take them!

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,630
Aigoo, kiddo...

98
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,170
Food equals energy.
Are you getting your meals?

99
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,240
Eat up.

100
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,330
You can't give it like that.

101
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,200
Dr. Lee Yoo Joon?

102
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,600
You live in the staff apartment?

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,770
Yes, I do.

104
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,450
You're simpler than you appear.

105
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,990
Must a chief's daughter
live somewhere else?

106
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,040
I wasn't picking a fight.

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,880
But I am.

108
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,500
You can't give it like this.

109
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,230
The cats may hurt their
tongue on the sharp edges.

110
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,020
Wow.

111
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,680
He's eating it up.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,830
I hear you and
Kang Shi Young are sisters.

113
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,310
Yes.

114
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,320
I saw you two say hi in the
conference room yesterday.

115
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,670
How do you know each other?

116
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,090
When Dr. Kang was
working in prison,

117
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,110
I was at the nearby hospital.

118
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,980
She came in with a patient.

119
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,180
It's fascinating.

120
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,030
The three of us from
prison meet again.

121
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,390
Three of you?

122
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,620
Dr. Cha Yo Han.

123
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,280
He was there, too.

124
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,590
That was the prison
Kang Shi Young was at?

125
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,220
So she knew Dr. Cha from then?

126
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,260
Yes.

127
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,630
You didn't know?

128
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,010
I guess you're not close. For sisters.

129
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,400
You heard about my family
from Heo Joon sunbae, huh?

130
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,500
- Yes.
- Then ask him about this.

131
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,200
Why we're not that close.

132
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,010
They're similar.

133
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,000
- Yes, Driver.
- Watch your step!

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,480
We're heading out, give us a minute.

135
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,310
That girl...

136
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,140
Even though she's not my blood,

137
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,830
she's my niece.

138
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,270
She's my best friend's daughter.

139
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,310
Dr. Cha.

140
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,130
Please take...

141
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,420
good care of my Shi Young.

142
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,450
What did you say?

143
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,180
Why stare at me like that?

144
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,200
I'm wondering why
you're being like this.

145
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,440
I have enough worries on my own.

146
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,580
Let's go.

147
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,100
Aigoo, I know, but...

148
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,410
I'm pretty desperate here.

149
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,090
She never lets anything on,

150
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,510
- but that Shi Young...
- The taxi is here.

151
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,160
- Hey, Dr. Cha, don't be like this...
- Uncle!

152
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,670
Be of guidance for my Shi Young.

153
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,170
She's doing fine.

154
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,490
She is?

155
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,700
Doing fine?

156
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,320
Your niece is doing fine.

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,630
Uncle, get in.

158
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,250
- You're doing fine.
- Huh?

159
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,470
Dr. Cha said you're doing fine!

160
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,400
Huh, Shi Young! He complimented...

161
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,930
Yes, Shi Young!

162
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,720
Go on home.

163
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,180
What?

164
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,550
How are you doing fine?

165
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,660
You don't take directions.

166
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,710
You used to be burdened
with taking directions,

167
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,110
but not now.

168
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,680
You even do things before I say it,

169
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,040
and when I ask, you even object to it.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,090
Get going. See you tomorrow.

171
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,680
My patient...

172
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,860
is not dead yet.

173
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,070
He's in our hospital.

174
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,400
For over a year...

175
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,470
in a vegetative state.

176
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,450
My patient whose heart...

177
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,520
I stopped with my hands.

178
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,590
I went...

179
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,750
to his room for the first time.

180
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,450
Don't you have any regrets?

181
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,820
After that day...

182
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,520
that moment.

183
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,890
Haven't you ever regretted...

184
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,180
during those three years?

185
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,030
To reduce the patient's agony,

186
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,520
and if death is...

187
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,460
the only way to resolve it...

188
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,760
could you kill the patient?

189
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,170
I...

190
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,540
was that patient's pain specialist.

191
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,920
What I did was...

192
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,140
administer painkillers to
induce unconsciousness,

193
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,110
so he won't feel any pain.

194
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,510
Then reduce the medication to
keep him breathing

195
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,990
and inflict pain again.

196
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,190
Even though his body was rotting
away, he was fed nutrients.

197
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,160
He had no choice but to

198
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,080
wait for his heart to stop beating.

199
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,060
If I stopped the nutrients,
it'd be murder.

200
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,630
If I overdosed the painkillers,
it'd still be murder.

201
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,290
I was afraid of being a murderer...

202
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,890
so I kept him alive for over two
months and inflicted pain.

203
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,740
Under the guise of pain control.

204
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,100
I hated myself for using it as
an excuse since he was

205
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,880
he was a kidnapper
who murdered two kids.

206
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,830
Doctor...

207
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,010
Yo Han...

208
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,480
Please...

209
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,980
I...

210
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,170
Please...

211
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,390
During those two months,
he never pleaded for his life.

212
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,570
He didn't plead for death, either.

213
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,330
Then why...

214
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,240
You asked if a doctor can
resolve one's pain...

215
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,420
would he be able to kill him?

216
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,060
- Yes.
- That's a wrong question.

217
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,620
It's not killing to resolve the pain...

218
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,440
nor killing to avoid the pain.

219
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,190
Then what is it?

220
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,340
Resolving the pain.

221
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,480
Even if he dies in the process...

222
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,220
That's all.

223
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,590
My patient...

224
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,880
asked to end his pain.

225
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,710
Even if he died in the process.

226
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,480
The law says it's murder to end
a patient's life intentionally.

227
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,700
However, a doctor
neglecting a patient's pain...

228
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,510
or denying his request to
end the suffering...

229
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,870
That's true malpractice.

230
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,750
What I did to Yoon Sung Gyu
for two months

231
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,140
was not treatment, but torture.

232
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,070
Do I have regrets?

233
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,450
No.

234
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,520
But...

235
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,990
I was afraid.

236
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,410
You were afraid?

237
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,580
Yes.

238
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,060
Very much.

239
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,620
I was...

240
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,990
also afraid.

241
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,900
I was so scared that

242
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,970
I could not...

243
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,140
affirm in my convictions...

244
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,150
or say that I have no regrets.

245
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,100
I couldn't dream of it.

246
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,420
Back then and even now.

247
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,990
I'm so afraid.

248
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,010
That a patient's...

249
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,930
life is in my hands.

250
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,070
That's a given.

251
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,560
A patient needs a doctor
who's afraid of himself...

252
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,390
rather than one who isn't.

253
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,980
You're doing fine, Kang Shi Young.

254
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,550
I need a walk.

255
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,150
See you tomorrow.

256
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,250
The sky is so clear.

257
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,660
Or are my eyes clear now?

258
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,220
I heard you've gotten much better.

259
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,800
What a relief.

260
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,820
You're right.

261
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,400
You're not a doctor
who takes away lives...

262
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,140
or one who extends lives.

263
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,910
You help patients live their lives.

264
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,550
Thank you.

265
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,830
I just felt like it.

266
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,100
An uppercut should be
from below and straight up!

267
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,300
Put your weight on it.

268
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,770
You think I was always a stickler?

269
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,200
I've had days...

270
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,900
I wanted to cure the people,
not their illnesses.

271
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,350
But I still don't know
if that's the best way.

272
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,310
We're scientists seeking
answers to diseases...

273
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,650
but people are live beings.

274
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,050
Yes.

275
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,650
Yes, hello?

276
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,070
What happened?

277
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,440
Hello.

278
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,690
Hello.

279
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,390
If it's Code Blue in that state...

280
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,160
aren't the chances nil?

281
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,690
Hello.

282
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,480
Where are Kang Shi Young
and Kang Mi Rae?

283
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,640
What is it?

284
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,060
Cardiac arrest!

285
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,500
Dad! Dad...

286
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,340
Dad...

287
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,580
Dad, no...

288
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,500
Defibrillator.

289
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,730
Defibrillator!

290
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,640
Charge 209 bolts.

291
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,900
It's ready.

292
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,130
Everyone, move aside.

293
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,420
Charge!

294
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,610
Epinephrine.

295
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,720
Epinephrine!

296
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,520
Administering CPR.

297
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,920
Dad...

298
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,710
Mi Rae, where is Shi Young?

299
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,630
Kang Shi Young...

300
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,250
Please pick up the phone.

301
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,230
Father?

302
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,780
Yes.

303
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,190
It was a huge accident.

304
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,470
Kang Shi Young left the
hospital after that.

305
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,100
My patient...

306
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,510
is not dead yet.

307
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,870
He's in our hospital.

308
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,680
For over a year...

309
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,840
in a vegetative state.

310
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,840
Yes, Dr. Min.

311
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,330
Shi Young?

312
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,290
She's not here.

313
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,190
She's not in the ward?

314
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,770
Yes, we'll look for her.

315
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,980
She's not there?

316
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,030
No. She's not picking up, either.

317
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,930
The situation sounds serious.

318
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,590
How can this be?

319
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,500
Everyone, keep calling her.

320
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,990
Yes, Dr. Cha.

321
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,030
Kang Shi Young.

322
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,770
Kang Shi Young.

323
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,300
Get up.

324
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,610
How many times should I say it?

325
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,570
Every patient has timing.

326
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,920
If you miss it...

327
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,700
then it's too late.

328
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,740
At the timing, the doctor...

329
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,360
must always be ready to run.

330
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,170
That moment is here.

331
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,200
He's not a patient, but my father.

332
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,150
I'm not a doctor, but a daughter.

333
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,430
You're a daughter who's a doctor.

334
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,440
Your father needs both right now.

335
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,630
It hurts...

336
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,600
It hurts...

337
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,500
too much.

338
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,280
Please stop.

339
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,210
Dad is in a lot of pain.

340
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,260
[ Doctor John ]

341
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,310
♫ There was time to play ♫

342
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,450
♫ Yesterday ♫

343
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,610
♫ But the light in your eyes ♫

344
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,510
We will not turn away
from a patient's pain.

345
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,160
Your extreme empathy
with patients...

346
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,000
Don't you know how toxic that is?

347
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,260
Dr. Lee Yoo Joon.

348
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,880
You won't send me away?

349
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,120
I won't.

350
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,390
You're our patient.

351
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,470
The death-with-dignity, related to
Dr. Cha's resident.

352
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,910
Prosecutor Son Seok Ki
won't let it slide.

353
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,050
How is he? The same as before?

354
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,250
A doctor cannot be God.

355
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,830
But perhaps Grim Reaper.

356
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,940
What do you want from me?

357
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,740
I'm asking you not to do anything.

358
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,440
Nothing.
