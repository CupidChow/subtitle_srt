What? A noted pain doctor?

2
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,167
The fact that a CIPA
patient is treating

3
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,467

4

Excuse me.

5

He hasn't had any problems
treating patients.

Problems didn't happen to arise,

7
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:18,867
but it would've been
a problem eventually.

8
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:22,307
How could the patients trust
you and let you treat them?

9
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:25,217
So did you have fun observing
patients all this time?

10
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:28,917
You obsessed over the kinds
of pain unbeknown to you, right?

11
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:31,937
How could someone like
that treat patients?

12
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:33,857
How could I not?

13
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:36,827
The more I observed, the more I saw.

14
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:38,717
The more I obsessed,
the more I heard.

15
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:40,687
I can't feel,

16
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:43,727
but I was never free
from the patients' cry.

17

How could I not treat patients?

18
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:51,287
CIPA is neither a contagious disease

19
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:54,007
nor a mental illness such
as schizophrenia.

20
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:56,547
His condition doesn't affect
his performance at all

21
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:58,517
and it can't be the reason
for his dismissal.

22
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,647
Anyway, it's true that

23
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:03,417
he deceived the hospital
by hiding his condition.

24
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:06,387
I didn't say that we
decided to dismiss him.

25
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:08,007
We should form the
disciplinary committee

26
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:10,687
and discuss a way to punish him.

27
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:14,307

31
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:26,447
this is my responsibility.

32
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:29,627
I'll receive punishment as well.

33
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:35,097

I'll accept whatever the punishment.

tell you for the last time.

41

You can't treat anyone
