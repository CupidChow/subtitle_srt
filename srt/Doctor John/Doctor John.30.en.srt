On the day of the accident,

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:05,997
I found...

3
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:09,107
an organ donor's card
in Dad's wallet.

4
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:14,487
He won't be able to donate much,

5
00:00:15,837 --> 00:00:18,717
but I believe it's his final wish.

6
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:21,817
We applied for the card together.

7
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:26,587
Yes, we should do it.

8
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:30,237
Only a brain dead patient...

9
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:33,677
would be able to do this.

10
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:01,847
Dad.

11
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:05,117
Don't worry about us.

12
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:07,617
Please rest in peace.

13

15

Goodbye.

16
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:47,467
We'll have a moment of silence.

17
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:52,417
He was someone's beloved,

18
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:55,587
and will be dearly missed.

19
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:57,837
The donor has left us

20
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,247
after spreading flowers of love.

21
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:04,077
The love that the
deceased has shared

22
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,807
shall be spread through
and through.

23
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:11,777
We pray for his peace and
rest in the afterlife.
