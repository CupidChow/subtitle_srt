Who was that man from earlier?

338
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:16,844
- A doctor?
- Oh, 6238?

339
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:19,404
He says he's not a doctor.

340
00:26:19,404 --> 00:26:21,154
But he has to be.

341
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:23,244
That's the psycho...

342
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:24,994
I told you about.

343
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:27,374
That psycho?

344
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:28,814
That I shouldn't talk to?

345
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:31,444
From the first day he was
transferred to our prison,

346
00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:33,554
that punk took over.

347
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:34,964
But how?

348
00:26:36,114 --> 00:26:37,614
As soon as he arrived,

349
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,094
they jumped him real bad.

350
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:43,104
Someone took a sharp object and

351
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:45,254
raked it across his chest.

352
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:46,604
Stay back!

353
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,014
What?

354
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:49,864
What's going on?

355
00:26:49,864 --> 00:26:52,814
He asked for an emergency kit...

356
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:55,564
and sewed it up himself.

357
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,654
Without anesthesia. Just like that!

358
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:19,844
Without anesthesia?

359
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:22,514
I know he's got guts
and skills, but...

360
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:25,964
Aigoo, he's a psycho
and a pain in the butt.

361
00:27:25,964 --> 00:27:28,394
Why do you think the
doctors ran off?

362
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:29,954
Because of him?

363
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:33,524
- Why?
- If he thinks that they lack skills,

364
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:35,334
he attacks them ruthlessly.

365
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:38,554
He attacks and makes
them cry blood.

366
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:42,494
His nickname is "The Doctor Killer."

367
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,674
It doesn't concern me.

368
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:46,354
I'm not a formal doctor.

369
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:48,174
I'm just a part-timer.

370
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,334
That's true. A part-timer.

371
00:27:54,364 --> 00:27:57,844
Aigoo, the coat looks
great on that doctor.

372
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:02,454
My Shi Young looks
great in that coat, too.

373
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:04,404
Huh?

374
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:10,584
[ Anesthesiology ]

375
00:28:10,634 --> 00:28:12,934
[ Anesthesiology, Kang Shi Young ]

376
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:08,234
She's leaving the country tonight.

377
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:10,204
I don't think she's coming back.

378
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:12,504
It's a one-way.

379
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:14,744
Yes, I'm at the hospital.

380
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:16,364
I'm about to leave.

381
00:29:16,364 --> 00:29:18,224
Have Shi Young stay put.

382
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:19,994
- Pardon?
- I'll be right there.

383
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:21,964
- Yes, okay.
- Kang Shi Young?

384
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:25,634
Kang Shi Young!

385
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:29,314
- Shi Young, isn't he calling you?
- Huh?

386
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:31,464
Who?

387
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:33,294
- Let's go.
- Kang Shi Young.

388
00:29:39,454 --> 00:29:41,624
- Sunbae!
- It is you.

389
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:42,924
Long time.

390
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:44,764
It's been a while.

391
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:47,524
Are you Shi Young's
med school sunbae?

392
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:48,804
Yes.

393
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:51,654
I'll go to the car first.

394
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:53,244
Have a nice chat.

395
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:59,914
Wow, fancy running into you here.

396
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:01,974
How long has it been?

397
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:05,064
Was it the alumni reunion
two years ago?

398
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:07,044
Was it?

399
00:30:07,044 --> 00:30:08,564
It's already been that long.

400
00:30:08,564 --> 00:30:10,124
Anyway, good seeing you.

401
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:11,504
You're doing well, right?

402
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:13,844
He doesn't know.

403
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:16,744
This man doesn't know.

404
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,894
What had happened to me...

405
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:22,614
So what are you doing here?

406
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,534
I'm leaving the country tonight.

407
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,434
I came to say bye to my uncle.

408
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,914
A vacation?

409
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,334
Hey, I'm jealous.

410
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:32,634
I'll call you when I'm back.
See you, Sunbae!

411
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:34,894
- See you!
- Bye!

412
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:36,234
Call me sometime.

413
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,774
Okay, Sunbae!

414
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,074
Hey, isn't that Kang Shi Young?

415
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,064
You know her, too?

416
00:30:43,064 --> 00:30:45,664
How can I not know
your school's top student?

417
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:47,344
She's leaving the country tonight.

418
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:49,124
- She's on vacation.
- A vacation?

419
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:50,734
Not a leave of absence?

420
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,414
A leave of absence? Why?

421
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:53,714
You don't know?

422
00:30:53,714 --> 00:30:55,524
There was a huge incident.

423
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:57,974
A medical malpractice?
