00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,766
A murder convict is our
professor starting today?

166
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,966
Geez, what a shame.

167
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:45,636
I guess I'm the only
one who worries.

168
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,226
You guys have nothing
to worry about.

169
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,966
You're Chief's daughter...

170
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,966
and your parents own a building.

171
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,766
- I'm in your care.
- Me, too.

172
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:02,716
Dr. Lee.

173
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:04,776
It was you. I wasn't sure at first.

174
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,466
Your hair.

175
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:12,216
I didn't know you applied
to this hospital, too.

176
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:14,566
I did and I got accepted.
That's why I'm here.

177
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,366
You said "too."

178
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,246
Did you already run into him?

179
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:19,746
No. 6238.

180
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:21,566
Did you know?

181
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,966
I have two people to
introduce today.

182
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,626
One of them is running late.

183
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,706
Let's start with you,
Dr. Lee Yoo Joon.

184
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,566
He's got broad shoulders.

185
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:01,296
What did you say?

186
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:02,856
His broad shoulders.

187
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:07,706
My goodness.

188
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:11,166
How did someone so
handsome end up here?

189
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:16,016
I'm Lee Yoo Joon,
a second-year fellow.

190
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:17,476
Thank you in advance.

191
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,706
Welcome!

192
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:25,166
Am I the only one welcoming him?

193
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,716
A 38-year-old male.

194
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,276
He had canthotomy...

195
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,556
two days ago due to an emergency.

196
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:09,466
I held the tendon in lateral
canthus with forceps,

197
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:12,686
cut the outer issue with scissors,

198
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:16,326
and removed the hematoma...

199
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:19,266
that was pressuring the optic nerve.

200
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,616
The patient is currently...

201
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,836
suffering from sudden
dizziness, diplopia,

202
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,556
and he has a droopy eyelid.

203
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:35,316
But all the test results
came out normal.

204
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:41,766
Is that patient
Joo Hyung Woo by chance?

205
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,566
Joo Hyung Woo? The MMA fighter?

206
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,716
Joo Hyung Woo?

207
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,356
Daebak, wow.

208
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:50,356
Well...

209
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:53,526
What I wanted to say is...

210
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,846
The canthotomy was successful.

211
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:59,796
But he's suddenly suffering
from dizziness and diplopia.

212
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:02,996
So there must be something else
going on other than his eye.

213
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:05,526
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes, that's correct.

214
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:08,716
The patient had a slight fever,
similar to a flu symptom.

215
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:11,136
He also has diabetes in addition,

216
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:13,506
but he had slight numbness
on his extremities.

217
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,396
No problem with his vision.

218
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:18,556
What's the reason
you're bringing this up now?

219
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,846
You're not suggesting to
find the cause together.

220
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:22,376
I am.

221
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:23,576
Why?

222
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,036
He's not even our patient.

223
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:26,886
We didn't treat someone
else's patient...

224
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,966
and caused a problem
in the first place.

225
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,246
Who's it?

226
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,066
Excuse me.

227
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,666
This is Cha Yo Han.

228
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,646
Got it.

229
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:51,726
Apparently...

230
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,066
his vision just came back.

231
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,386
That's great.

232
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,666
- There's no problem then.
- No.

233
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:03,596
There is a problem.

234
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,766
We successfully stopped the bleeding
that was pressuring the optic nerve.

235
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,966
But he couldn't open his eye.

236
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:11,906
He had blurry vision and was dizzy.

237
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:13,406
And he fainted.

238
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,556
He suddenly developed...

239
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:18,286
dizziness and diplopia.

240
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:21,486
And he just recovered naturally.

241
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,856
Is this normal?

242
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,406
Can you think of anything?

243
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:29,926
By chance...

244
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:32,146
does he have a neurological disorder...

245
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:35,436
that has nothing to do
with this accident?

246
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:38,326
If so, Neurology should
treat him instead.

247
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:39,916
That's none of our concern.

248
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,736
Isn't it our job to treat patients
regardless of departments?

249
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,136
So what?

250
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,376
What are you suggesting?

251
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:48,256
It can be any of you.

252
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:50,296
An attending, a fellow, or a resident.

253
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:53,236
If any of you have an opinion,

254
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:54,706
feel free to call me.

255
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:55,706
Right.

256
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,776
I'll be...

257
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,416
in charge of Pain Surgery
starting today.

258
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,566
I'm Cha Yo Han.

259
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:13,146
"Isn't it our job to treat patients
regardless of departments?"

260
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:15,566
He thinks he's Schweitzer
or something.

261
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,076
He freaked out when the
patient deteriorated.

262
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,806
He's all talk!

263
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,666
The patient is doing fine.

264
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,476
What is the problem?

265
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:26,586
He's determined to be responsible
for the patient he treated.

266
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,416
A strong sense of duty
and responsibility.

267
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,946
He's irresponsible!

268
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,966
He operated on someone
when it's not his specialty!

269
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:37,416
Why is he yelling at me?

270
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,366
Gosh.

271
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:43,086
Shi Young.

272
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:45,896
This is your first day.

273
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:47,426
Good luck!

274
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:48,916
Yes, Auntie.

275
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:08,586
Do you have 10 licenses
or something?

276
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:12,646
Or are you planning
to get a new one...

277
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:14,486
whenever it's revoked?

278
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:17,116
Fine, that's up to you.

279
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,156
But keep this in mind.

280
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:22,556
You might get your license back,

281
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:26,636
but this is your only chance
to work at Hansae Hospital.

282
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:28,576
Who's the one...

283
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,966
who gave me that chance?

284
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:33,266
Is that the only reason you hired me?

285
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:39,406
You said this about what
happened three years ago.

286
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:41,906
"I didn't sin. I broke the law."

287
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,826
I agree with that.

288
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:47,176
You got punished for
breaking the law.

289
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:49,546
You're going back to work
since you've been punished.

290
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,076
Work harder than anyone...

291
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,566
and try to be discreet about it.

292
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,416
I'll go first.

293
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,706
I'm a fellow, and you're
a second-year resident.

294
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:14,866
Okay?

295
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:25,856
Yes.

296
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:27,266
It's me.

297
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,666
No. 6238.

298
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:30,916
Who are you...

299
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:33,736
I'm Lee Yoo Joon.

300
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:36,226
I worked at the hospital
nearby where you were...

301
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,946
Oh, right!

302
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:39,956
The fellow who
misdiagnosed frequently.

303
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:41,196
Not frequently.

304
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:43,166
It was just twice.

305
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:48,486
Are we meant to be, or is it
just a coincidence?

306
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:49,596
It's destiny.

307
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:52,086
I applied here so I could beat you.

308
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:53,636
Were you beaten by me?

309
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,456
When I was at that hospital...

310
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:57,996
I was in a much better
position than you were.

311
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,536
I could see and examine
patients myself.

312
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:02,836
All you did was eavesdropping in jail.

313
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,206
But you were always right.

314
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:07,446
How do you think I felt?

315
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:09,096
I wouldn't know.

316
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:11,616
I've never felt that way before.

317
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,666
You're now an attending,
and I'm a fellow.

318
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:19,726
It might sound ridiculous that
a fellow is challenging an attending,

319
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:21,586
but I'm sure someday,

320
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,766
I'll be able to...

321
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,506
correct your misdiagnosis.

322
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:27,026
I'm not sure about that.

323
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,226
Before that, Doctor...

324
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:31,566
- Dr. who?
- Lee Yoo Joon.

325
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,046
Dr. Lee Yoo Joon should
learn this first.

326
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:36,286
First, diagnosis isn't a competition.

327
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:40,686
Second, getting a new look won't
make you a better doctor.

328
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,206
What's this?

329
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,866

Cancer would've spread faster

- Why?

He left his watch.

Suddenly feeling eye
discomfort and dizziness.

472
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,076
If his recovery is connected
to the nerves system,

473

he'd experience other symptoms, too.
That's why he'd come back.

What else do you see at those fights?

492
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:45,356
Pretty grid girls?

493
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:48,166
- More importantly, there are fighters.
- And?

494
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:51,906
That'd be your homework.

495
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,466
Second-year resident.

496
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:56,226
- Yes.
- Didn't you have an opinion?

497
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:57,586
Well, yes.

498
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:03,276
Joo Hyung Woo went to South America
to film a TV show recently.

499
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:04,696
If he was vaccinated,

500
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,756
the antigens could've
damaged the nerve cells...

501
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:11,766
It could've caused Guillain-Barre syndrome
or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis?

502
00:31:12,476 --> 00:31:15,426
Guillain-Barre syndrome could've
caused the eye problem,

503
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:17,876
but it doesn't explain how
he recovered naturally.

504
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,026
I suspect a stroke,
neuromyelitis optica,

505
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,516
or other neurological issues
such as multiple sclerosis.

506
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,336
But since he's not showing
any neurological symptoms...

507
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:35,456
The numbness he felt
on his hands and feet.

508
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:38,616
It could easily be mistaken
as diabetes, but...

509
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:41,416
It's also the symptom
of multiple sclerosis...

510
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:44,006
or neuromyelitis optica.

511
00:31:45,856 --> 00:31:48,866
Should I call the patient
to receive checkups?

512
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,606
Tell him it might be
his brain, not his eye.

513
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:53,416
Tell him to receive
a checkup at Neurology.

514
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,476
Okay!

515
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,126
I'll get going.

516
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:04,666
Doctor, what if he was
already discharged?

517
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,766
I said he'd be back for his watch.

518
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:28,356
I'm Kang Shi Young,
a resident at Anesthesiology.

519
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:31,436
I'm Heo Joon, a resident.

520
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,866
I'm enjoying your fights.

521
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:39,036
Dr. Cha said it's not your eye,

522
00:32:39,036 --> 00:32:40,426
but it could be your brain.

523
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,496
He says to receive a checkup.

524
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:48,366
Receive a checkup at Neurology
and let them diagnose you.

525
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,476
Let Dr. Cha explain to you and...

526
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:51,556
Doctor.

527
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:56,366
You know what the DNR
(Do Not Resuscitate) order is right?

528
00:32:57,336 --> 00:32:58,296
Yes.

529
00:32:58,296 --> 00:33:01,026
I signed one recently.

530
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:04,996
If I get sent here for an emergency,

531
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:07,876
don't do anything to prolong my life.

532
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:09,906
Please tell him that.

533
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:10,946
Please.

534
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:13,676
Why would you say that?
You haven't even been diagnosed yet.

535
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:15,556
I'll get going for now.

536
00:33:15,556 --> 00:33:16,946
Well...

537
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:18,756
You're afraid, aren't you?

538
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:24,266
You're afraid you'd get diagnosed
with an incurable disease.

539
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,556
That's what you're afraid of, right?

540
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,496
Most people like us...

541
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:33,176
get scared if we notice something
wrong with our bodies.

542
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:35,146
But you're an athlete.

543
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,726
Your body is everything to you.

544
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:39,946
I think that's why you're
probably more afraid.

545
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:44,296
But your condition might
get worse if you wait.

546
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:46,966
- It's not too late...
- Thank you, Doctor.

547
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:49,436
I am afraid.

548
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:52,986
Knowing someone understands that...

549
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:54,766
comforts me.

550
00:33:57,586 --> 00:33:59,576
- Wait!
- Hey, Kang Shi Young!

551
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,236
This is so upsetting.

552
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:04,746
Sir.

553
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:07,376
Sir!

554
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:15,046
Sir.

555
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:18,346
Sir.

556
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:19,926
You can't leave.

557
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:21,576
Sir!

558
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:36,646
Sir!

559
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,026
Sir!

560
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:41,986
If you see here, there's
a fracture on your left leg.

561
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:44,906
The CT scan and everything is normal,

562
00:34:44,906 --> 00:34:47,216
but according to the spinal MRI,

563
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:50,066
we see a herniated disc that's
pressing down your left nerve.

564
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:52,826
I'll transfer you to Orthopedics.

565
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:54,816
We'll be treating you from now on.

566
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:57,446
Neurology, not Orthopedics.

567
00:34:57,446 --> 00:35:01,726
Have you experienced weird or
burning sensations on your limbs?

568
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:02,656
Why do you ask?

569
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:04,066
It might be a neurological disease.

570
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,486
Please receive a checkup.

571
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:08,816
Neurological diseases need
to get diagnosed ASAP.

572
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:14,856
A herniated disc doesn't explain
the dizziness and blurry vision.

573
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:17,466
- Transfer to Neurology and...
- No, that's okay.

574
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,466
Please treat my leg ASAP.

575
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:25,206
Don't you have a guardian?

576
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:27,466
How about family?

577
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:32,666
Does your family know
about any of this?

578
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:36,466
- You have no one to visit you?
- I have no one!
