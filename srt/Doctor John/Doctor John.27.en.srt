00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:39,957
- So he really can't feel pain?
- Is this true?

167
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:51,907
Ki Seok's phlegm culture
test results are out.

168
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:52,907
It's confirmed.

169
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:54,047
You heard, right?

170
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,067
Yes.

171
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,757
Dr. Cha.

172
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,667
Is he doing okay?

173
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:02,477
He said he'll stay home and rest.

174
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:06,517
Isn't Dr. Cha Yo Han
seeing patients today?

175
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:07,547
No.

176
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,417
He won't be seeing
patients for a while.

177
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,007
Why all of a sudden?

178
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:13,927
I came all the way
from the countryside.

179
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:16,497
I heard that Dr. Cha is ill.

180
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:17,757
Is it true?

181
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,547
But how?

182
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,967
He's unable to feel any pain.

183
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,687
That, congenital
insensitive something...

184
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,267
You're done, sir.

185
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,367
Please wait outside,
and we'll call you.

186
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,437
Thank you.

187
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:30,777
I see, okay.

188
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:33,577
Please change in to
your patient's gown.

189
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,267
Here you go.

190
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:48,807
What? What is it?

191
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,337
It's tomorrow.

192
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:51,867
The disciplinary committee
for Dr. Cha.

193
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:52,917
What?

194
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,747
Is it really tomorrow?

195
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,087
So soon?

196
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,547
I know.

197
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:59,717
I think his punishment
will be harsh.

198
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:02,547
Is it this easy to
dismiss someone?

199
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:05,707
If he damaged the hospital's
reputation, then yes.

200
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,227
Image is the most
important thing to them.

201
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:09,807
Then what should we do?

202
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,197
Do we just standby and
watch Dr. Cha leave?

203
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,067
Yes, Dr. Cha.

204
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,917
You received the notice, right?

205
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,067
It's tomorrow.

206
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,717
I don't have to attend, right?

207
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,867
Even if you don't, the disciplinary
committee will hold.

208
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,367
[ Notice of attendance ]
But if you don't attend,
you can't defend yourself.

209
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:25,547
Are you okay with that?

210
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:27,177
Yes, I'm fine.

211
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,587
Okay then.

212
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:29,887
I'll call you.

213
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,367
Also...

214
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:36,177
do you have time today?

215
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:37,227
Today?

216
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,737
There's someone
I'd like for you to meet.

217
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:44,547
You asked me who recommended
you to the hospital, correct?

218
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:45,937
He's the one.

219
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:54,227
Hello.

220
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,967
Mr. Yang Jae Young,
how are you feeling?

221
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:57,897
Is it true?

222
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:02,077
That Dr. Cha is really
unable to feel any pain?

223
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,237
- Yes.
- My God.

224
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:05,937
How can this be...

225
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:08,467
I had no idea that

226
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,417
he was like that.

227
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,927
Yes, yes.

228
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,597
Dr. Cha has CIPA.

229
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:15,777
But...

230
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,967
who treated your neuralgia, sir?

231
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,207
Dr. Cha, right?

232
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,957
He's such a competent doctor...

233
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:22,887
That's what I'm saying.

234
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:25,747
I couldn't even open my mouth,

235
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,827
so I couldn't eat properly.

236
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:29,307
I couldn't speak either,

237
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:31,487
and suffered immensely.

238
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,697
I mean,

239
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:34,667
he does not know pain,

240
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,647
but how does he cure it so well?

241
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,267
That man deserves an award.

242
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:44,227
So when will Dr. Cha
be returning?

243
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:47,877
I'd really like to thank him.

244
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:51,227
I'm the grateful one, sir.

245
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,847
Thank you so much!

246
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:56,427
Everyone, gather here. Hurry.

247
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:08,247
I think there is a way
to help Dr. Cha.

248
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:09,087
But how?

249
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,577
- Really?
- What is it?

250
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:14,917
Starting now, we'll split into
two teams and proceed.

251

will get better ♫

♫ I can't erase you from
deep inside my heart ♫

257
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,607
Really? Okay, thank you.

258
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:39,927
Yes, I understand.

259
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:41,197
Okay.

260
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:14,517
Minister.

261
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:16,407
Dr. Cha is here.

262
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:28,737
Hello, sir.

263
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,377
I'm Cha Yo Han.

264
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,207
I've been wanting to meet you.

265
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:35,037
Have a seat.

266
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:37,417
Have a seat.

267
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:55,467
So...

268
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,697
why did you want to see me?

269
00:18:57,697 --> 00:19:01,157
At first, it wasn't for the patients,

270
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:03,907
but probably to know
more about your illness.

271
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,277
That's why you became
a doctor, correct?

272
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,487
I also felt the same way.

273
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:14,167
I wanted to know more
about this disease

274
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,667
which hardens the muscles
and the organs gradually.

275
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,967
I tried to find a way to

276
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,067
cure this disease.

277
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:25,277
However, I couldn't do it.

278
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:29,217
Instead, I found another way.

279
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,697
A way to resolve the

280
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:36,107
pain itself, and not the disease.

281
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:43,117
Don't you want to know
what that is?

282
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:46,857
Show him.

283
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:56,847
Hi.

284
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:02,257
Excuse me, Ms. Chae.

285
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:04,387
Do you need something?

286
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:08,877
Is there a clinical trial for
patients with terminal cancer?

287
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:14,257
Actually, my sister received this
text on her phone yesterday.

288
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:20,557

for terminal cancer patients.

He's guilty of it all.

Or will you call it
"salvation" instead?

306

Salvation...

about "death"?

308

Everyone dies.

309

However, not everyone can

310

experience a peaceful death.

00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,967
Use me to legalize
euthanasia and sell that drug?

333
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:17,517
I also have the same illness!

334
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,477
I have the same illness
as the minister.

335
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:25,327
The disease which traps
me in my body.

336
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:28,147
My mind is sound,
but my body will die.

337
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:31,817
For patients like me...

338
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:34,117
that drug is our only hope.

339
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,797
Myung Oh.

340
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:42,007
Myung Oh, come to
your senses and listen.

341
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,057
Okay?

342
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:45,917
This is different from euthanasia.

343
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:47,527
Will that drug be

344
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,917
given only to doctors
and patients in need?

345
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:52,367
Anyone can die,
and anyone can kill.

346
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:54,917
No one will try to save
or cure anymore.

347
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:58,007
I wanted to help...

348
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,037
patients like me.

349
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:05,777
I'm sorry about your illness.

350
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:08,267
But...

351
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,167
you weren't trying to
help the patients.

352
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:15,357
You were only trying
to help yourself.

353
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:37,607
Dr. Cha!

354
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:39,897
Dr. Cha! My Ki Seok.

355
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:40,967
Please save him.

356
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,767
- Dad!
- Honey...

357
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:46,227
What is the big deal about "death"?

358
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:47,337
Mom...

359
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:49,017
You suffered so much.

360
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:51,447
I love you, Mom.

361
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:53,187
It hurts.

362
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,567
It hurts so much.

363
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,467
Please stop.

364
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:59,567
Dad is in a lot of pain.

365
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:01,347
Speeding up death for relief and

366
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,467
speeding up death to
take a life is different!

367
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:04,687
I'm not...

368
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:08,167
a doctor who takes away lives.

369
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,627
Please save me.

370
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,667
Dr. Cha, I want to live.

371
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:17,797
Do you know what "death" is?

372
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:24,687
When they're forgotten
by their loved ones.

373
00:25:58,297 --> 00:25:59,717
Minister.

374
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:05,167
Make the preparations.

375
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:10,957
And call the doctor as well.

376
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:12,457
Yes, sir.

377
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:14,177
I will.

378
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:17,607
At "Conversation about death"?

379
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:19,807
If an incident like the
Kerubim video happens,

380
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:22,867
then "Conversation about death"
could become a murder site.

381
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:26,667
Shall we get going?
There's not much time.

382
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:31,767
[ Cha Yo Han ]

383
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,127
[ Seongbukgu Seongbukdong 127 ]

384
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,977
Seongbukgu Seongbukdong 127?

385
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:39,607
It's former Minister
Lee Won Gil's address.

386
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,137
What is this?

387
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:57,377
I said it's former
Minister Lee Won Gil's address.

388
00:26:57,377 --> 00:26:59,117
So why are you giving it to me...

389
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,857
Do you know anything?

390
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:03,557
You mentioned something
about a drug before.

391
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:05,997
What if...

392
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:09,597
there was a drug which allowed
for a pleasant, peaceful death?

393
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:10,767
Kerubim.

394
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:13,287
Did you see the clip?

395
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:14,107
Yes.

396
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,167
- You knew about that drug, correct?
- Yes.

397
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,167
So...

398
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:21,267
how is Kerubim connected to the
former Minister Lee Won Gil?

399
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:24,867
Former Minister Lee Won Gil
showed me that video clip,

400
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:28,137
and location in question
was his house.

401
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:31,967
This is enough to
charge him, correct?

402
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,757
- Arrest him quickly.
- Why me?

403
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:39,007
I said, why are you telling me this?

404
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,397
Considering who the opponent is,

405
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:43,417
I needed someone
who'll investigate

406
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:46,257
tenaciously and not succumb
to any outside pressure.

407
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:48,097
Please use...

408
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:51,167
your tenacity for these
instances, not on me.

409
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:01,067
We have an emergency.
We'll split up into two teams.

410
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,687
I got a tip that the Kerubim video

411
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,367
was viewed at former
Minister Lee Won Gil's house.

412
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:05,367
We'll go to the minister's house.

413
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:07,367
You go to the "Conversation about death."
Call the local police for backup.

414
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:08,267
Yes, sir.

415
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:09,577
But Prosecutor.

416
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:12,167
Who tipped you off?

417
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,057
- That's confidential.
- Pardon?

418
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:16,387
I must protect the informant.

419
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:17,557
Let's get going.

420
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:26,447
I understand.

421
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:31,557
Please take care of the aftermath.

422
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:33,307

[ Doctor ]

424
00:28:57,037 --> 00:29:02,727
Death washes away
all pain and sorrow.

425
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:05,907
It's a magnificent grace.

426
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:11,867

428
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,067
I don't hear anyone.

429
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,057
Stand by until I call for you.

430
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:07,857
Yes, sir.

431
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:40,187

Yes, how are things over there?

434
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:53,517
A group text was sent
canceling today's meeting.

435
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,437
We can't locate one of the
members' whereabouts.

436
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,617
Is he missing?

437
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:58,657
It's premature to label him missing.

438
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,817
He was here when the
meeting started,

439
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,577
but disappeared right
before we arrived.

440
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:03,917
He can't be reached, either.

441
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:07,617
Track his cellphone,

442
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:10,457
identify him, then visit his home,
family, and acquaintances.

443
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:11,467
Yes, sir.
