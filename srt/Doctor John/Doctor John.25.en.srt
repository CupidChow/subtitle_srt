that I'll do my best

Whether I've been faking
it all this time or not?

60

Sorry, but only my patients can judge
whether I'm qualified or not.

Are you confident?

63

Even if everything is out in the open,

64
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,070
your patients won't feel betrayed

65
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,460
and continue to trust you.

66
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,880
Are you confident about that?

A patient of mine is
unconscious as we speak.

that patient or not

can let you die

feeling happy and comfortable...

88
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,690

102
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,640

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,670
Yes.

104
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,770
It's only a matter of time
until he resigns.

105

We can't revoke his license or
faculty appointment over this stuff.

106

We can at least kick him
out of that hospital.

107
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,060
If people find out that the doctor who
can't feel pain treated them,

108

a lot of patients would
question the diagnosis.

109

Yes.

We need to find out the
cause behind his condition.

117

The prognosis depends
on that cause.

to communicate with you.

asked how Ki Seok is doing.

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,300
Nothing.

168
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,800
- I can have a look at this, right?
- Yes.

169
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,100
You have to stay strong, ma'am.

170
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,720
Ki Seok would fight
harder that way.

171
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,280
At least, Ki Seok can
communicate by blinking.

172
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,620
He took a step forward.

173
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,150
Yes.

174
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Yes.

175
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
My mother would say,
"Food equals energy!"

176
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,700
She says that all the time.

177
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,100

178
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,760
Excuse me.

179
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,960
Yes, Doctor.

180
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,410
Ki Seok.

181
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,820
You used steroid when you
worked out recently, right?

182
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,680
This. Blink once if I'm right.

183
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,730
Blink twice if I'm wrong.

184
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,890
Have you been somewhere
other than the gym?

185
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,880
Where?

186
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,060
No short-answer questions.
Only multiple-choice questions.

187
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,020
Excuse me.

188
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,070
Hold on a second.

189
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,170
Doctor, I have something to tell you.

190
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,910
I met with Ki Seok's friend.

191
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,880
Assaulted?

192
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,590
He was assaulted?

193
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,660
Yes.

194
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,060
Some kids have been
bullying Ki Seok.

195
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,830
They took him to a
warehouse and beat him.

196
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,170
A warehouse?

197
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,680
Hey.

198
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,610
Hey!

199
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,420
It really doesn't hurt?

200
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,270
Hey.

201
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,830
Doesn't it hurt, I asked!

202
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,800
Don't.

203
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,180
Hey, get up.

204
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,010
Stick this in.

205
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,290
I heard you've done this before.

206
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,150
Wow, Ki Seok!

207
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,770
I don't do stuff like this anymore.

208
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,000
Move.

209
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,200
Is that so?

210
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,730
I'll make you suffer.

211
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,750
Come here.

212
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,560
He hit his head?

213
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,080
Yes.

214
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,630
It still doesn't hurt?

215
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,240
That must hurt!

216
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,950

- Sue us.
- Ki Seok.

221
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,830
Where are you going?

222
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,780
Let's do a CTA scan.

223
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,080
By chance, are you suspecting...

224
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,340

226

Doctor, the first CT scan
didn't show anything.

227
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,370
CT scans can't detect
an acute stroke.

228

231

the prognosis...

232
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,180
the prognosis won't be good.

233

We don't know the result yet.

234
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,780

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,390
All right.

240
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,510
We built this garden with
hospice volunteers.

241
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,690
You only talk about your illness
when you're in your ward.

242
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,630
But when you're out here,
you get to talk about

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,570
flowers, trees, and things
that are pretty.

244

I can't smell the flowers,

245
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,610
but I can hear the birds singing

246
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,970
and the leaves

247
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,070

248
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,420

Hello, ma'am.

- Hi...
- Aren't the flowers pretty?

252
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,440
Yes, they're so pretty.

253

Yes.

What now?

285

291
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,190

300
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,300
I know.

301
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,100
How could they spread a false rumor
like this on the sacred bulletin board?

302
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,240
No.

303
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,200
This isn't just a false rumor.
It's defamation.

304

Yes!

305
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,240
Considering how it got posted
right after he was on TV,

306
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,260
someone must've been jealous.

307
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,700
A lot of weirdos attack

I'm sure.

309
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,790
Actually, when he first
started treating Ki Seok,

310
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,350
he was acting kind of weird.
So I wondered.

311
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,210
Huh?

312
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,850
Was he acting weird?

313
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,980
- I didn't notice.
- Never mind.

314
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,470
Oh, my gosh! What's going on?

315
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,100
- Dr. Lee Yoo Joon.
- Yes.

316
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,540
Get the bed ready.

317
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,890
He's not going to the ER?

318
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,330
No, he's not.

319

He's our patient.

320
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,780
I can only tell you
that it's impossible.

321
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,250
He's a bit strange today.

322
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,130
Right?

323
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,510
He's been asking all day
regarding the CIPA patient's results.

324
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,530

to a different hospital?

329
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,220
Could you tell me the location
of the warehouse you mentioned?

330
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,280
Yes, text me when you
get the address.

331

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,470
Talk to me for a second.

334
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,680
What's wrong?

335
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,550
Is it really true?

336
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,330
What is?

337
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,970
Is Dr. Cha...

338
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,400
a CIPA patient?

Doctor!

346
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,840
Did you find out?

347
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,300
Not yet.

348
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,500
But...

349
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,430

came to see me.

It's okay.

357
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,810
I knew a day like this
would come someday.

358

You promised.

You said you'd tell me first

366
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,300

will be the procedure now?

Please tell only the truth

Is the post on the hospital
bulletin board true?

That you're a CIPA patient,

It's true.
