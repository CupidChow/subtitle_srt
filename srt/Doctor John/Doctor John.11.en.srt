1
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,100
Get away from her.

2
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,800
Right this minute.

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,960
She's my resident.

4
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,850
Happy now?

5
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,610
Should I move back more?

6
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,800
Yes, I understand. See you there.

7
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,080
I must get going.

8
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,720
See you again.

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,700
Dr. Kang Shi Young.

10
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,530
[ Doctor John ]
[ Episode 6: A world without pain ]

11
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,760
It's half success and half failure...

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,370
You said this to me before, no?

13
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,750
You being sentenced was a success.

14
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,540
However, not for 10 years
but for only three...

15
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,320
- was a failure.
- So?

16
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,420
I've served my time.
What do you want me to do?

17
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,950
A criminal label doesn't
disappear over time.

18
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,280
Only society's forgiveness
can remove it.

19
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,570
I've never asked for the society's
forgiveness for what I've done.

20
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,020
I asked for their consent.

21
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,360
I believe you failed in
gaining their consent.

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,420
Since you were declared guilty.

23
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,710
What do you want from me?

24
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,230
Revoke my license?
Cancel my degree?

25
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,680
Of course not.

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,140
I have no reason nor right to
conduct such things.

27
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,690
Or since I'll conduct
euthanasia again,

28
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,310
you'll standby and watch,
then revoke my license.

29
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,660
- No.
- Then what is it that you want?

30
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,590
What I want is only one thing.

31
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm asking you not to do anything.

32
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,690
Please don't do anything.

33
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,920
Why?

34
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,770
Because I'm scared of you.

35
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,970
You're scared of me?

36
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,140
Yes.

37
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,870
A prosecutor of Korea is scared
of a doctor with a criminal history?

38
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,830
- Why do you think?
- Who knows? I have no idea.

39
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,020
A murder based not on accidental
impulse, but on firm beliefs.

40
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,610
And those beliefs are...

41
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,940
being held by one above the law.

42
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,560
Such people have a way
of tainting others.

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,220
Especially those who aren't
yet firm in their own beliefs

44
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,790
and under training. To them, you are...

45
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,150
like a martyr who sacrificed
himself for others and...

46
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,150
bled to death.

47
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,440
That's what you may seem to be.

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,970
This is why I'm asking
you not to do anything.

49
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,120
Nothing.

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,300
I'll see you around, Doctor.

51
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,320
It doesn't matter to me.

52
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,480
However you think about me,

53
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,530
or how you assess me,

54
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,740
it's not important.

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,480
What's important to me...

56
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,220
What's important to me...

57
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,640
is not how you assess
me as a doctor,

58
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,320
but how the patients assess me.

59
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,670
Am I a doctor who kills
or one who saves?

60
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,700
I'll be evaluated by
the patients and not you.

61
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,780
May I give you a piece of advice?

62
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,720
A doctor...

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,410
cannot be God.

64
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,720
But perhaps Grim Reaper.

65
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,100
Hello?

66
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,680
What happened?

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,310
What did Prosecutor Son say?
To duke it out?

68
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,620
We must fight again?

69
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,450
It's not like that.
Let's talk tomorrow.

70
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,610
Okay.

71
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,100
But there is one more news.

72
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,150
What news?

73
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,300
I know a producer at the station
Joo Hyung Woo gave his interview.

74
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,490
He called me.

75
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,250
And inquired about
interviewing you.

76
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,720
Are you okay with
media attention?

77
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,980
Are you doing this
as a prosecutor?

78
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,680
- As a prosecutor, or...
- I'm doing this...

79
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,180
- as a prosecutor.
- I don't think so.

80
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,500
[ Incoming Call: Chae Eun Jung ]

81
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,790
- Hello?
- Prosecutor, it's me.

82
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,000
- Did you see him?
- Yes.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,510
Just now.

84
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,450
How is he?

85
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,330
The same as before?

86
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,900
Let's talk in person.

87
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,230
Yes, I have something to
tell you as well.

88
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,500
Han Myung Oh.

89
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,830
Hansae Hospital's legal adviser.

90
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,220
As you know, he volunteered
as Cha Yo Han's

91
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,890
attorney during the
Yoon Sung Gyu case.

92
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,460
Min Tae Kyung.

93
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,110
Hansae Hospital's Chief of
Department of Pain Medicine.

94
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,420
She faced opposition but got
Cha Yo Han appointed at the hospital.

95
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,660
However, no matter how
I much dig, she has no relations

96
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,640
whatsoever to Cha Yo Han.

97
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,230
Then why was she so eager
to get him appointed?

98
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,450
The reason may be right here.

99
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,110
Kang Yi Soo.

100
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,920
Chairman of Hansae Hospital
Board of Directors.

101
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,030
Min Tae Kyung's husband.

102
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,330
He's in a vegetative state due
to an unfortunate accident.

103
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,650
He's on a respirator...

104
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,590
for prolongation of life.

105
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,230
I wonder what my husband
is thinking right now?

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,100
What are you two doing?

107
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,750
We were talking about how
your dad must be feeling.

108
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,260
Are you agreeing with my sister?

109
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,130
I don't agree.

110
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,110
If you don't agree with something...

111
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,880
you don't try to
understand it at all.

112
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,270
A doctor's decision isn't based
on your likes or dislikes.

113
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,030
In that aspect, Shi Young...

114
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,400
is making an effort.

115
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,070
Hello?

116
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,650
Yes, Doctor.
It's Kang Shi Young.

117
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,820
Where are you?

118
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,270
- What?
- I said, where are you?

119
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,600
Their daughter is Kang Shi Young,

120
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,410
a resident at the
Department of Pain Medicine.

121
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,820
Yes, correct.

122
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,200
She is...

123
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,560
Cha Yo Han's resident right now.

124
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,130
Yes.

125
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,660
It's like Postma.

126
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,300
Postma...
[ Postma: A case in the
Netherlands regarding euthanasia ]

127
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,700
[ Postma: A case in the
Netherlands regarding euthanasia ]

128
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,300
Postma from the Netherlands?

129
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,190
She was a doctor and
a patient's daughter.

130
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,880
If she halts her father's life
prolongation and results in his death...

131
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,770
she'll be the Korean version of Postma.

132
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,030
If someone dresses it up like that...

133
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,440
and sways the public that way.

134
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,340
Could this possibly be a coincidence?

135
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,040
If not, there should be
some linking factors.

136
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,500
No school, friends, and
blood relations at all...

137
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,860
But a connecting factor
between them.

138
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,750
The prosecutor in
charge of your case...

139
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,910
Why did he pay you a visit?

140
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,000
To intimidate me.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,940
He wants to nip it in the bud
should it happen again.

142
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,210
What if...

143
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,230
I hope this will never happen, but...

144
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,020
If...

145
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,610
there's an identical
patient as back then...

146
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,350
Would I make the same choice?

147
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,500
Yes.

148
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,580
Do you know what I heard the
most right after that case?

149
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,860
That it wasn't for the patient...

150
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,770
but I wanted to be liberated
from that patient.

151
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,730
They said it was because
I wanted peace.

152
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,150
You're not speaking
for Dad's sake...

153
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,840
Isn't it for your own peace?

154
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,290
There were many reasons
to let the patient go...

155
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,270
but that wasn't it at all.

156
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,340
I could confidently answer them.

157
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,680
If I can't do the same
in the current state

158
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,600
in an identical situation...

159
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,080
then it's not my conviction.

160
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,560
It would be a murder based
on momentary impulse.

161
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,480
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,880
I asked you a stupid question.

163
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,030
Can I hit back with
a stupid scenario?

164
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,270
In the event...

165

How would you describe
the word, "pain?"

205

To paraphrase "pain,"

206
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,150
I think it's our bodies talking to us.

207
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,250
- Our bodies talking to us?
- Yes.

208

If our body is in danger
or something is not right,

209

The patient we're meeting today...

His body doesn't talk even
though something's wrong.

In other words...

he's unable to feel pain.

216
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,350
He's suffering from congenital insensitive
to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA).

This equipment monitors one's heart

[ Analgesia Nociception Index ]

When most people feel pain,

00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,700
their heart rate changes,

However, this patient
shows no changes.

as a form of cognitive training.

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,410
Since his neurons won't register
any painful stimulation,

232
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,470
we've repeatedly been telling
him that he's being stimulated.

233
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,120
Yes. Through repetitive training,

on their reflexes.

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,400
Since he's susceptible to infections,

332
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,960
we can find the source
from infections and poisons.

333
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,160
Proceed with the examination.

334
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,990
Yes, sir.

335
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,710
How are you feeling?

336
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,510
I think I had a switcheroo
with Ki Seok.

337
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,600
My pain is better...

338
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,060
but my shoulders feel weak
and so are my hands.

339
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,760
You feel weak?

340
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,200
Yes.

341
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,970
Let me twist it once.

342
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,120
Are you okay?

343
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,710
Why?

344
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,280
What is it?

345
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,440
Disc?

346
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,690
Yes.

347
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,710
The exam states you have a disc
between the fifth and sixth cervical spine.

348
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,320
If I get surgery...

349
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,200
will the pain really go away?

350
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,380
Out of your symptoms, we're only
able to locate the disc issue,

351
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,460
and we'll attempt to remove it.

352
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,460
I see.

353
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,660
You haven't eaten due
to the examinations.

354
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,330
Dr. Park Sang Hyun of our
Neurosurgery Dept. is truly the best.

355
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,780
He's already booked for months,

356
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,540
but he had a vacant spot
today. So we signed you up.

357
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,580
Well, then...

358
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,070
I'll do it.

359
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,830
What's this?

360
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,500
Is Choi Seung Won entrusted
with the Neurosurgery Dept.?

361
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,940
Yes. They're prepping for surgery.

362
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,210
May I take a look?

363
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,560
Yes.

364
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,840
It's Choi Seung Won's pain diary.

365
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,180
But I'm not sure if his pain...

366
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,470
is a result of the disc.

367
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,530
He's 47 years old and
a carpenter for 20 years.

368
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,070
He's used to manual labor,
therefore, used to physical pain.

369
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,120
But he said this is a first for him...

370
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,990
I don't think it's
a simple disc problem.

371
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,420
Yes, a disc will cause
much discomfort, but...

372
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,700
He has a daughter.

373
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,140
Pardon?

374
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,900
She was ill about a year ago.

375
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
What was wrong with her?

376
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,390
"Seul Ah was sick and
missed school today."

377
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,200
"We were to make a desk together,

378
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,540
but we couldn't
because she was sick."

379
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,110
She was sick...

380
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,670
I wonder what ailment?

381
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,400
Check for her illness.

382
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,700
They usually miss school
when it's contagious.

383
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,470
Yes, sir.

384
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,690
You draw well.

385
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,390
Around this time of the year?

386
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,130
In the patient's diary,

387
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,350
it said that his daughter
missed school due to an illness.

388
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,670
- Oh, she had chickenpox.
- Chickenpox?

389
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,710
Even if the wind blows,

390
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,080
it hurts as if I'm being knifed.

391
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,580
No way...

392
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,150
What's the matter?

393
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,360
My apologies. Please excuse me.

394
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,470
Doctor.

395
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,880
His skin feels as if he's being knifed,
it burns, and it stings.

396
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,650
What if his physical pain
symptoms are...

397
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,510
due to the chickenpox virus left in
his nerve cells being reactivated?

398
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,220
- Shingles?
- Yes.

399
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,390
His daughter had
chickenpox a year ago.

400
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:39,230
Around the same time
his left chest pain started.

401
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,050
Shingles itself is not contagious,

402
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,410
but if the child wasn't infected
with chickenpox at the time,

403
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,570
she could've contracted
it from her dad.

404
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,460
But...

405
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,590
his skin didn't show
any abnormalities.

406
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,110
Aside from that,

407
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,620
all symptoms are right on.

408
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,590
Zoster sine herpete.

409
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,980
Shingles without a rash?

410
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,550
Patient Choi Seung Won...

411
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,820
Since he doesn't have
concrete symptoms,

412
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,340
early diagnosis is hard,
and his neuralgia persists.

413
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,500
This patient...

414
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,950
is in the OR?

415
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,400
Take a deep breath.

416
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,950
We'll administer
120 milligrams of Propofol.

417
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,050
We'll give you a sleep aid.

418
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,750
You can just sleep.

419
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,090
Please wait!

420
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,960
Don't administer that.

421
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,090
What do you think you're doing?

422
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,540
My apologies, Doctor.

423
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,680
There's an examination
we must conduct.

424
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,660
Doctor, we have Ki Seok's results.

425
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,800
His MRI is fine.

426
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,900
We had the Radiology examine it.

427
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,350
With the same results.

428
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,960

What about the spinal fluid
and the urine test?

431
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,560

- Auditory hallucinations.
- Yes, that's it.

477
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,830
What's important here is

478
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,590
being able to see and
hear when you can't,

and hearing because you aren't able.

481
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,360
The brain always wants
to receive neuro signals,

482
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,080
but when they stop, it creates its own.

Auditory hallucinations are
for the hearing impaired.

for a long time,

489
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,520

nerve transmissions before,

his neurocepters which were
waiting for transmissions

491
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:44,680
would create their own
transmissions all of a sudden,
