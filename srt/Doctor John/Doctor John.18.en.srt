1
00:00:00,896 --> 00:00:03,166
I'm reporter Ahn Seung Hyun
from Social Times.

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,916
We met briefly yesterday.

3
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:05,996
Not sure if you remember.

4
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:07,686
Your thoughts on being
reinstated after

5
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:09,326
Myeongwon University Hospital's
euthanasia incident?

6
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,106
Oh, yes.

7
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:18,076
This is a restricted area.
How did you get in?

8
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:19,176
I see.

9
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:20,346
Is that right?

10
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:22,786
I wanted to hear something,
so I was waiting.

11
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:25,526
Can I please have
a minute of your time?

12
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,626
I only give official interviews.

13
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:30,966
The exit is over there.

00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,496
The reporter.

19
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,016
The reporter is coming.

20
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,966
- The reporter?
- The reporter...

21
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,406
Dr. Cha.

22
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:24,706

Doctor.

27
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:04,936
He has a high fever
and is unconscious.

28
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:06,076
Any other symptoms?

29
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:07,436
Such as abdominal pain or vomiting?

30
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:08,466
We're not sure.

31
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,076
Please examine him first.

32
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,146
I understand.

33
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:12,476
Show them inside.

34
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:14,376
- Conduct a blood test first.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:15,786
Please run a brain CT, too.

36
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:18,066
CT, too?

37
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:21,206
He could've hit something as he fell.

38
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:22,466
I understand.

39
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,906
Let's show you in first.

40
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:24,826
Come this way.

41
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:43,416
He called in sick recently...

42
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,156
I wonder if he's really ill.

43
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:49,896
So why did you want to come
to a different hospital?

44
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:56,176
People may start talking at our hospital.

45
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,716
That's true.

46
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,126
The examination is over.

47
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:05,446
We'll give you the results if you wait.

48
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:06,326
Okay.

49
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,266
Let me go make a phone call.

50
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,396
Pardon?

51
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:36,026
I was heading to
my mom's restaurant.

52
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:37,746
I'll let her know I'll be late.

For your help.

00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,506
As if you're the only one
who's worried?

57
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:49,996
I worry about Dr. Cha, too.

58
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:43,736
Dr. Cha.

59
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:52,056
We're in the ER.

60
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:53,856
How do you feel?

61
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:57,516
You fainted in front of the
first-floor emergency exit.

62
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:58,976
Do you remember?

63
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:00,396
What about the reporter?

64
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:01,946
For now...

65
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:04,216
he didn't see us since we hid.

66
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:10,216
Sir, you're awake now.

67
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,616
How are you feeling?

68
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,866
- I'm okay.
- That's good.

69
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,346
Well, the test results are out.

70
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:17,896
- Nothing out of the...
- Pardon me.

72
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,646

73

CT?

74
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,416
You requested a CT?

75
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,686
- Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Pardon?

76
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,376
Oh, yes.

77
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:47,996
You can leave after
you finish the IV.

78
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:49,276
Thank you.

79
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:54,936
Why?

80
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:56,286
Let's leave.

81
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:58,916
No, you must rest more.

82
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,856
Dr. Cha.

83
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,966
Are you all right?

84

Yes, I'm okay.

85
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:06,296
But how did you...

86
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:09,606
Dr. Kang called me saying
you had collapsed.

87
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,386
Wait, you're leaving already?

88
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:16,746
Where is the car?

89
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,236
Will you really be okay?

90
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:27,946
You have a presentation
tomorrow, too.

91
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:29,556
I'm fine.

92
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:31,686
All will go according to schedule.

93
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:55,496
Thank you, guys. Go on home.

94
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:57,306
Will you be okay by yourself?

95
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:59,106
Shall I pick you up in the morning?

96
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,366
Why?

97
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:01,776
I'll see you at the conference.

98
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,176
I'm sorry to keep nagging,

99
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,726
but you shouldn't drive for a while.

100
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:08,816
- You know that, right?
- Yes, I'll take a taxi.

101
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,846
Will he really be okay?

102
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,166
Aigoo...

There's ringing in my ears
and some dizziness.

115

Ringing in your ears?

116
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:01,456
Yes.

117
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:03,146
Go to the hospital and get examined.

118
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:04,726

00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:07,026
- Yes.
- Go tomorrow then.

120
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:10,726
Cancel the presentation
and go to the hospital first.

121
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:12,266
I'll take care of it.

122
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:13,696
You'll go, right?

123
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,246
You'll get an examination?

124
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:17,376
I said I'll take care of it.

125
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,276
What if you collapse again?

126
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:24,126
What if I wasn't the one
who found you earlier...

127
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:26,616
That must never happen, but...

128
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:28,976
what if this does happen again?

129
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:31,936
Someone else finding
you is one problem.

130
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:34,516
But no one finding you is even worse.

131
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,116
Just thinking about it...

132
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:40,316
At the ER earlier,

133
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:41,736
they asked where you hurt

134
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:44,376
and what your symptoms were.

135
00:11:44,376 --> 00:11:47,346
But I couldn't answer anything.

136
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:51,276
Even if I were conscious,
it would've been the same.

137
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:54,196
That's my illness.

138
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:55,516
That's why.

139

I'll help you.

140
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,956
You're endlessly monitoring
your body which won't talk

141
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:04,616
and must hide that fact as well.

You're too serious.

146
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,396
It's nothing to fuss over.

147

is not a curse.

Everyone gets sick with

I'm not saying you're different.

But you won't be able to
detect the symptoms.

159
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,056

In contrary, it numbs your senses

When patients grow teeth, they bite

♫ You were going through your life,
there was time to play ♫

334
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:33,566
♫ Yesterday ♫

335
00:26:35,616 --> 00:26:38,766

337
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:43,466
Prosecutor, I think today is the day.

338
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:46,726
The day which you spoke of.

339
00:26:46,726 --> 00:26:48,096
What?

340
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:49,666
Patient Yu Ri Hye...

341
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,596
What about Ms. Yu Ri Hye?

342
00:26:51,596 --> 00:26:53,186
Please don't do this.

343
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:54,896
So I could be free from this disease,

344
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:58,286
shouldn't you let me do what I want?

345
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:05,166
How much time do I have left...

346
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:07,456
as a doctor?

347
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:10,676
I don't think much longer.

348
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:16,406
♫ Oh, did you, did you, did you know
that yesterday ♫

349
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:18,706
♫ You’d lose that light ♫
