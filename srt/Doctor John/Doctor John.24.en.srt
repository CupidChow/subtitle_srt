His brain CT shows no abnormalities.

His temperature won't drop
even with the medication.

181

Couldn't the seizures be
a febrile fit due to the fever?

but the pneumonia is advancing.

209

We gave him 5ml of Ancef.

We may have to get him
on a ventilator soon.

No.

Nothing out of the ordinary.

He didn't travel, either.

Antibiotics and fever
reducers are not working.

Ma'am.

Sure.

Okay, go ahead and take a look.

Yes.

00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,580
He didn't before.

236
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,850
But he wanted a personal
trainer during his vacation.

237
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,110
Ki Seok measured his weight, body fat,
and muscle mass every day.

238
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,680
He analyzed himself.

239
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,520
At his weight, the body fat and muscle
mass are below average.

240
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,580
It couldn't have been to lose weight.

241
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,180
Maybe he was increasing
muscle mass?

242
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,430
That's a possibility.

Steroids.

244
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,640
Perhaps it's because of steroids?

245

In order to bulk up their muscles,

246
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,740
some people get illegal
steroids shots and work out.

247

As a side effect, the
immune system collapsed...

Unlike the regular steroids,

251

anabolic steroids which
increase muscle mass

252

don't repress the immune system.

In his confusion, he injected
the regular steroids?

He's unable to feel pain.

their heart rate changes,

we won't know unless it
shows up on the surface.

333
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,860
He has to be really careful.

334
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,640
When we're at the hospital,

335
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,630
so that he won't suffer
an infection, they always....

336
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,780
prescribed antibiotics.

337
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,660
Tell me what you said earlier.

338
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,290
Cha Yo Han took antibiotics often?

339
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,350
Yes.

340
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,950
His source was a drug
dealer who knew his meds.

341
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,940
He said there was something quite strange.

342
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,370
Something strange?

343
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,620
If he took antibiotics like that,

344
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,040
it means he got injured
or infections often.

345
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,640
If that's the case, they must
be taken with other meds.

346
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,510
But he didn't.

347
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,970
We've never...

348
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,930
been prescribed painkillers.

349
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,030
He doesn't need them.

350
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,230
He doesn't feel pain, regardless.

351
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,390
- Could it be...
- Yes.

352
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,970
Painkillers.

353
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,280
Cha Yo Han has an illness.

354
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,470
The same disease as that patient.

355
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,810
I have CIPA.

356
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,990
I suffer from congenital insensitive
to pain with anhidrosis.

357
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,150
Cha Yo Han has been
putting on a show.

358
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,120
How can a CIPA patient

359
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,770
know of pain and
treat the patients?

360
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,120
I'll report him myself.

361
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,550
Cha Yo Han.

362
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,000
We'll connect the ventilator.

What on earth?

390
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,640
Dr. Kang, is it true?

What is?

Dr. Cha.

Why did you do that

I didn't think you'd do it.

Are you moved by
Cha Yo Han or something?

Is the post on our
hospital website true?

397
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,820
That you're a CIPA patient
who's unable to feel pain.
