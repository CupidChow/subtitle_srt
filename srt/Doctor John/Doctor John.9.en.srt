1
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,240
I had an interview yesterday.

2
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,770
When asked why one
becomes a doctor,

3
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,670
all sorts of answers ensue.

4
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,000
Shi Young, do you
remember what you said?

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm sure I said something mushy.

6
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,030
In all honesty, no answers
are needed for novices.

7
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,950
You're just getting started.
How would you answer that?

8
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,420
So why do they ask?

9
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,200
They always ask during interviews.

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
"Why did you become
a doctor?" question.

11
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,230
You guys do it as well.

12
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,390
That "I became a doctor
to save lives" answer.

13
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,570
I did become one to save lives.

14
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,460
But it's problematic because I can't
save everyone because I want to.

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,800
Saving everyone...

16
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,760
A way for doctors to
never kill their patients...

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,360
There is one.

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,520
A way for them to never,
ever kill the patients.

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,410
- What is it?
- Do you want to know?

20
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,380
Yes.

21
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,570
Let's talk when we get up there.

22
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,020
We're almost there.

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,700
What on earth?

24
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,520
Dad!

25
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,570
Dad!

26
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,790
Dad!

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,800
Dad!

28
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,940
Dad!

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,230
Dad.

30
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,700
Dad!

31
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,120
Dad...

32
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,310
Dad.

33
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,200
Dad.

34
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Dad...

35
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,530
Dad.

36
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,180
Hello?

37
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,150
Yes, we're in the northern
Sumoon Mountains.

38
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,500
It's a falling accident.

39
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,770
Hello, hello?

40
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,060
Hello?

41
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,690
Hello?

42
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,630
Hello? Yes, I can hear you.

43
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,190
Yes, northern Sumoon Mountains.
A falling accident.

44
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Please hurry.

45
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,300
Dad. They'll be here soon,
so stay with me.

46
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,300
Hang on just a little longer.

47
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,610
Okay, let's go.

48
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,290
Stop.

49
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,870
You can stop. Please.

50
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,240
- We have to go.
- Let's wait.

51
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,940
- We must go!
- Let's wait.

52
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,590
They'll come.

53
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,150
911.

54
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,740
No, they won't.

55
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,000
No one is coming.

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,900
I couldn't connect to 911
to report this.

57
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,050
Then what will...

58
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,510
I thought someone would show up.

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,300
That someone will pass by.

60
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,740
So Dad...

61
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,790
we have to go.

62
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go.

63
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,780
Dad.

64
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,570
Dad!

65
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,600
It hurts.

66
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,850
It hurts...

67
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,760
too much.

68
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,300
This news just in.

69
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,070
The police are searching for the reported
falling accident in Sumoon Mountains...

70
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,140
Dad.

71
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,820
I think Mom reported it.

72
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,050
but they're having difficulties.

73
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,700
Due to the strong
winds and blizzard,

74
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,980
the police have decided
to halt the search...

75
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,920
When the weather clears up
and it turns better,

76
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,370
they'll be resuming the search.

77
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,100
Onto our next news.

78
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,810
Shi Young.

79
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,260
Yes, Dad.

80
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,000
What time is it?

81
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
It's 6:20 p.m.

82
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,920
Until...

83
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,460
the daybreak...

84
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,260
we have 12 hours.

85
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,400
In my current state...

86
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,440
I don't think I could last an hour.

87
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,200
- Dad...
- Hypothermia...

88
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,100
Shock from blood loss.

89
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,300
Shi Young.

90
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,100
You...

91
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,100
are a doctor.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Tell me my current state in terms
of pain intensity prediction.

93
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,310
An open fracture.

94
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,700
Pelvic bone fracture.

95
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,000
Massive bleeding and hemorrhaging.

96
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,190
This means...

97
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,400
VAS... 6, 8...
[ VAS: Visual Analogue Scale ]

98
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,440
9...

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
10.

100
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,320
Right?

101
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,200
Theoretically...

102
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,800
and clinically...

103
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,700
that's what is taught.

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
But...

105
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,480
it's wrong.

106
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,380
That's not the case.

107
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,900
The pain level a human feels...

108
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,930
at its peak...

109
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,630
is when one...

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,600
loses hope of recovery.

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
Take...

112
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,700
your hands off.

113
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,740
No.

114
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,050
Don't.

115
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,500
Do it.

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,100
You're not killing me.

117
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,900
You're putting me at ease.

118
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,250
The way for a doctor to never, ever...

119
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,950
kill a patient...

120
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,710
Yes.

121
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,250
It is to...

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,500
see only...

123
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,200
patients who won't die.

124
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
That is the only way.

125
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,100
Remove...

126
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,400
your hands.

127
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,500
Do it.

128
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,900
Dad.

129
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,450
Dad!

130
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,480
Dad!

131
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Dad...

132
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,410
Dad!

133
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,900
Please stop.

134
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Dad is in a lot of pain.

135
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,640
What are you doing?
Why did you stop?

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,700
- Mi Rae...
- No!

137
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,200
One, two, three, four...

138
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,400
Why did you say to stop?

139
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,310
Once isn't enough?

140
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,390
You'll kill Dad twice?

141
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,550
Mi Rae...

142
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,310
All right.

143
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Everyone, please vacate the room.

144
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,060
They'll discuss extending
the Chairman's life, correct?

145
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,080
Truthfully, it should've
been done sooner,

146
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,220
but there's the inheritance
and successor issue.

147
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,790
It's complicated.

148
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,720
The board of directors
must comply as well.

149
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,300
I suppose so.

150
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,430
Shi Young, what are you thinking?

151
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,640
Could you possibly be...

152
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,860
We know of your dad's pain.

153
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,430
But due to a small reaction
in his brainwaves...

154
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,990
he's not brain dead.

155
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,300
However, his chances
of recovery are nil.

156
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,860
Mom...

157
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,830
So...

158
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
you want to remove the respirator?

159
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,700
No, I don't want to.

160
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,800
No way, never.

161
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,190
Why did you stop her?

162
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,130
His heartbeat is back,
so why did you stop her?

163
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,810
Because Dad is not back.

164
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,140
I...

165
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,450
want Dad alive, even though
he's not the same as before.

166
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,810
Even though he's lying here...

167
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,500
I want him to stay with us.

168
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,030
He's still so warm...

169
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,770
Doesn't this mean anything?

170
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,700
I can feel him and touch him.

171
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,830
Yes.

172
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Dad feels everything, too.

173
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,600
Your hands...

174
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,600
your warmth...

175
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
and the pain, too.

176
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,770
If we are...

177
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,500
only extending Dad's pain
and not his life...

178
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,200
are we doing it for his sake?

179
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,580
You're not speaking for Dad's sake...

180
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,200
Isn't it for your own peace?

181
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,040
It's hard to watch Dad in this state,

182
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,760
and even if he wakes up
but is not his old self...

183
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,830
then it'll be even harder
for you to watch.

184
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,600
I'll never let Dad go.

185
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,330
What will happen then, Director?

186
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,780
What do you mean?

187
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,680
The prolongation
of the Chairman's life.

188
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,950
It's the first time being discussed.

189
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,890
If his family is willing
to lead the way...

190
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,910
Hey, now. What's the rush?

191
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,760
Just because his family consents,

192
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
we can't simply end
prolonging his life.

193
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,410
That is true.

194
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,900
It's difficult to rule the
Chairman as being brain dead.

195
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,300
It'll depend on Chief Min's decision.

196
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,400
Even if she decides to
end the prolongation...

197
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,680
if legal issues arise,
then we could go to court.

198
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,110
To some, I'm...

199
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,800
one who shouldn't be a doctor again.

200
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,950
But to me...

201
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,400
my patients are more important
than what they think.

202
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,800
I hope you feel the same, too.

203
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,710
Yes.

[ Episode 5: 21 grams, the weight of a soul ]

207
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,200
Are you ready to order?

208
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,900
Two Ivalas,

209
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,220
and a cake, too.

210
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,570
The sweetest one.

211
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,490
Ivala?

212
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,900
It's ice vanilla latte.

213
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,800
She knows even less than I do.

214
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,060
I'm going upstairs.

215
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,430
Sit down.

216
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,350
Eat, drink, then go.

217
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,240
Please calm yourself.

218
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,670
Aunt, do you think I'm
being emotional here?

219
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,300
You're not being emotional?

220
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
You use logic when
it's about your dad?

221
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,410
You look angry right now.

222
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,630
But I know you're not.

223
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,410
You're suffering

224
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,680
not because you're
furious with Shi Young,

225
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,590
but due to the fear
of losing your dad.

226
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,500
Are you okay?

227
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,520
All right! Life is tough and hard!

228
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,740
Let's recharge with
caffeine and get started!

229
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,300
One, two, three!

230
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,910
Americano!

231
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,800
- Thank you, Dr. Lee.
- Thank you, sir.

232
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,700
You need sugar!

233
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,890
You need sugar.

234
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,400
I already had some.

235
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,400
The Chairman's case is
a bit complicated.

236
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,960
You'll need the family's consent,

237
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,600
plus the hospital ethics committee
might want a discussion.

238
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,640
A brainwave test will rule
that he's not brain dead.

239
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,090
So if you remove the respirator,

240
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,250
that'll be...

241
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,080
It won't be a legal cease
of the prolongation process,

242
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,200
but will be considered
a death-with-dignity.

243
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,670
Chief, are you seriously considering

244
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,300
a death-with-dignity
for the Chairman?

245
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
Welcome.

246
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,570
For the culprit who killed
the elder, stole the jewelry,

247
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,480
and charged with robbery and murder,

248
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,670
the prosecution demanded
a life sentence rather than

249
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,160
a death penalty, causing a stir.

250
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,350
A robbery resulting in murder is given
a life sentence or the death penalty.

251
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,060
However, Prosecutor Son Seok Ki
of the Seoul Nambu District Office

252
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,320
demanded life sentence
during today's hearing.

253
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,920
The victim's family is
strongly protesting it.

254
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,850
Your thoughts on the opinion that
say prosecution's demand is weak?

255
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,840
Any words for the victim's family?

256
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
What are your thoughts
on this controversy?

257
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,110
At the Amnesty International,
the Republic of Korea

258
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,060
was designated as a nation that
abolished the death penalty.

259
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,210
The Ministry of Justice hasn't enforced
the death penalty in over 20 years.

260
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,720
So for us to sentence
a death penalty despite that

261
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,220
would be a waste of
prosecutorial authority.

262
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,880
If the death penalty is abolished,

263
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,590
they say the heightened awareness
against violent crimes would be lessened.

264
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,080
What are your thoughts?

265
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,200
A murder is a murder,
but so is the death penalty.

266
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,710
All acts which rob
human lives is murder.

267
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,700
There are no exceptions here.

268
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,000
I won't...

269
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,500
repay a murder with murder.

270
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,840
It's identical to

271
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,910
his closing argument against
Cha Yo Han three years ago.

272
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,110
Wait, this part is different.

273
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,800
"A murder is a murder,
but so is euthanasia."

274
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,070
A patient is near death
with no hope of recovery.
[ 3 years go - Yoon Sung Gyu trial ]

275
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Thus meaningless life prolongation can
intrude on his right to a death-with-dignity.

276
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,800
Yes, defendant Cha Yo Han has halted
such a meaningless prolongation.

277
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,140
However, the Constitutional Laws
state the fundamental rights,

278
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,540
and the most basic of them all...

279
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,580
is the right to life.

280
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,500
Cha Yo Han administered
a lethal dose of painkillers to

281
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,660
Yoon Sung Gyu and violated
his fundamental rights.

282
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,060
Yes, his right to life.

283
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,770
One possesses dignity, worth,
and any rights, only while alive.

284
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,730
What do dignity, worth, and
any rights matter post mortem?

285
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,610
Protecting the patient's
dignity after killing him?

286
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,500
A doctor's duty...

287
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,400
is to...

288
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,300
save the patient.

289
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,710
No doctor should state
he did his duty after

290
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,910
murdering his patient.
There's no one like that.

291
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,030
There shouldn't be.

292
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,380
Whether it was illness, accidental...

293
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,200
or euthanasia.

294
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,100
Did he ever visit?

295
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,160
Perhaps he already did.

296
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,050
The protesters from yesterday.

297
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,950
Who do you think is behind them?

298
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,220
- Is it cooled down?
- Yes.

299
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,780
You asked us to cool it down.

300
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,000
Thank you.

301
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
Your eating habits are something.

302
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,720
You heard about the
Chairman today, right?

303
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,000
Chief inquired regarding
Chairman's death-with-dignity.

304
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,070
From what I can see,
it'll be a big controversy.

305
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,260
It can even end up in court.

306
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,140
If Chairman's
death-with-dignity is executed...

307
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Prosecutor Son Seok Ki
won't let it slide.

308
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,150
And?

309
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,470
You know how persistent he is.

310
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,580
He had no clue about
the medical field at first,

311
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,000
then he shows up
two weeks later well informed...

312
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,090
and named all the medication and
how many milligrams of what was in it.

313
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,700
What are you trying to say?

314
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,170
Hansae Hospital.

315
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,780
You're stationed there

316
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,100
and Chairman is your
team member's father.

317
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,690
The death-with-dignity, related to
Dr. Cha's resident.

318
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,510
Plus the two of you knew
each other in prison.

319
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,680
Even though you had zero influence,

320
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,440
he'll tie it together.

321
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,150
Be careful. So you
don't get sucked in.

322
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,390
You should still watch your back.

323
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,480
How should I be careful?

324
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,200
For now, look the other way
regarding the Chairman.

325
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,700
Don't give any advice and...

326
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,000

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,700
I think it is.

502
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,690
Is this our floor?

503
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,250
We can't go home today?

504
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,800
I have to go home.

505
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,140
What is this?

506
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,110
I have to go home. What is this?

507
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,350
Heo Joon?

508
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,440
Doctor, your name is Heo Joon?

509
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,310
Yes, it is.

510
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,690
Goodness! You must be it.

511
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,250
The doctor who's a master healer.

512
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,620
My goodness! This is the man.

513
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,780
Even his name is "Heo Joon."

514
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,810
Heo Joon.

515
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,620
Goodness, Doctor!

516
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,360
Everyone, everyone, please be quiet.

517
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,810
Please look this way.

518
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,450
Step this way.

519
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,630
Where are you going?

520
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,110
- No, no, no, no!
- But Doctor!

521
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,340
Why are you doing this?

522
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,700
No, no, ma'am. Please stop!

523
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,830
No, no, I'm not the guy.

524
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,210
Why are you doing this?

525
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,690
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, please stop!

526
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,590
Ma'am, please, really...

527
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,400
- No, no, no, why gang up on me?
- Please Doctor!

528
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,430
Ma'am, sir! Please...

529
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,600
No, no, it's not me...
