Okay.

Is that the treatment?

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,980
I won't be able to feel again.
How is that treatment?

7

You said this one doctor said

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,770
that I'm like a ticking bomb
that can explode at any time.

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,860
That's why patients like me don't
live for more than 20 years.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,110
Then I have three years left.

00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,290
help to the Chairman's
situation. I'm worried.

169
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,120
In what way?

170
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,810
As you know, death-with-dignity
and euthanasia are sensitive topics.

171
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,120
If we halt Chairman's
life prolongation,

172
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,030
there will be much controversy.

173
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,820
If we add Dr. Cha to the mix,

174
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,560
our hospital will appear
as if we're pro-euthanasia.

175
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
I'm not too worried.

176
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,260
The society's views on euthanasia and
death-with-dignity are changing as well.

177
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,840
Dr. Cha in his current state

178
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,340
may be of help to our hospital.

179
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,680
What do you mean by "help"?

180
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,920
Well...

181
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,410
I'm not sure of the details yet.

182
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,850
All right, our beer bombs are ready!

183
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,140
Pigs' feet are here!

184
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,150
- Yes!
- Nice!

185
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,340
Spicy noodles and dumplings
are on the house!

186
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,650
- Mother, this way, this way.
- Enjoy your meal.

187
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,630
Mother, give it to me.
Over here, Mother.

188
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,780
Mother, isn't this too much?

189
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,610
Don't worry, and please eat a lot.

190
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,320
I'll take it out of
my son's paycheck,

191
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,970
Okay!

192
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,150
- Tell me if you need anything.
- Yes, ma'am!

193
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,060
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you!

194
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,230
- Okay, our Dr. Cha.
- I'll pass.

195
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,970
You don't drink?

196
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,470
No.

197
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,320
Do you attend church?

198
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,960
Were you John (Yo Han) the Baptist?

199
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,860
Nope.

200
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,120
That's right. I was curious.

201
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,710
If that's not your baptized
name, what does it mean?

202
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,170
Yo stands for a healer,

203
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,260
Han stands for enjoyment.

204
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,830
Whoa. Enjoy being a healer?

205
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,550
Who gave you that name?

206
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,660
- A famous fortune-teller?
- My dad.

207
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,550
- Wow...
- He really wanted you to be a doctor.

208
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,320
He's had you pegged since birth.

209
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,020
Now, now, now, now!

210
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,540
You should enjoy yourself.

211
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,480
- You won't die from this.
- Nope.

212
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,880
Geez...

213
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,450
But still, Dr. Cha...

214
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,890
I'll...

215
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,180
drink it instead.

216
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,300
Wow, a black-rose!

217
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,630
Okay, let's drink up!

218
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,460
All right!

219
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,930
AnesthPain, AnesthPain, fighting!

220
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,300
- All right!
- Let's drink!

221
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,490
Hey! You're here!

222
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,050
- Hello.
- Hey, Kang Mi Rae.

223
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,080
Hello!

224
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,120
- Have a seat.
- Kang Mi Rae, Kang Mi Rae.

225
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,330
- Cool, cool?
- Sit.

226
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,480
Cool, cool, cool?

227
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,120
Cool, cool, cool.

228
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,430
- What are you doing?
- A black-knight.

229
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,260
If you drink alone,
you'll ruin your insides.

230
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,440
Starting now, Dr. Kang
and I'll trade shots.

231
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,480
Wow, how cool.

232
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,030
So why did you choose the
Department of Pain Medicine?

233
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,930
With your skills, if you'd chosen
Neurology or other internal medicine,

234
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,430
the patients wouldn't need
the Dept. of Pain Medicine.

235
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,480
I agree.

236
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,320
There is a pain-ridden patient
with an unknown cause.

237
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,780
Her acquaintances tell her

238
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,420
to go to this hospital and
see this amazing doctor.

239
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,250
What would that patient do?

240
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,430
She'd go right away.

241
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,200
Nope.

242
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
On the contrary,

243
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,210
she'll keep pushing her
appointment out.

244
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,740
Why?

245
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,430
Because she doesn't trust them?

246
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,510
In fear of not being cured?

247
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,790
You're close.

248
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,140
She's afraid?

249
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,910
Bingo. That's correct.

250
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,320
Because that doctor may
not be able to help as well?

251
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,710
Correct.

252
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,890
She wants to cling onto hope.

253
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,370
That there's a doctor out there...

254
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,470
who can surely cure my illness.

255
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,650
Is that the reason and the goal
you're in the Dept. of Pain Medicine?

256
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,150
To be the final doctor to
prescribe the patient?

257
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,230
It's not a goal but a dream.

258
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,460
Okay! For all of our dreams!

259
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,960
Cheers!

260
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,870
Is euthanasia...

261
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,920
a form of "final prescription?"

262
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,610
I have a question for you, Dr. Cha.

263
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,630
Yoon Sung Gyu...

264
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,040
I heard he was
borderline unconscious.

265
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,370
How were you so sure?

266
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,310
That he wanted to die and
at the moment of his death...

267
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,400
he wouldn't have any regrets?

268
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,620
How were you so sure?

269
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,910
Yoon Sang Gyu.

270
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,600
No...

271
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,620
Yoon Sang Gyu!

272
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,150
Yoon Sang Gyu.

273
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,840
If he can get well,

274
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,870
of course, he must endure it.

275
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,200
But...

276
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,520
no matter how much he endures it...

277
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,260
he won't get well.

278
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,110
Dr. Kang Mi Rae...

279
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,880
why did you become a doctor?

280
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,520
To save lives.

281
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,710
I'll never give up on a patient...

282
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,200
and save them somehow.

283
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,880
You'll save them...

284
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,190
I failed to save Yoon Sang Gyu.

285
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,300
But that doesn't mean
a doctor's duty ends.

286
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,620
When the patient is unconscious...

287
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,030
When even the equipment isn't
able to measure his pain...

288
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,200
I believe that's the moment a doctor

289
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,320
must do his duty.

290
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,820
And one of those duties is
removing the respirator?

291
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,970
Dr. Cha, you see no wrong in that.

292
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,630
Dr. Kang Mi Rae, I...

293
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,590
don't think euthanasia
is the answer to all.

294
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,660
It's a necessity at times.

295
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,330
For those who are skilled as you...

296
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,610
would know when to
differentiate the situation.

297
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,450
We're not there yet.

298
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,500
So don't go brainwashing
a newbie doctor.

299
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,770
Making an irreversible mistake
due to misjudgment...

300
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,130
should be a one-time-only deal.

301
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,050
I ask of you, Dr. Cha.

302
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,980
I'll get going first.

303
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,370
My apologies.

304
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,240
Mi Rae.

305
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,850
I'm nervous about you.

306
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,150
You're always unpredictable.

307
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,420
Then you caused trouble.

308
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,230
I have no idea what you'll do next.

309
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,270
Mi Rae...

310
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,730
- Regarding Dad...
- It's more nerve-wracking...

311
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,260
that someone like
Dr. Cha is by your side.

312
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,350
Are you okay?

313
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,260
What about Dr. Cha?

314
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,050
He just left. He has
some work to do.

315
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,920
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

316
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,290
See you all tomorrow.

317
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,440
Goodnight!

318
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,280
♫ I can't see no matter how I try ♫

319
