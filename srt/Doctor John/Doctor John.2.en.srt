- Of course, you'll feel that, but...
- I said this already, but...

I feel heavy hearted.

302

Enough to think about dying.

Will you really send her off?

All this time...

311
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:17,734
I ignored Shi Young not because
it was hard to see her.

312
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:28,894
It couldn't be helped.

313
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,534
Just accept it.

314
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:34,574
Get up again.

315
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:39,464
Normally, I would've
scolded and yelled at her...

316
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:42,814
but I couldn't.

317
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,674
When Shi Young
crumpled to the floor...

318
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:53,194
I accepted it.

319
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:58,634
Shi Young said she
wants to try again.

320
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:01,564
She said she really wants to...

321
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:04,924
and maybe she'll do well.

322
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:06,844
She said that?

323
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:07,974
Yes.

324
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:10,994
But...

325
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:13,214
she wants to start again, but...

326
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:15,004
She doesn't deserve to?

327
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,644
What about 5353?

328
00:21:43,644 --> 00:21:46,264
Come on. He's a player.

329
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,324
He's an expert at faking illness.

330
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:51,884
- Did his fever go down?
- Yes, yes.

331
00:21:51,884 --> 00:21:54,214
Since it went down, I sent him up.

332
00:21:57,544 --> 00:22:00,114
Officer.

333
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:04,544
If he gets feverish again or
has any other symptoms...

334
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,124
please don't ignore it.
Send him to an outside hospital,

335
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:08,774
and get him a thorough exam.

336
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:10,464
A thorough exam?

337
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:12,804
Yes, I ask of you.

338
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:18,844
Aigoo, feels cool.
The food's here, let's eat.

339
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:21,304
- There's meat.
- Hey, let's eat.

340
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:22,804
Hey, let's eat! Wake up.

341
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:24,414
Let's eat.

342
00:22:24,414 --> 00:22:25,984
- Eat with us.
- Give me that.

343
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:27,604
He's not answering.

344
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:28,674
Hey.

345
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:31,164
Hey!

346
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:33,514
- Whoa!
- What's wrong with him?

347
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:38,124
Guard!

348
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,224
Guard!

349
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,524
Guard, please hurry!

350
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:41,694
Guard!

351
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,814
Guard!

352
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:44,254
What's wrong? What's going on?

353
00:22:44,254 --> 00:22:45,954
Here! Over here!

354
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:54,054
What's wrong with him?
Someone do something!

355
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,024
Wait a second.

356
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:26,564
Jung Bo, let me see your eyes.

357
00:23:29,804 --> 00:23:31,634
Where does it hurt, huh?

358
00:23:34,124 --> 00:23:35,804
He's not sweating at all.

359
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:39,944
- I called 911.
- Okay, good.

360
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,044
- No.
- What?

361
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:44,664
This isn't for 911.

362
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,444
What do you mean, it's not for 911?

363
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:48,104
- Kang Shi Young.
- Who?

364
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:50,014
Call Dr. Kang Shi Young. Right now.

365
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:21,004
I'm leaving now.

366
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:44,644
- Open the door.
- Okay!

367
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:47,524
- They're here!
- Move aside.

368
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,474
Where is Dr. Kang Shi Young?

369
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,714
Doctor!

370
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,544
Dr. Kang! Stop, stop!

371
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:09,844
Dr. Kang!

372
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:12,004
Doctor...

373
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,234
Someone's in trouble.

374
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,484
5353. That 5353...

375
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:17,604
Why? How is he?

376
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:18,814
It's not good.

377
00:25:18,814 --> 00:25:21,024
- Let's go quickly, Doctor.
- Aren't you getting in?

378
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:24,734
He needs you in order
for him to live.

379
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,114
- What?
- He said only you can save him.

380
00:25:29,114 --> 00:25:31,384
If not, he'll die!

381
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:32,684
Who said that?

382
00:25:32,684 --> 00:25:33,804
6238.

383
00:25:33,804 --> 00:25:35,624
He said I must bring you.

384
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:40,284
Miss, are you getting in or not?

385
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:55,134
Call Dr. Kang Shi Young,
Dr. Kang Shi Young.

386
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:57,234
You didn't even call her.
What do you mean you can't reach...

387
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:00,774
If she's not coming, go find her!

388
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:08,354
Wait. Just wait!

389
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,754
Move aside, please move aside.

390
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:13,724
Call Dr. Kang Shi Young. Hurry!

391
00:26:13,724 --> 00:26:15,014
But why?

392
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:16,664
Why are you looking for her?

393
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:19,594
Because it's something
she must do!

394
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:21,134
What is it?

395
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,414
What must I do?

396
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:32,384
Take this patient to the hospital.

397
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,164
- And after that?
- Just do it.

398
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:36,954
And do what over there?

399
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:38,194
You must save the patient.

400
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:40,094
I do?

401
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:42,284
But how?

402
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:45,244
I'll tell you how, so promise me.

403
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:48,144
That you will save this patient.

404
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:51,324
I will...

405
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:53,664
save this patient?

406
00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:55,724
If he dies tonight,

407
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:57,424
it won't be from an illness.

408
00:26:57,424 --> 00:26:59,524
It'll be due to a doctor's negligence.

409
00:27:08,164 --> 00:27:10,304
An illness is a despair to patients,

410
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:12,024
and doctors are their hope.

411
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:13,654
Will you...

412
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:16,754
betray their hope?

413
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,294
To save this patient...

414
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,194
what must I do?

00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:21,854
Starting now,
life or death is not on me.

422
00:28:21,854 --> 00:28:23,504
It's up to you, Dr. Kang Shi Young.

423
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:24,694
- Doctor, are you crazy?
- Pardon?

424
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:26,424
You issued an order based on

425
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:28,624
an ex-doctor who's in
prison right now?

426
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,264
Do you know why he's in prison?

427
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:31,694
What are you saying?

428
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,884
Is that cause for running over here?

429
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:35,344
Cha Yo Han.

430
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:37,314
You illegally issued painkillers,

431
00:28:37,314 --> 00:28:39,384
and sentenced to
three years in prison.

432
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,154
Away with Cha Yo Han!

433
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,154
If Cha Yo Han tries to do what
he did three years ago,

434
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,614
what would you do?

435
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:46,844
Do you even know
what you're trying to do?

436
00:28:46,844 --> 00:28:48,254
Get out, right now!

437
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:49,724
- Who are you?
- Nice to meet you.

438
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,374

439

440
00:28:54,554 --> 00:28:56,174
Wait!

Dr. Cha Yo Han!

443
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:12,684
He had an urgent
canthotomy two days ago.

444
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,994
What are you saying here?

445
00:29:13,994 --> 00:29:17,504
Regardless of the department,
shouldn't we tend to those who are ill?

446
00:29:17,504 --> 00:29:21,604
I'm Cha Yo Han, in charge of
