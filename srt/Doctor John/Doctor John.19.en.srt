171
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,040
Is something the matter?

172
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,350
Well, I don't know the details.

173
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,970
I only heard it's a personal matter.

174
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,270
All right.

175
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,750
Let's call it a day and go out...

176
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,380
for drinks? Cool?

177
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,860
Okay, cool, cool.

178
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,640
Gotcha!

179
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,750
You're seeing someone, huh?

180
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,190
Who is it, who is it, who is it?

181
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,300
I'll get going first.
See you all tomorrow.

182
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,310
She really is seeing someone.

183
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,500
- Right, right?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,570
I'll follow her.

185
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,170
Dr. Heo.

186
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,830
Okay, let's all go out for some beer.

187
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,790
Let's go!

188
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,070
- Go, go, go!
- Let's go.

189
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,500
[ 2019 Anesthesiology and
Pain Medicine Conference ]

190
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,600
Let's eat.

191
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm hungry.

192
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,010
Dr. Cha, I'm outside.

193
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,550
Where should I meet you?

194
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,200
It's freaking delish.

195
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,780
Dr. Lee, how long will you
stay at our hospital?

196
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,990
Well...

197
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,980
I'll hang on until I'm
an assistant professor.

198
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,250
Assistant professor?

199
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,790
Dr. Lee, you were the academic type?

200
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,140
You don't seem like one.

201
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,280
How do I look then?

202
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,840
Well, the one...

203
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,300
who opens up a clinic
and rakes in money?

204
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,480
People live longer these days.

205
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,810
If you open up a clinic,

206
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,460
all the elderly will be lining up...

207
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,270
Please hook me up when you do.

208
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,050
But Dr. Heo, aren't you going
into anesthesiology?

209
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,270
I know.

210
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,240
He says patients in pain depress him.

211
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,800
Well...

212
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,390
after Dr. Cha joined us, Pain Medicine
has become more dynamic.

213
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,370
It's fun learning from
him and rewarding.

214
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,640
There's some of that, too.

215
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,290
It's fun and rewarding?

216
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,650
Wow, that's great.

217
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,430
Geez, whatever.

218
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,490
What are you staring at?

219
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,520
Are you seeing someone?

220
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,350
Dating is off-limits here.

221
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,610
Especially between colleagues.

222
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,670
Who'd date among our department?

223
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,220
That's not it.

224
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,740
Take a look at this.

225
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,960
In the Netherlands, there is the
Ambulance Wish Foundation.

226
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,010
They grant terminal
patients' dying wishes.

227
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,500
I saw this clip, too.

228
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,990
This terminal patient applied
because he had a wish.

229
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,710
He applied and?

230
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,470
He wanted to go to the
beach and eat ice cream.

231
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,190
That's right. It's this patient.

232
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,080
It's so sad.

233
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,950
You'd think a dying wish would
be something grandioso.

234
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,640
But it's so simple.

235
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,380
"I want to visit an art gallery."

236
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,940
"I want to attend my favorite
soccer player's game."

237
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,740
"I want to visit my hometown."

238
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,610
Most of them are simple and ordinary.

239
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,770
Yes.

240
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,220
They must miss their healthy days.

241
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,940
So I was thinking.

242
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,030
We should do this, too.

243
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,930
- Do what?
- For whom?

244
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,100
- For Yu Ri Hye.
- Huh?

245
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,320
I was such a huge fan.

246
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,360
I was happy because of her.

247
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,040
Now she's ill...

248
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,460
and doesn't have much time left.

249
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,970
I'm a doctor now, and
there's nothing I can do.

250
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,130
Man...

251
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,870
I'm tearing up.

252
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,160
Do you guys really mean it?

253
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,940
I don't see why not.

254
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,460
You never know. Maybe we
can do something for her.

255
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,860
- Really?
- Of course!

256
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,250
- I'm in.
- I'm in, too.

257
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,300
- I'm in!
- Right now?

258
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,620
- One, two, three!
- We're in!

259
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,460
Number one, egg mayo.

260
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,540
And number eleven, BBQ chicken.

261
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,640
♫ Something that disappears
without a trace ♫

262
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,170
♫ All I've been doing is thinking ♫

263
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,390
♫ I can't stand that
I keep thinking about it ♫

264
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,380
♫ Unbelievable days of the past ♫

265
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,570
♫ Do what you want ♫

266
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,290
♫ Do what you want ♫

267
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,890
♫ I'm sure everything will get better ♫

268
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:42,690
♫ The more I get to know you,
you warm my heart ♫

269
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,210
♫ We must never try to stop ♫

270
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,640
♫ I can't erase you from
deep inside my heart ♫

271
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,130
Where are we going?

272
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,590
The nearby park?

273
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,720
Let's go.

274
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,260
Wow, it's so pretty.

275
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,650
Bye! I'm going first.

276
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,110
No!

277
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,510
Go this way.

278
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,380
You're overreacting.

279
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,250
Not overreacting. I'm being careful.

280
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,880
It doesn't hurt to be careful.

281
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,770
"Are you a hypochondriac?"

282
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,900
- That's what you used to say.
- Well...

283
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,400
Back then...

284
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,700
I didn't know you very well.

285
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,840
And when did I ever say it
so argumentatively?

286
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,250
What did the doctor say?

287
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,660
Dr. Cha.

288
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,960
He ran a few tests.

289
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,420
He'll call me when the
detailed test results are out.

290
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,240
You got a comprehensive check-up?

291
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,380
Yes.

292
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,900
In case.

293
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,370
That's all?

294
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,410
Yes.

295
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,100
We should eat these somewhere.

296
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,840
You were craving it.

297
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,880
Did you want to be a doctor
since you were young?

298
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,590
No.

299
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,170
Then what did you want to be?

300
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,250
Well...

301
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,880
A comic book store owner.

302
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,020
Comic book store?

303
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,700
When I was little,

304
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,050
we had an attic in our house.

305
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,360
I see.

306
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,120
I'd stay up there and
read comic books.

307
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,970
I'd feel so relaxed.

308
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,820
As if I was in another world.

309
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,110
It suits you.

310
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,610
What would've suited me?

311
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,530
I can't picture it.

312
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,910
No matter what I picture...

313
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,770
I can't see you without
your doctor's robe.

314
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,080
Is that right?

315
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,740
But why?

316
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,070
Just because.

317
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,550
I did think I may not be able to
work as a doctor someday.

318
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,150
If I quit,

319
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,700
I haven't thought about
what I'll do after.

320
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,320
You'll be quitting?

321
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,140
You're not, right?

322
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,360
I'm just saying.

323
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,210
If something happens...

324
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,270
you must tell me.

325
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,810
Okay?

326
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,160
Yes, I promise.

327
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,420
Dr. Cha...

328
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,160
I don't think you can have
other professions.

329
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,710
Why not?

330
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,900
If you have a regular job,

331
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,930
they'd stiff your pay.

332
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,520
If you run a business, you'd be lied to.

333
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,210
If you do retail, you'd go bankrupt.

334
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,180
Is that a compliment or an insult?

335
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,490
