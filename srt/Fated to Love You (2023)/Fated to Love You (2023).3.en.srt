[Fated to Love You]

2
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,060
[Episode 3]

3
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,847
Come, let's keep drinking.

4
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:20,267
Let go of me. Give it to me.

5
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,412
What outsider?

6
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:23,627
It's your own father who is lying in bed!

7
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,488
He only cares for Zhang Yuan Qing and her son.

8
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:29,016
He's never cared about me.

9
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,388
Xiao Ren Yan.

10
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:34,606
The parents have their own difficulties.

11
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:38,037
As their children, if we only consider things from our perspective,

12
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,503
of course, we'd think they're selfish and preferential.

13
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:43,521
There aren't any parents who don't love their children.

14
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:47,260
Perhaps they are hiding their affection too deeply,

15
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,502
so you can't see clearly.

16
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:52,277
Xiao Ren Yan, think it over well.

17
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:58,129
When you were little, didn't your father kiss you or hug you?

18
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,459
Didn't he teach you about studying and behaving?

19
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,280
Even if he is bad in many ways,

20
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,610
given your scandalous reputation these years,

21
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,280
you've still kept your position as the marquis' heir,

22
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,548
who has been supporting you from behind?

23
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,472
Xiao Ren Yan,

24
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:25,735
whatever is making you put on a disguise, I have no idea.

25
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:32,000
- But when you saw the marquis pass out, your anxious gaze couldn't lie.
- You try it.

26
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,760
That kind of gaze,

27
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,463
Meng Han Jiao didn't have it. Xiao Ming didn't have it. Zhang Yuan Qing especially didn't have it.

28
00:04:38,463 --> 00:04:41,158
- That's great.
- Only you, Xiao Ren Yan, had it.

29
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,028
Xiao Ren Yan,

30
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:48,220
in the entire Marquis' Manor, you

31
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,840
are the only one who truly cares about the marquis.

32
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:59,548
That's true.

33
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:02,541
Even if he is bad in many ways,

34
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,130
he is still my father.

35
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,218
Have you thought it through?

36
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,560
Let's go.

37
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
We're going home.

38
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,043
Let's go.

39
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,060
My Lady, I have a little headache.

40
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,660
Are you really drunk?

41
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,200
What do we do?

42
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,230
Why don't you carry me on your back?

43
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,950
Hey...

44
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,060
You're so heavy, Xiao Ren Yan!

45
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,976
Be careful.

46
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
We're almost there.

47
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,340
Be careful. We don't want your stepmother to notice.

48
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,620
Xiao Ren Yan never speaks his true thoughts.

49
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,760
He clearly cares about the Marquis' health,

50
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,320
but he's determined to waste his energy pretending to be unfilial.

51
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,460
Father, I was unfilial.

52
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,100
I'm sorry for angering you.

53
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,340
Zhang Yuan Qing is prone to suspicion.

54
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,860
If I don't put on a disguise even as Xiao Ren Yan,

55
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,760
I won't be able to monitor Zhang Yuan Qing's every movement in secret.

56
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,020
Father, don't worry. I'll defend the Marquis' Manor's reputation.

57
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,120
Xue Fei.

58
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Has His Grace's medicine been brewed?

59
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,080
Orders have been disseminated.

60
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,320
Good.

61
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,920
Remember to brew it with the prescription I gave you.

62
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,900
Only then will His Grace recover.

63
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,480
Yes, Madam.

64
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,636
I'll take a look at his condition.

65
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:49,000
You're dismissed. Make sure no one disturbs us.

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Yes.

67
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,020
Your Grace, you're awake.

68
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,820
Here, have some water.

69
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,160
Your Grace.

70
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,280
Your Grace, you've slept for a day.

71
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,180
I've been worried sick waiting by your side.

72
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,960
Your Grace, don't be agitated.

73
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,660
Yan'er went too far this time.

74
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,740
The imperial physician said that your anger triggered a heart condition.

75
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,300
Yan'er infuriated you to the point that you spat out blood and fainted.

76
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,041
With such a huge commotion,

77
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,640
the Marquis' Manor's reputation will be tainted.

78
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,860
Your Grace, it's best if you present a memorial soon.

79
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,960
Make Ming'er the heir.

80
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,800
That'll preserve the manor's reputation.

81
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,340
I already asked the manor's Chief Secretary to draft it.

82
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,480
You only need to leave your fingerprint.

83
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,621
Come on, Your Grace.
[Memorial]

84
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:15,114
Leave your fingerprint.

85
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,000
Things have already come to this.

86
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,080
Why are you still defending that useless son of yours?

87
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,620
You're sick, but he's getting drunk at brothels.

88
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,720
He's a scum.

89
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,840
How is Ming'er worse than him?

90
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,640
Why is he the heir?

91
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,360
Old fool!

92
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,720
I will tell you the truth.

93
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,681
You're leaving your fingerprint today.

94
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,060
Stamp it down! Do it!

95
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,300
Once you do it, Ming'er will be the heir.

96
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,060
Isn't Xiao Ren Yan just that bitch's son?

97
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,220
Why must Ming'er live in his shadow?

98
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,780
Stamp your fingerprint! Old man!

99
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,080
Damn you!

100
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,260
You ruined the memorial!

101
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,610
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

102
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:34,120
The poison of the Lost Soul Flower is hard to cure,

103
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,744
but it's not incurable.

104
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:39,520
I will find the one who poisoned him.

105
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,060
Even if Father woke up, he wouldn't be able to speak much.

106
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,978
Why did he suddenly sit up?

107
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,220
Something must've gone wrong.

108
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,101
Regardless, we have yet to succeed. Word of this can't spread.

109
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:54,033
Stepmother!

110
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,080
Did you just say that my father woke up?

111
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,780
Why are you two here?

112
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,640
His Highness is here to visit his father.

113
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,500
Father said he doesn't want to see you.

114
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,301
Yet, you're still so devious.

115
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:13,540
You even sneaked out here in the middle of the night.

116
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,740
What's your true motive?

117
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,140
I came to visit Father out of filial piety.

118
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,580
What other motive can I have?

119
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,020
But what about you bunch who've sneaked here in the middle of the night?

120
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,181
Why is that?

121
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:29,100
Ming'er is worried about His Grace's health.

122
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,620
His Grace woke up briefly before fainting again.

123
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,360
It's late. You should return.

124
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,540
Come back during the day.

125
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,240
Stop!

126
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,140
There's blood on your feet.

127
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,020
What did you do?

128
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,020
Is that His Grace's blood?

129
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,820
Ming'er, check on His Grace!

130
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,520
Yes, Mother.

131
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,320
What did you do to His Grace?

132
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,660
Crap.

133
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,120
Don't worry. Leave this to me.

134
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,100
Mother!

135
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,220
Mother, things are bad.

136
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,360
Father is unconscious, and he spat out tons of blood.

137
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,020
These two must've sneaked into his room

138
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,600
and infuriated him again!

139
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,120
You angered His Grace to the point of vomiting blood twice.

140
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,780
Your unfilial behavior is outrageous!

141
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,700
I have to report this to the Imperial Clan Affairs Office.

142
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,660
Stepmother, why did my father vomit blood?

143
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,652
Are you sure you're clueless?

144
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,620
The blood on this handkerchief comes from His Grace.

145
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:56,480
I know.

146
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,180
She's been eyeing my title as the heir for her son,

147
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,380
but she's way too anxious.

148
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,880
This woman is so vicious.

149
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,300
My dad must've been blind.

150
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,320
By the way, what did you do to my father just now?

151
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,580
I sealed all his meridians with a hairpin

152
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,200
so that his blood will circulate slower.

153
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,600
What are you doing now?

154
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:35,500
Does the blood on this handkerchief belong to His Grace?

155
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,340
Yes.

156
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,740
I made two discoveries.

157
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,820
Firstly,

158
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,342
you pretended to be drunk and deceived me.

159
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:52,900
I was a little drunk just now,

160
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,400
but I sobered up after that.

161
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,900
I didn't do it on purpose.

162
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,480
Secondly,

163
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,040
the blood on this handkerchief is black.

164
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,300
It also reeks of a strange smell.

165
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,280
It smells like a poison unique to the Northern Desert.

166
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,380
The Lost Soul Flower.

167
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:16,440
"The Lost Soul Flower"?

168
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,140
Yes.

169
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,020
Great.

170
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,201
The blood on this handkerchief proves where you've been!

171
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:40,101
His Highness and I found this handkerchief by His Grace's bed when we visited him.

172
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:43,701
Take a closer look at who this handkerchief belongs to.

173
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,621
That's an old handkerchief of mine.

174
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:50,480
I must've left it in the room.

175
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,360
I wonder when it got stained with blood.

176
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,760
Don't bother asking!

177
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,980
These two must've plotted to harm Father!

178
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,840
Father is lying on the bed without a scratch.

179
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,200
Go in, and you'll see.

180
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,920
As for the blood, I'm about to provide an explanation.

181
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,940
Which one of you has the best nose?

182
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,640
Me.

183
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,980
Take a good sniff.

184
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,980
What other scent is on this handkerchief

185
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,886
besides the smell of blood?

186
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,540
There's a peculiar fragrance.

187
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,740
That's right.

188
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,640
His Grace vomited blood and fainted

189
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,780
not because he was angry at His Highness,

190
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,520
but because he's been poisoned with the Lost Soul Flower.

191
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,500
What Lost Soul Flower?

192
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,620
I've never heard of that.

193
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,780
The fragrance on this handkerchief is proof.

194
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,801
The imperial physician already said it was a stroke. Why are you so sure that he was poisoned?

195
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,720
Not only do I know that he was poisoned,

196
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,480
but I also know of a cure.

197
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
Is that true?

198
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,143
Marquis of Xuanping's pulse indicates that his heart is inflamed.

199
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,460
His blood flow is smooth.

200
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,987
How could he have been poisoned?

201
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:14,240
A fragrance in the blood?

202
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,580
That must be a fragrance that was already on the handkerchief.

203
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,720
Jing Shu, you're young and a daughter of a respectable family.

204
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,040
You can't possibly know about poisons.

205
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,080
Apologize to the imperial physician at once.

206
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,880
Imperial Physician, your excellent medical skills are admirable.

207
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,100
Medicine is a profound area of study,

208
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,720
My Lady, please refrain from making casual statements in the future.

209
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,920
However, curing an illness is similar to an arduous battle.

210
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,907
If you're so conservative and can't tell right from wrong,

211
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:54,680
you'll be fighting a losing battle during a war.

212
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,180
Preposterous!

213
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,300
You might be proficient in medical herbs,

214
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,453
but how much do you know about the Lost Soul Flower unique to the Nothern Desert?

215
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:04,820
Even the imperial physician is clueless.

216
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,120
How can you possibly know anything?

217
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,760
The Lost Soul Flower comes from the Northern Desert.

218
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,940
It blooms in winter and has a peculiar fragrance.

219
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,380
Medical records state

220
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,540
drying it under the sun and crushing it into powder for consumption

221
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,041
will cause continuous coughing in a person.

222
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,641
They will then vomit blood and faint.

223
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,381
My father did have such symptoms.

224
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:30,380
His Grace's coughs were due to a lung affliction caused by cold air entering his body.

225
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,980
The Lost Soul Flower is an untraceable poison

226
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,361
precisely because its symptoms are similar to a stroke.

227
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,140
It's hard to notice.

228
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,820
If we continue treatment only based on observable symptoms,

229
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,580
His Grace will lose his life.

230
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,921
You claim that His Grace has been poisoned

231
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,880
and promise that you have a cure.

232
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,930
Fine, take out the antidote right away.

233
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,606
I don't have the antidote.

234
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,220
You're just blabbering nonsense!

235
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,960
You want to cover up your scheme of sneaking into my father's room.

236
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,180
Imperial Physician, do you have golden needles for acupuncture?

237
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,080
Of course.

238
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,641
I don't have the antidote,

239
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,941
but I can perform acupuncture to expel the poison.

240
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,281
I've been a physician for twenty-three years.

241
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:23,460
I've never heard about expelling poison through acupuncture.

242
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:26,420
This is a wide world filled with mysteries.

243
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,900
My father hasn't gotten better despite taking so much of your medicine.

244
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,600
Why do we not let Jing Shu try acupuncture?

245
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:38,940
You're truly insolent.

246
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,300
What if acupuncture doesn't work?

247
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,920
Don't worry.

248
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,040
The golden needle poison expulsion is a lost skill passed down in the Liu family's physicians.

249
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,681
Even though I only know a little,

250
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:55,001
I'm confident in expelling the poison in Father's body.

251
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,721
If the acupuncture fails,

252
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:04,360
I'll walk into the Imperial Clan Affairs Office's prison with Liu Jing Shu.

253
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,020
Mother, are you really going to let them mess around?

254
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,960
Don't you want Father's illness to be cured?

255
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,700
I don't believe Liu Jing Shu is that capable!

256
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,420
Jing Shu.

257
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,540
Go on with the acupuncture.

258
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,080
She has such delicate and experienced acupuncture skills.

259
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,340
Is she telling the truth?

260
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,581
Father!

261
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,369
Don't move!

262
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,020
Father!

263
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:06,520
- Great!
- His Grace can't stop vomiting blood!

264
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,839
Did the acupuncture hurt his heart meridian?

265
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,120
Men!

266
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,320
Capture these two scheming rats who tried to kill His Grace!

267
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,214
Lock them up in the Ancestral Hall.

268
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,600
Save it. We can walk there ourselves.

269
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,680
Father.

270
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,380
[Ancestral Hall]

271
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,300
Take a seat.

272
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,240
You can flee.

273
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,100
Why?

274
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,460
Who knows what Zhang Yuan Qing is up to

275
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,300
by locking us up in this Ancestral Hall.

276
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,420
You know martial arts.

277
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,300
How about taking refuge in your home?

278
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,100
Don't worry.

279
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,060
His Grace will be fully recovered in a few days.

280
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,760
Are you sure?

281
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,120
But he vomited so much blood.

282
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,700
Didn't you realize that the blood he vomited was bright red?

283
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,060
Since he's vomiting fresh blood,

284
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,260
that means the poison in his body has been expelled.

285
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,707
As long as he recuperates well, he will recover soon.

286
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:39,407
He will definitely be out of danger.

287
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,200
Sometimes, I really wonder

288
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,940
if you're really the pampered daughter of a rich family.

289
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,900
Aren't you full of surprises, too?

290
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,781
Everyone has their secrets.

291
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,721
Women are just the same as men in this aspect.

292
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,000
Initially, I wanted us to live our separate lives.

293
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,700
Now, I'm growing interested in your secrets.

294
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,240
Why would I tell you my secrets?

295
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,280
You should get some sleep while there's time.

296
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,720
We still have to deal with that old lady tomorrow.

297
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,700
Are you hungry?

298
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,060
Yes.

299
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,785
Wait here.

300
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,420
What a useless stomach.

301
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,500
Why is it acting up now?

302
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,000
Here.

303
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,660
These are offerings for your ancestors!

304
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,107
Besides, I'm too fat.

305
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:08,627
I'm dieting.

306
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,980
We're the descendants my ancestors have to protect.

307
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,060
They won't bear to watch us starve.

308
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,260
When I was really young, my mother always joked with me.

309
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,200
She said she'd get me a fat wife.

310
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,040
If she were still alive,

311
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,640
I bet she'll feed you even more.

312
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,440
Eat up. You aren't fat.

313
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,040
Look! A shooting star!

314
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,920
Wow! It's gorgeous!

[Ancestral Hall]

316
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,560
The floor of the Ancestral Hall is really hard.

317
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,460
You're really a pampered young man. I bet you've never slept on the floor.

318
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,300
Aren't you the spoiled daughter of a general? Have you slept on the floor?

319
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,820
I... definitely haven't!

320
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,260
My shoulders are aching from a night of that.

321
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,281
I'll massage them for you.

322
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:54,580
Men, open the doors.

323
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,080
Yes!

Liu Jing Shu.

325
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,620
You performed acupuncture on the Marquis of Xuangping without permission,

326
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,060
causing his life to be at greater risk.

327
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,480
A grave crime.

328
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,440
An unpardonable sin!

329
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,300
The Marquis' Manor should have you trialed at the Imperial Clan Affairs Office,

330
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,820
but since you're the daughter of the respectable Liu family,

331
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,200
Madam has decided to be gracious with you.

332
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,880
You can stand before this Ancestral Hall

and end your life.

Exactly! Here's what I think.

338
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,431
She should be locked up in the Imperial Clan Affairs Office and punished severely.

339

If you insist on opposing this, you'll be penalized, too!

This isn't Grand Preceptor's Manor.

Has this woman bewitched you?

Why are you still standing there? Get the heir away!

00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,720
His Majesty has heard about the doubts

361
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,860
concerning the Marquis of Xuanping's grave illness and vomiting of blood.

362
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,860
He has specially appointed the heir of King Wei as the investigating censor

363
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,181
to investigate this matter.

364
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:38,441
No mistakes will be allowed. That is all.

365
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,140
What's going on?

366
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
What do you think?

367
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,340
Zhang Yuan Qing is truly troublesome.

368
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,541
I have to ask for help.

369
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,140
Xiao Hui, you have to send this letter to Wei Hong He.

370
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:33,380
Your Highness, there's a letter for you.

371
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,120
Don't bother me. I'm training.

372
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,620
- It's from Liu...
- Boss? Give it to me!

373
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,887
Boss wrote me a letter?

374
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,020
She married Heir Xiao?

375
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,180
No wonder I can't locate her!

376
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,700
No, I have to save her!

377
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,500
Give me the sword.

378
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,040
Give me a lighter sword next time!

379
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,420
Goodness!

380
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,440
Boss, did I make it in time?

381
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,500
Yeah, if you were a second later,

382
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,030
Grand Master Meng would've been strangled to death by Xiao Ren Yan.

383
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,300
Boss, why did you marry Xiao Ren Yan?

384
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,360
Are those rumors about Sister Jing Shu fleeing from marriage true?

385
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,140
My sister didn't flee from the marriage. She went missing.

386
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,680
I married into the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor to look for my sister.

387
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,060
Xiao Ren Yan is notorious for being a playboy in the capital.

388
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,460
Did you already do that with him?

389
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,700
Do what?

390
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,412
That.

391
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:44,940
What's in your head?

392
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,960
Both of us are clean! Got it?

393
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,500
I'll look for Sister Jing Shu with you.

394
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,780
When we find her, we can return to the military.

395
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,580
This puny capital city is so suffocating.

396
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,980
- Okay.
- Oh?

397
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,080
You seem very friendly with Heir Wei.

398
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,140
Heir Wei used to serve under my father.

399
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,223
That's how I know him.

400
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,340
Heir Xiao.

401
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,440
I'm sorry for intruding in your manor.

402
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,280
You're too courteous.

403
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,940
My father is gravely ill.

404
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,200
I'm in charge of everything in the manor.

405
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,780
You just have to report your investigation to me.

406
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,080
There's no need to bother my wife.

407
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,580
How can I do that?

408
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,700
Only Sister Jing Shu can identify the Lost Soul Flower.

409
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,680
Isn't that right?

410
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,080
Sister Jing Shu? That's really affectionate.

411
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,680
How about you call me brother-in-law?

412
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,240
How can I do that?

413
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,301
Your Highness is a man of authority and standing.

414
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,941
I can't forgot my manners.

415
00:31:02,189 --> 00:31:04,869
Your Highness, Madam!

416
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,681
Your Highness, Madam, Imperial Censor Wei, the culprit behind the poisoning has been found.

417
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,460
Imperial Censor Wei, you're here.

418
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,360
Madam, I heard that the culprit has been found.

419
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,500
Xue Fei.

420
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,260
I found this in the room of Hong Ye, who was responsible for brewing the medicine.

421
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,647
Please take a look at it.

422
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,860
Hong Ye, don't resent me.

423
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,840
You're just unlucky.

424
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,420
It's the smell of the Lost Soul Flower.

425
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,280
What's this white cloth for?

426
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,340
This is a poison-detecting cloth made by the palace's imperial physician.

427
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,780
It's been soaked in a special herbal brew.

428
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,860
Once the white cloth comes into contact with the Lost Soul Flower, it will turn red.

429
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,187
His Majesty gave me this cloth to test for poison before everyone

430
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:14,467
and prove that the heir's wife isn't lying.

431
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,460
The white cloth turned red.

432
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,080
This medicine is indeed the Lost Soul Flower.

433
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,260
Xue Fei, bring Hong Ye here.

434
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,260
Yes, Madam.

435
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,436
What is Zhang Yuan Qing up to this time?

436
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,780
Now that His Grace is confirmed to be poisoned with the Lost Soul Flower,

437
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,920
can he still be saved?

438
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,120
Thanks to Her Lady for expelling the poison using acupuncture,

439
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,360
His Grace managed to vomit out the poisoned blood in time.

440
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,020
His Grace's life is no longer in danger,

441
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,710
but recovery will take time and a period of recuperation is needed to regain consciousness.

442
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,740
Thank the Heavens.

443
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:27,504
Jing Shu, I'm glad Imperial Censor Wei uncovered the truth.

444
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:29,160
I misjudged you.

445
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,520
Don't resent me.

446
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,640
I understand.

447
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,360
Your immense worry for Father frazzled your mind.

448
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,560
Don't be bothered by this.

449
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,320
Madam!

450
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,820
There's trouble!

451
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,460
Hong Ye has jumped into the well.

452
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,460
What?

453
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,280
Word of the culprit being found must've spread.

454
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,180
Hong Ye killed herself to escape punishment.

455
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,860
You didn't even believe that His Grace was poisoned.

456
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,580
Why did Imperial Censor Wei's arrival

457
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,280
spur you to suspect Hong Ye and search her room?

458
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,960
That's because I know a secret.

459
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,460
What is it?

460
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,140
One day, I heard people quarreling when I passed by His Grace's room.

461
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,660
I walked over and saw...

462
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,300
What is it? Tell us.

463
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,334
I saw His Grace forcing himself onto Hong Ye.

464
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,500
No wonder His Grace's health worsened drastically after the new year.

465
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,860
So it's because that darned brat poisoned him.
