1
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,240
One bride, two brides, they are fighting!

2
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,960
Why should they go in first?

3
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,961
- We came first!
- We came first!

4
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,280
General Liu is at the frontier...

5
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,160
My name is Liu Jia. The one sitting in this palaquin

6
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,480
should have been my older sister, Liu Jing Shu.

7
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
Xiao Jia.
[Three months ago]

8
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,320
Your older sister's wedding date is approaching, but she suddenly disappeared.

9
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,640
- Grand Master Meng has never been friendly with me.
- Go!

10
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,360
He will definitely blame your mother while I'm stationed at the border.

11
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,800
- Help!
- You must protect the family for me

12
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,441
and find your older sister.

13
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:47,801
You must not reveal your identity as a twin.

14
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Oh, no.

15
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,440
Who dares to block my horse?

16
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,520
Young Master, save me. Someone wants to kill me.

17
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
Don't be afraid.

18
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,040
I've underestimated you

19
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,200
and let you run away.

20
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,080
How can you take advantage of a weak woman in broad daylight?

21
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,240
"Weak woman"?

22
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,640
Look carefully. Where is the weak woman?

23
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Show yourself!

24
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's just a deception trick from the northern desert.

25
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,201
Young Miss, you...

26
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,281
Young Master, do you think I'm pretty?

27
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,040
Jiang Da Zhuang,

28
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,280
if you don't come over,

29
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,481
I will capture you but not alive.

30
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,080
Cut your useless talk, or I'll kill her.

31
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,800
Go ahead.

32
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,680
You...

33
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,161
So? In broad daylight,

34
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,601
how can I fight against a weak woman?

35
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Sorry, Young Miss.

36
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
Ouch...

37
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,880
Done.

38
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,240
No need to thank me, Scumbag.

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,360
Quite good at martial arts.

40
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,013
Then I won't be polite.

41
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,680
What are you doing?

42
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,160
The Imperial Clan Affairs Office is working on a case.

43
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,801
Your horse is being recruited.

44
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,521
Please cooperate, Little Young Master.

45
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,800
Go back to your young lady's chamber to do embroidery.

46
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,841
If you dare to be brazen and reckless again,

47
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,641
I wonder which man will dare to marry you.

48
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,480
No need to give change.

49
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,200
You bastard!

50
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,521
I wonder which unlucky woman will marry you!

51
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:35,080
Young Miss, don't you worry about it.

52
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,718
It certainly won't be you!

53
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Seal the entire surroundings of Liu Manor.
[General's Manor]

54
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,481
Don't allow even a bird to enter.

55
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:48,481
Yes!

56
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Stop!

57
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,240
- Bring it.
- Yes!

58
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,466
Madam, be careful.

59
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Madam.

60
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,961
Grand Master Meng, what are you doing?

61
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,240
Madam Liu!

62
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,840
Madam Liu, please don't blame me.

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,320
I came here following His Majesty's edict.

64
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,680
I have no intention to cause trouble for personal reasons.

65
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,160
Grand Master Meng, my general has been serving the country for years.

66
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,840
When you treat the Liu family this way, aren't you afraid of being criticized by the people?

67
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,280
I am afraid.

68
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,000
But what else can I do?

69
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,360
His Majesty bestowed marriage to the Liu family's eldest daughter, Liu Jing Shu.

70
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,080
But she has eloped with someone.

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,480
His Majesty is enraged and has meted out a punishment.

72
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,801
I wanted to dissuade him but failed.

73
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:52,801
Nonsense!

74
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,880
It's impossible that my Jing Shu would elope!

75
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,720
Tell her to come out.

76
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,600
You...

77
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,840
As long as Liu Jing Shu shows herself

78
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,800
and proves that I've wronged the Liu household,

79
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,600
I will die as redemption.

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,440
But if Eldest Miss Liu doesn't appear,

81
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,561
then it's a capital crime for the whole household of deceiving the monarch.

82
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:17,800
Men!

83
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,920
Present!

84
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,160
Arrest everyone in the Liu household and put them in jail.

85
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Hold on!

86
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
Jing Shu...

87
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
No, it's Jia'er.

88
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,680
Liu Jing Shu greets Grand Master.

89
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:09,081
Jing Shu, didn't I tell you already?

90
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,441
You caught a contagious disease. Hurry and go back in.

91
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,840
Now that Eldest Miss Liu has appeared,

92
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,160
this is all a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding!

93
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
I'm leaving.

94
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Stop!

95
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,400
Just now, Grand Master said it very clearly.

96
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,640
As long as I appear

97
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,280
to prove that Grand Master has wronged the Liu houseold,

98
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,920
you would die as redemption.

99
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
You...

100
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,921
Eldest Miss Liu is indeed a descendant of a general's family.

101
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,400
Fine.

102
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,640
I will do as you wish.

103
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,000
This animal has apologized

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,120
to Madam Liu in my stead.

105
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,120
Let's leave!

106
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
You...

107
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
It's enough.

108
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,400
Lan'er, bury the bird.

109
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
Yes, Miss.

110
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Kneel.

111
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,480
You... How could you be so daring?

112
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,680
Mom, Older Sister is missing.

113
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
If I hadn't appeared today,

114
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,878
you would have been captured by Grand Master Meng.

115
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,640
Come, get up.

116
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,360
You cheated him by pretending to be Jing Shu today.

117
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,800
What if Jing Shu still doesn't appear on the wedding day?

118
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,360
What will you do then?

119
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,032
I'll marry in Older Sister's stead.

120
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,840
Congratulations.
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

121
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,080
- Please go inside.
- Congratulations!

122
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,492
Lord Li, your presence brings light to our humble abode.

123
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,800
Has the Marquis' heir been found?
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

124
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,360
We heard that the marquis' heir went drinking and stayed out all night.

125
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,520
He just returned to the manor.

126
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,320
He's about to marry, but he is still so unruly.

127
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
Bring him here right away.

128
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Yes, Madam.

129
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,440
Keep up.

130
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,160
Gorgeous, why did you leap into my arms so early in the morning?

131
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,480
You reek of alcohol.

132
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,320
You're getting married today. Why are you so drunk?

133
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,761
Madam asked me to get you.

134
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:34,681
Tidy up and go out to welcome your bride.

135
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
Does that mistress miss me that much?

136
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,000
How about I marry you first?

137
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,281
You're so annoying.

138
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,241
Don't bully me on your wedding day.

139
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,360
Oh, no!

140
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,200
Two bridal palanquins bumped into each other at the entrance.

141
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,560
Two?

142
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,920
Am I marrying two wives today?

143
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,720
Second Young Master is also getting married today.

144
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,680
He's marrying Grand Master Meng's niece.

145
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,840
Your Highness! Hurry on out!

146
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,883
Quickly.

147
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:01,164
Come on.

148
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:03,044
Let's check out the commotion.

149
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,560
One bride, two brides, they are fighting!

150
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,280
- Why should they go in first?
- Hey!

151
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,440
We came first!

152
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,640
We came first!

153
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,080
- Hurry.
- The Meng family arrived first.

154
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,760
The Liu family arrived first.

155
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,440
- What's going on?
- I have no clue, either.

156
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,160
They just started fighting.

157
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,520
General Liu is loved by the people for his victories at the frontier.

158
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,760
- So what?
- We arrived first.

159
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,041
- The Meng family arrived first.
- We did.

160
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,320
I don't care.

161
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,160
- Lan'er.
- The Meng family arrived first!
- The Liu family arrived first!

162
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Young Miss.

163
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,240
We're here for my sister.

164
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,920
Let them enter first.

165
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,080
Young Miss.

166
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,320
Meng Han Jiao lost the title of the top lady of the capital to the eldest miss.

167
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,680
So she's been in disagreement with the eldest miss.

168
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,920
If we let her enter first, she will be even more obnoxious.

169
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,360
Besides, you're the eldest son's wife.

170
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,120
Xiao Jia, I have one last piece of advice.

171
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,880
This is Yanli Kingdom's iron law.

172
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,600
Twins are inauspicious.

173
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,800
The firstborn will be recognized and allowed to live.

174
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
The second will be condemned as evil and killed.

175
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,200
When you and your sister were born,

176
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,160
your father and I couldn't bear to do it

177
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,376
so we let you live.

178
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:19,920
But... you aren't a stand-in for your sister.

179
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,400
You don't have to do this.

180
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,640
Mother.

181
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,920
My sister is missing.

182
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,360
If I reject this marriage, I will be criticized even more harshly.

183
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,240
As part of the Liu family,

184
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,840
I can't be a bystander.

185
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,080
I believe that my sister

186
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,921
would look for me and prove my innocence.

187
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,960
The auspicious hour has arrived.

188
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,240
Young Miss, we have to leave.

189
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,120
Xiao Jia.

190
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,880
Actually, both you and your sister...

191
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,520
I know.

192
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,160
We're your darlings.

193
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Yes.

194
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
By the way, Mother,

195
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,280
Father wanted me to relay a message to you.

196
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,800
What is it?

197
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
He said this.

198
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,072
He misses you.

199
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Abide by my wishes.

200
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,880
Yes, Young Miss.

201
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,840
Brother, they...

202
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,960
Interesting.

203
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,280
Listen up.

204
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,640
Young Miss is a gracious lady.

205
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,360
The wife of the second son from the Meng family can enter.

206
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,320
Goodness.

207
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,360
Letting the second son's wife enter first?

208
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
How gracious!

209
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
- Men!
- Yes!

210
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,240
I'm really curious,

211
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,401
how sharp the fangs of this rogue girl are!

212
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Attack!

213
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
Second Brother.

214
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,241
Men shouldn't be involved in women's fights.

215
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,480
This is atrocious.

216
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,240
What a way to test the waters.

217
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:53,247
The sequence of entry isn't important.

218
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
However...

219
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,600
hitting a woman is unacceptable.

220
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,640
It's her.

221
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,120
Insolence!

222
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,961
How dare you hit the Meng family's subjects!

223
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,095
Attack!

224
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,280
General Liu's troops, in position!

225
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
Ho! Ho! Ho! Hah!

226
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,800
Stop!

227
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Father, Mother.

228
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,840
What's going on?

229
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,680
Why are they fighting?

230
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,600
Father, the two brides you chose with Second Aunt sure are filial.

231
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,681
What an exciting entrance they've made.

232
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:07,961
I bet our manor will be bustling in the future.

233
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,880
How dare you, Liu Jing Shu!

234
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,040
Anyone who harms the Liu family's subjects

235
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,640
will meet a bloody end!

236
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Impudence!

237
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,120
Marquis, calm down.

238
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,840
We can talk things out.

239
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,440
How dare you step out of your palanquins before entering the manor!

240
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,400
You even ordered your servants to fight! This is outrageous!

241
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Lan'er.

242
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,800
The Liu family's teachings are as such.

243
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
We shall not strike anyone first.

244
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,040
However, if we're struck, the fight goes on no matter what.

245
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
You!

246
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,520
Marquis, let this go.

247
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,840
Jing Shu is the daughter of a valiant general.

248
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,880
Besides, His Majesty arranged this marriage.

249
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Even if she behaves rudely,

250
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,720
we should just proceed with the marriage first.

251
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,360
Father-in-law.

252
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,240
You have to seek justice for me.

253
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,520
My uncle is Grand Master Meng.

254
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,680
I've never suffered such humiliation.

255
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,600
Well, here's your first time.

256
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,360
Besides, you're suffering the consequences of your own deeds.

257
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
You...

258
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,480
Even if this is a marriage ordained by His Majesty,

259
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,280
you can't behave so disgracefully!

260
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,080
You're audacious and disrespectful to your elders before you're even wedded.

261
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,801
The Xuanping family

262
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:21,721
isn't worthy of marriage to General Liu's family!

263
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,000
The altar tablet of the Marchioness of Xuanping has arrived!

264
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
What...

265
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
What...

266
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,560
Father, when it comes to rites,

267
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,160
you remarried less than a year after my mother's passing.

268
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,800
Isn't it equally unbecoming?

269
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,560
Xiao Ren Yan, what are you doing on this wedding day?

270
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,320
Since it's my wedding day,

271
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,320
what's wrong with inviting my mother here to see my wife?

272
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,600
Brother.

273
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,080
My mother has been the marchioness for over a decade.

274
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,560
How can you humiliate her in public?

275
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,680
The marchioness?

276
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,160
I'm the heir.

277
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,320
That means I'm the future Marquis of Xuanping.

278
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,280
My wife will be the future marchioness.

279
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,560
Aren't you humiliating her, too?

280
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,160
Why is he here?

281
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,480
She's screeching murder in public.

282
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,840
How can someone like her be fit to be the marchioness?

283
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
That decision

284
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,174
lies with me.

285
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,080
Why hasn't Lan'er returned?

286
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,840
Forget it. I will do it myself.

287
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,840
I came up with this ploy to find my sister.

288
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,120
Xiao Ren Yan, don't resent me.

289
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,480
Madam, what are you doing?

290
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,000
Why didn't you make a sound?

291
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,760
Madam, what are you doing?

292
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,480
His Highness just helped you.

293
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,680
This is mariticide!

294
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,760
Don't worry. This is a sleeping draft often used in the military.

295
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,880
What?

296
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm here to find clues about my sister's disappearance.

297
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,680
I can't really do that with him.

298
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Do what?

299
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
That.

300
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Oh, that.

301
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Stop following me.

302
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm not drunk!

303
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,920
I'm not drunk! Not drunk!

304
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,440
I have to accompany my wife.

305
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,920
Drunken fool.

306
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,720
Madam, are you waiting for me?

307
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,841
Why has Your Highness just returned?

308
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,401
I thought you would sleep elsewhere.

309
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,520
It's all madam's fault.

310
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,680
I've married the most renowned young miss in the capital.

311
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,760
All of my buddies are envious and jealous.

312
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,320
They had to drag me over to force me to drink.

313
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,160
Drunken fool.

314
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,400
Let me take a look. How beautiful

315
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
is the most renowned young miss of the capital?

316
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,640
Madam, you look quite familiar.

317
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,520
A hundred years of cultivation results in friendship.

318
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,560
A thousand years of cultivation results in marriage.

319
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,601
Your Highness, you and I are fated in this life.

320
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,241
We must have known each other in our previous life.

321
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,600
The auspicious night is young, we must not disappoint it.

322
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
Why don't we drink the nuptial wine?

323
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Fine.

324
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,800
Madam, I will feed you.

325
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,160
Everyone in the capital says,

326
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,200
Liu Jing Shu is a brainless beauty who is naive, willful, and doesn't know the world.

327
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:27,000
But as I see it,

328
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Madam looks like a smart beauty with a thousand faces and excels in culture and martial arts.

329
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,400
They say the Marquis Xuanping's heir is a drunken fool.

330
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
All he knows is drinking and whoring every day.

331
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,640
As I see it, with quite a lot hidden in your heart, you are quite the duplicity.

332
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,520
You're more like a jade-faced fox.

333
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,101
Don't pretend anymore. I've recognized you.

334
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,644
In that case, I can't let you live.

335
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:17,640
- Here come the nuptial chamber partiers!
- Your Highness, we're here!

336
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,840
We're here to tease the newlyweds.

337
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,960
We're here, Your Highness.

338
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,680
Who is that? Aren't you a nuisance enough?

339
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,560
We're asleep.

340
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,080
Isn't the Marquis' heir the top playboy in the capital?

341
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,480
You linger in the brothers every day.

342
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,760
How can you still be so energetic?

343
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,520
We bow in admiration.

344
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,720
We bow in admiration.

345
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,040
Forget it. Let's leave.

346
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,961
- We're leaving, Your Highness.
- We're leaving.

347
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:41,160
He sure makes us envious.

348
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,600
They've left. We can get up now.

349
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,440
All right.

350
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,920
Three, two, one.

351
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,360
This marriage was ordained by His Majesty.

352
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
If anything goes wrong,
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

353
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,800
both of us have family and clans.

354
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,920
Neither of us can bear to be guilty of defying the imperial edict.

355
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,680
I didn't make the first move just now.

356
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,440
That day in the countryside, you were rushing on your journey.

357
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,400
Where were you going?

358
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,281
Why did you disguise yourself as a man?

359
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,401
Why were you chasing after that pompous big guy?

360
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,400
He stole a lot of my money. That's why I captured him.

361
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,280
As for the mask,

362
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,440
it's because I have a frivolous reputation in the capital.

363
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,720
I don't want to be laughed at for getting trapped.

364
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,400
I'm listening to nonsense.

365
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,040
I've heard of it, too.

366
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,801
His Majesty bestowed marriage to my husband

367
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,520
who has quite a frivolous reputation in the capital.

368
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,080
So I wanted to burn incense at the Taoist Temple in the countryside to pray for a smooth marriage.

369
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,452
As for disguising as a man,

370
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,160
I also didn't want people to laugh at me.

371
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,600
This woman can talk nonsense easily.

372
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,560
Although we've just gotten acquainted,

373
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,132
we seem to share similar interests.

374
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,280
In that case, why don't we cooperate with each other?

375
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,680
We'll be loving in public.

376
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,920
In private, we won't cross each other's path.

377
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
How about it?

378
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Deal.

379
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,080
I'll go to sleep in the study.

380
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Wait.

381
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
There's one more thing.

382
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,680
What about the virgin cloth?

383
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,680
Madam is so skillful. Why ask me about such a trivial matter?

384
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
We...

385
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,000
The Liu family is a military family for generations.

386
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We don't like to beat around the bush.

387
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,280
If you don't come up with an idea,

388
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,911
don't blame me when the time comes.

389
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,281
Madam, you are so smart. Just think of a solution by yourself.

390
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,920
Xiao Ren Yan, don't blame me for being vicious.

391
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,440
There's trouble! There's trouble!

392
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,400
Your Highness, Madam.

393
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Bad news.

394
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,440
What's wrong?

395
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,040
That... virgin cloth has been stolen.

396
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,000
What happened? Wasn't it still there just now?

397
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I don't know. I went back to look, but it disappeared.

398
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,720
Your Highness, Young Madam.

399
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,360
What's wrong, little bueaty?

400
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,761
Old Madam told me to come

401
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,601
to ask the Marquis' heir and Young Madam to go there with the virgin cloth.

402
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,248
I see. You may leave.

403
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Useless thing.

404
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:52,586
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

405
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Xue Fei.

406
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Madam.

407
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,480
Madam.

408
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
It's empty.

409
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,840
Nonsense!

410
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,320
Why is the virgin cloth missing?

411
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,160
I don't know.

412
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,880
I put it in the box.

413
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,320
Without the virgin cloth, how can you prove your pureness?

414
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,400
Oh my Goodness.

415
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,841
Perhaps the rumor is true that she had lost her virginity before marriage.

416
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,760
Shameless.

417
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,200
Yes, shameless.

418
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,640
Just as I expected, Liu Jing Shu really did lose her virginity before marriage.

419
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:37,440
So shameless.

420
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,880
Yes, so shameless.

421
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,520
If I had known, why would I waste my effort to steal it?

422
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,880
Just wait to see her get laughed at.

423
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,360
How can you lose such a precious item?

424
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,840
As I see it, you are guilty and deliberately hid it.

425
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,640
At the dignified Marquis of Xuanping Manor,

426
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,840
how can we allow an unclean woman to tarnish our lineage?

427
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,800
Today, I must let Yan'er divorce you!

428
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,520
Your Grace, don't be angry.

429
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,320
The virgin cloth is missing.

430
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,040
It doesn't mean Yan'er's wife lost her virginity before marriage.

431
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,240
Besides, this marriage was ordained by His Majesty.

432
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,880
So what if it was ordained by His Majesty?

433
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
She can't produce the virgin cloth and will get divorced.

434
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,160
His Majesty and General Liu can't blame me.

435
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Someone!

436
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,920
Present.

437
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,440
Drag away this woman.

438
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,000
- Yes.
- Hold on.

439
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:38,000
Father and Mother, why don't you drink the tea from Younger Sister-in-law first.

440
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,880
If her virgin cloth also has a problem,

441
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,840
then you can dispense with us together.

442
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,920
You can save the trouble of doing it again.

443
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,600
My virgin cloth has no problem.

444
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,521
You lost virginity before marriage, but you want to drag me down too.

445
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,560
Father, please drink this tea.

446
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,240
Mother, please drink this tea.

447
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,040
Thankfully, Ming'er's wife is clever and adorable.

448
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,680
- Xue Fei.
- Yes, Madam.

449
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,000
Madam, it's an auspicious cloth.
(T/N: Stained with virginal blood)

450
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,240
Madam, there's another one here.

451
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
What?

452
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,680
How did this happen?

453
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
This...

454
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,130
They want to harm me with this measly trick?

455
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,601
- Yes, shameless!
- Shameless!

456
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:48,327
- Liu Jing shu has really lost her virginity before marriage.
- That is...

457
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:49,920
So shameless.

458
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,280
Yes, so shameless.

459
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,640
If I had known,

460
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,801
why should I waste the effort to steal it?

461
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:58,401
I'll just wait to see her get laughed at.

462
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,320
Isn't this my virgin cloth? Why is it...

463
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,720
Meng Han jiao!

464
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,320
Toilet chips! Toilet chips?
(T/N: Ancient toilet tissue)

465
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:19,840
I should die. I left the toilet chips in the bedroom.

466
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,640
Why are you still standing there then?

467
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,960
Hurry and get it.

468
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,200
Oh, yes, yes.

469
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,520
Oh, yes, Madam.

470
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
The medicine sent over by Grand Master Meng is already brewed.

471
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,880
Grand Master reminded you to take the medicine regularly.

472
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,920
Fine, noted. What a nuisance!

473
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,520
Why aren't you getting the toilet chips yet?

474
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,080
Yes, yes, yes.

475
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,560
Idiot. My legs are getting numb.

476
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,960
Liu Jing Shu!

477
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,840
You're finally defeated by me.

478
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,080
I will never be second to you anymore.

479
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,280
Such strange thinking.

480
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
This is...

481
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,000
You didn't expect it, right?

482
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,760
Younger Sister-in-law is truly thoughtful.

483
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,800
She even prepared two virgin cloths.

484
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,920
This way, no one will know if she had lost virginity before marriage.

485
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,160
You must have done it!

486
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,325
You've been wanting to harm me.

487
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,160
Enough now.

488
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,360
So much arguing and clamoring, it's improper.

489
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,720
We divorce on the same day, and also marry on the same day.

490
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,760
Second Brother, we are truly fated.

491
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,240
Congratulations.

492
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,720
Congratulations what?

493
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,360
Of course, it's to congratulate us for being able to divorce and marry again.

494
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,320
Be a groom again.

495
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
Ridiculous!

496
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,960
Mother and Father, it's all my fault.

497
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,160
I got muddled momentarily.

498
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,160
That blank virgin cloth belongs to Eldest Sister-in-law.

499
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,280
Oh...

500
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,840
Your Grace.

501
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,200
Although Ming'er's wife made a mistake,

502
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,560
what's important now

503
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,440
is that Yan'er's wife indeed didn't show blood.

504
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,640
If the gossip gets out,

505
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,880
our manor will be utterly embarrassed.

506
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,640
The virgin cloth has been found.

507
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,649
There is no blood. How do you explain it?

508
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,120
Xiao Ren Yan?

509
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,800
Xiao Ren Yan.

510
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,989
Why does it have anything to do with me?

511
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,720
In that case...

512
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,080
Mother, it's not easy to talk about this matter in public.

513
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,760
Do you want to save your dignity now?

514
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
I'm not concerned for my own dignity.

515
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
It's for...

516
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,040
It's for the Marquis' heir.

517
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,521
You've been improper in your conduct.

518
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:59,880
How does it have anything to do with the Marquis' heir?

519
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,320
Since Mother insists,

520
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,240
I'll have to say it then.

521
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,360
I am still a virgin.

522
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,280
It's because...

523
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
It's because the Marquis' heir...

524
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,120
It's because the Marquis' heir is impotent!
