[Fated to Love You]
[Episode 5]

2
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,620
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

3
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
Young Madam has always been reckless and domineering.

4
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,020
You've never liked her.

5
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,460
Why feel bothered by her?

6
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:28,660
You are right.

7
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,521
It's such a nice night, why waste the time on her?

8
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,960
Come, Little Beauty.

9
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,000
You can serve me well tonight.

10
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,580
Xiao Ren Yan, you scumbag!

11
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,200
I've been good to you, but you won't believe me!

12
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,700
I...

13
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,980
I know that was your mother's memorial tablet.

14
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,501
I also know that you made it with your hands.

15
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:59,381
Why can't I also make one with my hands?

16
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,040
That's right. Why don't I make one for you?

17
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,780
She wants to sleep with me every night.

18
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,980
Keep dreaming!

19
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,720
[Memorial Tablet of Madam Zhang, Wife of Xiao Yun Ting]

20
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,620
Done!

21
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,780
Madam, although you passed a long time ago,

22
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,820
Xiao Ren Yan has always kept you in his heart. He's never forgotten you.

23
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,760
Although he looks unconventional and unruly on surface,

24
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,380
he is really inscrutable.

25
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:27,560
I think he must hold a great secret.

26
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Although I don't know what it is,

27
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,660
I also don't know what he is doing,

28
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,981
but I hope your spirit in heaven
[Memorial Tablet of Madam Zhang, Wife of Xiao Yun Ting]

29
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:39,761
will protect him and keep him safe.

30
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,860
You aren't asleep yet, are you?

31
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,780
Don't be angry anymore.

32
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,960
During the day, I was wrong in my tone of voice.

33
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,460
But I didn't disbelieve you.

34
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,820
I was angry that you made your own decision to participate in the manor's grand memorial service.

35
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,260
Why didn't you keep an eye out?

36
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,740
What if you got bullied when I'm not at home?

37
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,160
What's this smell?

38
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,978
Help!

39
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,620
The memorial tablet!

40
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Help!

41
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,560
All right, enough.

42
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,640
I was in the wrong, okay?

43
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,881
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you.

44
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:57,861
You're the kindest, the gentlest, and the most gracious.

45
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,940
Liu Jing Shu.

46
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,820
Liu Jing Shu?

47
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,600
Are you asleep?

48
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,776
Fire!

49
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,780
I bet she's dead.

50
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,220
Jing Shu!

51
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,480
Stop him. Stop him!

52
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,800
Let go! Jing Shu!

53
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,740
Yan'er, Jing Shu is young and reckless, refusing to change despite my advice.

54
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,200
I only mentioned a divorce to scare her and make her repent.

55
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,641
I didn't think she'd lose her mind

56
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:35,901
and set a fire to kill herself.

57
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:38,080
Jing Shu wouldn't kill herself in a fire.

58
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,420
Let go of me! I have to save her!

59
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,720
Brother, you can't go in! It's too dangerous!

60
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,420
Yes, it's such a huge fire.

61
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,880
Liu Jing Shu has probably been burned to death.

62
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,760
It's pointless for you to go in now.

63
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,980
You're the heir of the Marquis of Xuanping.

64
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,300
You can't risk your life for a mere girl.

65
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,440
Yes, Brother! You can't kill yourself for her!

66
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,220
You can always marry another one tomorrow.

67
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,480
Xiao Ming, listen up,

68
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Liu Jing Shu is the only person I will marry in this life.

69
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,700
Liu Jing Shu!

70
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,300
Liu Jing Shu!

71
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,141
Liu Jing Shu, where are you?

72
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:26,620
Xiao Ren Yan, I'm over here.

73
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,821
Liu Jing Shu, don't be scared.

74
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,940
Come with me.

75
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,320
Come on.

76
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,060
Xiao Ren Yan.

77
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,020
I have something to tell you.

78
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,820
Shut up.

79
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
You're awake.

80
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,480
Imperial Physician Wang said the smoke scarred your throat.

81
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
He prescribed some medicine to calm you down.

82
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,800
You have to speak less for the next few days.

83
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,300
Here, I'll feed you.

84
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,960
Are you looking for the memorial tablet?

85
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,180
Don't worry. I've fixed it.

86
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,300
It's much better than the original.

87
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,640
Here, have some honey water.

88
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,940
Look at you.

89
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,660
Is there something wrong with your brain?

90
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,301
Why didn't you get out when the fire broke out?

91
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:30,281
Why did you save those shabby memorial tablets?

92
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,400
I wanted to run here,

93
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,660
but the windows and doors were sealed, and I couldn't run.

94
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,760
You knew someone tried to hurt you, but you didn't try to save yourself.

95
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,561
Those memorial tablets are just tokens of memory.

96
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:45,181
Your life is the most important.

97
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,600
I'm lying here safely, aren't I?

98
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,880
We got the best of both worlds.

99
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,140
I should thank you for saving me, Great Heir Xiao.

100
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,940
Ever since you married me,

101
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,260
the Marquis' Manor has been in chaos and danger has loomed.

102
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,180
I've never given you a single peaceful day.

103
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,360
You're right.

104
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,061
Any woman who marries me is downright unlucky.

105
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:20,040
I did you wrong and failed to protect you well.

106
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,600
If there's trouble again, make sure you protect yourself.

107
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,620
Everything else doesn't matter.

108
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,740
You're the most important.

109
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,880
I wonder who was the one

110
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,401
who got angry at me yesterday over the memorial tablet.

111
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,987
Remember this, in my heart, nothing is more important than you.

112
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,880
Xiao Ren Yan.

113
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,940
Do you treat every woman like this?

114
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,600
What about you?

115
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,880
You're the celebrated daughter of Liu Manor. I'm sure you have loads of suitors.

116
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,380
- Well, that depends on the season.
- What?

117
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,080
For example, in spring,

118
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,060
everything is blossoming and the rain makes the world hazy.

119
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,570
There are tons of guys lining up at my manor's entrance.

120
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,860
Let's take a look at another example.

121
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,980
In summer, when it's blazing hot, and the winds are gusting,

122
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,140
there are even more men lining up by my house.

123
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,480
Why do you believe my nonsense? Are you a fool?

124
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,020
I'm going to get you medicine to soothe your throat.

125
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm so impressive.

126
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,980
And you're wedded. Who would even court you?

127
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,880
You haven't answered my question.

128
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,780
Do you treat every woman like this?

129
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,092
Only you.

130
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:20,900
Do you believe me?

131
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,580
Yes.

132
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,240
Great Heir Xiao appears frivolous,

133
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,741
but he's a prideful man who doesn't bother to lie.

134
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,200
- Capture this woman who attempted to burn down the Marquis' Manor.
- Yes.

135
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,980
Who dares to do so?

136
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,920
Brother, this isn't the time to be protecting her.

137
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
She tried to kill herself in a fire.

138
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,640
She wanted to burn down the entire Marquis' Manor!

139
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,420
Her sin is unforgivable.

140
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,580
Yes, the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor has no room for this vicious woman.

141
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,400
Yan'er. Arson is a grave crime.

142
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,300
Even if I want to cover up her deed, it's impossible.

143
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,380
Right now, the officials are outside.

144
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,300
Sign the divorce papers.

145
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,681
Sever all ties with this despicable woman

146
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,981
and take her to be trialed.

147
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,080
You...

148
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,340
Officials? Which Magistrate's Office?

149
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm sure they were sent by Grand Preceptor Meng.

150
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,160
When have the matters of the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor been subject to the interference of outsiders?

151
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,800
Yan'er.

152
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,141
You won't disregard imperial law for this despicable woman, will you?

153
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:18,220
That depends on whose laws those are.

154
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,420
His Grace is sick.

155
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,300
I make the decisions in this family.

156
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,832
Drag this despicable woman out.

157
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,000
Father is gravely ill.

158
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,760
The entire Marquis' Manor is under my authority.

159
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,220
If anyone dares to touch her,

160
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,840
I'll order them to be flogged to death.

161
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,920
Madam!

162
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,240
Madam, envoys from the palace are here. They want the heir's wife to receive the imperial edict.

163
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,880
Who's supposed to receive the edict?

164
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,820
The heir's wife, Madam Liu.

165
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,920
In accordance with the Heavens, His Majesty's decree is as such.

166
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,300
The wife of the Marquis of Xuanping's heir, Madam Liu,

167
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,320
has both courage and insight.

168
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,260
She bravely saved the Marchioness' memorial tablet from the fire

169
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,740
without any care for her own life. Her courage is commendable.

170
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,060
Madam Liu is hereby titled Lady of Courage and Loyalty.

171
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,401
She's rewarded with 1,000 taels of gold.

172
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:19,301
That is all. Receive the edict with gratitude.

173
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:23,400
Hold on.

174
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,992
Liu Jing Shu committed arson with insidious intentions.

175
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:28,140
How can His Majesty bestow her with a title?

176
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,800
Madam, are you defying the imperial edict?

177
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,400
Mother.

178
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,340
Defying the edict is punishable by death.

179
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,040
We thank His Majesty for his benevolence.

180
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,981
From this day forth, I will protect you well.

181
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,460
This Xiao Ren Yan.

182
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,220
I received Heir Xiao's secret letter

183
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,900
and rushed into the palace for an audience with His Majesty at night.

184
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,320
His Majesty happened to be worshipping his ancestors near the Marquis' Manor.

185
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,141
He heard about your brave act and rewarded you generously.

186
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,260
Thank you.

187
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,800
Save it. There's no need to thank me.

188
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,280
As long as...

189
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,792
as long as it's for you, I'll do anything.

190
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:10,801
With the imperial edict as a shield, I can finally have a peaceful night of sleep.

191
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,500
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

192
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,980
Oh, that's right.

193
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,621
Before the fire,

194
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,680
I think I smelled tung oil.

195
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:28,001
Okay, I'll get someone to investigate this clue immediately.

196
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,960
I owe you one for this.

197
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,860
In the future, let me know if you need a favor.

198
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,300
Okay, you can divorce Sister Jing Shu.

199
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,462
What did you say?

200
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,500
The Marquis' Manor is filled with threats.

201
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,180
Why must a weak woman like her risk her life with you?

202
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,101
She isn't as weak as you think.

203
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:05,021
Even if she isn't, does she deserve to be hurt?

204
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:06,741
Barely any time passed since her marriage here.

205
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:09,701
I've already entered the palace and requested an edict for her twice.

206
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:13,420
It's my fault. I put her life at risk twice.

207
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,420
I'll take care of her well.

208
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,500
Forget it. A womanizer like you can't take care of her.

209
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,340
How am I a womanizer?

210
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,140
Haven't I explained to you the reason for taking Zhang Xue Fei in as a concubine?

211
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,380
So what?

212
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,860
Listen up.

213
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,021
As long as she continues getting hurt by your side,

214
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:31,621
I won't stand by and do nothing.

215
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,740
Heir Wei, watch your words.

216
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,700
Don't forget that His Majesty ordained my marriage to Liu Jing Shu.

217
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,720
I will protect her well.

218
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,700
Sister Jing Shu is your wife.

219
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,749
Boss isn't!

220
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,940
After I received your secret letter,

221
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,899
I investigated Zhang Yun Qing's recent whereabouts immediately.

222
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:58,540
Three days ago, she sent someone to visit a convent she frequents.

223
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,541
50 pounds of tung oil was bought under the excuse of the grand memorial service.

224
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,880
Her, again.

225
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,700
She tried to kill your wife

226
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,420
to ruin you and build her son's future.

227
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,100
As long as you're still the heir,

228
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,740
she'll never stop.

229
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,460
She holds the title of the Marchioness of Xuanping

230
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,341
and has Grand Preceptor Meng backing her.

231
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:21,901
I guess I'll have to let her live a little longer.

232
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,581
When I settle scores once autumn is over,

233
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:28,361
I'll count this in as well.

234
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,860
You're awake. Does your throat still hurt?

235
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,320
I'm fine now.

236
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,580
Nonsense. Lie down and recuperate.

237
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,940
- Wait, I'm really fine.
- Lie down.

238
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,840
Xiao Ren Yan, I'm really...

239
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,980
I'm really all right.

240
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,460
- What are you doing here?
- Let me go in and have a look.

241
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,080
I heard sounds from the room. Is she awake?

242
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,660
Young Madam is still asleep.

243
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,180
Come in, I'm awake!

244
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,140
My greetings to the Heir and Sister.

245
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,220
You're up really early.

246
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,380
After you barely escaped danger, I've been worried all night.

247
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,760
How could I fall asleep?

248
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,080
Your concern is appreciated.

249
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,920
Young Madam has recovered.

250
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,900
You can rest in your room.

251
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,500
Yes, you have to spend more time with her.

252
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,080
Don't worry about me.

253
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,340
I got it. Once I have the time, I'll visit you.

254
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll take my leave.

255
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,460
You have time now.

256
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,980
Off you go.

257
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,740
Don't neglect such a beauty.

258
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,680
Who told you that I have time now?

259
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,180
I'm busy.

260
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,934
Busy with what?

261
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,200
Busy with cheering you up.

262
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,620
It won't take long.

263
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,280
Once I tidy up the courtyard,

264
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,400
there won't be anyone left to bother us.

265
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,820
We can grow old together.

266
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,420
I'll get you a cup of honey water.

267
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,020
All right.

268
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,840
Xiao Ren Yan.

269
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,360
What if I'm not who you think I am,

270
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,100
will you still grow old with me?

271
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,240
As long as you remain who you are,

272
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,000
and I remain the same,

273
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,460
I will always stay by your side.

274
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:32,940
Sister, I've fallen in love with Xiao Ren Yan.

275
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,561
Can I have this man you don't want?

276
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,780
Jing Shu, His Majesty has bestowed you with the title of Lady of Courage and Loyalty.

277
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,900
This is a remarkable act of grace.

278
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,580
As your mother, I have to add to this joy.

279
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,360
I'll hand you the authority over this household.

280
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,660
Thank you for your trust, Mother.

281
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,460
I will do my best to lead this family.

282
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,540
Off you go.

283
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,420
The manor's various housekeepers are waiting to greet you.

284
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,440
I'll take my leave.

285
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,241
Mother, didn't you say that you'll leave the manor's grand memorial service to both of us?

286
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:17,061
How could you hand her the household's authority?

287
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,140
She turned calamity into a blessing and has been rewarded by His Majesty.

288
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,820
I can only do this for now.

289
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,500
Don't panic.

290
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,100
Such a large manor isn't easy to manage.

291
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,060
Once she makes a mistake,

292
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,742
this family

293
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:38,420
will still be left to you.

294
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,100
Sister-in-law, you survived a catastrophe.

295
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,460
As expected, blessings rained down on you.

296
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,760
However, don't be too cocky about it.

297
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,480
This family isn't that easy to manage.

298
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,821
No matter how hard it is,

299
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:12,961
I don't need the wife of the second son to remind me.

300
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,720
Liu Jing Shu, don't think you can always trample over me.

301
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,260
I'll do just that.

302
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,660
Before my marriage, I did it with my talents.

303
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,980
Now that I'm married, I'll do so with my standing.

304
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,101
Someone stuck as the second for life will never make a comeback.

305
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,060
I'll kill you!

306
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,900
Help! Help!

307
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,760
You're fighting! You're fighting!

308
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,820
Ghost! The drowned ghost is here for revenge!

309
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,740
What did you say? Why did you call me a drowned ghost?

310
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,180
Don't take revenge on me!

311
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,380
It was her! She pushed you into the water! It's none of my business!

312
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,820
Lunatic, what are you saying?

313
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,460
She pushed you into the water!

314
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,860
Splash! Splash!

315
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,140
Let go of me.

316
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,580
She deserves to drown to death! She also deserves to be killed for revenge!

317
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,741
It's none of my business!

318
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:06,361
None of my business!

319
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,320
Don't listen to her rubbish! She's a lunatic!

320
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,140
When did you ever push me into the lake?

321
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,500
Where is that lake?

322
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,020
Are you related to my memory loss?

323
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,420
Talk!

324
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,180
So what if that's true? You didn't die!

325
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,520
Meng Han Jiao, I'll make you pay!

326
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,780
I'll tell my uncle that you're bullying me!

327
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,780
The General's Manor won't be able to live properly!

328
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,260
Cut the crap!

329
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,900
Tell me everything that happened that day!

330
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,580
If you leave anything out,

331
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,780
I'll toss you into the river to feed the turtles!

332
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,300
I thought you were dead.

333
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,820
I ran home and hid there.

334
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,340
After that, I heard that you ran away from your marriage.

335
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,860
I was happy that you'd never appear before me again.

336
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,661
In the end, you still married into the Marquis' Manor!

337
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:49,958
All you do is oppose me!

338
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,620
Move out of the way! A good dog doesn't obstruct the path!

339
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,340
Liu Jing Shu, are you here at the Marquis' Manor as a thief or a guest?

340
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,940
We're all sitting in the main hall, but you're the only one in the backyard.

341
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,861
What are you plotting?

342
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,401
That's none of your business!

343
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,620
You haven't even wedded, but you're already putting on airs!

344
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,420
What's so impressive about you? You're just marrying the heir.

345
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,660
He's just lazy and a frivolous womanizer!

346
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,940
What a pity! Some people just love frivolous wastrels!

347
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,940
They even wailed to Grand Preceptor Meng so many times.

348
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,660
Do you think I'm clueless?

349
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,540
What can I do? The capital's Second Madam will always be second.

350
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,260
You can only marry the second son!

351
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,981
Once I kill you, I'll be number one!

352
00:27:33,981 --> 00:27:36,704
I'll be the top!

353
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:38,180
Meng Han Jiao!

354
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,940
What are you doing?

355
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,260
Let go of me!

356
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,060
I didn't do this on purpose! You deserved this!

357
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,940
It was just a quarrel.

358
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,620
How could you shove me into the lake and try to kill me?

359
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,020
I didn't try to kill you!

360
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,540
I only shoved you out of anger!

361
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,420
You shoved me in a fit of anger,

362
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,900
but didn't you choose to stay quiet instead of calling for help after I fell in?

363
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,580
Do you hate me that much?

364
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,980
Yes, I hate you!

365
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,580
Blame yourself for trampling over me all the time!

366
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,620
You deserve to drown to death!

367
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,901
The price of murder is death.

368
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:20,763
Have a taste of drowning to death!

369
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,233
Help!

370
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,900
Stop!

371
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,620
What are you doing? No matter how unreasonable she is, she's still your sister-in-law.

372
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,320
She's inhuman! I'll kill her!

373
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,020
I merely shoved you into the lake.

374
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,220
You didn't drown to death. Must you be so extreme?

375
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,300
Shut up! Get lost!

376
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,540
If you have the guts, talk when you're in the lake.

377
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,780
Calm down. My brother will punish her for that.

378
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,700
If you try to punish her yourself, you'll only spark gossip.

379
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,260
I don't care. I'll die with her.

380
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,000
Shut up! This is the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor, not a place for you to run wild.

381
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,820
Xiao Ren Yan, all you do is berate me.

382
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,541
Why don't you care about Meng Han Jiao's audacious acts?

383
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,581
Why don't you care about her falling into the lake?

384
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:02,020
Her? Who's that?

385
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,440
Weren't you the one who fell into the lake?

386
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,820
You misheard me.

387
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,320
I fell into the lake.

388
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,460
- Hold on.
- Let go of me.

389
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,720
Jing Shu, you misunderstood me.

390
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,080
How dare you trespass in the Imperial Clan Affairs Office!

391
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,900
I deserve death. Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

392
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,140
Rise and have a seat.

393
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

394
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,261
Why is Your Majesty here?

395
00:30:00,261 --> 00:30:03,521
I came to see the place you make engagements.

396
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,067
The brothels are crowded and unruly.

397
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:08,580
Your Majesty shouldn't have entered this place so easily.

398
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,140
It's fine. I came here tonight

399
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,740
to relay a piece of important news.

400
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,380
What important news is this?

401
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,587
Why must you relay it yourself?

402
00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:21,348
You mentioned that your subjects couldn't find anything about the private mine's manager.

403
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:23,589
So I sent undercover guards to investigate.

404
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:27,150
I found out that person is your stepmother's extended relative.

405
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,310
Zhang Yuan Qing?

406
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:34,420
I thought she was an extended relative of the Meng family,

407
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,923
using the Meng family's prestige to put on airs.

408
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:40,120
I didn't know that she had such profits at her hands.

409
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,780
Grand Preceptor Meng really killed two birds with one stone.

410
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,821
He has Zhang Yuan Qing serving him from the Marquis' Manor.

411
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:47,462
If the private mine is exposed,

412
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:50,223
he can make the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor his scapegoat.

413
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,963
He'll be able to evade punishment.

414
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:55,100
Presently, my father is unconscious.

415
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,620
It's easy for him to make us the scapegoat.

416
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,840
What a despicable and sly old man.

417
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,680
Grand Preceptor Meng holds immense power.

418
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,461
Without incriminating evidence,

419
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:06,262
I can't declare him my enemy.

420
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:11,564
However, you have to find the ledger and seal their doom.

421
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:13,380
I understand.

422
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,740
Grand Preceptor Meng's ledger should be with his housekeeper.

423
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,600
I know where he's hiding it.

424
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,420
I can feel that my sister is still alive.

425
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,180
But if Meng Han Jiao really committed murder,

426
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,920
there's no reason for the Marquis' Manor to cover up for her.

427
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,380
Move out of the way! A good dog doesn't obstruct the path!

428
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,140
Liu Jing Shu, are you here at the Marquis' Manor as a thief or a guest?

429
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,980
We're all sitting in the main hall,

430
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,780
but you're the only one in the backyard.

431
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,620
What are you plotting?

432
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,820
That's none of your business!

433
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,820
Meng Han Jiao wouldn't lie to me,

434
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,980
but why did my sister go to the backyard that day?

435
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,880
Why did she see to run away in such panic?

436
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
The backyard...

437
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,940
Zhang Yuan Qing?

438
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,680
The Ancestral Hall.

439
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,760
Zhang Yuan Qing has complete control over who enters and leaves the Ancestral Hall.

440
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,140
There must be something off in here.

441
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,720
The candles?

442
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,460
I get it.

443
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,680
Damn! Someone's here.

444
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,900
That's strange. The Ancestral Hall's doors are usually locked.

445
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,260
Why aren't they locked today?

446
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,780
Seems like I'm not the only visitor.

447
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,089
Come out!

448
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,280
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

449
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,320
What are you doing here?

450
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,480
I'm here to look for evidence of Zhang Yuan Qing using poison.

451
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,160
What about you? Why are you here?

452
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,120
I'm also here to find evidence for Zhang Yuan Qing's deeds.

453
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,280
The same.

454
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,680
One, two, three.

455
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,100
There must be something wrong with this Ancestral Hall.

456
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,020
That's right. I've searched for a long time but failed to find clues.

457
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,000
That's because you're a man.

458
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,082
What has that got to do with being a man?

459
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:49,422
That's because tidying the Ancestral Hall is a woman's task.

460
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,001
Zhang Yuan Qing lit the candles of the Ancestral Hall herself for years.

461
00:33:56,001 --> 00:34:00,720
This is the only pair out of over 200 candles that have never been lit.

462
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,440
Here's my guess.

463
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,862
The mechanism lies here.

464
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,620
Impressive!

465
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,640
A woman's instinct.

466
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,200
It seems like this is Zhang Yuan Qing's secret hideout.

467
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,180
She has really kept her true nature well hidden.

468
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,740
Zhang Yuan Qing even managed to build this large secret room under the Ancestral Hall.
