[Fated to Love You]

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,430
[Episode 6]

3
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,360
Zhang Yuan Qing has complete control over who enters and leaves the Ancestral Hall.

4
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,740
There must be something off in here.

5
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,520
The candles?

6
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,160
I get it.

7
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,280
Damn! Someone's here.

8
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,600
That's strange. The Ancestral Hall's doors are usually locked.

9
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,960
Why aren't they locked today?

10
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,880
Seems like I'm not the only visitor.

11
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
Come out!

12
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,880
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

13
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,020
What are you doing here?

14
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,080
I'm here to look for evidence of Zhang Yuan Qing using poison.

15
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,880
What about you? Why are you here?

16
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,940
I'm also here to find evidence for Zhang Yuan Qing's deeds.

17
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,880
The same.

18
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,280
One, two, three.

19
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,800
There must be something wrong with this Ancestral Hall.

20
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,680
That's right. I've searched for a long time but failed to find clues.

21
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,600
That's because you're a man.

22
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,880
What has that got to do with being a man?

23
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,120
That's because tidying the Ancestral Hall is a woman's task.

24
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,700
Zhang Yuan Qing lit the candles of the Ancestral Hall herself for years.

25
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,421
This is the only pair out of over 200 candles that have never been lit.

26
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,100
Here's my guess.

27
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,460
The mechanism lies here.

28
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,420
Impressive!

29
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,474
A woman's instinct.

30
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
It seems like this is Zhang Yuan Qing's secret hideout.

31
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,554
She has really kept her true nature well hidden.

32
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:22,170
Zhang Yuan Qing even managed to build this large secret room under the Ancestral Hall.

33
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,850
A map.

34
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,681
That's...

35
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,520
A hairpin?

36
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,560
This hairpin is...

37
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
We can't stay here for long.

38
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,920
Let's talk outside.

39
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,900
- Come on.
- Okay.

40
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,840
This fan clearly belongs to a man.

41
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,960
Did Xiao Ming leave it there when he was in that secret room?

42
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,400
Chang Ming?

43
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,120
Is Xiao Ming's name Chang Ming?

44
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,000
Grand Master Meng Hui's name is Chang Ming.

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,500
Grand Master Meng?

46
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,560
Grand Master Meng and Zhang Yuan Qing...

47
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,140
Well, you...

48
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

49
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,180
She's not my mother.

50
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,460
The blood in my veins belongs to the Xiao family.

51
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
- Hurry.
- Don't pull me!

52
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,100
- Faster.
- The melon seeds are scattering. Stop pulling me!

53
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,000
Get a brain. Go.

54
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,200
Wait here for me. Stop looking around.

55
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,020
Talk nicely. Why must you grab me?

56
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,920
Why are you here? We are not open today.

57
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,200
How did you get in?

58
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,180
I'm here for Sister Hong.

59
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,460
That's me. You can talk.

60
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,380
Oh, so you're the one.

61
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,080
My granddaughter is as pretty as a fairy.

62
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,100
I'm sure she's worth a hundred taels or so.

63
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,360
It's good that she's pretty,

64
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,120
but she looks rather foolish.

65
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,160
Who knows if she can be trained well?

66
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,701
She's a good learner.

67
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:48,341
If she can't learn, just beat her until she does.

68
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:50,580
State your price.

69
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,600
At least a hundred taels.

70
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,960
A hundred taels? Look.

71
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,660
She has already fled.

72
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,960
Fled?

73
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,560
She won't be far. I'll look for her.

74
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,400
Another worrying one.

75
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,760
Goodness.

76
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,561
Are there thieves in brothels? Why have they locked up everything in the day?

77
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,160
This must be a fine lady's room.

78
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,841
It's so nice.

79
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:36,001
I wish I could stay in such a place.

80
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,520
What is that sound?

81
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,960
My wife?

82
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,800
Wife?

83
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,040
Where did she go?

84
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,140
Once I catch you, I'll beat you to death.

85
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,160
She's finally gone. I'm safe.

86
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,160
This is an imperial envoy's token.

87
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,160
It wields the same authority as an official, got it?

88
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,680
Who gave that to you?

89
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,520
That's none of your business.

90
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,621
If you take me to the government office to make a report, I won't pursue this matter with you.

91
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,800
What crime did I commit?

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,180
This appears to be a brothel,

93
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,640
but it trafficks humans.

94
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,600
A man like you can't be a courtesan.

95
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,480
Besides, you're here at this time of the day.

96
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm sure you aren't a customer.

97
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,500
So I think you're definitely—

98
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,200
What in the world is going on?

99
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,840
That old widow picked her up by the river.

100
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,240
She was wearing these clothes on that day.

101
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,300
The old widow kept this jade pendant in a box.

102
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,800
I've checked.

103
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,840
The carving on this jade pendant is General Liu's family emblem.

104
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,480
General Liu?

105
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,080
Is she Liu Jing Shu?

106
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,500
Yes. Even though the old widow mentioned memory loss,

107
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,760
she's certainly the eldest daughter of the Liu family.

108
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,840
The top lady of the capital, Liu Jing Shu.

109
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,560
Madam.

110
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,000
You're truly the daughter of a general.

111
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,966
Of course.

112
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,640
In the capital,

113
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,160
everyone praises the daughter of the Liu family to have ethereal beauty.

114
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,460
Why have I never heard any praise about your excellent martial arts?

115
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,160
Where did you hide them in the past?

116
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,600
- How is that possible?
- Stand still!

117
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,860
Stand still!

118
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,780
Why are you running off?

119
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,880
Why is your temper so bad today?

120
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,260
Did something annoy you?

121
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,140
Are there new clues about Zhang Yuan Qing?

122
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,821
A married couple should be honest with each other.

123
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:36,360
She was never of one mind with my father.

124
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,760
She's been hiding so many secrets for years.

125
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,980
The more I investigate, the more appalled I get.

126
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,600
Madam.

127
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,640
We can't be like that.

128
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,261
Of course, why would we be like that?

129
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,400
How about we finish this game of chess?

130
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
Sure.

131
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,440
If you're keeping secrets from me, tell me right away.

132
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,600
No matter what happens, I won't hold it against you.

133
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,780
Why would I be keeping secrets from you?

134
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,820
Are you sure?

135
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,241
Why are you being so doubtful?

136
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,981
I'm unlike Zhang Yuan Qing.

137
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,060
Where did you get this jade pendant?

138
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,380
Of course, it's from you, the Eldest Miss Liu, My Mady.

139
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,300
Where did I get it?

140
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,860
I found it after you accidentally lost it.

141
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,202
Xiao Ren Yan, you know everything, don't you?

142
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,400
Don't beat around the bush with me.

143
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,680
This is my older sister Liu Jing Shu's personal item.

144
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,160
Have you found her?

145
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,280
Older sister?

146
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,680
My older sister, Liu Jing Shu, was bestowed marriage with you by His Majesty.

147
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,680
A few days before the wedding, she was invited to visit the Marquis of Xuanpaing's Manor.

148
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,360
From then on, she has been missing.

149
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,280
Who are you then?

150
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,640
I am Liu Jia.

151
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,220
My sister and I are twins.

152
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,340
She is the official child,

153
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,780
I am... the evil child.

154
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,830
How could you hide such a huge matter from me for so long?

155
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,120
You are really something, Liu Jia!

156
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,400
Xia Ren Yan, I am sorry about it.

157
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,700
But my older sister doesn't know anything about it. It's completedly unrelated to her.

158
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,600
Can you please let her go? She is your wife, after all.

159
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:32,267
What about you? What is our relationship?

160
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,400
It's my fault to involve you into an injustice.

161
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,321
From now on, whatever you wish,

162
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:40,181
I will go through fire and water to comply.

163
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,700
I don't need anyone to go through fire and water for me.

164
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,460
Look into my eyes.

165
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,060
Tell me.

166
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,340
Have you never liked me?

167
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,980
Never.

168
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,060
Fine.

169
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,680
Since your older sister is the one bestowed marriage by His Majesty,

170
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,680
then you should call me brother-in-law.

171
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,400
All these days, you've been intimate with your brother-in-law.

172
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,280
While we were in the midst of deep affection,

173
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,060
didn't you feel sorry toward your sister?

174
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,900
I entered the manor in order to find my older sister.

175
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,747
All these days, it's also for my sister's sake that I played along with you.

176
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:36,400
Played along?

177
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,360
Yes, I played along.

178
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,041
If you can play along with Zhang Xue Fei, why can't I?

179
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,180
Shut up.

180
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,840
Get out of here.

181
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,960
Get out!

182
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,006
Don't let me see you again.

183
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,480
Xiao Ren Yan, my older sister—

184
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,960
Don't worry.

185
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,640
I will take care of your older sister.

186
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,160
I'll love her and make it up to her.

187
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,980
After all, she is truly my wife.

188
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,840
From now on,

189
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,560
in the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor, and wherever I am,

190
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,460
there won't be any place for you.

191
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,300
Fine.

192
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,140
I wish you two to grow old together.

193
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,050
Xiao Ren Yan, forgive me for doing it this way.

194
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,520
Now that you've found my older sister,

195
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,221
she and I cannot stay by your side at the same time.

196
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,260
[General Liu's Manor]

197
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,360
It's good that you've brought her back.

198
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,860
Ever since she got amnesia after getting sick, she's been listless.

199
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,180
Mother-in-law,

200
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,740
I already know everything.

201
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,120
She is Liu Jing Shu, not Liu Jia.

202
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,160
In the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor, it may look calm on the surface

203
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,000
but turbulance abounds.

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,440
I deliberately had a fight with my wife this time

205
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,160
so I could bring the older sister back to where she belongs.

206
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

207
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,660
It's not necessary to be so courteous, Mother-in-law.

208
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,020
Liu Jia is my wife.

209
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,460
For my in-laws, I'm willing to go through hardship and suffering.

210
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,240
Bright and early this morning,

211
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,520
Liu Jing Shu already went back to her home.

212
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,740
Clearly, the two of them had a huge fight.

213
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,180
Greetings, Old Madam, Second Young Madam.

214
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,580
Han Jiao, go ahead and return to your room.

215
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,071
I...

216
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Yes.

217
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,420
Speak. What did you find out?

218
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,261
The wife to our Marquis' heir isn't Liu Jing Shu.

219
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,640
My older sister Liu Jing Shu was bestowed marriage with you by His Majesty.

220
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,600
A few days before the wedding, she was invited to visit the Marquis of Xuanpaing's Manor.

221
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,280
From then on, she has been missing.

222
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,200
Who are you then?

223
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,660
I am Liu Jia.

224
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,240
My sister and I are twins.

225
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,160
She is the official child.

226
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,740
I am... the evil child.

227
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,640
So I see.

228
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,600
I was wondering.

229
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,700
How is it that Liu Jing Shu, when she married into our manor,

230
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,160
was entirely different from the Liu Jing Shu we saw originally?

231
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,700
General Liu's Manor actually has hidden an evil twin.

232
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,520
They even let the evil twin substitute Liu Jing Shu to marry into the Marquis' Manor.

233
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,940
Twins?

234
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,360
That brainless beauty who came before the wedding

235
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,680
was Liu Jing Shu.

236
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,250
But the one who married into the manor was the twin, Liu Jia, who has been hidden by General Liu since she was born.

237
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,080
This is wonderful, Yuan Qing.

238
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,360
Heaven is helping us!

239
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,760
What do you plan to do?

240
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,880
Capturing both of these women

241
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,480
would be the same as capturing General Liu.

242
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,360
Xiao Ren Yan married the evil twin.

243
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,540
He can't escape, either.

244
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,264
Did I write all of these books?

245
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,280
Older Sister wrote these books under an alias.

246
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Whenever a new book is published, it's always sold out.

247
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,440
When you were missing, all the bookstores were looking for you.

248
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,560
Court officials occupy their positions without being productive.

249
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,540
Women are relied upon to serve the country faithfully.

250
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,780
Older Sister, you write really well.

251
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,800
What's this about keeping the official one alive but killing the evil twin?

252
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,640
We both came from the same maternal womb. How can one be killed while the other is allowed to live?

253
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,200
Heaven is benevolent to all living things.

254
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,440
Why do humans kill newborn babies?

255
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,480
This is a terrible law.

256
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,660
Although you are an amnesiac,

257
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,080
you are still kind and warm-hearted.

258
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,720
Jia'er, we are twins from the same maternal womb.

259
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,280
In this world, we are the closest ones.

260
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,300
Regardless of my memory, this fact stays the same.

261
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,780
Older Sister, I want to tell you about something.

262
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,805
Just say it.

263
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,600
Xiao Ren Yan.

264
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,121
He is supposed to be your husband

265
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:35,101
and my brother-in-law.

266
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,940
But I...

267
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
about him...

268
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,241
Mother-in-law...

269
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:50,340
In-law, Son-in-law said he'd let her stay here for a few days before taking her back.

270
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,060
How can the newlyweds live separately?

271
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,760
Little ones are immature. We older people must think for them.

272
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,640
But she has a contagious disease.

273
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,080
I'm afraid it'll harm your health.

274
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,400
I really must see her, then.

275
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,120
Jing Shu, I'm taking you home.

276
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,100
Isn't Jing Shu just fine?

277
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,880
I heard that you had an argument with the marquis' heir.

278
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,380
What exactly upset you so much that you returned to your home?

279
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't really know.

280
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,580
When I woke up, I was already here in the Liu Manor.

281
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,480
As to what exactly happned, I don't really remember clearly.

282
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,700
I heard that you also got sick and lost your memory before the wedding.

283
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,480
Wedding?

284
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,700
Did I marry into your manor?

285
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,300
Don't try to remember if you can't remember.

286
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,300
I'll send you to the Buddhist Temple on the city's outskirts to recuperate.

287
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,530
Once you've recuperated, you'll probably recall your memories.

288
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,180
Stop right there!

289
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,960
- Xiao Ren Yan, I—
- I wasn't talking about you.

290
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,580
Come here.

291
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,700
Put me down now!

292
00:23:45,672 --> 00:23:47,920
Why would you go away with Xhang Yuan Qing?

293
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,180
Are you crazy?

294
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,480
Mother-in-law came to pick me up. Why wouldn't I leave with her?

295
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,560
There are many guards at the Liu Manor.

296
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,520
If you didn't want to go, could she forcefully grab you?

297
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,420
- Mother-in-law ordered me. How would I dare—
- Don't pretend anymore.

298
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,980
How did you know it's me?

299
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,480
If I can't even recognize the person who sleeps next to me,

300
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,780
it'd be unnecessary for me to continue.

301
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,160
Since I can't hide from Your Highness' sharp eyes,

302
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,140
do as you wish, kill me or slice me into pieces.

303
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,160
Liu Jia, what did you call me just now?

304
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,660
Didn't Your Highness say so already?

305
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,140
There is no place for me in the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor,

306
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,840
nor in Your Highness' heart.

307
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,564
Older Sister is your true wife.

308
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,680
You were the one who lied to me first and forced me to talk harshly.

309
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,280
Now you used my words to block me.

310
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,180
Liu Jia, I've never been manipulated by anyone like this.

311
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,200
Didn't I say it already?

312
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,480
Kill me or slice me into pieces, do as you wish.

313
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,040
I won't kill you or slice you into pieces.

314
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,880
I'll punish you to stay by my side forever.

315
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,280
Take my bidding.

316
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,680
Let me torment you.

317
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,600
Let me love and pamper you.

318
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,040
Xiao Ren Yan, can we really be together?

319
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,580
Why can't we?

320
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,460
As the evil twin, I'll bring trouble to you.

321
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,500
Haven't I also dragged you into the turbulence in the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor?

322
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,480
I don't care whose daughter you are, whose sister you are.

323
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,040
In my heart, I only care that you are Liu Jia.

324
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,640
You are my wife.

325
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,160
Imperial Physician Wang came to make a diagnosis today.

326
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,940
He actually said his pulse has improved.

327
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,980
Why are you scared?

328
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,940
With the way he is, even if he doesn't die,

329
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,680
he will be a living dead.

330
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I followed your order to capture Liu Jing Shu.

331
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,040
Unexpectedly, Xiao Ren Yan stopped me again midway.

332
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,920
He is always a nuisance. How will our Ming'er ever—

333
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,200
Cheating...

334
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,160
Cheating man and woman!

335
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,640
You adulterous man and woman!

336
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
Servants!

337
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,820
Servants!

338
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,000
You should die!

339
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,720
You should die!

340
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,400
What do we do now?

341
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,820
We might as well go the whole way.

342
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,100
Tell Xiao Ren Yan to come here.

343
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,460
Say that his father is asking for him.

344
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,600
Your Highness, Madam, Marquis is waiting for you inside.

345
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,460
Is my father awake?

346
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,700
Father.

347
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,740
Father?

348
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,540
Father!

349
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,580
Father! Father!

350
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,880
Father!

351
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,140
Father!

352
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,380
Xiao Ren Yan, you actually killed your father!

353
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,420
Xiao Ren Yan, you are so perverse

354
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,740
as to commit patricide. Heaven won't tolerate you.

355
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,620
This time, even the gods won't save you.

356
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,400
Servants, report to the authorities!

357
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,100
Wait!

358
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:34,301
I came in along with His Highness and found His Grace to be dead already.

359
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:35,601
You came late.

360
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:38,521
Why makes you say that he was killed by His Highness?

361
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,100
I'm relying on this.

362
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,540
The marquis woke up late at night.

363
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:49,361
He thought the rebellious and unfilial marquis' heir to be unqualified in his important role.

364
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,460
He asked me to write a memorial in the middle of the night

365
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,020
to change to Xiao Ming as the Marquis' Heir.

366
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,100
He made me write it up during the night.

367
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,430
He signed and stamped his seal.

368
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,740
[Marquis of Xuanping's Memorial]

369
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,540
Xiao Ren Yan knew that his heir's position was not secure,

370
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,580
so he came up with an evil idea.

371
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,260
He actually strangled his own father alive.

372
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,580
How did you know I strangled him?

373
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,040
You all never got close to His Grace after you entered the room.

374
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,620
You've been standing at a distance.

375
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,160
His Grace is even covered with a blanket.

376
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,440
How did you know he was strangled to death?

377
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,320
Unless you were present when His Grace died,

378
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,680
or you are the killer.

379
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,920
This is ridiculous.

380
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,080
The wound on Father's neck is so clear.

381
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
One can see they are made with a man's hands.

382
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,320
How could my mother have strangled him?

383
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,200
To evade the blame, Eldest Brother and Sister-in-law

384
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,980
are even trying to frame my mother!

385
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,260
No more talking with this brat who killed his own father.

386
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,300
Hurry and tie him up to send to the authorities.

387
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,480
Who dares to make a move?

388
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,020
My father is the Marquis of Xuanping.

389
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,480
When an imperial noble suddenly dies, the Imperial Clan Affairs Office will do the autopsy and draw a conclusion.

390
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,660
This time,

391
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,420
between you and me,

392
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,920
one of us will accompany my father to the netherworld.

393
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,920
Madam!

394
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,180
How are things? What did you find out?

395
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,860
The outside is full of gossip that the marquis was strangled to death by the heir.

396
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,280
The heir's young servant secretly passed a message to me,

397
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,640
saying that the heir has already been arrested by the Imperial Clan Affairs Office.

398
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,480
- We'll go to Hong He to discuss what to do.
- All right.

399
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,180
Stand still!

400
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,140
Liu Jing Shu.

401
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,020
Your husband is in the imperial jail.

402
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,681
Are you rushing over to keep him company?

403
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:01,281
You...

404
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,220
I want to go back to my home.

405
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,000
This is truly as they say, "Husband and wife are like birds on the same tree"

406
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
"that fly separately away when there is disaster."

407
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Why are you pointing fingers at me?

408
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,200
I sure would like to see, when Xiao Ming is jailed, will you still act like a loving wife?

409
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,420
How dare you curse my husband!

410
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,740
Jing Shu, although Xiao Ren Yan has committed the heinous crime of patricide,

411
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,880
you and he are not divorced yet, so you are still his wife.

412
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,980
How can you go home without any regard or care?

413
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,500
Then... what do you think I should do?

414
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,580
Zhang Xue Fei is pregnant with Xiao Ren Yan's baby.

415
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,800
Xiao Ren Yan won't be able to escape from execution this time.

416
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,940
But we can at least keep a descendant for him.

417
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,680
Later on, the descendant will take care of you until you are old, right?

418
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,060
I'll entrust her to you then.

419
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,000
Take good care of her.

420
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,640
Madam.

421
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,960
Go ahead and get settled first.

422
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,200
Take good care of your pregnancy.

423
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,900
Yes.

424
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,000
Madam,

425
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,120
why is Zhang Xue Fei pregnant as soon as His Highness is jailed by the Imperial Clan Affairs Office?

426
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,520
Even you think it's fishy, it must be faked.

427
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,320
They think I'm my older sister, so they would dare to do anything.

428
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,100
What do we do now?

429
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,080
When the enemy doesn't make a move, I stay still.

430
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,600
Baby, I hope your grandmother will keep her promise.

431
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,376
Once this matter is concluded, she'll let us unite with your father.

432
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:11,960
Concubine, Old Madam told me to serve Swallow's Nest Porridge for your supplement.

433
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:25,542
Thank you for saving me, Your Majesty.

434
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,140
No need for thanks between us. Just sit down.

435
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

436
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,600
You've suffered in the Imperial Clan Affairs Office.

437
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,300
I listened to you and ordered an old coroner to check the marquis' corpse.

438
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,440
It was indeed odd.

439
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,340
This is the mark of a jade pendant left by the marquis.

440
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,520
I want to find an expert to decipher the mark.

441
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,660
This mark looks like Grand Master Meng's.

442
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,340
Grand Master?

443
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,980
How could it be him?

444
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,120
You'd have to ask Zhang Yuan Qing.

445
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,560
The grudge of killing my father is irreconcilable.

446
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,360
I must make them pay for the blood debt.

447
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,160
Grand Master Meng holds immense power.

448
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,040
Without any witness or evidence,

449
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,440
this jade pendant's mark isn't sufficient to prove that he is the killer.

450
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,240
The most urgent matter now is still finding the ledger

451
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,180
in order to knock down Grand Master Meng in one strike.

452
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,700
Zhang Yuan Qing has the ledger.

453
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,100
I must hurry back to the manor to search.

454
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,080
You can't rush on this matter.

455
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
You can hide here for a couple of days.

456
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,481
Once I return to the palace, I will find a way to exonerate you.

457
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,120
Yes.

458
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,090
Strange. Why would Xiao Ren Yan write a letter to me?

459
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,680
[I'm fine at the same old place. Don't worry.]
