[Fated to Love You]

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,400
[Episode 7]

3
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,680
Thank you for saving me, Your Majesty.

4
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,160
No need for thanks between us. Just sit down.

5
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

6
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,660
You've suffered in the Imperial Clan Affairs Office.

7
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,360
I listened to you and order an old coroner to check the marquis' corpse.

8
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,550
It was indeed odd.

9
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,300
This is the mark of a jade pendant left by the marquis.

10
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,762
I want to find an expert to decipher the mark.

11
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,720
This mark looks like Grand Master Meng's.

12
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,300
Grand Master?

13
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,940
How could it be him?

14
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,180
You'd have to ask Zhang Yuan Qing.

15
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,620
The grudge of killing my father is irreconcilable.

16
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,420
I must make them pay for the blood debt.

17
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,220
Grand Master Meng holds immense power.

18
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,159
Without any witness or evidence,

19
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,500
this jade pendant's mark isn't sufficient to prove that he is the killer.

20
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,340
The most urgent matter now is still finding the ledger

21
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,240
in order to knock down Grand Master Meng in one strike.

22
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,760
Zhang Yuan Qing has the ledger.

23
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,160
I must hurry back to the manor to search.

24
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,040
You can't rush this matter.

25
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
You can hide here for a couple of days.

26
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,501
Once I return to the palace, I will find a way to exonerate you.

27
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,080
Yes.

28
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,140
Strange. Why would Xiao Ren Yan write a letter to me?

29
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,540
[I'm fine at the same old place. Don't worry.]

30
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,940
My Lord, someone wants to meet you.

31
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,323
Thanks, Pretty Lady.

32
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,161
Why are you here?

33
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:17,144
I'm here to congratulate you on becoming a dad.

34
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:19,260
Are you pregnant?

35
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,300
Nonsense. I never did anything with you.

36
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,980
Yes, it's all my fault for being incompetent.

37
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,440
I didn't try hard enough, so you refuse to do anything with me.

38
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,860
That isn't the case with Zhang Xue Fei.

39
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,000
The imperial physician already said that she was pregnant. I bet she'll deliver a chubby son for you.

40
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,401
Wife, I'm innocent.

41
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,801
I never laid a hand on Zhang Xue Fei.

42
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:41,960
Please investigate thoroughly.

43
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,360
I'll only have a child with you in this life.

44
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,320
I'm not having a child with you.

45
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,020
All right, let's get to business.

46
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,461
Zhang Xue Fei's child has to be a ploy by Zhang Yuan Qing.

47
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,600
I can't return to the Marquis' Manor for now.

48
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,820
Zhang Yuan Qing thinks I'm locked up in the Imperial Clan Affairs Prison.

49
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,937
She'll scrutinize you. You have to be careful.

50
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:04,480
Since she's plotting my downfall,

51
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,560
I'll scheme against her and catch her red-handed.

52
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,940
Besides, Zhang Xue Fei is the key to this matter.

53
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,740
I asked Wei Hong He to keep a close eye on her.

54
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,917
We're bound to have leads.

55
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,780
Jia'er, you're too trusting of other men.

56
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,381
I already trust that Zhang Xue Fei isn't pregnant with your child.

57
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,620
Don't I trust you enough?

58
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,320
You're very dutiful and wise.

59
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,120
I can only return the favor by offering myself to you.

60
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,680
Oh, no!

61
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,500
Madam, there's trouble!

62
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,620
Calm down and take your time to talk.

63
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,500
- Zhang... Zhang Xue Fei is dead!
- What?

64
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,620
The manor's imperial physician said that someone poisoned her bird's nest soup.

65
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,871
Two lives were lost!

66
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,810
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

67
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,860
Madam, the windows and doors have been locked. What do we do?

68
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,300
I'm not even anxious. Why are you so flustered?

69
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,754
Take a seat and enjoy a cup of tea.

70
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:20,900
This isn't the time to be enjoying tea!

71
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,120
Men!

72
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,240
Liu Jing Shu, how dare you poison and kill Yan'er's only heir.

73
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,180
The Marquis of Xuanping's Manor can't keep a vicious woman like you.

74
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,960
You're accusing me of killing Zhang Xue Fei,

75
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,540
but where is her corpse?

76
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,300
I have to see that before I can admit to a crime.

77
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,320
If I don't see the corpse with my eyes,

78
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,020
how would I know if she's really dead?

79
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,460
You'll see it once we're in the Judicial Court.

80
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,920
Men, arrest her!

81
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,620
Yes.

82
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
Move it!

83
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,780
- Madam.
- Move it!

84
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,680
Madam!

85
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,380
Stop!

86
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,102
How dare you touch her!

87
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,020
Get lost!

88
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,821
Why aren't you resisting?

89
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:21,401
I was waiting for you to save me.

90
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,000
Haven't you been arrested by the Imperial Clan Affairs Office?

91
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
Why are you here?

92
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,680
Make a guess.

93
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:33,080
Xiao Ren Yan, you're lawless and impudent.

94
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,180
How dare you break out of the prison?

95
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,440
Men, arrest both of them!

96
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,268
Let's see who dares to do that!

97
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,280
I think the lawless and impudent one is you.

98
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,100
Young Master Wei.

99
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,680
The show hasn't started.

100
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,080
How can the star leave the stage?

101
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,100
Zhang Xue Fei.

102
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,560
Aren't you dead?

103
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,020
Madam.

104
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,680
I served you for years.

105
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,620
I've been so loyal.

106
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,120
I never thought you'd brutally kill me!

107
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,100
I have a wretched life,

108
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,780
but the child in me

109
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,721
is your grandson, the son of Second Young Master!

110
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,880
Xue Fei, you've served me for years.

111
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,121
You haven't had your period for two months.

112
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:48,801
Did you really think I wouldn't notice?

113
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,640
Madam, please spare me.

114
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,336
How could you bear to kill me?

115
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,395
I didn't do it!

116
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:01,960
Liu Jing Shu poisoned you!

117
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,900
I'm seeking justice for you!

118
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,240
You were the one who told me

119
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,080
if I faked my own death to frame the wife of the Marquis' heir,

120
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,434
you'd let me hide in the manor for the time being.

121
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,260
Once the child is born,

122
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,960
you'll let Second Young Master take me in as a mistress.

123
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,080
I never thought you'd

124
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,580
order someone to forcefully poison me!

125
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,520
Utter lies!

126
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,880
How could I ever do that?

127
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,790
Are you still going to deny the truth at this stage?

128
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:37,140
Zhang Xue Fei, you...

129
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,760
What are you doing? I'm pregnant with the second young master's child!

130
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,820
How dare you!

131
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,700
Second Young Master wouldn't care about that bastard in you.

132
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,800
Old Madam already told us to eliminate this problem at its root.

133
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,340
Drink it!

134
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,140
Drink!

135
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,020
Women only know how to cry when they're in trouble.

136
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,500
Hey, Zhang Xue Fei.

137
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,020
Consider wisely.

138
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,360
Even if I save you now, Zhang Yuan Qing will surely try to silence you again.

139
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,950
Do you really want to die for no good reason?

140
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,960
Zhang Yuan Qing.

141
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,980
Since you're heartless,

142
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,621
I won't show any loyalty, either.

143
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:17,600
Are you still going to deny the truth at this stage?

144
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:20,980
This isn't a surprise.

145
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,180
An old hag like you didn't just use Zhang Xue Fei.

146
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,892
You even want to kill her to bury the truth.

147
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:30,681
What else do you have to say for yourself now?

148
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,520
Zhang Xue Fei, I've always been generous to you!

149
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,580
Why are you colluding with others to ruin me?

150
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,880
Second Madam, you're really stubborn to the bitter end.

151
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm a First Rank Lady under the imperial mandate.

152
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,640
How dare you pin a crime on me just because of a brat's words.

153
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:03,600
Since you're bent on accusing me,

154
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,680
I'll head back and wait for the Imperial Clan Affairs Office to arrest you.

155
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,080
We're leaving.

156
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,200
Are we just going to let her leave?

157
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,500
She's just someone else's pawn.

158
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,940
She'll be useful to have around.

159
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,760
That's the only way for us to lure out the mastermind.

160
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,687
It's time to settle scores.

161
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:33,120
[Ancestral Hall]

162
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,320
Ming'er.

163
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,060
What are you doing?

164
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,080
Zhang Xue Fei knows too many secrets.

165
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,220
We have to leave the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor at once.

166
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,523
Don't worry, all preparations have been made.

167
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:52,623
Change into these clothes and come with me.

168
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,680
I'm the Marquis of Xuanping's heir.

169
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,400
Why should I leave?

170
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,360
Don't be silly.

171
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,280
Have you forgotten how the Marquis died?

172
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,740
How could I forget?

173
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,120
You killed Father.

174
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,440
Ming'er, I'm your mother.

175
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,260
You're my mother,

176
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,900
that's why you should pave my future for me.

177
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,690
I'm clueless about everything you did.

178
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,580
Men!

179
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,840
Zhang Yuan Qing viciously killed my father!

180
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,660
She's even trying to run away from her crimes!

181
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,560
Xiao Ming.

182
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,120
Do you think that making me the scapegoat for everything

183
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,280
will earn Xiao Ren Yan's forgiveness?

184
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,900
Xiao Ren Yan?

185
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,421
He can't even defend himself!

186
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,161
He doesn't have time to meddle with me.

187
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,000
Arrest her.

188
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,160
This is water boiled with pomelo leaves.

189
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,740
It can cleanse all the bad luck from the Imperial Clan Affairs Prison.

190
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,520
Thank you.

191
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,620
Jia'er.

192
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,720
You can wipe yourself. I'm leaving.

193
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
Hold on!

194
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,860
My wife, even though we experienced so many hardships,

195
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,500
I'm still glad I could marry you.

196
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,320
If you hadn't taken your sister's place in the marriage,

197
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,280
I would've lost the love of my life.

198
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,040
Jia'er.

199
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,080
It seems like the Heavens want us to be in love and grow old together.

200
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,420
But I'm still the evil child.

201
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,180
If someone finds out, you'll definitely be implicated.

202
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,580
You never did anything wrong.

203
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,820
The problem lies with those ridiculous ancient teachings that doom the second child as evil.

204
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,700
I'm not afraid of getting into trouble.

205
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,957
My only fear is losing you.

206
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,300
Jia'er, you suffered immensely after marrying me.

207
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,780
Once I help His Majesty eradicate the toxic Grand Master Meng,

208
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,480
I will take you away from the capital.

209
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,301
We will travel without care for worldly affairs.

210
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:57,820
We will enjoy a carefree life.

211
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,800
His Majesty? Have you been acting on His Majesty's orders this entire time?

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,480
My mother is His Majesty's aunt.

213
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,080
I grew up with His Majesty.

214
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,380
When my mother passed away,

215
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,840
my father's heart wavered.

216
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,240
He was bewitched by Zhang Yuan Qing

217
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,260
and even colluded with Grand Master Meng.

218
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,653
It was a moment of foolishness for His Grace.

219
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,301
Grand Master Meng holds great power. Disloyalty has festered within him for a long time.

220
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:30,460
I have to eliminate him for the nation and my own reasons.

221
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,800
But the former emperor trusted Grand Master Meng greatly.

222
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,640
Moreover, Grand Master Meng holds great authority.

223
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,380
Without sufficient evidence, you can't bring him down.

224
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,960
The evidence of Grand Master Meng's crimes lies with Zhang Yuan Qing.

225
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,040
"Zhang Yuan Qing"?

226
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,700
Are you willing to come to the Imperial Clan Affairs Office with me?

227
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,723
Chang Ming.

228
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,320
You've suffered.

229
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,420
I knew you'd come. Save me from this place.

230
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,240
You've committed the grave sin of matricide.

231
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,620
I can't help you.

232
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,700
Chang Ming, I've done so much for you over the years.

233
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,800
I even gave birth to Ming'er for you.

234
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,900
You have to save me.

235
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,840
I helped you become the Marchioness of Xuanping.

236
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,840
You enjoyed riches and luxuries as a First Rank Lady under the imperial mandate.

237
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,140
What else do you want?

238
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,200
You know that you're the only one I love.

239
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,940
For you and Ming'er,

240
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,640
I don't even care about being the Marchioness of Xuanping.

241
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,280
You made your own choices.

242
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,620
I didn't force you into anything.

243
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,180
Are you really going to abandon me?

244
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,640
Don't forget that you killed the Marquis of Xuanping.

245
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,220
- That private—
- I have a firm grip on my title as Grand Master.

246
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,120
I can still prevent your death.

247
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,560
If you implicate me,

248
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,860
you'll be doomed to death.

249
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,100
Before you speak, consider wisely.

250
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
If I can leave this place,

251
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,360
I'll keep my mouth shut.

252
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,460
If I can't...

253
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,480
I sure know a lot.

254
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,387
Fine, I'll get someone to save you from this place.

255
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,327
However, once you're out of here...

256
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,380
My lips will be sealed tight.

257
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:26,991
Marchioness of Xuanping.

258
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,320
Did Grand Master Meng send you to save me?

259
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,820
Yes.

260
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,140
Let's go.

261
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,580
Stop!

262
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,528
Don't chase after him.

263
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Are you two here to kill me, too?

264
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,820
We can kill you easily.

265
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,020
Why would we play along with your farce?

266
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,840
Take a good look at who is trying to kill you.

267
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,180
Meng Chang Ming.

268
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,420
How could he try to kill me?

269
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,060
You're hopelessly devoted to Grand Master Meng.

270
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,680
You committed arson and murder for him,

271
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,040
but this is how he treats you.

272
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,180
I really feel aggrieved for you.

273
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,950
Xiao Ren Yan.

274
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,060
You must be over the moon.

275
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,320
Don't you want me dead?

276
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,240
I don't care if you trust me or not.

277
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Xiao Ming has severed ties with you, and Grand Master Meng wants to kill you.

278
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,760
If you want to live, I'm the only one who can help you.

279
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,160
What do you want me to do?

280
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,760
I only have two questions for you.

281
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,440
Answer me, and I'll free you from the Imperial Clan Affairs Office.

282
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,240
What do you think?

283
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,660
What are your questions?

284
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,880
First, did Grand Master Meng murder my father?

285
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,140
Second, where did you hide the ledger for the private mine?

286
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,260
Xiao Ren Yan,

287
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,840
I really underestimated you.

288
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,960
You pretended to be a frivolous playboy for years,

289
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,520
but you've even dug up information about my private mine.

290
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,180
Do you think

291
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,660
I'll join hands with you just to save my life?

292
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,960
Back then, Chang Ming and I were in love.

293
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,880
Just because I was a concubine's child,

294
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,161
I was forced to marry your darned father as a mistress.

295
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:41,162
Your mother was a prideful woman who ignored my existence.

296
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,820
So what?

297
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,420
She died and I became the Marchioness.

298
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,297
Your father

299
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:56,640
indulged in wine and women.

300
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,390
He was useless and foolish.

301
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,520
He can't even be compared to my dear Chang Ming.

302
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,220
Right now, I'm doomed to be ruined by your hands.

303
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,547
I accept my fate.

304
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,880
But joining hands with you?

305
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,760
Dream on.

306
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:45,407
Meng... Chang... Ming.

307
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:58,440
Xiao Ren Yan, how will you find what you're looking for if she's dead?

308
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,620
Zhang Yuan Qing was captured all of a sudden.

309
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,080
She didn't have the chance to pass the ledger to someone else.

310
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,980
The ledger should be in the manor.

311
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,820
We'll definitely find it if we search the entire manor.

312
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,320
Xiao Ren Yan.

313
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,521
Let's find a place to bury her.

314
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,900
According to my father's will,

315
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,420
I should be appointed as the heir.

316
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,980
If I inherit the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor,

317
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,084
I'll be your ally, just like when my mother was alive.

318
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:44,220
The entire capital is filled with rumors about my involvement in the Marquis' death.

319
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,760
It isn't a good time for me to help you.

320
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,300
You may be unaware,

321
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,160
but Xiao Ren Yan has been searching through my mother's items in the manor.

322
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,980
What is he looking for?

323
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,070
Did he find anything?

324
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
The Marquis of Xuanping's manor isn't very big.

325
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,000
As long as he's determined, he'll find it eventually.

326
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:14,320
I mean well.

327
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,560
I'm worried that he will find something detrimental to you.

328
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,521
I heard my mother mention this before.

329
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,780
You have incriminating information

330
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,780
about General Liu's Manor and Xiao Ren Yan.

331
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,260
Grand Master, there isn't any time for delays.

332
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,740
Don't miss this chance.

333
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,660
I understand your intentions.

334
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:39,380
Don't worry.

335
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,020
I've already made arrangements regarding this matter.

336
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,360
I've found the midwife who delivered General Liu's child.

337
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,000
She will make a report to the emperor tomorrow.

338
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
General Liu's Manor will be exposed for concealing an evil child.

339
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This time, Liu Jia is doomed to die.

340
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,760
I'll be waiting for your good news with a peace of mind.

341
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,460
This rascal has unfettered ambition.

342
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,570
[General Liu's Manor]

343
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:26,310
Madam Liu, you sure are bold.

344
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,741
How dare you conceal an evil child!

345
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:30,420
Where is she? Get her out here.

346
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,340
Grand Master Meng, my husband has served as a general in many wars.

347
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,900
Spare my poor daughter! I'm begging you!

348
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,260
His Majesty has sent an imperial decree.

349
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,100
Your entire family will be penalized.

350
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,860
The evil child won't be the only one.

351
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,640
Every last one of you won't be able to escape.

352
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,200
Where is she?

353
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,160
Preposterous!

354
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,320
It's outrageous to force a parent to kill their child!

355
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,920
Are you trying to defy the imperial decree?

356
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,240
If the evil child doesn't appear, you'll be the one suffering the punishment!

357
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,460
Men, arrest her!

358
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,760
How can you disregard the law so brazenly?

359
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,660
Jing Shu, Jing Shu!

360
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,180
Jing Shu, are you all right?

361
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,460
I'm the evil child you're looking for!

362
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,840
Jing Shu!

363
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,300
Stop!

364
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,600
I'm Liu Jia, the evil child you're looking for.

365
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,261
His Majesty's token is with me.

366
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:43,761
Let's see who dares to act recklessly.

367
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,700
Xiao Ren Yan, how dare you defend the evil child!

368
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,620
You should be locked up as well!

369
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,552
I have His Majesty's orders to personally imprison Liu Jia in the imperial prison.

370
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:57,380
The rest of General Liu's Manor is to wait in the manor for orders.

371
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,040
Will you stop me from completing my task?

372
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,540
I was the one who seized the Liu family for the evil child.

373
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,600
I should be in charge of this case.

374
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,820
Do your wishes override the imperial decree?

375
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,700
Men, lock Liu Jia up in the prison.

376
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,260
Move it.

377
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,760
My wife, leave this to me. Don't worry.

378
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,600
Liu Jia, this isn't the end.

379
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,060
Fine!

380
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,560
Great!

381
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,320
Since His Majesty has issued a decree,

382
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,420
I will let this evil child live for a few more days.

383
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,900
Sister Jing Shu, wake up.

384
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,840
Sister Jing Shu.

385
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,720
Mother-in-law, please don't worry.

386
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
I will protect Jia'er.

387
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,200
You can't leave Liu Manor for now.

388
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,560
Please bear with this for a little longer.

389
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,220
Sure, I'll leave Jia'er to you.

390
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,460
Wait for me. I'll be back to save you.

391
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,460
You have to be careful out there.

392
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,440
Don't worry. I won't let anyone hurt you.

393
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,380
Boss! Boss!

394
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
Boss! Boss!

395
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,192
How can you still smile when Jia'er is locked up?

396
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:17,660
I have good news!

397
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,601
Sister Jing Shu regained her memories!

398
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,301
What?

399
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,160
[General Liu's Manor]

400
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,840
If it was so easy to regain my memories, I should've hit my own head sooner.

401
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,900
What happened after you arrived at the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor that day?

402
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,760
I wonder where Xiao Ren Yan lives.

403
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,360
There isn't a single servant in such a huge manor.

404
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,720
There's someone there. I'll ask them.

405
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,620
The Ancestral Hall?
[Ancestral Hall]

406
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,600
Yuan Qing, I've been too busy lately to visit you.

407
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,340
Chang Ming, it's fine.

408
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,300
Keep this ledger safe.

409
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,180
Who's there?

410
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,260
Liu Jing Shu?

411
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,240
Sister Jing Shu, take a break if it's too agonizing.

412
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,380
I'm fine.

413
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,960
Did you see Grand Master Meng in the Ancestral Hall?

414
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,440
I only found out later that he was Grand Preceptor Meng.

415
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,060
That day, I was in a hurry to flee.

416
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,060
But I ended up bumping into Meng Han Jiao.

417
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,102
Move out of the way! A good dog doesn't obstruct the path!

418
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:14,960
Liu Jing Shu, are you here at the Marquis' Manor as a thief or a guest?

419
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,560
We're all sitting in the main hall, but you're the only one in the backyard.

420
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,340
What are you plotting?

421
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,820
That's none of your business.

422
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,200
You haven't even been wedded, but you're already putting on airs!

423
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,040
What's so impressive about you? You're just marrying the heir.

424
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,113
He's just lazy and a frivolous womanizer!

425
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:35,420
What a pity! Some people just love frivolous wastrels!

426
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,520
They even wailed to Grand Preceptor Meng so many times.

427
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,140
Do you think I'm clueless?

428
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
What can I do?

429
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,060
What can I do? The capital's Second Madam will always be second.

430
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,740
You can only marry the second son!

431
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,621
Once I kill you, I'll be number one!

432
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:47,949
I'll be the top!

433
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
What are you doing?

434
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,400
I didn't do this on purpose! You deserved this!

435
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,960
Meng Han Jiao has always been at odds with me.

436
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,021
That day, she strangely picked a fight with me.

437
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:16,842
In a moment of anger, I insulted her a little.

438
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:19,783
I never thought she'd shove me into the lake!

439
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:22,404
Thank goodness I can swim.

440
00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:24,784
If I couldn't, I would've drowned.

441
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,221
When I climbed out of the lake,

442
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:34,520
I ended up seeing Zhang Yuan Qing and Grand Master Meng standing by the lake.

443
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,840
They knocked me out and dragged me into a secret room.

444
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,500
How did you escape?

445
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,640
A secret room can't trap me.

446
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,700
I overheard their discussion.

447
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,197
They were deciding whether to kill me or to let me live a little longer.

448
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:02,981
When they were leaving,

449
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,801
I feigned unconsciousness and escaped.

450
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:09,700
I really thought I was going to die at that moment.

451
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,800
Luckily, luckily!

452
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,900
There's a secret river passage that leads from the lake in the Marquis of Xuanping's Manor to outside the city.

453
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,760
So I floated out with the current.

454
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,320
A blessing! I've struck it rich! She's clearly from a wealthy family!

455
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm rich!

456
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,680
You're awake.

457
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,940
Where am I?

458
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,480
This is Li Village.

459
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,920
Who am I?

460
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,220
Don't... don't you remember?

461
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,840
You're my granddaughter!

462
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,600
Granddaughter?

463
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,780
You all know what happened after that.

464
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,780
I only wanted to reject the marriage on that visit.

465
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,340
Who knew that I'd almost end up as the murder victim of an adulterous couple?

466
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,100
The old widow almost sold me to the brothel as well.

467
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,440
There are too many dangers for single women in this world.

468
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,820
So full of difficulties and hardships.

469
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,360
It's all my fault that I didn't recognize Sister Jing Shu at that time.

470
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,300
Otherwise, you wouldn't have suffered so terribly.

471
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,240
It's fine.

472
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,100
These happenings are all part of my experiences.

473
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,780
Besides, only by experiencing something myself

474
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,300
I can understand the hardships of civilian women.

475
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,980
That's why we should try harder to understand them and protect them.

476
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,880
Grand Master Meng and Zhang Yuan Qing are distant relatives and in-laws.

477
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,900
Even though it's inappropriate for them to meet in private,

478
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,860
they can easily find a believable excuse.

479
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,240
So why did they have to kill you to shut you up?

480
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,500
What did you see?
