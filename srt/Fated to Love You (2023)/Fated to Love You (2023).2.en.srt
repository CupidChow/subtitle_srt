[Fated to Love You]
[Episode 2]

2
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,503
Younger Sister-in-law is truly thoughtful.

3
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:19,560
She even prepared two virgin cloths.

4
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,903
This way, no one will know if she had lost her virginity before marriage.

5
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,150
You must have done it! You've been wanting to harm me.

6
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:30,900
Enough now.

7
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,100
So much arguing and yelling, it's improper.

8
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,460
We divorce on the same day and also marry on the same day.

9
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,500
Second Brother, we are truly fated.

10
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,980
Congratulations.

11
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,460
Congratulations what?

12
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,100
Of course, it's to congratulate us for being able to divorce and marry again.

13
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,060
Be a groom again.

14
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,860
Ridiculous!

15
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,700
Mother and Father, it's all my fault.

16
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
I got muddled momentarily.

17
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,200
That blank virgin cloth belongs to Eldest Sister-in-law.

18
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Your Grace.

19
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,120
Although Ming'er's wife made a mistake,

20
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,223
what's important now is that Yan'er's wife indeed didn't show blood.

21
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:22,380
If the gossip gets out,

22
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,620
our manor will be utterly embarrassed.

23
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,380
The virgin cloth has been found.

24
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,380
There is no blood. How do you explain it?

25
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,860
Xiao Ren Yan?

26
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,540
Xiao Ren Yan.

27
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,740
Why does it have anything to do with me?

28
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,460
In that case...

29
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,163
Mother, it's not easy to talk about this matter in public.

30
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,406
Do you want to save your dignity now?

31
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:54,206
I'm not concerned for my own dignity.

32
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,180
It's for...

33
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,680
It's for the Marquis' heir.

34
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,620
You've been improper in your conduct. How does it have anything to do with the Marquis' heir?

35
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,060
Since Mother insists,

36
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,980
I'll have to say it then.

37
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,100
I am still a virgin.

38
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,020
It's because...

39
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,020
It's because the Marquis' heir...

40
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,120
It's because the Marquis' heir is impotent!

41
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,100
That's nonsense.

42
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,063
I'm a regular at brothels, but there aren't any rumors about my being impotent.

43
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:26,440
Brothel ladies barely make ends meet.

44
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,700
They wouldn't dare to speak the truth and offend you.

45
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,380
- I—
- Besides,

46
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,180
those who enjoy brothels

47
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,980
are eunuchs.

48
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,620
Hey, I...

49
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,780
- I—
- In fact,

50
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,740
I heard about your frivolous ways.

51
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,300
I refused to believe that.

52
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,220
I thought we'd live a blissful married life.

53
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,903
I never expected...

54
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:55,483
I never expected the consummation of our marriage to be impossible.

55
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:58,060
I'm so pitiful! This was a marriage ordained by His Majesty!

56
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,780
Now, I can only live in loneliness.

57
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,820
Hey, you—

58
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,120
What?

59
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,460
If you think I'm wrong, explain to your parents yourself!

60
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,145
I...

61
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,240
Useless rascal.

62
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,940
All you do is indulge in pleasures.

63
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,140
Your body is ruined now!

64
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,380
I...

65
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,600
If I left the Marquis' Manor to you,

66
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,660
I'd be disappointing our ancestors.

67
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,680
Your Grace.

68
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,060
Your Grace, calm down.

69
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,540
I'll send for a doctor to cure Yan'er.

70
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,060
He's still young.

71
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,960
He might still be able to produce offspring.

72
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,523
Yes, Father.

73
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:37,159
Besides, Han Jiao and I are in perfect health.

74
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,923
We can easily have ten children.

75
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,660
Thank you, Mother.

76
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,900
Thank you, my brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

77
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,818
Thank you for the hard work.

78
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,863
You can do this, Your Highness!

79
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:57,503
It's no problem! Man up!

80
00:06:57,503 --> 00:07:00,440
You can do it! I'm experienced!

81

[Ancestral Hall]

82
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,500
Ming'er's wife.

83
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,180
Since this is your first time erring,

84
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,100
and you confessed your misdeed,

85
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,540
your punishment is to clean the Ancestral Hall for a month.

86
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,256
Yes.

87
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:41,160
Jing Shu, I will get the doctor to cure the heir as soon as possible.

88
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,860
I heard that you fell terribly ill before the marriage.

89
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,500
You lost a large portion of your memories.

90
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,423
Do you want the doctor to take a look at you, too?

91
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:52,143
She sure is well-informed.

92
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:54,960
Mother, I'm fine now.

93
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,940
But my memories of the past are a little cloudy.

94
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,820
I've also seen a doctor at my manor.

95
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,780
I just need to recuperate well. Medicine isn't necessary.

96
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,940
All right.

97
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,123
You must be tired. Get some rest.

98
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:12,083
If you need anything, let me know.

99
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,987
Thank you, Mother.

100
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,320
Mother. Liu Jing Shu is no ordinary person.

101
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,203
Did she really lose her memory?

102
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:30,620
Goodness.

103
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,263
If I didn't defend you today,

104
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:35,883
the Marquis wouldn't have spared you so easily.

105
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,263
What's your grudge against Liu Jing Shu?

106
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:42,483
Why are you bent on opposing her?

107
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:45,220
I just can't stand the sight of her.

108
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,040
She...

109
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Don't be impatient.

110
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,620
She's in the Marquis' Manor now.

111
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,620
It doesn't matter if her memory loss is real or fake.

112
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,440
I'm curious to see what trouble she can cause.

113
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,960
Your Highness.

114
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,403
Night is falling. Why are you dressed like this?

115
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,703
Are you heading out for something?

116
00:09:15,703 --> 00:09:17,920
I'm heading out for some fun.

117
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,750
Am I supposed to stay and consummate our marriage?

118
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,980
Your Highness, that may really be impossible for you now.

119
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,200
After all, the entire manor knows that

120
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
you're impotent.

121
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,380
What are you doing?

122
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,823
Madam, my sexual potency

123
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,543
will be clear to you once you give it a try.

124
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,160
What are you doing?

125
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,340
I'm warning you.

126
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,460
I was forced to live with a lecher like you.

127
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,020
Show some respect.

128
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,380
If you try anything, I won't show any mercy.

129
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,360
I don't ever want to share a room with a shrew.

130
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,977
Not bad.

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,303
That's very good.

132
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:19,986
Once you're gone, I can investigate this place at night.

133
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,060
You're here. Are you looking for me?

134
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,220
Entertain him well.

135
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,180
- You've been away for so many days!
- The Marquis' heir! What a distinguished guest!

136
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,300
You just got married yesterday.

137
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,740
Why do you have time to drop by?

138
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,380
That's clearly because I miss Huan Huan.

139
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,580
Who misses me?

140
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,980
Oh, it's the Marquis' heir.

141
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,100
I missed you.

142
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,603
Come on, drink with me upstairs.

143
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:59,320
Huan Huan, take good care of him.

144
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,900
How are things?

145
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,980
My Lord, there's a secret letter for you.

146
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,503
Where is it?

147
00:11:05,503 --> 00:11:07,100
With me.

148
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,380
Good, let's speak inside.

149
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,197
Yes.

150
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,280
My Lord, the higher-ups sent over a message.

151

[Refusal to confess. No more leads]

152
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,340
Quite a strong backbone.

153
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,080
I don't believe I can't make him talk.

154
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,697
What do we do next?

155
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:47,103
Continue everything the same. Don't rouse any suspicion.

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,592
I'm going for a look.

159
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,640
It's the middle of the night. Why is Zhang Yuan Qing dressed like that?

160
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,240
There's something fishy.

161
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,240
I'll check it out.

Confess now!

Your lips are quite tight.

- Nonsense!

I'm really sorry.

174
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,080
I haven't trained for days, so my archery skills may be rusty.

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,980
- Stop right there!
- Catch him! Don't let him run away!

184
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,300
Hurry!

185
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,266
- Come here.
- Hurry.

186
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:06,720
- Stand right there!
- Search over there!

187
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,260
- Young Lady.
- This way! Coming!

188
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,434
Stop.

189
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,340
I can see you. Come out!

190
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,020
Who is disrupting my good time?

191
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Big Brother? Why are you here?

192
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,960
Don't come over.

193
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,620
Don't you see what's obviously going on here?

194
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,200
Big Brother, aren't you... impotent?

195
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,360
I can still be intimate for a short while.

196
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,463
Second Brother, it's the middle of the night. Why are you also here?

197
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:53,020
There's a thief. We're trying to catch him.

198
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,020
Did you see someone dressed in black?

199
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,220
I haven't seen anyone dressed in black,

200
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,500
but I've seen someone wearing nothing.

201
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,200
Enough now. Why are you still standing there dazed?

202
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,720
Don't bother the two of us anymore.

203
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,920
The thief will be gone!

204
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:19,087
Go!

205
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,900
You actually slandered me in front of everyone that I'd do that with you in the open.

206
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,915
Didn't you also say I'm impotent in front of many people?

207
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:05,898
That's because you refused to solve the problem of the virgin cloth with me.

208
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,443
Anyway, I saved you tonight. I've done enough favors.

209
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:11,703
Don't bother me again.

210
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,068
Wait.

211
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,040
The Marquis and Marchioness will definitely lecture me tomorrow.

212
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,810
You'll have to help me.

213
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,787
What if I don't help you,

214
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:26,587
will you want to fight me?

215
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,163
Threatening someone doesn't always require physical force.

216
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:44,920
Instead of any scent of rouge on you,

217
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,040
you are covered in bloody odor.

218
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,017
So I can guess that you didn't go to a brothel tonight.

219
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,280
There are also straws stuck on the boots.

220
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,020
There are holes burned by ember on the clothes.

221
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,163
A dignified Marquis' heir

222
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,206
goes out in the middle of the night.

223
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:19,329
He either went to a slaughterhouse or a blacksmith.

224
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,360
So I'm guess you must have gone to...

225
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,070
Shut up!

226
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,560
Before you strike, do you always twist your fingers like this?

227
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,223
Hasn't anyone taught you that

228
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:37,206
the more you know, the sooner you'll die?

229
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,083
I am your wife by His Majesty's bestowed marriage.

230
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,723
Shutting me up by killing me won't work.

231
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,176
Don't worry.

232
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:49,420
I am not interested in you at all.

233
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,480
As long as you let me live peacefully in the Marquis' Manor,

234
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,900
I guarantee that my lips are sealed.

235
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,060
Is that so?

236
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,100
What are you doing?

237
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,804
What do you want?

238
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,940
Don't you want to live peacefully?

239
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,500
You sure can,

240
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,940
but there is a condition.

241
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,780
As long as you bear a child for me in the manor,

242
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,320
I'll let you stand firm here.

243
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,680
Otherwise...

244
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,560
Who wants to bear a child for you?

245
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,504
Liu Jing Shu, just you wait!

246
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,380
Ridiculous!

247
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,660
I heard that Eldest Sister-in-law was coupling in the garden last night.

248
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,083
She's totally embarrassed the Marquis' Manor.

249
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,240
Luckily, these intimate encounters between a husband and his wife

250
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,043
aren't as shameful as your stealing the virgin cloth.

251
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,300
Father and Mother, look at her.

252
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,460
She has no remorse at all.

253
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,265
Kneel down!

254
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:59,510
I can kneel down, but please give me a reason.

255
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:04,280
Reason? I am the reason in the Marquis' Manor.

256
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,404
Your Grace, please quell your anger.

257
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:10,900
Jing Shu, you are the future marchioness.

258
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,783
We establish these rules for you because we're truly considerate for your sake.

259
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:17,080
Go ahead and kneel down first.

260
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,780
I didn't do it by myself last night.

261
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,460
Why should I be punished alone?

262
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,720
You brat!

263
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,700
Having done such an shameful act, you aren't even embarassed at quibbling?

264
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:31,190
What's so embarassing about it?

265
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,043
My Lady and I are harmonious. Isn't this wonderful?

266
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,120
You rebellious son!

267
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,640
I don't care what you two do behind a closed door.

268
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,762
What kind of place is the garden?

269
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:47,100
She is the official wife.

270
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,560
Not only that she doesn't dissuade you, you even mess around with her.

271
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,620
So improper!

272
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,820
As people say, if one marries a rooster, one should follow the rooster; and if one marries a dog, one should follow the dog.

273
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,540
Jing Shu is married and follows her husband.

274
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,980
She is respecting the female virtues of a good wife.

275
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,740
Having married such a good wife, what else would I ask for?

276
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,503
Father, Second Madam,

277
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:09,543
you should especially praise and reward her.

278
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:15,107
Do you actually think you're right to do such dirty things?

279
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:18,220
Young Sister-in-law is ignorant to say that.

280
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,500
When my mother was lying in bed sick those years ago,

281
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,980
didn't Second Madam also accompany my father to go boating in the lake?

282
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,380
They strayed into the deep part of the blooming lotus flowers

283
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,124
and startled a flock of herons.

284
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:29,060
Shut up!

285
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,380
What's the matter? If Second Madam could do it in the boat,

286
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
why can't Jing Shu and I do it in a cave?

287
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,260
Brazen brat!

288
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,060
Whatever I did with your mother is not for you to talk about.

289
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,840
Father, are you muddled in your old age?

290
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,680
My mother is memorialized on the altar at the Ancestral Hall.

291
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,780
Yuan Qin is a marchioness by imperial edict.

292
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,140
All these years, you've always called her Second Madam.

293
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,260
You've never respected her.

294
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,183
How can such an unfilial son be the Marquis of Xuanping's heir?

295
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,185
You Grace, please quell your anger. I'm fine.

296
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,663
As the saying goes, there is an order or sequence in births, and difference between legitimate and illegitimate.

297
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:15,183
Who will be the Marquis' heir if I'm not?

298
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:16,720
You brat!

299
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,120
Don't think that your wings are firm once you're married.

300
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,300
Believe it or not, I can complain to His Majesty and depose you.

301
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,180
I don't believe it.

302
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,740
If you could depose me in front of His Majesty, you would have done it already.

303
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,950
You... You...

304
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,156
Your Grace!

305
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:33,380
Your Grace!

306
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,780
Your Grace!

307
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,220
- Father!
- Your Grace!

308
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,280
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

309
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,480
That unfilial son has totally engered me!

310
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,020
Madam, the medicine is here.

311
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,686
I'll handle it.

312
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,940
You may leave.

313
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,783
Father, don't be angry.

314
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,003
Hurry and drink the medicine.

315
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm not in the mood. Put it there for now.

316
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,420
That won't do. Your body is important.

317
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,863
Here.

318
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:17,343
I'll feed you.

319
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:26,640
Father.

320
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,540
Father!

321
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,262
Father!

322
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,988
Father!

323
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,540
The Marquis is angered by Yan'er so much he's coughed up blood and passed out.

324
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,103
What do we do?

325
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,683
Hurry, get the imperial physician!

326
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,420
This isn't good.

327
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,740
Zhang Yuan Qing has always been thoughtful.

328
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,103
If I visit father now, all my efforts will be in vain.

329
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:58,909
Forget it.

330
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,420
Marquis' heir, why are you here?

331
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,060
They are yelling inside because of you.

332
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,260
Little Beauty, I haven't seen you for a long time.

333
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,260
The marquis is sick from the anger, you'd better behave for a few days.

334
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,860
"Sick from the anger"?

335
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,703
Why don't I believe it?

336
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:20,303
I'd like to see if he is really sick or faking it.

337
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:40,534
Officer?

338
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:42,620
Officer?

339
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,905
Officer!

340
00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:46,760
- I'm hungry...
- What's the matter?

341
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,120
I'm hungry.

342
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,269
So hungry.

343
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:53,280
Wait for me here. I'll find something to eat for you.

344
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,700
Wait for me.

345
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,631
All right.

346
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,460
How did you become so starved?

347
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,100
I just left the military camp to find my eldest brother.

348
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,380
Instead of finding my eldest brother, I got lost.

349
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,440
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

350
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,780
Miss, why are you covered in black muslin?

351
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,340
My grandmother said that I can't show my face or I'll provoke trouble.

352
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,700
She wouldn't let me show my face, but she wants me to wash the clothes.

353
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,519
Look if you don't believe it.

354
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,380
I'll help you do the work then.

355
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,340
It's not necessary. I'll do the wash. You still need to rush on your journey.

356
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,350
Oh, yes. It's important to find my eldest brother.

357
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:39,800
Thank you, Miss, for saving my life. I'll repay your kindness in the future.

358
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,580
Thank you, Miss. I'm leaving then.

359
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,344
It's fine.

360
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,900
Oh my! Everyone is here.

361
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,560
Xiao Ming, I was just looking for you.

362
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,700
Xiao Ren Yan, you angered Father so much that he passed out.

363
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,020
He is still unconscious now.

364
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,540
Aren't you ashamed to come here?

365
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,740
He coughed blood? When did that happen?

366
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,260
He coughed blood just now. Even the imperial physician is here.

367
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,420
My mother and I are really fearful.

368
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,660
But you?

369
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,580
Where were you fooling around before you came back?

370
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,940
I wasn't here when it happened.

371
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,580
How can you say that I angered him into coughing up blood?

372
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,740
I think it's obvious that you angered him into coughing blood.

373
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,020
But you want to blame me.

374
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,706
You brat!

375
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,900
So rebellious and unfilial, you can't even compare to the animals.

376
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,860
Look at how you've harmed Father, and you dare to slander me!

377
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,694
You disrespect your older brother. Aren't you worse then animals, too?

378
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:38,250
You...

379
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,440
Mother, don't be too sad. Your health is more important.

380
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,060
Yan'er, I know you are resentful toward me.

381
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,183
You already oppose me every day.

382
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:52,820
I've tolerated it all.

383
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,820
But the marquis is your own father, after all.

384
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,900
How can you anger him so much?

385
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,940
If something bad happens to him,

386
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,951
I won't live, either.

387
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:04,960
Second Madam, you are right.

388
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,120
You're the one who takes care of my father's meals and living.

389
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,923
If anything happens to him,

390
00:26:09,923 --> 00:26:12,643
you can't avoid the responsibility.

391
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,140
Marquis' heir, are you criticizing me for not taking good care of the marquis?

392
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,580
You contradicted Father in front of people and angered him to passing out.

393
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
Everyone witnessed it.

394
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,463
Isn't it enough to slander me just now?

395
00:26:26,463 --> 00:26:28,959
Do you even want to place the blame on my mother now?

396
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,240
I'll see for myself in order to be certain.

397
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,045
Don't dream of it!

398
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,900
The imperial physician is taking the marquis' pulse right now.

399
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,723
It's not good to disturb them now.

400
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,100
I think you just don't want me to see my father.

401
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:47,220
My mother doesn't want to say it openly to save your face.

402
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,720
But I'm not afraid of telling you.

403
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,487
Father is the one who doesn't want to see you.

404
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,660
Before His Grace passed out, he indeed said that.

405
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,820
I can't defy his wish.

406
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,660
Yan'er, go back for now.

407
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,100
What a joke! Who knows if you're telling the truth?

408
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,347
Stop arguing, everyone.

409
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,820
Madam.

410
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,680
Marquis' heir.

411
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,740
His Grace has just woken up.

412
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,280
Let's not let anyone in the manor disturb him for now.

413
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,120
Imperial physician, how is my father's illness?

414
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,860
His Grace was already afflicted with a lung disease.

415
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,503
After he coughed out blood, his illness has worsened.

416
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:30,815
There is also a sign of stroke.

417
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm afraid his heart has been damaged by the reversing blood flow.

418
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,180
It appears that he was really angered.

419
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,820
Stroke?

420
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,663
That's a deathly disease.

421
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,263
What do we do now?

422
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:49,202
Imperial physician, you must think of a solution.

423
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:52,025
Yes, I understand.

424
00:27:57,611 --> 00:27:59,460
Xiao Ren Yan,

425
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:02,300
if you anger Father to death,

426
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,740
even if I lose my life,

427
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,460
I'll get justice from you!

428
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,660
Husband, he is out of line, but he is the Marquis' heir.

429
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,780
You can't hit him.

430
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,820
We should report to the Imperial Clan Affairs Office, and ask His Majesty to adjudicate.

431
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,540
Get out of here!

432
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,660
You don't think Father is sick enough

433
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,720
and won't be satisfied until you see him take his last breath?

434
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,540
Someone! Come and drag away the Marquis' heir.

435
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,715
Who dares?

436
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,463
Aren't you too much?

437
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:40,126
His Grace is the father to the Marquis' heir.

438
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:42,846
What's wrong if he wants to go inside to visit?

439
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,180
Yan'er, if you still care for your father,

440
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,103
hurry and leave this place.

441
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,563
Let him have some quiet.

442
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,780
Fine, I'll leave.

443
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,660
I'll leave all the filial stuff

444
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,820
to Second Madam and your biological son.

445
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:08,307
Xiao Ren Yan, wait for me.

446
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,220
My Lord, you wanted me to find the private mine's keeper.

447
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,780
I haven't found him yet.

448
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,860
What is going on?

449
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,340
The news was probably leaked.

450
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,860
He hasn't appeared in Wansheng Gambling House in the last few days.

451
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,620
Keep searching then!

452
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,020
Do I need to teach you how to handle such a small matter?

453
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,967
If you can't find him, bring me your head.

454
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,881
Yes.

455
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,281
Wait.

456
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:54,780
Pour me more wine.

457
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,540
My Lord, you've had too much to drink.

458
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,600
Don't drink anymore.

459
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,884
Quit your useless talk.

460
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,772
Pour the wine.

461
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,460
Yan'er, she is your mother. Hurry and call her Mom.

462
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,860
No, I don't have a mother anymore. She is not my mother. I won't call her Mom.

463
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,880
How can you talk like this?

464
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,940
Your Grace, he is still a child.

465
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,160
Don't be angry.

466
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,660
Yan'er, from now on, I'm your mother.

467
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,023
No, I don't have a mother anymore. You're not my mother!

468
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:37,420
Why are you so immature?

469
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,260
I'll beat you up! How can you be so immature?

470
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,130
I...

471
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,140
Where is the singing and dancing? Where are the beauties?

472
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,160
This Marquis' heir must have some fun today!

473
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,860
You've only just come.

474
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,500
Beauty, you've made me wait a long time.

475
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,180
Marquis' heir, you really have a refined taste.

476
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,820
Little Beauty, drink with me.

477
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,970
Xiao Ren Yan!

478
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,060
Drink wine?

479
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,820
Sure.

480
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,450
Come.

481
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,149
Open your eyes wide and see who I am!

482
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,140
Why are you here?

483
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,240
The Marquis is lying sick in bed.

484
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,023
Why did you come here to drink? Do you know how much gossip are spreading outside?

485
00:31:51,023 --> 00:31:53,168
I don't care.

486
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,700
If you really don't care,

487
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,380
why are you getting drunk here?

488
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,920
Are you here as a persuader for Zhang Yuan Qing

489
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,260
to convince me to go back?

490
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,540
Your stepmother?

491
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,960
She would rather that you won't go back.

492
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,860
That's true.

493
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,640
They are happy together as a family.

494
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,220
I'm just an outsider.

495
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,700
Come, let's keep drinking.

496
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,180
Let go of me. Give it to me.

497
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,480
What outsider? It's your own father who is lying in bed!

498
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,340
He only cares for Zhang Yuan Qing and her son.

499
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,900
He's never cared about me.

500
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,300
Xiao Ren Yan.

501
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,540
The parents have their own difficulties.

502
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,920
As their children, if we only consider things from our perspective,

503
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,300
of course, we'd think they're selfish and preferential.

504
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,060
There aren't any parents who don't love their children.

505
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,180
Perhaps they are hiding their affection too deeply,

506
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,480
so you can't see clearly.

507
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,200
Xiao Ren Yan, think it over well.

508
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,710
When you were little, didn't your father kiss you or hug you?

509
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,340
Didn't he teach you about studying and behaving?

510
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,840
Even if he is bad in many ways,

511
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,580
given your scandalous reputation these years,

512
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,220
you've still kept your position as the marquis' heir,

513
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,200
who has been supporting you from behind?

514
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,349
Xiao Ren Yan,

515
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:27,020
whatever is making you put on a disguise,

516
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,080
I have no idea.

517
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,220
But when you saw the marquis pass out, your anxious gaze couldn't lie.

518
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,900
You try it.

519
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,700
That kind of gaze,

520
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,881
Meng Han Jiao didn't have it. Xiao Ming didn't have it. Zhang Yuan Qing especially didn't have it.

521
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:45,160
- That's great.
- Only you, Xiao Ren Yan, had it.

522
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,000
Xiao Ren Yan,

523
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,620
in the entire Marquis' Manor, only you

524
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,580
are the one who truly cares about the marquis.

525
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,500
That's true.

526
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,580
Even if he is bad in many ways,

527
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,135
he is still my father.

528
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,930
Have you thought it through?

529
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,380
Let's go.

530
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,240
We're going home.

531
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,808
Let's go.

532
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,980
My Lady, I have a little headache.

533
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,780
Are you really drunk?

534
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,023
What do we do?

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,980
