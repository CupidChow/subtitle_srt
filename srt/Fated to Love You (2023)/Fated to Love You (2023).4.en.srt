00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,310
[Fated to Love You]
[Episode 4]

2
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,380
This is a poison-detecting cloth made by the palace's imperial physician.

3
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,820
It's been soaked in a special herbal brew.

4
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,000
Once the white cloth comes into contact with the Lost Soul Flower, it will turn red.

5
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,220
His Majesty gave me this cloth to test for poison before everyone

6
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,500
and prove that the heir's wife isn't lying.

7
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,580
The white cloth turned red.

8
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,200
This medicine is indeed the Lost Soul Flower.

9
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,300
Xue Fei, bring Hong Ye here.

10
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,200
Yes, Madam.

11
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,360
What is Zhang Yuan Qing up to this time?

12
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,820
Now that His Grace is confirmed to be poisoned with the Lost Soul Flower,

13
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,920
can he still be saved?

14
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,160
Thanks to Her Lady for expelling the poison using acupuncture,

15
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,400
His Grace managed to vomit out the poisoned blood in time.

16
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,960
His Grace's life is no longer in danger,

17
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
but recovery will take time

18
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,620
and a period of recuperation is needed to regain consciousness.

19
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,680
Thank the Heavens.

20
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,560
Jing Shu, I'm glad Imperial Censor Wei uncovered the truth.

21
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,200
I misjudged you.

22
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,560
Don't resent me.

23
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,660
I understand.

24
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,400
Your immense worry for Father troubled your mind.

25
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,600
Don't be bothered by this.

26
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,420
Madam!

27
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,860
There's trouble!

28
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,500
Hong Ye has jumped into the well.

29
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,400
What?

30
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,320
Word of the culprit being found must've spread.

31
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,220
Hong Ye killed herself to escape punishment.

32
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,820
You didn't even believe that His Grace was poisoned.

33
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,620
Why did Imperial Censor Wei's arrival

34
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,321
spur you to suspect Hong Ye and search her room?

35
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,020
That's because I know a secret.

36
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,500
What is it?

37
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,053
One day, I heard people quarreling when I passed by His Grace's room.

38
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:27,700
I walked over and saw...

39
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,340
What is it? Tell us.

40
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,261
I saw His Grace forcing himself onto Hong Ye.

41
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,540
No wonder His Grace's health worsened drastically after the new year.

42
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,760
So it's because that darned brat poisoned him.

43
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,401
My father has a history,

44
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,421
but he wouldn't force himself onto a maid.

45
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:51,420
Hong Ye is probably a scapegoat.

46
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,560
As the saying goes, "The apple never falls far from the tree."

47
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,460
You have such a flamboyant lifestyle.

48
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:04,360
It's not impossible for His Grace to do that.

49
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,260
What did you say?

50
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,300
Enough.

51
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,420
Don't you find Zhang Xue Fei very suspicious?

52
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,200
The Lost Soul Flower comes from the Northern Desert.

53
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,580
Zhang Xue Fei is a mere servant.

54
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,380
She doesn't have what it takes to get the flower so easily.

55
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,700
Zhang Xue Fei is Zhang Yuan Qing's trusted maid.

56
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,880
If she's suspicious, Zhang Yuan Qing is even more suspicious.

57
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,020
That's true. Zhang Yuanqing is the most likely suspect.

58
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,340
After all, we heard how she coerced His Grace

59
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,700
under the bed—

60
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,600
What? Were you eavesdropping under the bed?

61
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,584
What else have you done?

62
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,980
The ongoings between my wife and I

63
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,345
are none of your business.

64
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,380
We only eavesdropped! Nothing else!

65
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,780
Besides,

66
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,780
according to Zhang Xue Fei,

67
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,160
Hong Ye got this poison after she returned home for the new year.

68
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,580
How about this? You can make a trip to Hong Ye's home.

69
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,480
Okay.

70
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,580
I'll look for the manor's Chief Secretary and ask for the location of Hong Ye's home.

71
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,620
You have to investigate thoroughly.

72
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,500
If she's really Zhang Yuan Qing's scapegoat,

73
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,620
there must be clues in Hong Ye's home.

74
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,820
You can count on me!

75
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,620
Nice!

76
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,660
Chang Ming, you're finally here.

77
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,661
I told you to proceed with the plan slowly.

78
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:39,481
You insisted on increasing the medicine dosage.

79
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:42,160
Look at what you've done.

80
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,401
The poisoning didn't only alert His Majesty.

81
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:49,340
Xiao Ren Yan almost strangled me to death!

82
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,310
I already made Hong Ye the scapegoat.

83
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,692
Besides, the Lost Soul Flower is so obscure.

84
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:59,092
Who would've expected Liu Jing Shu to find out?

85
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,180
General Liu defends the borders.

86
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,620
He is often at war with the Northern Desert.

87
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,340
Liu Jing Shu is his only daughter.

88
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,207
She has probably seen the Lost Soul Flower before.

89
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:19,780
Even memory loss can't stop this shrew.

90
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:23,000
We can't be sure

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,420
whether this memory loss is real.

92
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,001
I'm planning to plant a spy near Xiao Ren Yan.

93
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:34,720
That'll be to check if Liu Jing Shu's memory loss is real

94
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,980
and to show discord between him and Liu Jing Shu. We'll be killing two birds with one stone.

95
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,640
Who are you planning to use?

96
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,620
Zhang Xue Fei.

97
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Xue Fei, come here.

98
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,850
Madam, what are your orders?

99
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,460
I noticed Xiao Ren Yan exchanging flirting glances with you often.

100
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,720
He seems interested in you.

101
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,300
How about I let him marry you and elevate your status?

102
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,800
Madam, that can't be done.

103
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,780
Xue Fei, you've served me for years.

104
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,020
You haven't had your period for two months.

105
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,660
Did you really think I wouldn't notice?

106
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,880
Madam, please spare me.

107
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,060
Silly child.

108
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,040
I would never fault you.

109
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,100
Ren Yan is infertile and can't bear offspring for the manor.

110
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,540
Your child just happens to lack a father.

111
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,340
I will let you marry Ren Yan.

112
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,260
This will bring you many benefits.

113
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,180
Madam, this can't be done.

114
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,160
I already have a man I love.

115
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,820
I'd rather never get married.

116
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:04,020
How can you utter such nonsense?

117
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,620
There's no such thing as picking your own husband.

118
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,761
Besides, what's there to lament when you're marrying the heir?

119
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,560
Be good.

120
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,520
Only then will your child be able to grow up safely in this manor.

121
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,120
Yes, Madam.

122
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
Great.

123
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,460
This is excellent.

124
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,196
This isn't just killing two birds with one stone.

125
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:43,792
You're killing three birds.

126
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,460
Second Lord, I'm pregnant with your flesh and blood.

127
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,580
I, Xiao Ming, am an honorable man! How could I ever have an illegitimate child?

128
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,781
Let's not even talk about you.

129
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,861
Do you think that tigress Meng Han Jiao will spare me?

130
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:00,380
Second Lord, we've been together for years.

131
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,240
I've never asked for status.

132
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,300
I only want to stay by your side forever.

133
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,580
Now, Madam wants me to marry someone else.

134
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,380
I'd rather die.

135
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,740
Hey, my ancestors are watching.

136
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,760
Don't make me seem like a heartless jerk.

137
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,880
Second Lord!

138
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,340
Xue Fei, come, get up.

139
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,040
Xue Fei, don't cry.

140
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
Xue Fei, see?

141
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,920
Eldest Brother is impotent anyway.

142
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,560
You can just stay there for now.

143
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,689
Once I've achieved success later on, I will ask for you back.

144
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,280
Then... the baby?

145
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,220
When the baby is born in the eldest branch,

146
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,660
he'll be born the eldest legitimate son.

147
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,556
Even not for yourself, you should consider for our child, right?

148
00:11:57,556 --> 00:11:59,700
As long as you don't tell anyone else,

149
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,020
I'll agree to whatever you want in the future.

150
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,468
Second Madam, you wanted to discuss an urgent matter?

151
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:21,788
What is it? Just say it.

152
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:28,140
Yan'er, after your father vomited all the poisonous blood, he still shows no sign of awakening.

153
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,980
I want to arrange an auspicious event to expel his bad luck.

154
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,800
Expel his bad luck?

155
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,660
What kind of auspicious event does Second Madam plan for my father?

156
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:42,230
What do you think of this girl, Zhang Xue Fei?

157
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,280
People next to Second Madam are obviously, just like you,

158
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,200
good people.

159
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,381
Xue Fei is smart and cute.

160
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,440
She is also pretty.

161
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,341
She was indispensable in helping

162
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:01,835
to catch the real culprint in the poisoning.

163
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:07,190
It's not a suffering for you to send her to your household as a concubine, is it?

164
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,941
Second Madam must be joking.

165
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:12,502
I'm no match for such a good girl.

166
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:15,220
Why not give her to Second Brother?

167
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,000
Second Brother is also my father's son.

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,260
It'll also be an auspicious event to expel the evil.

169
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,623
I've asked Xue Fei.

170
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:24,363
She prefers you.

171
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:27,840
Besides, you know about Ming'er's wife.

172
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,260
She is extremely jealous.

173
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,081
I don't know if Young Sister-in-law is jealous.

174
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,121
But Jing Shu is very jealous.

175
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,481
Why not do this?

176
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:42,981
Second Madam, why don't you ask Jing Shu yourself?

177
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,020
All right then.

178
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,760
Xue Fei, ask Jing Shu to come here.

179
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,460
Yes.

180
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,200
I can't handle you, but I should be able to handle Liu Jing Shu.

181
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,161
Liu Jing Shu, it's time to test our tacit understanding.

182
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,860
Where is Madam?

183
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,580
Your Highness, Imperial Censor Wei is going to Hong Ye's hometown to investigate the case.

184
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,120
Madam is seeing him off.

185
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,785
What?

186
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:29,460
What? As a married woman, she is seeing off Imperial Censor Wei?

187
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,700
Old Madam, Imperial Censor Wei used to be General Liu's subordinate in the mililtary.

188
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,120
He is Madam's old acquaintance.

189
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,240
An old acquaintence indeed.

190
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,540
I want to give Xue Fei to Yan'er as a concubine.

191
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,900
Even Yan'er wants to ask her first.

192
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,960
But she's really something.

193
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,541
She has gone to see another man off.

194
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,401
She didn't even tell Yan'er first.

195
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,240
Since she's made an arbitary decision by herself,

196
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,800
I don't need to be courteous, either.

197
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,134
Let's confirm this matter then.

198
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,121
Damn you girl, I asked you to launder two pieces of clothing.

199
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:20,922
You only just came back.

200
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:23,840
You are being lazy and not want to cook, right?

201
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,800
When I wash too slowly, you say I'm not being diligent in working.

202
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,180
Why do you scold me so harshly?

203
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,040
Are you talking back?

204
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,740
Damn you girl, I'll beat you to death!

205
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,960
- I'll beat you to death.
- Save me!

206
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,920
- You can't hide.
- Save me!

207
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,584
Stop!

208
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,220
Bad news, Madam.

209
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,140
What's the matter?

210
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,100
Taking the opportunity of your absence, Old Madam has given Zhang Xue Fei to the heir as his concubine.

211
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,580
He wouldn't agree to it.

212
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,480
But he has already agreed.

213
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,540
That's impossible. You must be mistaken!

214
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,480
It's true. I saw the both of them enjoying the flowers in the back garden.

215
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,800
They were quite affectionate.

216
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,952
Why has Young Master appeared here?

217
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:10,600
I was just passing by and wanted to asked for water to drink.

218
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,000
Officer, please drink some water.

219
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,620
This is a Imperial Censor's token.

220
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,740
If you dare to torment this young miss again,

221
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,700
I'll take you to the authorities.

222
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,660
Even if she is your biological granddaughter, you'll still get a flogging.

223
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,300
- Understand?
- Yes, I understand.

224
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,626
I wouldn't dare anymore.

225
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,760
I'll give you this token.

226
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,896
If she bullies you again,

227
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,340
just take her to the authorities and complain.

228
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,900
How can you give me such an important item?

229
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,220
I dare to give it to you because I know what I'm doing.

230
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,800
Then... Thank you, Young Master.

231
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,300
It's a simple gesture. Don't worry about it.

232
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,880
Young Miss, do you know how to go to Hong Ye's house?

233
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,200
Don't you know Hong Ye's home?

234
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,680
She is from the Li Village.

235
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,640
She is about your age.

236
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,300
I was very ill recently.

237
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,700
I don't remember many things.

238
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,220
What? Have you lost your memory?

239
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,540
Hong Ye's home? I know. I know.

240
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,260
Officer, follow this road and head to the east.

241
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,980
Her home is right under the big locust tree.

242
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,920
All right.

243
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:39,420
Don't you dare bullying her again!

244
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,420
I won't dare. I won't dare.

245
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,940
I'm leaving.

246
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,060
Young Master, safe travels.

247
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,900
You...

248
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,950
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

249
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,580
- Look at this.
- These flowers are really pretty.

250
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,400
No matter how pretty they are, they aren't as pretty as you.

251
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,200
- Your Highness, you are bad.
- Oh my, isn't that Marquis Xiao's heir?

252
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,787
Your Highness, are you enjoying the flowers?

253
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:19,303
Imperial Censor Wei, you've come.

254
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:22,343
Zhang Xue Fei greets Imperial Censor Wei.

255
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,540
Go back first. I want to talk with him.

256
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,240
Yes.

257
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,200
When did you become so close with each other?

258
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,940
When you went to Hong Ye's hometown,

259
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,920
I took her as a concubine.

260
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,480
You bastard!

261
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,340
Do you dare to hit me?

262
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,800
Can you please be clear first before you hit me next time?

263
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,980
Come.

264
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,420
I wonder if Wei Hong He was successful in his journey.

265
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,160
I didn't get any news for the past few days.

266
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,980
Imperial Censor Wei, you had an arduous journey.

267
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,843
When you went to Hong Ye's hometown, did you find anything?

268
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,740
Hong Ye's family are honest people.

269
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,220
The older brother is thirty years old but still unmarried.

270
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,680
It's not a surprise that a loyal daughter was born to such an honest family.

271
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,780
But how did such an honest family have poison from the Northern Desert?

272
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,060
It's quite a coincidence.

273
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,340
His older brother met a western merchant at a temple fair.

274
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,580
He bought rat poison from the merchant.

275
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,721
The Lost Soul Flower is rarely seen in Zhongyuan.

276
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,422
But the western merchants have all sorts of exotic things.

277
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:57,020
It's not strange that he was able to buy from them.

278
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,840
That's true. The western merchants travel nomadically.

279
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,080
A temple fair is a temporary market.

280
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,740
It would appear this is as far as the case can be investigated.

281
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,200
It's enough to find this much.

282
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,300
That Hong Ye is inexcusable, but it can be understood.

283
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,920
I will report His Majesty and close this case.

284
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,700
I worked with Hong Ye for many years.

285
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,540
It's really incredible that she could do something like this.

286
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,400
Imperial Censor Wei worked hard in the investigation.

287
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,420
Allow me to make you a toast.

288
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,180
Thank you, Sister-in-law, for granting me a drink.

289
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,880
Imperial Censor Wei, I really don't deserve to be called sister-in-law by you.

290
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,300
I told him to call you this way.

291
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,980
Your Highness, aren't you afraid Madam will hear?

292
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,520
So what if she heard? What can she do?

293
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,840
I'll flog you to death!

294
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,940
I should be leaving then. I still need to go back to report.

295
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,640
As you please. I'll see you off.

296
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,560
Stand right there.

297
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,220
I'm seeing a guest off.

298
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,160
As the Madam, you turn your back and leave. Is this proper?

299
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,300
Madam simply didn't see me.

300
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,621
When you get angry for such a trivial matter,

301
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,961
how can I live with myself?

302
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,380
Everyone, please stay here.

303
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,180
I bid you farewell.

304
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,220
Imperial Censor Wei, safe travel.

305
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,100
During this time, you've worked hard in serving me.

306
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,560
You can return to the room to rest.

307
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,360
You are getting more and more unruly.

308
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,180
Come with me.

309
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,720
All you know is Zhang Xue Fei every day.

310
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,000
All you know is Zhang Xue Fei.

311
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,420
Were you eavesdropping just now?

312
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,580
The news that Wei Hong He talked about, we only talked about half of it in front of Zhang Xue Fei.

313
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,040
It's indeed true that Hong Ye's older brother is still unmarried at the age of 30.

314
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,580
But he is suddenly going to get married now.

315
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,500
The betrothal gift is also quite abundant.

316
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,260
That money was from selling Hong Ye's life.

317
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,860
Guess who gave the money?

318
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,900
I'm not as scheming as you. I can't guess.

319
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,820
When you go for the greeting tomorrow morning,

320
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,021
pay attention to Second Madam's facial expression.

321
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:46,740
I'm sure she'll look relieved and cheerful.

322
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,456
Oh?

323
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:52,220
Now, do you know why I agreed to take a concubine?

324
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,421
I do know.

325
00:22:54,421 --> 00:22:56,941
It's because she is pretty.

326
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,340
Wait!

327
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,140
What are you doing?

328
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,581
No matter how pretty,

329
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:09,581
can she compare to the capital's top beauty?

330
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:11,920
You're so shallow.

331
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,180
This is Mariticide.
(T/N: Literally means the killing of one's own husband)

332
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,797
Say that again, and I'll really kill you.

333
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,020
Imperial Censor Wei said he'd close the case as is?

334
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,720
Yes.

335
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,300
From now on, whatever the marquis' heir says in the bedroom,

336
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,821
you must pay attention when you listen.

337
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,360
Yes.

338
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,080
You've entered his household for some days.

339
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
Have you consummated with him?

340
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,400
His Highness is indeed... impotent.

341
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,100
He said that he will seek medicine from physicians.

342
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,900
But it's unknown when it'll be effective.

343
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,260
If we still can't consummate, my belly...

344
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,380
Don't be anxious.

345
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,580
I'm looking for medicine, too.

346
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,840
If it really doesn't work,

347
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,420
we can drug Xiao Ran Yan to make him pass out and fake the consummation.

348
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,660
After you've given birth to your child,

349
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,380
I'll elevate you as an official wife

350
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,960
to have equal status with Liu Jing Shu.

351
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,220
Thank you, Madam.

352
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,140
Enough now.

353
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,100
Go on. Spend more time with the heir.

354
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,220
You don't need to visit me often.

355
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,120
I understand.

356
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,820
Liu Jing Shu, you escaped last time.

357
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,420
You won't be lucky this time.

358
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,800
When I kill you, I'll be number one!

359
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,260
I'll be number one!

360
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,720
Meng Han Jiao, what are you doing?

361
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,940
Let go of me!

362
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,660
Mother, my body has recovered.

363
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,620
I just have a hazy memory and can't remember things clearly.

364
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,360
They retained a physician in the manor.

365
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,320
I was told it was enough to rest quietly.

366
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,560
No need to take medications.

367
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,470
That bitch's amnesia continues on.

368
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,080
We don't know for sure if she really has amnesia.

369
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:23,320
I pray for Buddha's protection to grant my wish.

370
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,500
Once Liu Jing Shu is finished off,

371
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,160
you'll be next, Xiao Ren Yan.

372
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,300
It's been quite sometime since I married into the Marquis' Manor.

373
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,500
I can clearly sense the connection between Older Sister's disappearance and the Marquis' Manor.

374
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,160
Why can't I find any clues yet?

375
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,940
No, I have to hurry to search for Older Sister.

376
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,840
The flowers are looking good.

377
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,860
Ghost! Ghost!

378
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,700
What ghost? Me?

379
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,560
It's not me! It's not me!

380
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,280
It's not me!

381
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,220
What ghost?

382
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,420
Older Sister-in-law, be careful.

383
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,060
- I'm asking you a question.
- Older Sister-in-law, be careful.

384
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,580
Be careful that she may hurt you.

385
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,360
- I'm fine. Let me...
- Older Sister, she is crazy.

386
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,820
Be careful that she may hurt you.

387
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,160
Drowning ghost! Drowning ghost!

388
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,480
Scram!

389
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,700
But...

390
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,580
Older Sister-in-law, this nanny is an old servant in the manor.

391
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,381
She was benevolent to Grandmother, so we still keep her even though she is crazy.

392
00:26:27,381 --> 00:26:30,919
She talks nonsense all day, and she'd even scratch and bite people.

393
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,540
Be careful that she may hurt you.

394
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,260
Thank you for the reminder.

395
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,380
Older Sister-in-law, it's time to do greetings.

396
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,820
Why don't we go there together?

397
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,220
All right.

398
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,900
[Marquis of Xuanping's Manor]

399
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,500
Now that your father is seriously ill,

400
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,420
I'm busy taking care of him every day.

401
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,100
I don't have the energy to mind the affairs in the manor.

402
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,580
Mother, you should take good care of yourself as well.

403
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,420
It'll be the grand memorial service in the manor next month.

404
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,900
I used to manage it myself in the past years.

405
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,700
This year, both daughters-in-law have entered the manor.

406
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,820
Mother, I often helped take care of things at my home.

407
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,720
Just let me manage the grand memorial service in the manor this year.

408
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll definitely do a good job.

409
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,220
There are lots of things involved in the manor's grand memorial service.

410
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,940
The rites must be thorough and complete.

411
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,300
The staffing arrangement must be properly done, too.

412
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,880
Mother, let me do it.

413
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,740
I am the wife of the Marquis' heir and the daughter-in-law of the eldest official wife.

414
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,820
I should be the one to handle such an important matter.

415
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,680
Since both of you want to help relieve my burden,

416
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,700
I'll let both of you do it together.

417
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,500
It's truly whatever one wants one will get.

418
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,700
In the entire manor, the ancestral hall is the only place that hasn't been searched.

419
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,140
Heaven is helping me.

420
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,340
This is a good opportunity to search it thoroughly under the name of the grand memorial service.

421
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,610
[Ancestral Hall]

422
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,120
[Memorial Tablet of Madam Zhang, Wife of Xiao Yun Ting]

423
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,920
What's this about the official wife of the eldest legitimate son?

424
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,420
I thought you were stoic.

425
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,960
Aren't you competing to show off in front of Mother?

426
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,860
What a schemer.

427
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,920
This is...
[Memorial Tablet of Madam Zhang, Wife of Xiao Yun Ting]

428
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,780
the memorial tablet of Xiao Ren Yan's mother?

429
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,100
I've got an idea.

430
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,820
Liu Jing Shu was right in what she said just now.

431
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,700
She is the wife of the heir and also the daughter-in-law of the eldest official wife.

432
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,220
If you want to be in charge, you can't step over her.

433
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,440
What do I do then?

434
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,360
Unless...

435
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,460
she is gone.

436
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,500
Eldest Sister-in-law, you are tall. I can't reach over there.

437
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,638
Why don't you clean it up?

438
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,800
Who do you think you are?

439
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:58,820
Which one?

440
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,520
That one.

441
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,640
Your Highness!

442
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
This is bad.

443
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
What's the matter?

444
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,960
Older sister and Second Young Madam were preparing for the grand memorial service in the Ancestral Hall.

445
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,360
I heard that they got into a huge argument.

446
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,081
Where is there so much dust on the memorial tablet?

447
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:31,981
How did it get up there?

448
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,560
How could you break the memorial tablet of the heir's mother?

449
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,640
Mother!

450
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,400
Mother!

451
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:55,808
Xiao Ren Yan, I...

452
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,940
I really didn't do it deliberately.

453
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,900
Previously you said you were the wife of the heir and the daughter-in-law of the eldest official wife.

454
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,860
You were arrogant because of your status. I tolerated it all.

455
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,980
But you've actually smashed the memorial tablet of the heir's own mother.

456
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,500
Liu Jing Shu, you are out of line.

457
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,540
Mother, Older Sister-in-law probably made a mistake accidentally.

458
00:30:19,578 --> 00:30:22,940
Even an accidental mistake could result in smashing the memorial tablet of the late Marchioness.

459
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,660
What if she was deliberate, wouldn't she have burned down the ancestral hall?

460
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,420
Meng Han Jiao said the memorial tablet was dirty, that's why I went to dust it off.

461
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,100
You didn't notice your mother-in-law's tablet was dirty.

462
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,720
I reminded you out of kindness, so it's my mistake?

463
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,700
You were the reckless one who smashed the tablet.

464
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,860
Fine. I indeed was the one who smashed the memorial tablet.

465
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,380
I admit it. How will you punish me?

466
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,480
Just say it.

467
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,380
What is this attitude?

468
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,500
On the day of your wedding, Yan'er especially brought out the memorial tablet.

469
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,860
You first bowed to the tablet before you bowed to the living.

470
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,740
Yan'er is so respectful of his birth mother.

471
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,740
As a daughter-in-law, you dared to smash the memorial tablet

472
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,313
and even talk back here.

473
00:31:02,313 --> 00:31:05,420
Yan'er, if you have any sense of filial piety,

474
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,540
you should divorce her.

475
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,540
I don't need Second Madam to tell me how I should be filial to my mother.

476
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,720
Xiao Ren Yan!

477
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,100
Xiao Ren Yan, stop right there.

478
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
I was really framed.

479
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,060
Even your toes can think of that.

480
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,140
Am I such a branless and heartless person who would break your mother's memorial tablet?

481
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,040
Sorry, I'm not in the mood to talk with you right now.

482
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,900
Fine. Even if I broke it,

483
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,840
can I repair it for you?

484
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,540
Repair it? How can you repair it?

485
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,000
I made it with my own hands.

486
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,541
Xiao Ren Yan!

487
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,500
Based on my understanding of Liu Jing Shu, she indeed couldn't have been so reckless.

488
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,781
Someone must have done a trick.

489
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:01,641
Your Highness, aren't you sleeping yet?

490
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:05,220
You go ahead. Don't wait for me.

491
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,140
Ever since I married you,

492
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,820
I've been sleeping in your embrace every night.

493
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,100
If you don't sleep, I wouldn't be able to sleep.

494
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,800
Young Madam has always been reckless and domineering.

495
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,900
You've never liked her.

496
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,540
Why feel bothered by her?

497
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,660
You are right.

498
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,590
It's such a nice night, why waste the time on her?

499
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,820
Come, Little Beauty.

500
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,060
You can serve me well tonight.

501
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,540
Xiao Ren Yan, you scumbag!

502
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,060
I've been good to you, but you won't believe me!

503
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,560
I...

504
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,840
I know that was your mother's memorial tablet.

505
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,461
I also know that you made it with your hands.

506
00:32:53,461 --> 00:32:56,341
Why can't I also make one with my hands?

507
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,000
That's right. Why don't I make one for you?

508
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,840
She wants to sleep with me every night.

509
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,740
Keep dreaming!

510
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,380
Done!

511
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,740
Madam, although you passed a long time ago,

512
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,220
Xiao Ren Yan has always kept you in his heart.

513
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,780
He's never forgotten you.

514
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:12,720
Although he looks unconventional and unruly on surface,

515
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,474
he is really inscrutable.

516
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:24,380
I think he must hold a great secret.

517
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,060
Although I don't know what it is,

518
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,720
I also don't know what he is doing,

519
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,960
but I hope your spirit in heaven
[Memorial Tablet of Madam Zhang, Wife of Xiao Yun Ting]

520
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,940
will protect him and keep him safe.

521
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,820
You aren't asleep yet, are you?

522
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,740
Don't be angry anymore.

523
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,020
During the day, I was wrong in my tone of voice.

524
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,500
But I didn't disbelieve you.

525
