2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,930
Oh, Miss Xiaoqing.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,310
My love for you

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,310
is like stars falling into the sea.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,890
Rains after a long drought.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,510
My heart,

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,470
except for you,

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,470
can't hold anyone else.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,130
You are my heart.

10
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,810
My treasure.

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,470
Ah.

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,390
You know what do we call

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,890
your chasing after Xiaoqing?

14
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,690
The guy dwells on wishful thinking.

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,930
Just a daydreamer.

16
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,170
Don't think I didn't know

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,270
you forced Miss Xiaoqing

18
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:40,730
to pretend to be with you.

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,550
Shut up.

20
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,810
Ha.

21
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,210
I got you.

22
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,970
If I tell the Soul Department,

23
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,270
see what you should do.

24
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,310
The Soul Department doesn't care about this.

25
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,890
And

26
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,430
it depends on whether you have the chance.

27
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,510
What are you doing?

28
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,090
Ah.

29
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,890
It's comfortable.

30
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,510
Xiaoqing.

31
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,470
Don't you feel sore and can't get up?

32
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,190
I came out to exercise.

33
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,890
Still lie to me?

34
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,350
Miss Xiaoqing.

35
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,530
Don't believe this bad rascal.

36
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,530
It was his lie.

37
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,390
Liar.

38
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,110
Xiaoqing.

39
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,110
Lie to others.

40
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,070
You deserve it.

41
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,290
Hey, Xiaoqing.

42
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,190
I won't listen.

43
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,210
Don't follow me.

44
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,890
Xiaoqing.

45
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,090
See.

46
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,050
Candied fruit.

47
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,930
I didn't have time to eat it last time.

48
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,490
Try it.

49
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,450
It's so sweet.

50
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,610
No, thanks.

51
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,570
I am full with anger.

52
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,730
Hey.

53
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,650
Alas.

54
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,310
This is called shooting myself in the foot.

55
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,350
It's actually not sweet.

56
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,330
Here.

57
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,550
Drink water.

58
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,310
Your clothes.

59
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,090
Back and forth.

60
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,230
What do you want from me?

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,550
Receive my apology.

62
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,510
Xiaoqing, wait for me.

63
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,590
Li Xiuning, stop following me.

64
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,290
Xiaoqing.

65
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,610
Are you still mad at me?

66
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,110
No.

67
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,290
But your face.

68
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,790
You don't look happy.

69
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,170
None of your business.

70
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,710
I know.

71
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,410
You think I lied to you.

72
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,470
But my heart is true.

73
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,790
But you are still a liar.

74
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,250
Don't you think so?

75
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,330
In that case...

76
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,970
What are you doing?

77
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,750
Don't you think I lied to you?

78
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,050
If I really get hurt,

79
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,330
then I am not a liar.

80
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:17,790
Oh my.

81
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,510
Who asks you to hurt yourself?

82
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,970
Then, have you forgiven me?

83
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,050
What if...

84
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,430
It will never happen again.

85
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,970
I also prepared a gift for you.

86
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,090
My hand hurts too.

87
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,410
I'll wear it for you.

88
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,450
What's the rush?

89
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,930
The time for the Soul Department to grant the token has been advanced.

90
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,950
Will I soon get he Nine-Heaven Jade Ruler?

91
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,410
Yes.

92
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,230
