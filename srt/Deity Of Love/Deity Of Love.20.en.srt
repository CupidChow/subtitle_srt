2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,030
Die, Demon.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,910
HAHAHA!

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,430
Loser.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,330
Not holding up already.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,950
You're mine now.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,750
Brother.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,330
Ning Yu...

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,350
Fu Ling.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,790
Be careful.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,910
I... I'm going with you.

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,930
Give me your blood,

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,770
and I'll give you pleasure.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,150
Demon.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,650
Kill me while you can,

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,810
otherwise

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,150
I won't let you off.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,530
You're a tough one.

19
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,190
I...

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,150
like that.

21
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,010
The more loyal a man is,

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,470
the better his blood tastes.

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,170
Do you really think

24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,290
capturing me will do?

25
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,750
That, we won't know

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,970
until we try.

27
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,370
Ning Yu.

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,410
Ling'er.

29
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,970
Demon, let him go.

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,950
It's you.

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,190
Then I'll do as Lord told me to.

32
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,750
You know me?

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,950
You killed all those people.

34
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,610
Yeah, but they're not very tasty.

35
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,610
You killed Wanying, too.

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,730
That stupid girl was quite useful.

37
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,110
You framed Xiaoqing.

38
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,950
Demon, you can't escape.

39
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,830
The Soul Department?

40
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,290
Department head.

41
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,210
(The Soul Department)
Any demon who breaks in dies.

42
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,530
Am I right?

43
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,190
Yes.

44
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,550
You came here yourself,

45
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,870
so don't blame me for this cruelty.

46
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,550
The Department covers for the Demon.

47
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,210
And the Demon goes to the Department.

48
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,590
Is the Department

49
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,150
colluding with the Demon?

50
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,930
Miss Xiaoqing.

51
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,890
Demons appear often these days.

52
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,150
It's too dangerous

53
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,830
to go out at night.

54
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,630
Go back if you're afraid.

55
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,890
You're kidding.

56
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,130
I'm known for being handsome and brave.

57
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,670
If there is a Demon,

58
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,530
I'll smash it with my silver.

59
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,110
Xiaoqing.

60
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,510
I have proven your innocence.

61
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,210
But where are you?

62
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,350
Kill you,

63
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,050
and I'll get the seal back.

64
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,710
Who's there?

65
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,290
Dare attack me sneakily midway.

66
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,210
Demonic energy?

67
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,190
The Green Snake got power back.

68
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,130
I'll kill you first.

69
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,650
Li Xiuning.

70
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,950
I told you.

71
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,450
This time

72
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,150
I'm not leaving you.

73
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,830
Li Xiuning.

74
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,530
Li Xiuning.

75
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,210
I'll kill you.

76
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,270
Miss Xiaoqing, Miss Xiaoqing.

77
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,090
They're coming. I'll spare you today.

78
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,370
Li Xiuning.

79
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,770
Oh my god.

80
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,010
What happened to you?

81
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,730
Li Xiuning.

82
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,190
Li Xiuning.

83
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,090
The Demon came to the Soul Department?

84
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,130
And entered the hall?

85
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,450
Same as last time.

86
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,770
Brother, what are you hiding?

87
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,090
