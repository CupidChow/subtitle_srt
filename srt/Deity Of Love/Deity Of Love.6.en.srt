2
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,470
Li Xiuning.

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,870
Miss Xiaoqing.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,450
I'm glad you're okay.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,550
What happened?

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,530
Nothing.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,130
It's just a small injury.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,770
What about you?

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,010
Why did you go to the back hill?

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,310
I want to retrieve my memory.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,110
But I didn't remember anything.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,570
Oh.

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,710
Only this.

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,550
Do you know what it is?

15
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,090
To find out,

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,050
you have to go to the Intelligence Pavillion.

17
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,450
Intelligence Pavillion?

18
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,950
As long as you pay the price,

19
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,050
you can have what you want.

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,110
Let's go.

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,290
This is a sachet.

22
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,370
And these.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:05,750
This one.

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,790
Do you like it?

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,070
I just find it a little familiar.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,910
Hey.

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,890
Keep it.

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,290
Maybe it can help you remember something.

29
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,310
Okay.

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,070
What are you looking at?

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,330
If I can be a Demon Hunter,

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,550
I'll be just like them.

33
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,990
Demon Hunter?

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,470
What is that?

35
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,730
Demons bring chaos to the world.

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,870
If I become a Demon Hunter

37
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,650
and join the Soul Department,

38
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,950
I'll be able to kill the demons and protect people.

39
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,210
Brother.

40
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,650
Sister.

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,450
Brother.

42
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,070
I met the Snake Demon

43
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,450
in Qingyun Valley.

44
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,070
but I couldn't catch her.

45
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,390
I know.

46
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,850
Take care of yourself.

47
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,530
Let me

48
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,250
deal with it.

49
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,330
Is that the Intelligence Pavilion?

50
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,210
Yes.

51
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,750
Only the Nimble Lock

52
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,490
can break the seal.

53
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,450
Yo!

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,330
There's a guest.

55
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,770
You know me?

56
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,530
No wonder you'd come.

57
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,690
You don't remember me any more.

58
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,870
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,430
When asking someone for help,

60
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,230
you should be polite.

61
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,570
Xiaoqing.

62
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,430
I just want to get my memory back.

63
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,010
You can't reveal the secret.

64
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,590
Hey.

65
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,310
That's not what your ad says

66
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,870
about your business.

67
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,810
I can do as I like.

68
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,390
However,

69
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,030
since you're an old friend,

70
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,550
I'll offer you a discount.

71
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,470
Give me the Nine-Heaven Jade Ruler.

72
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,010
and I'll tell you

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,450
how to retrieve your memory.

74
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,710
What is the Nine-Heaven Jade Ruler

75
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,470
she talked about?

76
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,390
The treasure of the year

77
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,430
at Soul Department.

78
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,350
If you pass the Demon Hunter qualification trial,

79
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,230
you can have it.

80
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,630
How can I be part of the trial?

81
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,410
Fencing,

82
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,450
pills and medicine,

83
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,530
and spells

84
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,410
are all necessary skills

85
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,750
for a Demon Hunter.

86
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,510
This is the Flower Powder

87
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,270
This

88
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,790
is a muter.

89
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,430
Have a try.

90
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,350
Make a muter.

91
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,370
You know,

92
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,610
explosions are common

93
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,790
in concocting pills.

94
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,610
Common?

95
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,230
Happen all the time.

96
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,370
I've seen a lot.

97
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,770
Qingyun Valley has never been associated with demons.

98
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,030
Yes.

99
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,770
Why did the Snake Demon appear there?

100
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,810
I need to go there in person.

101
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,810
Okay.

102
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,270
