00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,140
Li Xiuning

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,940
I won't let you die.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,820
Only

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,660
Blue Snow Lotus with seven leaves can save him.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,580
Where is it?

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,980
There are some in the Soul Department.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,140
Miss Xiaoqing,

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,040
the Soul Department

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,040
is heavily-guarded.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,960
You may die

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,440
if you go there.

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,660
You're going to Kunlun

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,180
and steal the magic herbs for such a man.

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,180
It's an act of suicide.

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,740
Xiaoqing,

17
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,620
maybe you can't understand it now.

18
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,340
I don't understand.

19
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,540
But if one day,

20
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,860
you have someone you love,

21
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,780
you will understand it.

22
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,460
What if you can't come back?

23
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,620
Then I won't come back.

24
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,660
Miss Xiaoqing, what's wrong with you?

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,260
Nothing.

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,740
Even if it's dangerous,

27
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,220
I will go.

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,020
(I think I understand it now.)

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
(These are not the Snow Lotus.)

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
(This should be the Snow Lotus.)

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,700
(I can save Li Xiuning now.)

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,160
(A demon?)

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,160
You evil demon!

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,740
How dare you steal herbs from the Soul Department?

35
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,660
I will kill you.

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,880
Get away.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
I don't want to kill anyone.

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,380
Who?

39
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,720
Li Xiuning, you will be all right.

40
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,900
Definitely.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,460
Department Head,

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,740
you've ignored me recently.

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,840
I need more power.

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,940
This is the list of all Demon Hunters.

45
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,860
I need you to investigate them.

46
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,220
I got it.

47
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,420
Remember to track Li Xiuning.

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,300
I, Red Fox,

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,220
will do as you order.

50
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,220
