2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,830
If you want to refine the pill,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,210
it is necessary to be familiar with

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,250
all kinds of herbs.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,630
So many herbs here!

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,770
Is this Solanum nigrum or Hsuehchien?

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,390
See,

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,690
the one with the yellow bottom and white heart

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,490
is Solanum nigrum.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,490
Solanum nigrum.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,150
You made it?

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,170
Yes.

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:34,990
It looks good

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,090
on you.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,170
It's going to rain.

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,270
Let's go down the mountain.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,330
Okay.

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,030
It is likely to rain for a whole day.

19
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,630
How did you know it's raining?

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,130
By instinct.

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,290
Maybe I knew it before.

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,930
I will help you recover your memory.

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,710
Why do you want to know

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,370
the information of this jade so badly?

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,830
I haven't seen my parents since I was a kid.

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,770
This jade was with me

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,310
when my master brought me back.

28
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,530
When

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,590
my memory recovers,

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,350
I'll help you find your parents.

31
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,490
Alright.

32
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,170
(Usage of Talisman is a required course for Demon Hunters.)

33
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,330
(Swordsmanship is also the most important skill.)

34
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,310
Don't you need to have a rest?

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,110
No,

36
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,350
I'm not tired at all.

37
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,510
Not to mention the next tryout is around the corner.

38
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,750
Well.

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,270
(We must seize the time to practice.)

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,830
Wait for me.

41
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,790
I'll be back soon.

42
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,350
(She is with Xiuning every day.)

43
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,790
(I'm gonna kill you.)

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,590
Xiuning.

45
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,390
You again.

46
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,590
This is Qingyun Valley, our turf.

47
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,170
Why can't I come?

48
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,570
What do you want to do here?

49
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,790
You will never pick up what we learn

50
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,670
in Qingyun Valley with your stupid brain.

51
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,230
You are a fool.

52
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,790
Stay away from me.

53
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,390
Don't regard my goodwill as malice.

54
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,650
There will be a time when you have to beg me.

55
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,710
Hum.

56
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,750
Wan Ying,

57
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,690
why are you here?

58
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,590
I,

59
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,010
I'm here to ask you about

60
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,590
the spiritual spell cultivation.

61
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,930
Go to the second floor of the Library,

62
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,810
and read the sixth book.

63
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,510
But I can't understand it.

64
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,790
Since you have read so many books, please teach me.

65
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,830
Xiaoqing.

66
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,550
Ah!

67
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,330
Oh, my!

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,610
My ankle sprained.

69
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,210
Brother Xiuning,

70
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,210
please help me.

71
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,250
Why are you holding my brother's leg?

72
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,410
I sprained my foot.

73
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,870
Xiaoqing?

74
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,970
I'm fine.

75
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,230
Why didn't you hurt?

76
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,110
You want me to get hurt?

77
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,550
It is you that

78
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,530
make the Pill Room explode.

79
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,530
You're talking nonsense!

80
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,050
You can't accuse me of it without evidence

81
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,230
because Xiuning likes you.

82
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,690
What are you doing? Let me go!

83
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,050
You said it wasn't you.

84
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,570
Xiaoqing,

85
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,570
are you all right?

86
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,530
Brother,

87
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,490
I was framed by her.

88
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,170
Did you make the Pill Room explode?

89
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,150
It's not me.

90
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,570
(The Chief is here.)

91
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,570
The Chief?

92
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,030
My Lord, are there any things

93
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,750
you want us to do?

94
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,150
I'm here to

95
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,770
find the demon

96
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,330
because Qingyun Valley is filled with

97
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,770
the breath of a demon not long ago.

98
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,730
We should keep away from the demon,

99
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,230
in case the demon hurts us.

100
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,790
A demon with us?

101
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,370
It's impossible.

102
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,730
People in the valley are all acquaintances.

103
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,410
The appearance of the demon can change,

104
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,530
so it's hard to tell.

105
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,450
This means that everyone is suspicious.

106
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,630
It's her.

107
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,550
It must be her.

108
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,550
She's the newcomer.

109
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,470
She must be the demon.

110
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,250
