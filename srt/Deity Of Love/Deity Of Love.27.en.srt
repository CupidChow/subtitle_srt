2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,140
Snake Demon.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,580
What do you want from me?

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,300
Look at my face.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,260
Can you recognize me?

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,320
I didn't notice anything wrong last time.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,540
Otherwise,

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,460
you would have died in my hands.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,900
I have forgotten the whole world.

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,980
But I could only remember you.

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,060
Why don't you remember me?

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,220
I don't recognize you.

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,100
I will never have anything to do with demons.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
Rest assured.

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,420
I will make you accept me.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,740
Snake Demon.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,380
What exactly do you want to do?

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,860
Xiaoqing.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,260
Why do you want to give me this?

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,620
As long as you always wear this,

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,860
you can remember me forever.

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,540
How is it?

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,980
Do you like it?

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,580
I like all

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,280
that you send me.

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,740
Do you really forget me?

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,180
I told you.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,020
I'm not the person you're looking for.

29
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,420
You look exactly the same as her.

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,020
But you...

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,140
have totally different personalities.

32
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,620
Let go of me!

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,380
I can't be a demon.

34
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,860
What's wrong with demons?

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,740
Demons will bring chaos to the world,

36
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,100
so they should die.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,160
You said we should die?

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,100
Do you think the Soul Department is clean?

39
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,340
Soul Department protects people of the world.

40
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,140
Why can't we

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,380
kill demons?

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,580
Really?

43
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,220
A large number of Demon Hunters died before.

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,540
But it's all done by Soul Department.

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,900
You are unqualified to condemn demons.

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,660
Impossible.

47
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,140
You didn't trust him that much.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,100
Well,

49
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,540
at least we have a clear conscience

50
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,820
for what we have done.

51
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,620
Have a clear conscience.

52
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,940
Then why do you feel guilty?

53
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,340
I am going to confirm something.

54
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,460
Stay here.

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,000
Xiaoqing said the jade is related to Heart Lock Seal.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,620
Is the jade the key to becoming Fa Hai?

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,380
No, I won't be Fa Hai.

58
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,300
I finally found you.

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,620
Get out of my way.

60
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,140
I won't.

61
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,460
If you step forward,

62
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,220
I will kill you.

63
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,300
Good.

64
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,380
If you won't regret it,

65
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,380
then just kill me.

66
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,140
Get off my back.

67
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,620
Do you have to remind me again and again

68
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,580
the person in front of me is my biggest enemy?

69
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,100
I am not Fa Hai.

70
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,060
I am Xiuning.

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,700
You are.

72
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
I'm telling you,

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,380
don't follow me anymore.

74
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,660
If you show up again,

75
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,140
I will kill you.

76
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,740
Xiaoqing.

78

80
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,300
You can be anyone,

81
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,740
but why are you the very Fa Hai?

82
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,300
Five hundred years ago,

83
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,860
you didn't let me and my sister go.

84
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,420
And now,

85
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,620
do we have to get entangled again?

86
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840

How long are you going to lock me up?

91
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,020
Let's go.

92
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,940
I'll take you to Intelligence Pavilion.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,300
And let me go?

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,980
Sis, after you recover your memory,

95
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,860
you won't want to leave me anymore.
