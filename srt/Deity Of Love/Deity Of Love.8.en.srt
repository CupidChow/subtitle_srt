2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,670
It's her.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,590
It must be her.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,590
She's the newcomer.

5
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,510
She must be the demon.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,510
I.

7
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,410
Your Lord,

8
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,510
please make a fair ruling.

9
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,790
If

10
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,210
you said

11
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,510
she is the demon,

12
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,170
do you have any evidence?

13
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,610
Xiaoqing is not the demon.

14
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,910
The Demon Hunting Pin has proved it.

15
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,050
Brother Xiuning is right,

16
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,410
if he has tested it,

17
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,330
then Xiaoqing is not the demon.

18
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,750
It must be her disguise.

19
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,270
She went to the back mountain alone,

20
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,350
and all the demons in the bamboo forest were gone.

21
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,670
It doesn't make sense if she is not the demon.

22
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,370
It is you that led Xiaoqing to back mountain.

23
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,650
Anyway, I saw it with my own eyes.

24
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,910
She even convinced those little demons.

25
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,690
I even don't know you went to

26
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,070
the back mountain that day.

27
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,330
Anyhow,

28
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,090
the day when the breath of the demon broke out

29
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,550
is the same day when Xiaoqing went to the back mountain.

30
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,390
She must be the demon.

31
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,570
You're the demon?

32
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,750
Demon？

33
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,690
I'll kill you.

34
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,430
Are you just going to listen to one side of the story?

35
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,210
It's better to kill her by mistake than let her go.

36
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,830
Stop.

37
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,330
My Lord,

38
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,210
kill the demon right now!

39
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,030
That's it.

40
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,290
In that case,

41
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,170
let's test her together.

42
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,990
This is Soul-Checking Lock.

43
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,670
As long as there's a demon,

44
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,170
it will sound the alarm,

45
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,630
and lock the demon

46
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,790
until it shows his or her original appearance.

47
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,750
Xiaoqing,

48
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,910
you're fine.

49
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,250
I know you're not the demon.

50
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,710
(There's no breath of demon.)

51
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,070
(Then I'll let you off.)

52

(His identity needs to be confirmed.)

56
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,370
How's your injury?

57
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,690
I'm fine now.

58
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,770
We can set out tomorrow to look for Snake Demon.

59
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,810
Don't bother about the Snake Demon.

60
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,770
I have other plans.

61
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,870
Yes, my Lord.

62
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,390
How is the preparation

63
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,990
of this selection going?

64
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,410
It's Dream Furbolg.

65
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,650
Change it into Sky Moon Fox.

66
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,350
Sky Moon Fox?

67
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,270
But...

68
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,450
Alright,

69
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,530
I will change it.

(The Demon Hunter Selection is divided into two rounds.)

Take it easy.

00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,910
How is it?

77
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,910
I've asked around.

78
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,650
The demon in the selection

79
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,910
is replaced by Sky Moon Fox.

80
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,490
Brother Xiuning is so outstanding that

81

we will definitely win the first prize.

Hum.

83

Why are you talking big again?

84
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,770
Don't you know that you're unable to reach it?

85
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,490
I wonder it was who that ran so fast last time.

86
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,410
Stop mentioning last time.

87
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,070
Don't you know that I had affairs last time?

88

your age

95
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,110
and your address?

96
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,790
Have you got married or not?

97
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,790
You're blocking my way.

98
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,810
Oh my!

99
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,090
Are you all right?

Li Xiuning.

101
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,650
I'm talking to the girl.

102
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,190
What does it have to do with you?

103
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,690
She's the people of Qingyun Valley,

104
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,190
you can't talk with her.

105
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,650
Hum,

106
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,530
stop talking nonsense.

107
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,290
I know she's not from Qingyun Valley.

108
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,570
Are people not from Qingyun Valley

109
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,190
not allowed to take part in the tryout?

110
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,150
Hum,

111
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,330
of course.

112
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,650
I will definitely report her.

113
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,370
Pardon?

114
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,990
I can make you dumb.

115
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,730
Hum,

116
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,570
it is cheating if you let people from nowhere

117
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,830
to take part in the competition.

118
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,430
How can he say these to my senior brother!

119
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,410
I'll kill him.

120
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,090
Don't go.

121
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,670
If you do this,

122
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,930
then you're helping Xiaoqing.

123
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,010
You're right.

124
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,770
I remember there is one situation that allows others to take part in the tryout.

125
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,590
What is it?

126
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,550
Couple.

127
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,850
Is it right, my husband?

128
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,050
Husband?

129
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,990
What?

130
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,870
Husband?

131
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,450
Ah.

132
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,450
Ah...

133
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,110
Are you full, my dear?

134
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,230
Yes...

135
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,270
I'm full.

136
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,270
Then let's go back and rest.

137
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,690
It's abnormal.
