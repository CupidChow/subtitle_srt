2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,170
Ah!

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,390
We are demons.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,510
What are you afraid of?

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,130
Get him.

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:16,790
That's right.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,250
That's not right.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,590
I'm a great demon hunter.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,550
What am I afraid of?

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,790
Haaa!

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,930
Yah!

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,690
You blocked my spell with your head.

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,490
Unbelievable!

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,030
Boss, please spare my life.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,990
Life gives us no choice.

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,950
Yes, boss.

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,230
We have no choice.

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,010
Don't call me boss.

19
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,950
Call me Distinguished Mister.

20
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,290
Yes, boss.

21
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,190
No problelm.

22
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:51,910
Boss.

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,670
If you help me

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,830
do one thing,

25
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,870
I'll let you off.

26
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,050
Of course, of course.

27
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,350
Come and get me.

28
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,790
If you want Puti Lotus, catch me first.

29
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,010
Find me.

30
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,610
If you want Puti Lotus, find me.

31
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,470
It's you.

32
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,010
What do you want?

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,550
Despicable demon.

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,290
How dare you take advantage of

35
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,170
a woman in broad daylight?

36
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,350
It's dark.

37
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,930
Ah.

38
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,670
That's even worse.

39
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,270
How dare you take advantage of

40
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,210
a woman in the darkness of night?

41
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,810
Miss Xiaoqing, don't be afraid.

42
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,150
I'll take care of them.

43
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,470
Boss, boss.

44
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,650
He captured us

45
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,390
and told us to attack you.

46
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,970
Yes, boss.

47
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,650
Heaven and earth will tell

48
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,850
how loyal we're to you.

49
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,810
What a coincidence.

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,810
So the two demons

51
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,470
are Miss Xiaoqing's underlings.

52
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,530
What they say is true.

53
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,610
People who are meant to get together

54
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,910
always find each other.

55
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,070
Who is your buddy?

56
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,070
Where is the Puti Lotus?

57
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,370
My lord,

58
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,790
I need to heal,

59
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,110
and take in fresh blood.

60
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,150
Go.

61
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,990
Don't forget to clean up the scene.

62
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,730
What happened here?

63
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,690
More demons appear in town,

64
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,470
killing lots of people,

65
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,810
the way they killed Ren Wanying.

66
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,350
Could it be

67
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,810
Xiaoqing?

68
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,190
It wasn't her. She already left.

69
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,390
Now that she left,

70
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,690
who are you to say it wasn't her?

71
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,350
I will catch the demon

72
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,510
and prove Xiaoqing's innocence.

73
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,610
Mr. Lin,

74
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,430
what brings you here this time?

75
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,850
Where is Puti Lotus?

76
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,110
Puti Lotus.

77
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,590
So you're here for  Puti Lotus.

78
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,930
But we don't have Puti Lotus here.

79
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,550
Hey.

80
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,350
That's enough.

81
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,970
Don't give me that.

82
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,150
I know you have it.

83
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,430
I offer ten thousand taels of silver.

84
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,650
A generous offer.

85
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,110
But our Puti Lotus

86
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,350
is special.

87
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,230
Okay, got it.

88
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,150
Thirty thousand.

89
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,110
You know, Puti Lotus

90
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,550
is a family heirloom.

91
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,510
Hey.

92
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,310
What are you doing?

93
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,310
Want to kill me to get it?

94
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,990
Miss,

95
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,010
business is business.

96
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,650
He doesn't want to sell it.

97
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,730
Then I'll offer a higher bid.

98
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,470
How about fifty thousand?

99
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,510
A hundred thousand?

100
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,570
No.

101
