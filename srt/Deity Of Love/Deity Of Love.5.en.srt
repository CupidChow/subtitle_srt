2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,030
If you eat a person for me,

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,390
I can spare your lives.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,010
Alright.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,890
Definitely.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,430
Boss, please don't kiill me.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,450
I'd better have Fu Ling

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,170
do this kind of matter.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,390
Ling.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,170
Isn't Xiaoqing trying to restore her memory?

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,490
If you can help her,

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,950
Xiuning must be very happy.

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,910
That makes sense.

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,450
Since she saved me yesterday,

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,850
I will help her.

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:35,570
Well,

17
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,530
I heard that

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,470
if you go to the back hill alone...

19
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,350
I know I know.

20
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,150
Just give me the address.

21
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,670
I will ask her.

22
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,790
Fu Ling has the simplest mind.

23
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,190
As long as Xiaoqing is gone,

24
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,970
Xiuning will be mine sooner or later.

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,990
Brother.

26
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,850
Are you all right?

27
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,570
I'm fine.

28
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,250
Sister.

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,970
Take this

30
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,530
and find the Snake Demon.

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,570
Okay.

32
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,170
With the power of the Snake Demon, the Heart Lock Seal will be combined into one piece.

33
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,710
Ghost!

34
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,190
Look carefully.

35
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,330
I'm not a ghost.

36
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,890
Why are you here?

37
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,670
To send you good news, of course.

38
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,190
This is for saving me yesterday.

39
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,670
Here.

40
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,810
What is this?

41
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,530
Aren't you looking for you memory?

42
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,190
It is said that this place

43
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,190
holds what you want.

44
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,950
But you have to go alone.

45
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:34,890
Ah.

46
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,290
That's the girl?

47
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,890
It's her. It's her.

48
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,130
Then what are you waiting for?

49
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,130
Do it.

50
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,590
Are you from here?

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,990
Can you help me get my memory back?

52
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,290
Get your memory back?

53
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,110
We don't take such low-skill jobs.

54
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,690
What?

55
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,650
So you do have a clue, right?

56
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,730
Won't tell you. We won't tell you.

57
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,710
You lied to me.

58
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,550
Yes we did.

59
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,210
Do the job to save our lives.

60
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,350
This is called the work ethic.

61
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,810
Snake Demon's breath.

62
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:49,890
Boss, boss.

63
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,470
Boss, please don't kill me.

64
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,090
That girl asked us to do it.

65
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,150
Right.

66
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,450
If we don't, she'll kill us.

67
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,050
Shut up!

68
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,630
I want you to help me retrieve my memory.

69
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,730
You can do it.

70
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,430
Boss.

71
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,550
We were talking nonsense.

72
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,230
That's right.

73
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,630
Just let us go.

74
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,570
Why should I spare your lives?

75
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,770
I might as well eat you.

76
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,790
Don't!

77
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,550
Boss.

78
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,770
If you keep us alive,

79
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,130
we'll do whatever you ask.

80
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,490
Help you get back your memory.

81
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,490
We have parents and children to look after.

82
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,150
Please let us go.

83
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,170
Snake Demon.

84
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,170
I finally found you.

85
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,470
I wonder if Xiaoqing has retrieved her memory.

86
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,990
Did she really go to the back hill alone?

87
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,230
Yes.

88
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,350
Didn't you ask me to tell her that?

89
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,370
What?

90
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,890
Miss Xiaoqing went to the back hill.

91
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,530
There are so many demons there.

92
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,990
What a Snake Demon!

93
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,670
The seal didn't change you for the better after all these years.

94
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,650
Demon?

95
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,110
You call me a demon?

96
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,370
Do you know me?

97
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,530
Don't play with me.

98
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,150
I'm taking you back to the Soul Department.

99
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,050
This is not good.

100
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,070
The hairpin is back with the Snake Demon.

101
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,230
I have to tell the Department Head.

102
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,790
Sister.

103
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,410
Xiaoqing.

104
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,890
This is for self-defense.

105
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,630
Do you like it?

106
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,630
The hairpin can turn into a sword.

107
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,610
Miss Xiaoqing.

108
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,950
Who is she?

109
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,470
How could her power make the Heart Lock Seal explode?

110
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,610
