2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,070
What happened?

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,270
Xiaoqing.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,490
Don't go there.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,690
She's a demon.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,990
She killed Wanying.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,070
Xiaoqing

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,950
is a demon.

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,030
Ning Yu,

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,690
what are you doing?

11
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,450
Kill this demon.

12
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,830
It must have nothing to do with Xiaoqing.

13
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,950
It must.

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,230
So what?

15
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,770
All demons should be killed.

16
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,290
If she doesn't kill people today,

17
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,650
she will kill people tomorrow.

18
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,570
I didn't kill anyone.

19
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,830
We have been together for so long.

20
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,930
Don't you know her?

21
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,130
So what?

22
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,050
The demon is a demon.

23
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,390
There's no difference.

24
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,370
Kill this demon.

25
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:38,790
Kill her.

26
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,770
Kill this demon.

27
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:40,730
Ning Yu.

28
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,810
Listen to Brother Xiuning

29
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,890
and put down your sword.

30
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,270
Ning Yu.

31
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,270
Put down your sword.

32
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,190
You are a demon hunter.

33
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,190
Why do you insist on protecting a demon?

34
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,770
Even if I'm a monster,

35
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,090
I should go to hell?

36
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,190
Get out of my way.

37
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,930
Well.

38
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Then you will get your own way.

39
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,730
Xiaoqing.

40
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,390
Ning Yu.

41
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,850
Are you here to capture me?

42
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,630
Xiaoqing.

43
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,730
You're a demon hunter, while I'm a demon.

44
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,890
People and demons can never live in harmony.

45
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,470
Can you really accept that I'm a demon?

46
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,450
You demon,

47
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,370
how dare you break into the Soul Department?

48
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,410
How is it going?

49
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,870
My lord,

50
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,370
there was some accident.

51
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,210
I was nearly found.

52
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,410
What a good-for-nothing you are!

53
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,130
Sister Xi Ling,

54
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,350
why do you come in the palace without any permission?

55
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,630
Department Head, please forgive me.

56
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,390
I just saw

57
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,590
a demon sneak in.

58
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,710
I'm here to have a check.

59
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,390
Oh?

60
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,710
Demon?

61
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,470
Demons can be found anywhere in the world,

62
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,670
except the Soul Department.

63
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,350
But I did see it.

64
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,350
Really?

65
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,670
Are you suspecting me?

66
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,010
I dare not.

67
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,430
That's good.

68
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,390
Do what you should do.

69
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,730
Don't forget

70
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,830
how the Snake Demon ran.

71
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,090
Yeah.

72
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,130
I got it.

73
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,370
I'm leaving now.

74
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,610
Why...

75
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,410
Why is Xiaoqing a demon?

76
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,570
Brother Xiuning.

77
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,170
Brother Xiuning.

78
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,030
Can you stop being like that?

79
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,450
Will demons definitely kill people?

80
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,450
Don't forget,

81
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,690
demons will definitely do evil things.

82
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,810
Can't people do those too?

83
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,030
But is't it

84
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,750
what the Soul Department has said?

85
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,610
The Soul Department.

86
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,430
Even if Xiaoqing is a demon,

87
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,670
I also believe that

88
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,970
she won't kill anyone.

89
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,470
How do you prove it?

90
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,930
I will prove Xiaoqing's innocence,

91
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,430
as well as the existence of good demons.

92
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,830
I will find out the truth

93
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,930
to clear Xiaoqing's name.

94
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,750
Xiaoqing, wait for me.

95
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,370
