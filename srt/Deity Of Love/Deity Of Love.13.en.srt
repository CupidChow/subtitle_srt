Since I have given it to you,

29

you should eliminate more demons.

30

You have my word.

is it the Nine-Heaven Jade Ruler?

50
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,770
Is it...

51
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,450
Yes.

52

Ning Yu.

53
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,970
Xiaoqing and I will go to Intelligence Pavilion.

54
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,270
You go back with Ling'er.

55
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,230
Well.

56
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,270
Xiaoqing.

57
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,770
Let's go.

58
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,350
Miss Xiaoqing.

59
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,390
Oh, Miss Xiaoqing.

60
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,190
My heart has gone with you.

61
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,310
Hey, are you blind?

62
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,010
It's you who are blind.

63
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,770
It's you.

64
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,310
You like Xiaoqing,

65
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,310
right?

66
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,050
Yes.

67
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,110
Do you want me to help you?

68
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,810
Yes.

69
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,450
You're so fast.

70
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,030
Do you know the owner of this hairpin?

71
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,330
Its owner is you.

72
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,990
Nonsense.

73
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,790
Since you know the hairpin,

74
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,570
You should know who Xiaoqing is.

75
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,430
Can you help me recover my memory?

76
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,190
Don't overthink it.

77
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,910
Except you yourself,

78
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,370
no one can help you recover your memory.

79
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,330
You lied to me.

80
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,950
Don't worry.

81
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,230
The trouble should be ended by the trouble maker.

82
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,190
I can tell you

83
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,690
how to retrieve it.

84
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,990
How?

85
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,570
