2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,250
(Are they...)

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,390
Are you going to stay with us?

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,890
Ha.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,690
I...

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,570
Hey, Miss Xiaoqing.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,430
Xiaoqing!

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,130
She entered the room with Brother Xiuning.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,530
What is she going to do?

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,930
Let's follow them.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,430
Xiaoqing,

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,330
why did you do this?

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,250
Don't you think it's the easiest way to solve the problem?

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,790
You don't want to?

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,330
Or do you dislike me?

16
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,870
Of course not.

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,010
Absolutely not.

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,210
That's good.

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,750
In order to recover my memory,

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,170
I don't mind it.

21
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,910
Only for recovering memory...

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,810
What are you doing?

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,430
You asked me to sit here.

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,050
I asked you to take the quilt,

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,710
not to sleep.

26
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,990
Okay.

27
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,850
Xiaoqing pissed me off.

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,810
I knew she would definitely do something to Brother Xiuning.

29
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,610
Xiaoqing,

30
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,610
be gentle.

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,150
Move a little to the left.

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,930
To the right.

33
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,110
Brother Xiuning,

34
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,490
Talk to me later.

35
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,530
It's late.

36
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,730
What's wrong with him?

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,930
I've never seen him so angry before.

38
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,370
Maybe...

39
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,610
He is feeling blue now.

40
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,190
(The second round of the selection competition begins.)

41
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,310
(Those who see through the illusion
created by Sky Moon Fox can get the highest score. )

42
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,030
Sky Moon Fox is best at killing people in illusion, be careful.

43
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,870
(Haha, show me your desire at the bottom of your hearts.)

44
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,590
It's Sky Moon Fox.

45
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,810
(What's wrong with you guys?)

46
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,110
Your Excellency.

47
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,530
You will surely be the pillar of

48
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,530
Soul Department after you work for us.

49
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,690
You think I would say these words?

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,330
You're not good at swordmanship,

51
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,070
refining pills and using herbs.

52
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,110
You can't do anything.

53
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,290
You are a loser.

54
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,990
Your passion can't help you

55
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,690
to be admitted to Soul department.

56
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,710
Xiaoqing.

57
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,710
Why can't we be together in the future?

58
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,630
Because I'm getting married.

59
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,850
Why can't I be with you

60
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,510
after your marriage?

61
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,350
You will understand

62
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,630
when you have someone you love.

63
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,990
Hey!

64
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,710
Where are you?

65
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,370
Hey?

66
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,710
No one is here.

67
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,990
Li Xiuning, let me see whether

68
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,470
you're excellent or not in your dream.

69
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,810
Hum.

70
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,770
