2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,570
Are sure you are fine?

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,490
How about I fetch you a doctor?

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,310
No need.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,490
I will be alright when I stare at you.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,610
- Really?
- Sure.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,490
Well, then lie down and rest.

8
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,230
Does your hand hurt?

9
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,230
How about I blow it for you?

10
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,310
It is useless whether it hurts or not.

11
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,350
Brother won't drink the medicine anyway.

12
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,110
The herbs have been boiled or nothing again.

13
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,710
How could it be in vain?

14
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,210
It tastes great.

15
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,290
Are you stupid?

16
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,670
Medicines don't taste good.

17
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,550
As long as they are boiled by you,

18
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,990
they taste sweet in my heart.

19
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,630
They are pretending to be husband and wife.

20
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,030
Why does Brother treat her so well?

21
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,750
Oh.

22
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,030
So it's an impersonation.

23
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,050
Then I can pursue Miss Xiaoqing again.

24
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,210
Ah.

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,170
Miss Xiaoqing.

26
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,950
I'm here.

27
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,630
Miss Xiaoqing.

28
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,010
Miss Xiaoqing.

29
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,290
This is especially for Miss Xiaoqing.

30
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,630
The flowers and jewelry I fetched.

31
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,730
Alas.

32
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,850
This one.

33
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,850
It's from Spiritual Jade Pavilion.

34
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,090
This is from Frost Flowers Pavilion…

35
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,970
These all are…

36
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,590
Ouch.

37
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,770
Oh my.

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,510
Ouch.

39
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,390
What's wrong with you?

40
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,630
No big deal.

41
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,630
It might be some minor injuries.

42
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,130
Back and leg pain.

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,970
Let me get you some medicines.

44
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,710
No need.

45
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,430
Let's go somewhere less crowded.

46
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,850
Hey, Miss Xiaoqing.

47
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,970
He's pretending to be ill.

48
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,310
I don't like what you send me.

49
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,090
Such a decisive girl.

50
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,010
My crush on you gets stronger.

51
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,470
There is nothing in the world that I can't buy.

52
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,090
Miss Xiaoqing, you will be my girl.

53
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,190
