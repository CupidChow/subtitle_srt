00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,630
(Why is there a girl here?)

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,550
(She wakes up.)

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,930
Who are you?

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,870
I'm Li Xiuning from Qingyun Valley.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,770
Miss, are you feeling good?

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,430
Where are we?

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,810
The land of Jinghu Lake.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,430
Miss, who are you?

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,010
Why are you here?

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,630
(Xiaoqing! Live on!)

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,690
I...

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,450
I'm Xiaoqing.

(Who is it?)

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,910
Miss, are you okay?

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,130
Why can't I remember?

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,850
Let's go out first.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,950
The land of Jinghu Lake.

21
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,790
Your Excellency.

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,410
Just now,

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,970
something unusual happened in Jinghu Lake.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,270
You go there and investigate first.

25
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,790
Jinghu Lake

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,270
is where the Snake Demon has been sealed.

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,410
Do...

28
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,090
Do we need finish the selection in Jinghu Lake earlier?

29
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,770
No.

30
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,210
But if the Snake Demon come out,

31
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,290
she would wreak havoc in the human world.

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,970
At that time...

33
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,730
If you fear demons,

34
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,410
how can you become a demon hunter?

35
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,730
I got it.

36
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,150
Green Sanke Demon.

37
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,970
This time,

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,890
I will never let you get out of my hands again.

39
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,070
It's he.

40
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,830
It's they

41
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,470
who made such a big noise just now.

42
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,910
How dare they bother us?

43
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,210
Kill him.

44
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,570
Demons.

45
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,170
You are so lucky

46
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,410
to come across us.

47
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,230
Lucky.

48
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,210
If you are sensible,

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,970
give us your valuable things.

50
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,030
Give them to us.

51
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,090
Otherwise...

52
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,270
Otherwise, hey hey.

53
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,590
Otherwise what?

54
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,910
Stop talking too much.

55
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,070
Stop talking too much.

56
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,390
Wrong spell.

57
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,770
Why can't I get my hand away from yours?

58
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,410
You said I should just tie them together.

59
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:17,970
Hey,

60
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,650
we're demons not the Matchmaker.

61
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,090
Tie what?

62
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,090
Demons, break the spell.

63
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,070
Call me Master Da first.

64
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,710
And then call me Master Er.

65
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,710
Sir, Sir.

66
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,650
We are doing this for a living.

67
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,850
Yes, I have an elder demon

68
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,850
and a young demon to support.

69
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,410
When did you see a woman?

70
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,850
Why don't I know that?

71
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,650
How can I tell you?

72
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,710
Why don't I know that?

73
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,770
Demons,

74
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,850
I only repeat one more time.

75
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,010
Hurry and break the spell.

76
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,070
Otherwise...

77
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,070
I won't tell you.

78
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,670
(Help!)

79
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,790
(Brother Ning Yu. Brother Ning Yu.)

80
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,910
(You want to catch me?)

81
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,230
(I'll kill you first.)

82
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:06,910
Miss Xiaoqing.

83
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,270
Watch out.

84
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:08,790
The hooked jade?

85
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,950
Oh no.

86
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,170
(Humph, I'll spare you today.)

87
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,270
The heart seal is starting to break?

88
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,390
Does the seal loosen again?

89
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,730
If this continues,

90
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,030
you will meet your end.

91
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,530
I'm all right.

92
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,230
It's a pity that the Peach Blossom Demon ran away.

93
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,730
What's wrong with you?

94
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,550
Why did you grab brother Xiuning's sealing jade pendant?

95
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,630
That's my jade pendant.

96
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,650
You bandit.

97
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,590
It is obviously brother Xiuning's sealing jade pendant.

98
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,930
How could it be yours?

99
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,130
Brother Xiuning.

100
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,290
What are you doing?

101
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,230
Stop it.

102
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,430
A demon cast a spell upon us.

103
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,370
Why is your jade pendant the same as mine?

104
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,930
It's a jade pendant I have worn since I was young.

105
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,870
Do you have memory about yours?

106
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,750
I don't know.

107
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,250
If you can't remember, forget it.

108
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,670
Hey,

109
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,750
why are you tied to my brother?

110
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,350
My name is not hey.

111
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,750
I'm Xiao Qing.

112
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,270
I don't know why we are tied together.

113
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,630
It's so suspicious that you show up suddenly

114
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,850
in this place full of demons.

115
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,470
You're a demon.

116
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,610
Ning Yu,

117
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,830
calm down.

118
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,350
Is there any demonic energy?

119
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,250
Xiaoqing is not a demon.

120
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,250
The demon has various images.

121
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,490
I agree with you.

122
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,590
(Are they saying

123
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,790
I am a demon?)

124
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,010
It's a pity that the Peach Blossom Demon escaped.

125
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,010
Li Xiuning,

126
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,250
the top priority now

127
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,770
is to break this spell first.

128
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,110
And then recover yourself.

129
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,430
Let's go back to the inn.

130
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,410
Hey.

131
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,330
Where are we going?

132
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,730
Hum.

133
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,510
I don't care where you come from,

134
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,490
but never try to take my brother Xiuning.
