2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,060
Xiaoqing.

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,860
I'm still a demon.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,420
I can't become a human being.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,500
I've figured it out.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,460
Being a demon or not

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,620
can't be decided by anyone.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,420
Then why Demon Hunters

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,900
keep catching and killing demons?

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,260
There are good men and bad men in the world.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,500
It is the same with the demon.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,780
Xiaoqing is the good demon.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,660
But being with a demon

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,260
is not allowed by the public.

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,940
Even if people don't allow it,

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,780
I will always stand by you.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,220
A demon is coming!

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,420
Ahhh!

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,020
There's a demon!

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,060
Help!

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,500
Miss Xiaoqing, don't be afraid.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,780
If there's another demon,

23
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,980
I will protect you.

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,520
How did you meet this demon?

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,620
It's not difficult to meet her.

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,700
She's on the streets and

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,140
killing Demon Hunters now.

28
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,700
Especially me.

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,100
The handsome talent.

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,740
(This demon was killed by

31
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,980
Ling Zhao.)

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,660
You've just recovered.

33
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,180
Where are you going to?

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,500
Now the demon is raging,

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,100
so I'm going to the Soul Department

36
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,060
to kill the demon.

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,140
Then I will go with you.

38
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,260
You'd better stay here.

39
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,340
It's too dangerous outside.

40
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,060
I heard that

41
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,420
you want to work for the Soul Department?

42
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,140
Recently, a demon killed many Demon Hunters.

43
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,700
I also want to help and catch the demon.

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,020
Oh?

45
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,700
Really?

46
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,700
Because I may know something

47
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,620
about that demon.

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,300
It's great for you to have this ambition.

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,140
However,

50
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,980
what makes you think that

51
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,740
we need you to work for us?

52
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,140
I wonder whether Your Excellency knows

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,760
which demon is killing Demon Hunters now?

54
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,340
The demon is ever-changing.

55
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,940
There's no need for me to remember all of them.

56
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,660
I understood it now.

57
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,300
My Lord,

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,660
he seems to suspect you.

59
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,540
Then kill him.

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,020
Kill him legally.

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,220
Department Head,

62
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,420
Ning Yu from Qingyun Valley comes.

63
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,340
Why are you here?

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,880
Ning Yu is willing to join the Soul Department.

65
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,260
Hope you can give me a chance.

66
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,460
Alright.

67
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,020
That's good.

68
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,260
As long as you pass the test,

69
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,180
you can be the member of

70
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,340
our Soul Department.

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,900
What's the test?

72
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,860
There is someone who is harboring demons.

73
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,640
I need you to bring him here.

74
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,620
Yes.

75
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,100
(Why does Ling Zhao also have the Heart Lock Seal?)

76
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,100
You look different.

77
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,860
Because I have figured out something.

78
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,780
From now on,

79
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,380
I will never let you go.

80
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,620
Xiaoqing,

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
I love you.

82
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,180
Are you willing to be with me forever?

83
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,150
Yes, I am.

84
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,180
Xiuning?

85
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,260
The Heart Lock Seal.

86
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,220
Oh no.

87
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,020
(I'll obtain the power of the Heart Lock Seal soon.)

88
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,820
Stay away from me.

89
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,360
I might hurt you.

90
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,060
It works.

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
Are you all right?

92
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,060
Why this jade

93
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,180
can ease the pain brought by the seal?

94
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,220
If the jade can ease your pain,

95
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,620
I'll stay with you forever.

96
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,860
I remembered that you said

97
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,620
only your master can strengthen the seal.

98
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,900
But...

99
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,220
Let's go back to Qingyun Valley.

100
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,140
No, we can't.

101
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,820
Aren't you going to prove my innocence?

102
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,340
How can you prove it if I don't go back?

103
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,500
Let's go.

104
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,940
