2
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,630
Isn't it broken?

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,610
Wha... What am I doing?

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,930
What's wrong?

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,410
What's wrong with him?

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,690
Xiuning.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,190
I remember Ning Yu has the antidote.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,870
What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,170
Stay away from me.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,790
Brother Xiuning.

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,610
What are you looking for?

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,530
Can I help you?

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:32,890
Ning Yu.

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,410
Ning Yu.

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,910
Xiuning, what are you doing?

16
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,410
Where is the medicine?

17
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,430
What medicine?

18
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,710
Brother Xiuning.

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,610
If you need medicine,

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,550
I can be your medicine.

21
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,930
Go away.

22
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,110
Xiuning.

23
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,670
Calm down.

24
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,190
I'm Ning Yu.

25
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,910
Male.

26
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,850
Hey.

27
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,330
What happened to him?

28
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,370
He's looking for medicine.

29
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,950
Xiuning, stop it.

30
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,370
You can have me,

31
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,130
but not my heart!

32
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,910
Shut up.

33
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,050
He orders everyone to shut up.

34
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,430
Sister, what are you doing?

35
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,690
Didn't you order everyone to shut up?

36
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,870
I'll do

37
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,510
whatever you ask me to.

38
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,190
Are you all right?

39
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,550
I'm fine.

40
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,750
I'm fine.

41
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,330
Where have you been?

42
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,570
We met the Peach Blossom Demon.

43
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,730
Wish I had killed her.

44
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,410
Yeah.

45
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,010
What does she want to do with a pretty girl like me?

46
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,410
If she wants a girl,

47
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,250
why don't we draw her out?

48
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,390
The prettiest girl here...

49
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,550
It's me, of course.

50
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,670
Why?

51
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,170
Am I not beautiful?

52
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,990
The Peach Blossom Demon absorbs blood of girls.

53
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,130
We can draw her out with this.

54
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,010
A pretty girl.

55
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,050
Why are you looking at me?

56
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,950
Ning Yu and I will be the bait.

57
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,410
You stay here.

58
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,870
Will it work?

59
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,150
If you can be the bait,

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,670
it'll save them the trouble.

61
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,670
Then why don't you go?

62
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,350
Because you're the prettiest, of course.

63
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,050
Who said that?

64
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,210
All right.

65
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,470
Don't argue.

66
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,250
Let's go.

67
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,870
Will the Peach Blossom Demon really appear?

68
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,490
No trace of her so far.

69
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,770
We've already gone so far.

70
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,410
Don't worry.

71
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,230
Our strategy is correct.

72
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,390
It's been so long.

73
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,690
The Peach Blossom Demon won't come.

74
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,710
Nonsense.

75
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,910
Xiuning said she would come.

76
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,150
So she definitely will.

77
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,950
Is the Peach Blossom Demon here?

78
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,910
HAHAHA

79
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,810
Are you looking for me?

80
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,950
Two beauties.

81
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,150
Is this the Peach Blossom Demon?

82
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,010
Why does she look different from before?

83
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,830
This is her true look.

84
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,910
You've come to me voluntarily.

85
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,610
Your blood.

86
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,610
I'll take it.

87
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,470
Trying to fight me?

88
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,850
Naive.

89
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,710
Ning Yu.

90
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,810
You two

91
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,810
want to take my internal exlixir and take credit for it?

92
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,850
Must be dreaming.

93
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,250
A strange smell.

94
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,670
Xiuning.

95
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,830
Xiaoqing.

96
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,570
Ah!

97
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,010
Xiaoqing.

98
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,990
Miss Xiaoqing.

99
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,350
The demon also cast a spell on her.

100
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,510
But she recovered so quickly.

101
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,170
She must be a monster, too.

102
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,950
Wanying is right.

103
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,150
Stop it.

104
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,650
You took my Xiuning.

105
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,570
You took my Xiuning.

106
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,670
I will kill you.

107
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,650
This is...

108
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,330
I remember.

109
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,970
It must be the smell of that boy.

110
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,490
I'm going to eat you.

111
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,930
I'm going to revenge.

112
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,710
Demon dispeller?

113
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,890
Help, help!

114
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,210
If you eat a person for me,

115
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,570
I'll spare you.

116
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,190
Alright.

117
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,070
Whatever you want.

118
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,610
Boss, please don't kill me.

119
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,070
