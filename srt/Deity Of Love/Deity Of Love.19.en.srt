2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,590
Here you are.

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,090
Why are you helping me?

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,370
Do I need a reason

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,210
to help anybody?

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,630
Let alone

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,410
Miss Xiaoqing.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,530
You should know

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,910
my feelings for you...

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,590
What if I am a demon?

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,330
Such a beautiful girl like you

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,490
can't be a demon.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,830
What if I am.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,830
Miss Xiaoqing.

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,950
Don't play

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,250
this kind of joke.

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,550
Okay, take it as a joke.

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,910
Let's go.

19
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,550
Who are you?

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,930
Why are you at the scene of the murder?

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,810
We are demon hunters

22
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,810
and come here to track down the demon.

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,010
Leave it.

24
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,690
The Soul Department takes it over now.

25
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,230
Do you know what kind of demon it is?

26
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,770
A demon is a demon.

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,890
Why tell the difference?

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,670
If you don't know, how do you catch it?

29
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,470
Leave, right now.

30
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,590
You can't afford to

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,530
waste our time in demon hunting.

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,070
You are wasting our time!

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,930
The Soul Department will handle it.

34
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,150
Don't interfere from now on.

35
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,650
Brother, don't be angry.

36
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,110
Didn't you notice?

37
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,730
The people of the Soul Department

38
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,770
have the smell of murderous demons.

39
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,370
Killing demons is their job.

40
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,950
Isn't it natural they carry the smell?

41
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,950
No.

42
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,270
The smell is so strange.

43
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,030
As if the demonic smell has merged

44
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,330
with their own after too much exposure.

45
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,070
Impossible.

46
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,070
Why would they

47
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,030
hang around with the demons?

48
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,290
Nothing

49
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,870
is impossible.

50
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,070
Ning Yu.

51
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,450
Take Fu Ling back to Qingyun Valley.

52
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,570
And wait for me there.

53
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,410
Not enough.

54
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,110
Far from enough.

55
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,150
But

56
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,290
Department Head,

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,030
a demon hunter has sensed it.

58
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,690
I'm afraid they'd find out.

59
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,410
Are you scared?

60
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,370
No, not at all.

61
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,030
I swear to be always loyal to my lord.

62
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,630
Now that he sensed it,

63
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,790
let him be consumed as well.

64
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,050
No problem, my lord.

65
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,210
Hahaha.

66
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,510
Why did he have to go alone?

67
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,930
Killing people in broad daylight.

68
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,630
Must be a reckless demon.

69
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,970
Let me send you back first.

70
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,510
Why didn't you go with my elder brother?

71
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,510
I'm worried about you.

72
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,210
What if...

73
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,170
I'll be fine.

74
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,790
Go help him.

75
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,830
Hurry up.

76
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,390
This is a good one.

77
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,270
Go.

78
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,850
Is she the demon

79
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,930
who murdered those people recently?

80
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,810
Yes.

81
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,130
Brother is right.

82
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,550
Xiaoqing didn't do it.

83
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,090
That's not the problem now.

84
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,210
I'm her target.

85
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,410
Let me kill her.

86
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,450
Hide yourself.

87
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,830
Eh!

88
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,870
But...

89
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,030
It's you.

90
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,910
How many times

91
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,210
The Soul Department is investigating.

92
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,490
You cannot enter.

93
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,290
Is the Department always this furtive

94
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,910
with the investigation?

95
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,210
Continue to interfere with the case,

96
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,630
and I will show you no mercy.

97
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,090
When are you people so arrogant,

98
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,250
throwing wild accusations?

99
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,410
Ah!

100
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,410
Fu Ling?

101
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,050
Don't get in my way.

102
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,750
Move!

103
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,550
I suspect you're the demon's accomplice.

104
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,550
I'm taking you back to Soul Department.

105
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,710
See if you can.

106
