1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,840


2
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,003
 

3
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:00,064
 

4
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:01,780
 

5
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,000
 

6
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,733
 

7
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,600
- You're here.
- You came.

8
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:19,700
Why are you outside?

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Go inside and see it yourself.

10
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,233
It was urgent.

11
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:42,000
They just did it without a plan.
That's not even their style.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,533
There was no hard drive,

13
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:47,333
no weapon, no hair, nothing at all.

14
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,867
He talked about playing together at the beach.

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,580
He said

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,460
he was happy back then.

17
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,400
Do you remember?

18
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,567
No.

19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,500
This one's probably you, Ms. Jung I Sin.

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,667
And this is Min Jae.

21
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,430
It's you.

22
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,830
The one next to me is you.

23
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,667
Min Jae

24
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,433
was watching from here.

25
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,900
He was jealous of you

26
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:11,167
and hoping I'll call him over.

27
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,867
 Hyung, I'm going to meet that punk. 

28
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:15,767
 You know I'm helping you, right? 

29
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:19,200
 They're coming to the studio.
You need to hurry. Got it? 

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,380
Until the end,

31
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,560
he tried to help me.

32
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,033
That punk will call again.

33
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,133
Let's catch them.

34
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,367
Help me please.

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,733
I'll think like you.

36
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,933
I'll act like you.

37
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,667
I'll think like Jung I Sin
and act like Jung I Sin.

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,633
Help me catch them. Please.

39
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,030
 

40
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,433
 

41
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:31,633
You're home. It's been a while.

42
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:34,100
At this hour?

43
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,500
They said it's urgent.

44
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:40,400
The dead aren't going anywhere.

45
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
Jeez.

46
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Getting help from someone
who's dead is awkward enough,

47
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,800
and if people find out Su Yeol's on the team,

48
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,733
how will you handle the fallout?

49
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,467
Seung Pyo...

50
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,280
Will the Commissioner

51
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,930
take responsibility for that?

52
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:02,000
It was Jung I Sin's condition.
For helping with the case.

53
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,433
I should've refused.

54
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,100
Both this time and last time,

55
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,433
I don't know if I did right.

56
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,000
I messed up, didn't I?

57
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,867
Yesterday a 40-year-old man

58
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:22,048
hanged himself in his scam-seized home.

59
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:24,867
No suicide note, so we did an autopsy.

60
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:28,267
Somehow, the note turned up later,

61
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:32,067
and it was filled with nothing
but 'I'm sorry, it's my fault',

62
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:36,333
even though it wasn't his fault at all, right?

63
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:43,400
But, all I could write in the report was

64
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,267
 
'hanging', that one word.

65
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,400
If I put my feelings in there...

66
00:07:55,567 --> 00:08:01,267
What I mean is, the work we do,
we can't let emotions get into it.

67
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,733
If we do that, things would
get unbearably complicated.

68
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:08,400
Since you're here, give
the kids a pat before you go

69
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,000
with plenty of feeling.

70
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,067
Okay. Drive safely.

71
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,800
Yeah.

72
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:51,033
- The team...
- On standby.

73
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,700
You know, stall as long as possible,

74
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,367
but don't make them angry.

75
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,960
 

76
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:07,667
Answer it.

77
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,490
 

78
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,400
 Hello. 

79
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,267
Who is this?

80
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,733
 It's me. You know. 

81
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:25,233
 Webtoon artist. Was that really you? 

82
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,300
 Obviously. Who else would it be? 

83
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,567
 Ah, I see. 

84
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,433
 But it was so clumsy. 

85
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:37,900
 It didn't look like your style or mine. 

86
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,333
 You crammed the place with mirrors, 

87
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,133
 scribbled a total mess, 

88
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,033
 and then slapped your signature
on it in huge letters. 

89
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:47,633
 It was a real sight, I'll give you that. 

90
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,767
 So, all that talk about it being the 'final scene' 

91
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:53,633
was just nonsense, huh?

92
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,400
Why is she saying that?

93
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,267
 It was the final scene. 

94
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:03,267
 He died in the middle of drawing it,
which makes it the last scene. 

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,800
 Ah, finally had a good laugh after so long. 

96
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:19,233
You want people to remember
every single thing I've done?

97
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,667
You? No way.

98
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,200
 I don't do that. 

99
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,033
 You're a pathetic little brat
who can't even copy it properly. 

100
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,233
- She's...
- What is she doing?

101
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,800
Team Leader Cha.

102
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,567
Bingo.

103
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,767
 Hello there. 

104
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,100
So clingy.

105
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,767
 You'll envy me soon enough. 

106
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,900
 What's this? 

107
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,667
Intriguing.

108
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:21,967
 Take a guess. 

109
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:25,267
 You're in prison while I'm here. 

110
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,448
 You can't do it, but I can. 

111
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:30,233
 The fourth case? 

112
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,000
The fourth case.

113
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,367
Kang Yeong Ho, the coal mine residence.

114
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,067
The case where he gouged his nose with a spoon,

115
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:41,067
had broken limbs, and died from massive bleeding.

116
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,300
 Yes, the fourth case. Correct. 

117
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,900
 Honestly, I rushed the last one. 

118
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,533
 I admit it. Oh my, I'm sorry, okay? 

119
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:51,167
 It wasn't part of the plan. 

120
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,867
 But, this time it's real. 

121
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,600
 He'll be here soon. 

122
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,200
 Go ahead and hang up again, why don't you? 

123
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,067
Sorry. Got the spoons? That's crucial.

124
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:06,800
 Everything's ready. Even the torch. 

125
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,100
 Perfect. 

126
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:13,500
 This feels like we're doing it together. 

127
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,667
 I feel the same. You know the order, right? 

128
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:21,333
 I know the order. Know it too well. 

129
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Is that woman really helping us right now?

130
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:28,333
What? Who is it?

131
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,733
 Oh, they're here. See you later. 

132
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,000
Ji An, check the footage and locate them.

133
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Alright.

134
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,967
Secure building security office,
entrances, and parking lot first.

135
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:47,267
Identify everyone who entered within 30 minutes.

136
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,100
Cross-check with Joy's followers.

137
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,967
- Everyone got that?
- Yes.

138
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:00,500
Move out.

139
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,267
Detective Bae Seong Gyu from Team 1 speaking.

140
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,800
Requesting SWAT team backup.

141
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,467
Found it.

142
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,067
One moment.

143
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,733
Esto Premier Hotel.

144
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:14,867
It's Esto Premier Hotel in Yeonho-dong. Copy that.

145
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:17,033
- Okay, hurry.
- Yes.

146
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,900
 Team Leader Cha. 

147
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:32,333
Don't think you can take them down
without any bloodshed.

148
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,833
I wouldn't think that.

149
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,767
 You have to think like them, like me, Jeong Ho. 

150
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:53,233
The SWAT team has already left.
They'll be there in ten minutes.

151
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,900
Ji An is staying in the office
to access the hotel intranet.

152
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,767
She'll search CCTV records.

153
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:03,233
Heading there now. Tell Jung I Sin
to stall them as long as possible.

154
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:06,033
Team Leader Cha needs you to buy time.

155
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,367
Endure until anesthesia wears off.

156
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,467
You know my style, right?

157
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:24,933
No anesthesia used.

158
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:29,233
He brought the stockings himself,
said tying him up is better.

159
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:36,433
Too easy. That makes it boring.

160
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:40,533
 Today's tool is a Korean-made hammer. 

161
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:42,933
 Calm down. 

162
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:46,500
Calm down. Stay calm. It's far from over.

163
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,000
 Why so scared? 

164
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,667
 

165
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,800
Step aside, please.

166
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,667
Police. Security office location?

167
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,900
That way.

168
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,400
Police.

169
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,433
Hotel CCTV feed connected.

170
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,933
Where's this room?

171
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:47,433
This is studio suite.
57 of 194 rooms are studio suites.

172
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:51,433
- What floor?
- From the 3rd to the 13th floor, all of them.

173
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,533
Can you check which rooms currently have guests?

174
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:57,333
There's a Misty Night performance nearby.

175
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,500
We've got a group booking,
so the hotel's fully booked,

176
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,567
and they all checked in about 30 minutes ago.

177
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,000
Most guests are probably in their rooms now.

178
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,300
SWAT team, descend in pairs from the 13th floor.

179
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,567
- Seong Gyu, stick with them.
- Alright.

180
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,633
Manager Kim and I will start from
the 3rd floor and work our way up.

181
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,767
Hyuk, block the escape routes.

182
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,267
Team Leader, the victim is already in danger.

183
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,367
Block the exits and trigger the emergency alarm.

184
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,867
We need to rescue the victim first, right?

185
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:24,800
We've just started searching
from the 3rd and 13th floors.

186
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,500
What if the suspect on another floor
hears the bell and escapes?

187
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,433
We can't wait any longer.
We have to catch the suspect.

188
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,400
Check rooms 1305, 1304, 1312,
1317, 1318, 1319, 1320, 1322...

189
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,033
- Confirm all. Got it? Let's go.
- Alright.

190
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,400
Spread out to rooms 304, 305,
312, 317, 318, 319, 320, 322.

191
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,033
- Got it.
- Understood.

192
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,467
Police. We're need to check the room.

193
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,067
Oh, sorry! Police work.

194
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,800
Sorry to disturb you. Please rest.

195
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,267
Police. Thank you.

196
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:30,967
Apologies. Police, excuse us.

197
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,167
Police. Just a moment, sorry.

198
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,000
Thank you.

199
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
 This is really tough... 

200
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,833
 Where should I start? 

201
00:17:55,833 --> 00:18:00,467
Arms? Legs? The neck's quick, right?

202
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,933
Ji An, did you check the CCTV?

203
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,867
No guests match Joy's followers.

204
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,967
 Today's highlight. 

205
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,733
 A spoon and a torch set. 

206
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,467
Wait, what about the mirror?

207
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,067
 Today, it's all for you. 

208
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,833
 We'll do it strictly your way. 

209
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,500
No, that's not necessary.

210
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,467
 I know the police are there. 

211
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:32,367
 Don't waste time with tricks or nonsense. 

212
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:36,200
Enough nonsense.

213
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,833
 Good, this part's my favorite. 

214
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,200
 All potential exits are blocked. 

215
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,167
He'll die at this rate, Team Leader.

216
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:07,533
The exits are sealed. Let's ring the bell.

217
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,167
Team Leader.

218
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:13,400
The method matches the one 23 years ago.

219
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,867
Team Leader.

220
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,200
If we press the emergency bell,

221
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,300
they'll notice and flee.

222
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,333
We can catch them if that's the case.
All exits are blocked.

223
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,567
Even if they're on another floor,

224
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:28,933
unless they jump from
the rooftop, we can catch them.

225
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,733
He'll die if we keep stalling!

226
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:35,100
We can't catch the killer without bloodshed.

227
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,167
What does that mean?

228
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:39,233
Wait! Wait, huh?

229
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:46,933
 You have to think like them, like me, Jeong Ho. 

230
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:49,900
 Team Leader. 

231
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,067
The 4th-floor CCTV's been off for two hours.

232
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,333
Room 418.

233
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,200
What?

234
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,067
Room 418.

235
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
Seal all exits to the 4th floor.

236
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,233
 Time to end this! 

237
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,000
Team Leader!

238
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,297
What's going on?

239
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,384
- Why is the bell ringing?
- What's happening?

240
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:50,433
Hurry, we have to run!

241
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:53,367
Police. Stay calm.

242
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,000
The suspect's dressed like a guest.

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,056
Stay close, everyone. Police.

244
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,767
This is unbelievable.

245
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,533
Police. Step aside, please.

246
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:04,580
- What on earth is happening?
- Excuse us.

247
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,100
Police coming through.

248
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,700
Sorry, excuse us. Coming through.

249
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,433
Call an ambulance! Now!

250
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,633
Sir, are you conscious?

251
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:29,667
I'm police.

252
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:34,367
Sir, it's over now. Don't worry.

253
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,200
Who are you?

254
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,167
Ah, Team Leader!

255
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,467
Team Leader, are you okay?

256
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:13,467
Team Leader. The victim's Son Hyeon Ho.

257
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:17,633
He was among Joy's followers.
He managed this hotel.

258
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,900
I assumed he was just
another guest so I missed it.

259
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Luckily, he survived.

260
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,700
Good work.

261
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,167
By the way, the emergency alarm earlier,
was that Team Leader Cha?

262
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,700
Good call, huh?

263
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,567
I pressed it.

264
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,700
Team Leader told us not to.
He said the suspect would flee.

265
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,867
What?

266
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:00,992
He said we can't catch them without bloodshed.

267
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:04,667
Jeez. How did he become like that all of a sudden?

268
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,933
Park Min Jae...

269
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,633
Huh?

270
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:14,300
 Min Jae, don't die. Wake up. 

271
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,967
 Open your eyes, Min Jae! Park Min Jae! 

272
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:20,733
 I'll think like Jung I Sin
and act like Jung I Sin. 

273
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:23,567
 Help me catch them. Please. 

274
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,067
Seong Gyu. Investigate Team Leader Cha.

275
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,167
Team Leader Cha?

276
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,900
Yeah.

277
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,400
Check him out.

278
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,633
Why did a narc suddenly come here?

279
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:43,467
Why Team Leader Cha specifically?

280
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:46,000
What exactly is his relationship
with Park Min Jae?

281
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,733
Why did he change so drastically?

282
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,633
 What if you're late again today? 

283
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:07,433
 Considering your son's condition
and his young age, 

284
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,200
 custody would undeniably favor the mother. 

285
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,567
 I see. 

286
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:14,067
 But, please be cautious
in front of the investigator. 

287
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,033
 Understood. 

288
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:22,667
 My apologies. 

289
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:24,867
 - Frog legs.
- Hello. 

290
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:28,267
 Frog legs. 

291
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:36,400
 Ho Jun, how many people live in your house? 

292
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:48,133
 Are those people here now? 

293
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,567
 Wow, you drew this really well. 

294
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:58,500
 Did you draw this, Ho Jun? 

295
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:03,433
 Who's this person? 

296
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,333
 What about this one? 

297
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,600
 Good job. 

298
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,267
 Where do you think Mommy is? 

299
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:24,400
 So this is mommy. 

300
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,367
 Miss, could you ask Ho Jun whether he likes 

301
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,967
 being with Mom or Dad more? 

302
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,633
 - Investigator?
- Wait. 

303
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,500
 - Why ask something that wasn't planned?
- Unacceptable. 

304
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,867
 This situation already stresses Ho Jun. 

305
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,333
 If she pushes with such questions... 

306
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,300
 This question has to be asked... 

307
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,933
 No... 

308
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,367
 Do you need anything else? 

309
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,367
 Ho Jun must be having a really hard time. 

310
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,533
 - Please ask him.
- Wait... 

311
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:54,633
 Miss. Please ask him. 

312
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,900
We almost caught them.

313
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,700
Almost? He nearly killed someone.

314
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,933
But, we saved the victim.

315
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,633
You probably don't care, but...

316
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,900
This is Yeonpo. Remember?

317
00:27:56,867 --> 00:28:02,833
You, Min Jae, and me
spent all day at the beach together.

318
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,200
I also included Min Jae in the drawing.

319
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,367
I remember the sea.

320
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,533
Would Min Jae like it?

321
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,767
These are hotel crime scene photos.

322
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:35,767
And this is the material related to
the case you committed 23 years ago.

323
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,100
 

324
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,433
They tried to reenact the past crimes exactly.

325
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:45,200
Compare these, and share any connections you see.

326
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:53,967
I can't go back, so take care of this yourself.

327
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,600
You know this song, right?

328
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,367
They even hummed it exactly like I did back then.

329
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,333
How did they know that?

330
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,167
That detail isn't even in the statement.

331
00:29:56,033 --> 00:30:00,800
- At the scene...
- At the scene. Right?

332
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,800
They were there, observing it at the scene.

333
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,567
But why didn't they report it later?

334
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:18,367
Because I gave them what they wanted.

335
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:29,533
These two, I didn't do them.

336
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:39,167
The cut is 1.5 cm, very shallow wounds.

337
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:43,733
Something like a box cutter?

338
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:48,400
Even full-force stabs left only these marks.

339
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,567
Whether in a wardrobe or anywhere else,

340
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:56,200
if they wanted to stab the already-dead man
again like this after I left...

341
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:07,300
The family was only the wife and a young boy.

342
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,067
If it's a shallow wound...

343
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:13,167
Do you remember? The mining village.

344
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,867
There was that kid always hanging around.

345
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,567
 Mom! 

346
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:55,967
There was a kid who carried around
dead cats like dolls.

347
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:59,400
That child's body was covered
in all kinds of wounds,

348
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:04,833
even severe burns that left
one side of his nose disfigured.

349
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,533
Kang Yeong Ho.

350
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,933
He locked the child in the bathroom

351
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,767
and forced him to eat feces.

352
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,967
He chained his legs and later...

353
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,667
With a spoon heated in the fire,

354
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,900
he even burned one side of the nose.

355
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,467
How could someone do that to their own son...

356
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:32,300
Your own dad tried to kill you.

357
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,167
The child was 12 at the time. Kang Yeon Jung.

358
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:46,133
He watched me at the scene.

359
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:07,500
To him, I must have been the one
who always gave him what he wanted.

360
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,967
Naturally, he would have been curious.

361
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,467
That's how he found you,

362
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,300
and even your family.

363
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,167
Your house, and Jung Yeon.

364
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:28,700
Your wife is in danger.

365
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:39,867
Section Chief, I need officers
assigned immediately.

366
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,967
Yes, for Jung Yeon.

367
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:56,967
The suspect apparently mimicked

368
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,800
Jung I Sin's humming and melody exactly

369
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,767
during the 23-year-old case.

370
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:04,700
Knowing that means he must have
seen Jung I Sin's murder firsthand,

371
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,200
whether hidden or otherwise.

372
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,733
The victim back then, Kang Yeong Ho, had a son.

373
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,333
He suffered such severe abuse that there was even

374
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,500
public sympathy for Jung I Sin at the time.

375
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,667
The son is Kang Yeon Jung.

376
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:29,333
He appears to be the real killer behind this case.

377
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,567
 

378
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,733
This is his resident registration photo.

379
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:37,933
But there are no records of him after this.

380
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:42,033
As of now, Kang Yeon Jung's mother
is hospitalized with alcohol-related dementia.

381
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:44,333
But since then, there's been no change of address,

382
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,767
and he hasn't opened
any bank accounts or credit cards.

383
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:50,167
He probably used illegal means
to change his identity.

384
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,933
I wouldn't have kept living
as Kang Yeon Jung either.

385
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,067
The time he lived under that name

386
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,767
must've been worse than hell.

387
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,100
 

388
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,700
Did you find the address
of his mother's nursing home?

389
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,767
It's in Sangbong City. Not too far.

390
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,133
Mark the address.

391
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:09,833
Manager Bae and Hyuk, please handle
the neighborhood investigation around the victim.

392
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,933
- Understood.
- Let's go.

393
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,567
Wait, no, what I mean is...

394
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,200
He's the type who puts his own reputation first,

395
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,900
whether someone lives or dies, absolutely.

396
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,033
Then why even catch the suspect, huh?

397
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm trying to reduce the number of victims...

398
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,967
Did you ask him that directly?

399
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,000
Ask him what?

400
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,733
Whether he wanted to boost
his reputation or stop more killing.

401
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:57,333
Did you ask Team Leader? You missed the suspect.

402
00:35:58,267 --> 00:35:59,867
What are you talking about, man?

403
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,400
There he is.

404
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,367
Aren't we all part of the same team?

405
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,267
Ugh, whatever.

406
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,667
If you're gonna dig into a teammate's business,

407
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,367
do it on your own.

408
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,300
Do it on my own?

409
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,733
That punk suddenly uses informal speech.

410
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:28,333
Fine, I'll do it on my own.

411
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,367
Yes, correct. Kang Yeon Jung.

412
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:39,533
Your son. Have you met him recently?

413
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,367
Yeon Jung?

414
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:46,467
My son?

415
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,833
He needs to run away.

416
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:52,867
My husband's coming to get him.

417
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,600
Why?

418
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,533
Yeon Jung needs to escape.

419
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:58,600
Why?

420
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,733
Why does Kang Yeon Jung need to run away?

421
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:04,733
Madam! Madam!

422
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:07,600
Team Leader, a word.

423
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,567
Does anything come to mind?

424
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,600
It seems like you met the victim.

425
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,900
Well, it's just that he's a close friend.

426
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,900
And now that friend's in intensive care
because of this punk.

427
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,767
We need to catch them.

428
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:29,600
Please just tell us anything
you remember. It's okay.

429
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:33,933
Well, honestly, that friend
was kind of... sleazy, you know?

430
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:35,533
He signed up on all these apps

431
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:38,267
and kept meeting different women everywhere.

432
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:39,533
This woman too?

433
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,133
Yes.

434
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:43,700
Look here.

435
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,267
He bragged excitedly about meeting her,

436
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,167
but then went completely silent afterward.

437
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,667
I mean, I'm a guy too, so naturally I got curious.

438
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:51,667
- Right.
- So,

439
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:54,167
I bought him a couple glasses
of wine and pressed him.

440
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:57,767
So, he was being honest with me
back then, saying it seemed like

441
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,600
things were going a bit wrong.

442
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,067
- Going wrong?
- Yeah.

443
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,833
Why? Oh, her looks?

444
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,333
He said she was attractive.

445
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,400
Of course, the profile photos were all fake.

446
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,567
You know, those dating apps tend to be like that.

447
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:13,000
People hardly ever post their real photos.

448
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,867
But the problem is... Oh, jeez...

449
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:19,733
Do I really have to talk about all this?

450
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:22,367
You can tell us. We're police.

451
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,533
Just speak freely.

452
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:26,133
Team Leader, try to repeat after me.

453
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:28,600
Frog legs.

454
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,500
What's that all of a sudden...

455
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,800
Just try it. Frog legs.

456
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,367
When pronouncing the 'legs',
pull the corner of your lips up.

457
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,667
Frog legs.

458
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,100
- Legs...
- Legs...

459
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,967
People like that don't really
listen to what's being said.

460
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:48,000
They just watch the speaker's face.

461
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,700
So, that's why she's like that.

462
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,033
Frog legs...

463
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:53,767
Yeah.

464
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:05,367
Anyway, that crazy punk met a woman here.
Without the company knowing.

465
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:06,467
Even Joy?

466
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:07,733
Yes.

467
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:11,167
The moment Joy brought him into her room,
she told him to turn off all the lights,

468
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:13,467
and from then on he started
to feel something was off.

469
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:16,433
But you know, he figured
she just liked to take the lead,

470
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,200
so he let it slide.

471
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,367
And then?

472
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:23,200
Did the woman make any
threatening moves or anything?

473
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,233
It was quite the opposite.

474
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:25,767
- Opposite?
- Yeah.

475
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:28,500
While they were in the middle of... you know...

476
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,100
she suddenly asked him to choke her.

477
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,500
- The woman?
- Yes.

478
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,733
He thought maybe she was into some kinky stuff,

479
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:37,733
so he just pretended to go along.

480
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:40,700
But then, she kept saying, 'Harder! Harder!'

481
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,000
Really pushing him.

482
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,600
He said it scared him,
like he might actually kill her,

483
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,000
so he stopped.

484
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,500
After that, he panicked

485
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
and barely escaped in a daze.

486
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,100
Anything else?

487
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,467
Well...

488
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,300
What really terrified him was

489
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,233
when he had his hand around her neck

490
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:04,900
and she suddenly got excited

491
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,567
and told him to kill her.

492
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:10,067
She said that killing her
would save a lot of people...

493
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:12,700
I mean, that's seriously creepy, right?

494
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,100
That's why he stopped.

495
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,667
Madam. I'm genuinely curious.

496
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,233
Why does Yeon Jung need to run?

497
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:39,100
He killed Dallae.

498
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,200
Wh... Who's Dallae?

499
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,933
The dog.

500
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,533
The dog next door.

501
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,567
Doggie.

502
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:59,367
Her memories all seem mixed up.

503
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,300
Madam.

504
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,967
Yeon Jung. Have you seen him recently?

505
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:15,533
When?

506
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,800
Just now.

507
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,567
What?

508
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,267
He put on makeup again.

509
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:32,633
Trying to become a girl.

510
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,367
He wore makeup again.

511
00:41:37,033 --> 00:41:41,600
Run away. My husband's coming to catch you.

512
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,833
Ma'am. Did anyone else visit her just now?

513
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:46,933
Oh, yes.

514
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:49,333
Someone left right before you arrived.

515
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:52,888
Darn it.

516
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:55,833
Got it, Manager Kim.

517
00:41:56,733 --> 00:42:00,700
 There's a record of the visit,
but the CCTV was broken. 

518
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,833
From what the nurse and the front desk said,

519
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:06,400
even though the visitor wore a hood
and a mask, it was a woman.

520
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:09,600
A woman?

521
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,300
 Yes. 

522
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:32,133
Yes. All good right now.

523
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,033
Alright.

524
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:35,733
Alright, good work.

525
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,467
She said Kang Yeon Jung came,

526
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,500
but her dementia is so advanced now

527
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,033
that it's impossible to get through to her.

528
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:53,433
So, even if Kang Yeon Jung really
did visit, we wouldn't be able to

529
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,600
get any useful information.

530
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,833
Well... I've been thinking.

531
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,800
Even if Kang Yeon Jung's mother's mind
drifts in and out,

532
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,700
what she said could all be true.

533
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,500
What do you mean?

534
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,967
That it's her son,

535
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,400
that he used to kill dogs
and cats and carry them around,

536
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,133
that he wore makeup, all those could be facts.

537
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,867
If all of that's real,

538
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:25,100
whether it came from his father's abuse

539
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,467
or was just who he was,

540
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:31,533
what's clear is that Kang Yeon Jung showed

541
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:34,500
antisocial tendencies from childhood,

542
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,167
and that he was confused enough

543
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:42,100
about his gender identity
to want to become a woman.

544
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,933
That would mean

545
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:48,567
that after 23 years, Kang Yeon Jung

546
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,667
could look completely
different now, including his gender.

547
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:59,000
So the woman who came to the nursing home,
that could be Kang Yeon Jung... or Joy?

548
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,733
Come on, that seems a bit...

549
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:05,233
You said it before.

550
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:08,733
Back then, Kang Yeon Jung
must have lived a hellish life.

551
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:12,567
If that's true, wouldn't he have wanted

552
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,500
to become someone entirely different?

553
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,067
Life was such hell that the only way to survive

554
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:22,567
was to be reborn as someone else?

555
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,767
 

556
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,867
 

557
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,300
We're assuming this person has had plastic surgery

558
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,000
and their face might have changed
to look like some of these people.

559
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,767
Have you ever seen anyone here

560
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,567
who looks similar to these photos?

561
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:08,000
 

562
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,800
Thanks for taking the time.

563
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:17,700
Gender confirmation surgery

564
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,467
takes too long in Korea.

565
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:24,533
Even after getting an F640 code diagnosis

566
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:26,800
for gender dysphoria from psychiatry,

567
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,867
you need 6 months to a year of hormone therapy.

568
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:32,433
So Eddie, you did it abroad too?

569
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:34,867
Yes, in Thailand.

570
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,433
Do you happen to recognize any faces?

571
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,733
No, I don't know.

572
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:50,467
Not every transgender person
in the world is my friend.

573
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:54,433
It seems he eventually went abroad
where surgery is easier.

574
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:56,833
Gender confirmation surgery
comes with many aftereffects

575
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,833
and requires long-term care.

576
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:02,300
When he came back, he must have
visited a hospital for follow-up care

577
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,300
or additional procedures.

578
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,000
Team Leader, here's the list
of relevant hospitals.

579
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,033
Let me see.

580
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:12,833
These are clinics specializing
in gender confirmation surgeries.

581
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:16,800
 

582
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,933
The suspect, Park Min Jae,

583
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:37,033
was even given a ride all the way home,

584
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:40,600
and he was calling him, 'Min Jae, Min Jae'

585
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,267
showing they're extremely close personally.

586
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:47,733
And that Park Min Jae was murdered?

587
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,200
There are too many Jung I Sin copycats.

588
00:46:57,467 --> 00:46:59,300
Look at this drawing.

589
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,500
Here.

590
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:10,233
Not sure.

591
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:13,767
This is somewhat confusing, huh?

592
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,967
Thank you for your cooperation.

593
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:26,933
Or, does anyone remember
any patient who was unusual,

594
00:47:26,933 --> 00:47:30,267
regardless of this photo?

595
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,400
Excuse me, Detective.

596
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,033
Yes.

597
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:59,933
There's a hospital I used to work at.

598
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,033
You two met there?

599
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:08,400
Yes, that hospital was also well-known
in the online community,

600
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,833
so many people came looking.

601
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:15,167
If surgery goes wrong abroad,

602
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:17,100
the pelvis can rot,

603
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,133
and I've seen many serious cases.

604
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:21,700
Still, those people go through surgery

605
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,500
knowing they might die.

606
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,333
They've lived their whole lives

607
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:31,333
feeling like their soul is a woman,
but trapped in a man's body,

608
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,700
and now they want to be happy.

609
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,633
And?

610
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:39,567
That patient was different.

611
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,533
Of course, she was happy

612
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:48,133
to finally have the right body, a proper one,

613
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,533
but she quietly muttered to herself,

614
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,200
'It's nice that people don't
guard themselves around women.'

615
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,967
What?

616
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:09,767
You heard that, right?

617
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:11,467
I think it's our killer.

618
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:15,167
This is the hospital where the nurse worked
and the doctor's name.

619
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:20,533
I can't imagine someone would become a woman

620
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:22,267
just to make it easier to kill people.

621
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:25,200
But I think they had that in mind too.

622
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,267
It's definitely this one. Hyuk.

623
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:31,800
According to the nurse, the hospital
has closed, so we need to find the doctor.

624
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,900
If we find the doctor, we can catch them.

625
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,933
Why? What happened?

626
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,467
Jung I Sin and Park Min Jae.

627
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:02,300
What's this about?

628
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,167
Open it.

629
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:21,367
We've worked tirelessly to identify that kid.

630
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:24,267
Didn't you say you weren't hiding anything else?

631
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:28,100
Mr. Cha Su Yeol, please leave our team.

632
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,167
We're so close now, Manager Kim.

633
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:39,233
Let's hunt down that doctor.

634
00:50:39,233 --> 00:50:41,167
Then, we can catch the killer.

635
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:44,600
Why? Did Jung I Sin tell you that too?

636
00:50:50,533 --> 00:50:54,767
Right. This woman... is my mother.

637
00:50:54,767 --> 00:50:57,900
But do you mean

638
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,367
since I'm related to Jung I Sin,

639
00:51:01,367 --> 00:51:03,700
it might affect the investigation?

640
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,100
Is that it?

641
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,400
Please leave.

642
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,533
What exactly has failed because of me so far?

643
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,667
Apparently, Jung I Sin wanted you involved
to cooperate with the investigation,

644
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:16,767
but now that the suspect is identified,

645
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:18,500
Jung I Sin is no longer needed.

646
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,667
So now, I'm not needed either?

647
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:22,500
Inspector Cha Su Yeol.

648
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,433
You said you wouldn't hide
anything from us anymore, right?

649
00:51:26,433 --> 00:51:28,367
We don't need a team leader

650
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:31,167
who deceives the team and furthermore,

651
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,567
a team leader who doesn't
care about the victim's life.

652
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:36,233
That's it?

653
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:41,333
Did Son Hyeon Ho die?

654
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,967
If we'd been any later, he would've died.

655
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:45,033
So, did Son Hyeon Ho die?

656
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:47,800
You lied to all of us, you punk!

657
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,600
We won't take orders from him anymore.

658
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,233
We can't stand it any longer.

659
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:01,700
Section Chief, you decide.

660
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,567
Whether to keep the team or that man.

661
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:09,133
Section Chief, we're nearly there.

662
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:11,833
We're going to catch the killer.

663
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:15,500
That hotel manager, Mr. Son Hyeon Ho

664
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,833
died a short while ago,

665
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:45,433
Su Yeol.

666
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:47,633
If you go after him now,

667
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:50,400
I'll consider that you choose him.

668
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:13,900
You're home.

669
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:02,500
Want to be alone?

670
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,033
Jung Yeon.

671
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:14,233
Do you remember what Park Min Jae said before?

672
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:17,300
When we were kids,

673
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,467
there was a serial killer in our neighborhood.

674
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:26,833
Queen Mantis?

675
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,567
The serial killer.

676
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:43,400
That Queen Mantis.

677
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,933
She is my mother.

678
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,167
 Ms. Lee Jung Yeon? 

679
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:06,167
Jung I Sin was arrested when I was 11

680
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:13,567
for brutally killing five men.

681
00:55:15,133 --> 00:55:19,067
And I reunited with my mother after 23 years.

682
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:24,733
Pastor Jung, my grandfather changed my name,

683
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:28,067
dug a fake grave in Yeonpo
as if his daughter died,

684
00:55:28,067 --> 00:55:31,900
and tried to live that way, and...

685
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,000
Hold on, Su Yeol.

686
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:13,233
I'm sorry.

687
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:17,800
I didn't want to shock you like this, it's just...

688
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,533
Though of course you'd be shocked.

689
00:56:20,533 --> 00:56:23,500
Hearing that a serial killer

690
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,300
who killed five, no, six people

691
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,300
is your husband's mother,

692
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,600
of course, you'd be shocked and scared.

693
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,200
I know that.

694
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,100
But, I...

695
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,767
But... But here...

696
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:42,867
I never imagined such a terrible person...

697
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:44,633
Terrible, right?

698
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,933
I think I'm terrible too.

699
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:51,400
Su Yeol, I don't mean you. What I'm saying is...

700
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,300
But why are you avoiding me?

701
00:56:57,967 --> 00:57:01,167
No. No, that's not it.

702
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:05,000
It's okay. I understand.

703
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,933
It's just, I... This is a lot to deal with...

704
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:15,800
No, sorry, that's not it.

705
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,633
Jung Yeon, I know.

706
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,500
I know you want a child.

707
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,800
Su Yeol.

708
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,520
But...

709
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,200
Jung Yeon, I am so scared.

710
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,133
I feel like the blood of that monster
Jung I Sin, who gave birth to me,

711
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:39,967
runs through my veins.

712
00:57:39,967 --> 00:57:47,600
That violent, filthy, terrifying blood.

713
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:53,833
Every time I see a murder scene
as a police officer,

714
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:56,800
every time I draw my gun to catch the suspect,

715
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,467
every time my body ends up covered in blood.

716
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:02,767
That's what I think every time it happens.

717
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:10,967
Do I like the smell of blood?

718
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:15,167
Is it that I don't want to catch the criminal,

719
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,633
but want to shoot someone to death
under the name of the law?

720
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,667
That's what I think.

721
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:22,733
Su Yeol.

722
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:26,400
I don't want our child to have my blood.

723
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,267
You don't know about...

724
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:33,500
What are you talking about, Su Yeol?

725
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,567
- Su Yeol... Su Yeol.
- Wait.

726
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:45,867
I love you, Jung Yeon.

727
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,233
I'm sorry for lying.

728
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,833
They're agitated now.

729
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:08,100
They're trying to erase the tracks.

730
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,433
Bring Su Yeol here.

731
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:11,067
 
He's as desperate as you are.

732
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:13,567
If it's not about helping her son,

733
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:16,333
but about some ulterior motive to use him.

734
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:18,567
She said you're happy because of her.

735
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:21,200
 
How did you meet Jung Yeon?

736
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,133
Put out an APB in the area
and send them immediately.

737
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,500
Jung I Sin is coming here?

738
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,000
Special orders from the Commissioner.

739
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,500
From now on, we operate independently.

740
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,900
If you go, you'll die.

741
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,000
I have to do this.
