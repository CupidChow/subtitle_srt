1
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

3
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,953
PREGNANT

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,375
<i>It feels like the blood of Jeong I-shin,</i>
<i>that monster who gave birth to me,</i>

5
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,419
<i>is running through my veins.</i>

6
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,217
Jung-yeon, are you okay?

7
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,511
Yeah, I'm fine.

8
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,304
I'm just feeling a little nauseous.

9
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,549
I'LL BE AT AH-RA'S PLACE FOR A FEW DAYS
I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE THERE FOR YOU

10
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,060
Excuse us.

11
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,814
I'll be in the car.

12
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,898
Okay.

13
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,319
Pardon the intrusion,
but where are you off to?

14
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,571
A funeral.

15
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:39,534
She does own
a valid driver's license, right?

16
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,749
Yes.

17
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,173
Where's my compensation?

18
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,717
Sir.

19
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,636
You must be very upset,

20
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,679
but why don't you come here and…

21
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,306
Let go of me.

22
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,184
You killed a perfectly healthy boy.

23
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,310
Where's my compensation?

24
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,605
Who will compensate me?

25
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,612
-Sir.
-I should be compensated.

26
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,447
-Sir.
-Let go.

27
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,824
I should be compensated.

28
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,295
But…

29
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,422
How do you know the deceased?

30
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:18,091
Well, we are…

31
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,221
I'm his older brother.

32
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,473
Goodness. What a terrible tragedy
for such a young man.

33
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,958
Min-jae said this was his happiest moment.

34
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,002
This was the spot.

35
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,465
It's really nice.

36
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,467
He did a good job.

37
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,138
Min-jae painted it, right?

38
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,140
He painted you and her together?

39
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,267
It's weird, isn't it?

40
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,689
I'm her biological son,
and I don't even want to look at her,

41
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,152
but despite not sharing
a drop of blood with her,

42
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,155
he missed her so dearly.

43
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,325
Who cares about blood?

44
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,411
What they meant
for each other is what matters.

45
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,163
I just…

46
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,168
I don't know.

47
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,670
Ever since I was little,

48
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,505
I was on the run.

49
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,051
From the past…

50
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,220
and my mom.

51
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,975
I was always terrified of being found out.

52
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,021
I wondered if that would be
my life forever.

53
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,568
I guess I eventually grew tired of it.

54
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,530
At first, I joined…

55
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,950
this investigation team

56
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,787
because my mom requested it.

57
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,290
But I think a part of me

58
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,335
wanted to see if I could do it.

59
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,632
This time, I really wanted

60
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,969
to stand my ground and fight back.

61
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,846
But in the end,

62
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,015
it looks like I ran away again.

63
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,018
Ran away from what?

64
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,526
Carrying out an investigation
is a bit like…

65
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,279
looking after a child.

66
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,116
The more you obsess over it,

67
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,535
the more things go awry.

68
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,456
What does that mean?

69
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,210
I quit the investigation.

70
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,107
Nothing has changed.

71
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,277
You are still the one

72
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,613
I chose after long, careful observation.

73
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,908
You didn't run away.

74
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,494
Just look at this view.

75
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,456
You ended up somewhere even better.

76
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
I'm sorry…

77
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,925
I'm just sorry.

78
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,387
It's okay.

79
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,224
Come here.

80
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,767
Hey, buddy!

81
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,562
-Run!
-Let's go.

82
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,815
Ah-ra actually hates dogs.

83
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,485
She's just putting on an act for our sake.

84
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,695
Got you.

85
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,948
Hey, guys.

86
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,702
Isn't it so cute?

87
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,787
Look at it chasing after me.

88
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,085
Ah-ra.

89
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,879
Wake up. We've arrived.

90
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,672
Jung-yeon.

91
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,509
Can't you be nice and wipe her mouth?

92
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,929
I didn't drool.

93
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,183
You guys are terrible.

94
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,977
I'm going home now.

95
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,395
-Be careful getting out.
-Okay.

96
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,943
-I'll see you up there.
-Okay.

97
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,698
I'm going to go and grab my stuff.
It won't take long.

98
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,325
Take your time.

99
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,583
-Hello?
-<i>Why are you so hard to reach?</i>

100
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,377
You were right.

101
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,421
We have an address
for the doctor you were looking for.

102
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,715
It appears Kang and he were
aware of each other.

103
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,801
The perp will be caught soon.

104
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,927
No.

105
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,847
The doctor's computer and files
were all stolen from his home.

106
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,058
<i>It appears the perp</i>
<i>was in a real rush this time.</i>

107
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,769
No mirrors or the usual traces.

108
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,814
The scene was a complete mess.
Return to the office now.

109
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,066
Jeong I-shin won't cooperate
without you here.

110
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,195
Jeong I-shin and I will be of no help now.

111
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,991
The perp should be calling soon.

112
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,367
We must uncover a lead then.

113
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,831
Son Hyeon-ho died because of me.

114
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,001
So did Min-jae.

115
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,380
It's only natural that the team
doesn't want me to be there.

116
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,257
I'm sorry, sir.

117
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,217
<i>Su-yeol.</i>

118
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,344
The issue with the team members

119
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,224
will be taken care of by Jeong I-shin.

120
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,059
What?

121
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,561
<i>Return to the office immediately</i>

122
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,605
if you want the perp to be caught.

123
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,528
You need to go, right?

124
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,947
Well…

125
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,533
Go. I'll be fine.

126
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,163
Jung-yeon.

127
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,289
Su-yeol.

128
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,292
You said the investigation
was like a child.

129
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:31,172
You can't just pick and choose
when you want to take care of a child.

130
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,219
Go.

131
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,930
Go and make sure
to catch that copycat killer.

132
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,560
And then, come and pick me up.

133
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,618
The perp is excited right now.

134
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,291
She's trying to clean up her tracks.

135
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,091
Captain Cha Su-yeol
has been relieved from this case.

136
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,182
You can just return to prison
if you're not going to cooperate.

137
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,101
I will.

138
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,352
See to it.

139
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,481
Why does it need to be your son?

140
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,526
After over 20 years
of no contact, why now?

141
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,669
Can you give us the room for a moment?

142
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,215
We'll be fine.

143
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,203
Your custody battle.

144
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,208
The child was young,
and with his disability on top of it,

145
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,794
it was a guaranteed win for the mother.

146
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,713
How do you know about that?

147
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,925
That district office punk.

148
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,970
He just babbled on and on, unprompted.

149
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,141
Why did you lose that custody battle?

150
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,977
Ho-jun, it's okay.

151
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,479
You don't have to answer
any more questions.

152
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,356
It's okay. Don't worry, Ho-jun.

153
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,149
Come on now, Ho-jun.

154
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,279
Ho-jun. It's okay.

155
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,949
You don't need to answer that.
You're okay.

156
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,201
Daddy is sorry.

157
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,037
He chose his dad.

158
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,542
The wishes of a child that young

159
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,419
wouldn't influence the judgment.

160
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,504
You know that.

161
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,634
Daddy.

162
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,928
Daddy.

163
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,974
-Daddy.
-"Daddy"?

164
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,102
-Daddy.
-It's okay.

165
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,980
-Daddy.
-I got you.

166
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,400
Until then, he only knew
how to cry and scream,

167
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,029
and laugh when he was happy.
He had yet to speak a single word.

168
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,949
But he said, "Daddy" out loud.

169
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,952
That was his first word ever.

170
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,251
You pushed for the question to be asked
when you knew it would work against you.

171
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,968
You wanted the kid to choose his dad.

172
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,431
He was too much for you to handle.

173
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,142
But when that became the reality,

174
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,227
you found yourself unbearably loathsome.

175
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,980
You became the mother
who abandoned her own child.

176
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,190
Ms. Jeong I-shin.

177
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,194
My son, Inspector Cha Su-yeol,

178
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,532
became a police officer to prove
that he was nothing like me,

179
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,367
and that's why he took on this case.

180
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,995
If he can't solve this case,

181
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,164
he won't be able to forgive himself.

182
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,416
That's why he put up
with his loathsome mother

183
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,168
and refused to ring the emergency alarm.

184
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,503
He wanted to catch the perp.

185
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,885
But all you have is work.

186
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,137
After abandoning your child,

187
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,265
if you can't even work,
you'll truly be nothing.

188
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,143
I'm sure you can't forgive yourself.

189
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,269
Am I wrong?

190
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,064
What are you trying to say exactly?

191
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,565
Bring me Su-yeol right now.

192
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,318
He is just as desperate as you.

193
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,237
Go and see what
unified desperation gets you.

194
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,414
Inspector Cha Su-yeol…

195
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,001
is a decent police officer.

196
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,421
He is indeed qualified
to be the squad leader of our team.

197
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,716
We are not refusing him
because he's your son.

198
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,677
It's because he hid that fact from us.

199
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,347
Because he didn't trust us. That's why.

200
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,724
You're right.

201
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,811
Yeah, I was a coward.

202
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,813
I gave him up.

203
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,775
I didn't think I could do it.

204
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,363
If I couldn't be a good mother for Ho-jun…

205
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,244
I decided I should at least excel
in a space where I'm useful.

206
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,706
But you know what?

207
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,667
At the very least,

208
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,795
I didn't embrace my child
with hands that butchered human lives.

209
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,965
If you possessed any maternal love,
I mean…

210
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,467
any sense of responsibility,

211
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,262
shouldn't you have stopped
for your child's sake?

212
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,141
You severed a man's tongue
and ripped off the neck of another.

213
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,934
What went through your mind

214
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,603
when you went back home
and saw your child?

215
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,356
"Since I am your mother,

216
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,151
I won't kill you." Was that it?

217
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,569
Such an eloquent speaker you are.

218
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,281
You seem quite upset.

219
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,781
I'm just curious.

220
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,286
Are you actually assisting in this case

221
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,955
for the sake of Cha Su-yeol, your son?

222
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,251
What?

223
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,045
I just can't believe it.

224
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,466
What if this isn't a narrative
about a mother aiding her son?

225
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,510
What if it's one where the mother
is using her son with sinister intentions?

226
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,764
That's what heinous criminals do.

227
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,560
If that's the case…

228
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,565
I will kill you.

229
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,034
Inspector Kim Na-hee.

230
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,791
Hang in there.

231
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,564
NAMBU METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

232
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,988
You should've gone easy with the cilantro.

233
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,865
That was just way too much.

234
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,118
The soup was good,
but just too much cilantro…

235
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,161
Hyuk.

236
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,436
<i>Lying to us was wrong.</i>

237
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,707
Why do you look so blue?

238
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,003
I thought you worked it out
with Su-yeol at the funeral yesterday.

239
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,089
I'm not sure.

240
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,093
I can't figure you two out either.

241
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,763
I do appreciate the reminder
that being single is

242
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,973
the golden ticket.

243
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,185
How about some day-drinking?

244
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,021
Ah-ra.

245
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,732
I can't drink anymore.

246
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,525
Why not?

247
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,528
What's wrong?

248
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,282
You can talk to me.

249
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,128
PREGNANT

250
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,213
Seriously?

251
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,881
Wait, is this thing real?

252
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,467
Congratulations, Jung-yeon!

253
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,219
This is happy news. What's wrong?

254
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,347
Don't tell me.

255
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,806
Does Su-yeol not want it?

256
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,268
Cha Su-yeol, that jerk.
Should I give him a stern talking-to?

257
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,853
Knock some sense into him?

258
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,855
-Should I?
-No. He doesn't know yet.

259
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,900
Why not? Why didn't you tell him?

260
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,529
Jung-yeon.

261
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,116
I don't know.

262
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,036
I was the one who asked him out
and proposed to him.

263
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,164
I'm having this baby,
whether he wants it or not.

264
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,874
I need to show him how great

265
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,876
having a family can be.

266
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,005
I'm jealous.

267
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,967
What?

268
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,135
It's nothing.

269
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,471
How about going for a drive?

270
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,696
Its name is Astro Jian.

271
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,365
It's a character Sergeant Son made.

272
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,293
I'm not here for a warm welcome.

273
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,964
But still, at least,
until the investigation is over--

274
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,299
We need to work together.

275
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,843
We need to catch the culprit.

276
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,428
We can't have any more victims.

277
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,890
Thank you.

278
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,477
Do you remember what you told us
when you first got here?

279
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,355
It doesn't matter
if it's Narcotics or Major Crimes.

280
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,899
A true officer proves themselves
in investigations.

281
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,403
Now, prove yourself.

282
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,947
We will respond accordingly.

283
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,629
BLOCKED NUMBER

284
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,259
Why are you in cahoots with the pigs?
Is it for your son's sake?

285
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,927
Do you know what I'm looking at?

286
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,805
A corpse in a bathtub.

287
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,224
<i>What a dumpster fire.</i>

288
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,810
<i>You didn't kill someone</i>
<i>who deserved to be killed.</i>

289
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,064
<i>You just did it to save your own ass</i>
<i>because he knew your true identity.</i>

290
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,191
Do you understand now?

291
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,485
You and I are nothing alike.

292
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,529
You kill people
just because you want to kill.

293
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,907
Reasoning is nowhere to be found.

294
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,286
I know you killed the cat you showed me
when you were a kid.

295
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,122
<i>After being abused by your daddy,</i>

296
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,458
you vented your rage on small,
powerless creatures.

297
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,169
<i>Yeon-joong, that is who you are.</i>

298
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,629
If you ever have a kid,

299
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,924
I'm sure you'll follow right
in your daddy's footsteps

300
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,217
and make your kid suffer.

301
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,513
<i>You'd better shut up</i>
<i>before I wrench that tongue out.</i>

302
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,183
Damn, look at those murderous sparks
flying between them.

303
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,434
<i>Listen, Jeong I-shin,</i>

304
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,896
<i>you should've just killed me</i>
<i>after killing my dad.</i>

305
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,066
<i>You act all high and mighty</i>
<i>as if you're some noble hero,</i>

306
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,361
<i>but you're nothing more</i>
<i>than the pathetic beast who failed.</i>

307
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,446
<i>You ought to be grateful to me.</i>

308
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,950
<i>Hey, I was the one who stopped</i>
<i>Park Min-jae from digging into</i>

309
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,243
<i>you and your son.</i>

310
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:35,288
<i>Your son gets to live his happy life now</i>
<i>all because of me.</i>

311
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,332
<i>And this is the thanks I get?</i>

312
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,292
What's this now?

313
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:46,383
<i>Fine. I'll make sure you regret</i>
<i>not killing me after my dad.</i>

314
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,968
<i>You're in prison,</i>

315
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,053
<i>and I'm out here.</i>

316
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,304
<i>You just wait and see.</i>

317
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,933
<i>See how I tear down</i>
<i>every little thing you hold dear.</i>

318
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,903
She said you were happy because of her.

319
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,242
How did you meet Jung-yeon?

320
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,091
I thought all detectives were scary.

321
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,136
Yeah, I'm really scary.

322
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,183
What I mean is,

323
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,060
when I'm working,
I tend to be quite ruthless.

324
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,316
I hope to see the day
when you become afraid of me.

325
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,609
Why?

326
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,988
It's just a bit scary to realize
you have feelings for somebody.

327
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,410
Why are there so many people
in the bathroom?

328
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:01,166
What's this? The matchmaker returns from
the bathroom to find a whole new vibe?

329
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,128
This is only the first meeting,
and you already have secrets?

330
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,983
POWER OFF

331
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,506
Hey, don't you worry about a thing.

332
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,591
Safe driving is the best driving.

333
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,433
<i>The phone is switched off…</i>

334
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,856
<i>The phone is switched off. Your call</i>
<i>will now be forwarded to voicemail…</i>

335
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,234
Sir.

336
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,528
No one's here.

337
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,612
Her car's gone too.

338
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,865
-It seems they went somewhere.
-Isn't she an acquaintance?

339
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,242
Any idea where she could be?

340
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,496
Damn it.

341
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,581
Hey, you call that driving?

342
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,675
The vehicle just passed
Yeoseung Toll Gate.

343
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,969
Yeoseung? Where could they be headed?

344
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,305
-What about Ms. Lee's phone?
-It's still off.

345
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,308
<i>The phone is switched off. Your call</i>
<i>will now be forwarded to voicemail…</i>

346
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,437
Patrol cars and the highway control center
have been notified.

347
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,189
Most patrol cars are
smart vehicles nowadays.

348
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,774
I'm sure they'll find them.

349
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,900
Don't worry too much.

350
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,656
IF YOU'RE WITH AH-RA,
YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HER NOW

351
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,204
MYEONGCHEON SELF-SERVICE GAS STATION

352
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,591
Parked.

353
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,678
So? Can you trust my driving skills now?

354
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,764
Maybe we can call for a driver?

355
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,391
No, I got this. No worries.

356
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,644
-I need to pump the gas.
-Okay.

357
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,366
Why is it off?

358
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,871
<i>Please select your fuel type.</i>

359
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,295
HUBBY SU-YEOL

360
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,634
IF YOU'RE WITH AH-RA,
YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HER NOW

361
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,221
Ms. Lee's phone was turned on.
She's near Ichang-myeon.

362
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,473
Send all available units in the area.

363
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,975
AH-RA IS MIN-JAE'S KILLER…
YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE

364
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,898
Pass Ichang-myeon and take Route 92.

365
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:12,982
Yes, sir.

366
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,120
What's wrong?

367
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,083
I just need to use the bathroom.

368
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,850
-All patrol cars in the area--
-Hold on.

369
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,519
-Su-yeol, it's me.
-<i>Listen, Jung-yeon.</i>

370
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,106
I'll explain the details later.

371
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,734
<i>If you're with Ah-ra, you need</i>
<i>to get away as soon as possible,</i>

372
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,860
<i>and find other people.</i>

373
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,028
And don't panic. I'm on my way.

374
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,655
<i>Can you tell me where you are?</i>

375
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,869
Myeongcheon Self-Service Gas Station.

376
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,999
Jung-yeon, don't hang up,
and just keep your phone on you.

377
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,586
-Okay.
-<i>Don't get scared. Remain calm.</i>

378
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,129
<i>Go somewhere with lots of people.</i>

379
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,922
<i>Don't ever turn off your phone.</i>

380
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,007
<i>Okay, Jung-yeon?</i>

381
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,995
Our Jung-yeon can be so cute sometimes.

382
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,769
GISEUNG LOGISTICS

383
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,122
Hello?

384
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,332
Is anyone here?

385
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,131
Su-yeol, I managed to get away.

386
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,509
Good job, Jung-yeon. Are you okay?

387
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,344
What is going on right now?

388
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,096
<i>Is Ah-ra really the culprit?</i>

389
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,181
It seems so.

390
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,559
Don't worry. The police are
on their way there. I am too.

391
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,144
<i>Can you tell me exactly where you are?</i>

392
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,397
I am…

393
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,316
-at Giseung Logistics.
-<i>Giseung Logistics.</i>

394
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,238
But there's no one else around.

395
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,906
The police are on their way there.

396
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,658
<i>I'm on my way there, too. Don't worry.</i>

397
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,081
Take a deep breath.

398
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,584
One,

399
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,377
two,

400
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,796
<i>three.</i>

401
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,132
<i>One, two,</i>

402
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,676
three.

403
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,142
Su-yeol, I think someone's here.

404
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,314
Ms. Lee Jung-yeon?

405
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,065
Ms. Lee Jung-yeon?

406
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,901
Are you here, Ms. Lee?

407
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,361
It's the police.

408
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,865
<i>I'm over here!</i>

409
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,283
We've located Ms. Lee.

410
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,120
-Do you want to…
-Yes.

411
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,580
Hello, sir. I'm here.

412
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,748
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

413
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,417
Let's first get her somewhere safe.

414
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,753
We'll be there shortly.

415
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,921
Yes, sir.

416
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,465
You can get in the back.

417
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,926
We'll get you somewhere safe.

418
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,220
Heading to the precinct now.

419
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,521
<i>Hello?</i>

420
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,981
Jung-yeon, what's wrong?

421
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,528
Jung-yeon!

422
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,323
-Go! Step on it!
-Yes, sir.

423
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,372
<i>Do you copy?</i>

424
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,374
<i>What's going on there?</i>

425
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,001
<i>Do you copy?</i>

426
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,419
Jung-yeon.

427
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,510
Ah-ra.

428
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,594
Please don't do this.

429
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,930
I'm pregnant.

430
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,517
Hello.

431
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,726
It's nice to meet you.

432
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,770
I'm Kang Yeon-joong.

433
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,555
His gun is missing.

434
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,639
Sir.

435
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,484
Hello?

436
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,777
<i>Hello?</i>

437
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,987
Is that you, Su-yeol?

438
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,369
Ah-ra, you…

439
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,414
Inspector Cha Su-yeol.

440
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,666
No, I mean Jeong-ho.

441
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,751
<i>It's been a while.</i>

442
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,335
Kang Yeon-joong.

443
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,297
Jung-yeon is taking a nice little nap.

444
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:14,135
The only thing she has to look forward to
when she wakes up is hell.

445
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:16,094
I hope she at least has a nice dream.

446
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,014
Lay a hand on her,
and you'll answer to me.

447
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,809
Su-yeol.

448
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,562
She was just a toy
I threw your way from the start.

449
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,481
Who are you to threaten me?

450
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:28,399
Oh, that's right.

451
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,525
I left a little gift for you there.

452
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,527
<i>Check the center console.</i>

453
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,381
NAMBU METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

454
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,677
I've located the suspect's vehicle.
It's headed toward…

455
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,053
YEONPO INTERSECTION, ROUTE 21

456
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,806
Su-yeol, it looks like the perp
is heading to Woongsan.

457
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,642
-<i>She's not hiding it either.</i>
-Wait…

458
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,104
Kang Yeon-joong's old house in Tangwang
and my old house.

459
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,857
Dispatch units to every place
of interest tied to the perp.

460
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,359
And Yeonpo Bridge
also needs to be sealed off.

461
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,290
Sir.

462
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:11,169
After the Hyupseong mines shut down,
everyone moved out of the company housing.

463
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,672
There's no one
at your old house in Yeonpo either.

464
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,843
And Yeonpo Bridge?

465
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,554
It was sealed off a while ago.
They never crossed it.

466
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,098
It seems they're somewhere in this town.

467
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,852
The mining company has been contacted.

468
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,564
The advance SOU units are gathered
at the community center.

469
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,524
We should head there.

470
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,126
You're awake.

471
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,711
What do you think?

472
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,546
Isn't it cozy?

473
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,299
It's my favorite spot.

474
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,551
I wonder if you'll like it too.

475
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,719
Ah-ra.

476
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,429
It's me, Jung-yeon.

477
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,225
Of course, I know you, Jung-yeon.

478
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,685
You're Cha Su-yeol's wife
and Jeong I-shin's daughter-in-law.

479
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,230
I was the one who introduced you to him.

480
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,106
If I'm being honest,

481
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,692
I tried a few other girls
with him before you.

482
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,153
But for some odd reason,
he only ever showed interest in you.

483
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,697
I knew the door code to your place.

484
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,532
I got daily updates
on Cha Su-yeol from you.

485
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,742
I even saw him every day.

486
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,119
I didn't even need CCTV or surveillance.

487
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,663
All thanks to you.

488
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,039
Why are you doing this?

489
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,542
She looked after me.

490
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,462
It's only right that I help out her son,
don't you think?

491
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,049
"Her"?

492
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,969
Hey.

493
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,807
Unbelievable.
You really need to get your shit together.

494
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,560
You might see your mother-in-law.

495
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,396
You can't be out of it already.

496
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:09,996
LEADING COAL INDUSTRY INNOVATION!
EAST MINE SHAFT

497
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,757
Sir.

498
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,842
Thanks.

499
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,343
Hold on.

500
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,848
Yes, sir?

501
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,104
Answer it.

502
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,781
<i>Hi! Keep your mouth shut and listen to me.</i>

503
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,908
<i>You must be wondering where I am.</i>

504
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,494
You could call it my hideout.

505
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,122
There are a lot of bugs here
and it's quite damp,

506
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,790
<i>but I love it.</i>

507
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,710
-Basement storage room.
-<i>Every time my dad got wasted</i>

508
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,295
<i>and flipped out, I'd hide here.</i>

509
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,383
Ta-da!

510
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,179
<i>I used to play doctor on this table.</i>

511
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,681
I used to pretend
the box cutter was a scalpel,

512
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,642
<i>and I used it to slice open</i>
<i>stray cats and dogs, one after another.</i>

513
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,811
You were right.

514
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,855
The cat I showed you back then

515
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,315
<i>was also killed by me.</i>

516
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,819
I just sort of felt this thrill
when I went against my dad's wishes.

517
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,946
<i>You know what I'm talking about, right?</i>

518
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,658
<i>At some point, he was no longer a factor.</i>
<i>I just wanted to keep doing it.</i>

519
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,119
<i>I started small</i>
<i>and eventually made my way up.</i>

520
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,164
<i>From beasts to people.</i>

521
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,876
Fuck, seriously…

522
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,215
I should've been
the one to kill my father.

523
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,513
I really fucking regret that.

524
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,772
<i>I've always wanted</i>

525
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,316
<i>to slice open a pregnant creature.</i>

526
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,318
<i>I wondered</i>

527
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,904
-Sir.
-<i>if you put the mother under anesthesia,</i>

528
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,489
<i>does the baby go under too?</i>

529
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,449
Aren't you dying to know too?

530
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,036
<i>So I went all over town looking for one,</i>

531
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,915
<i>but I couldn't find</i>
<i>a single pregnant bitch around.</i>

532
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,417
<i>Maybe my town was too rural?</i>

533
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,962
I've sliced through everything else,

534
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,297
but not that yet.

535
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,927
I feel like I'll be able
to check that off my list today.

536
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,471
<i>Are you still a child?</i>

537
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,059
<i>You took out your rage at your daddy</i>

538
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,854
on helpless animals.

539
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,981
Because you were weak back then.

540
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,781
But that's no longer the case.

541
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,285
<i>If you're mad at me, take it out on me.</i>

542
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,079
You want me, right?

543
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,374
And not the toy you found.

544
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,043
<i>Hey, Jung-yeon.</i>

545
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,088
<i>Your mother-in-law</i>
<i>just called you a "toy."</i>

546
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,680
<i>I'm sure I told you</i>
<i>to keep your mouth shut.</i>

547
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,227
Our Jung-yeon…

548
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,358
gets to live, thanks to her mother-in-law.

549
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,361
<i>I'll give her back,</i>

550
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,446
<i>but in exchange,</i>

551
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,114
<i>you come here in person.</i>

552
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,951
<i>The exchange will happen in five hours,</i>
<i>at the community center.</i>

553
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,036
<i>And after that…</i>

554
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,205
<i>I'll tell you when you get here.</i>

555
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,292
If I even detect a whiff of the police,

556
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,295
I'll just kill Jung-yeon.

557
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,547
<i>See you later.</i>

558
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,632
<i>Mom.</i>

559
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,384
Five hours later?

560
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,844
It'll be 11:00 a.m.

561
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,638
Jeong I-shin is coming here?

562
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,006
Open your mouth.

563
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,093
Stop acting like you give a damn about me.
Untie me now.

564
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,053
It looks like

565
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,682
our Jung-yeon is not ready
to become a mom yet.

566
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,018
Forget you. Will your baby be okay?

567
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,365
Have you lost your mind?

568
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,286
Hey! I went out of my way to help you.

569
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,329
Why the hell would you spit on my face?

570
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,248
Look at what you did. I'm filthy now!

571
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,879
INSPECTOR CHA SU-YEOL

572
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,298
SPEAKER

573
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,217
You will end up dead if you go there.
You know that.

574
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,302
<i>Just accept it.</i>

575
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,305
You hand over one to get back two.

576
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,931
<i>It's a pretty good deal.</i>

577
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,476
<i>Last time, you told me</i>

578
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,730
I should aid with the investigation

579
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,773
if I want to pay for my sins.

580
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,443
<i>It's quite amusing.</i>

581
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,447
I am a death row inmate.

582
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,618
Even when I killed the scum of the earth
who deserved to die,

583
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,703
I was tried in a court of law.

584
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,833
However, when it comes to you…

585
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,254
What about me?

586
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,221
I have to do this.

587
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,852
INSPECTOR CHA SU-YEOL

588
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,149
<i>I understand…</i>

589
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,444
but I can't make that decision.

590
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,158
After the mines shut down,

591
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,160
there was talk of a casino coming in,

592
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,953
but I guess it went nowhere.

593
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,164
Even the former miners say

594
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,124
that there isn't anyone who knows

595
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,918
all the ins and outs of the mines.

596
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,003
Damn it. So what now?

597
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,674
After mobilizing all this man power,
are we just supposed to sit on our hands?

598
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,635
They said not to provoke the perp.
Just do as you're told.

599
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,761
What about Captain Cha?

600
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,936
His mother, wife,

601
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,062
and now, even his baby.

602
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,773
I would've lost my mind already.

603
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,651
You are just impossibly naive.

604
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,404
What does that mean?

605
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,364
I mean…

606
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,034
This might sound a bit…

607
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,205
Damn it. Screw it.

608
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,250
Anyhow, if we solely rely on Kang's words,

609
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:15,003
and things go awry,
we might end up letting Kang and Jeong,

610
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,214
both of the bloodthirsty killers,
walk free.

611
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,299
What if they're in it together?

612
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,179
To be honest,
I don't trust the captain either.

613
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,560
After all we've been through,
that's what you think about Captain Cha?

614
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,813
From what I've seen,

615
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,149
he has worked harder than anyone
to catch this perp.

616
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,734
He suffered the most
every time there was a new victim.

617
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,111
She's right.

618
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,738
It was almost to the point
of being excessive.

619
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,157
I finally understand now.

620
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,159
Jeong I-shin said that Captain Cha

621
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,744
became a police officer
and took on this case

622
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,080
to prove that he was
nothing like his mother.

623
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,999
To prove that he wasn't like her?

624
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,711
In other words, to prove he's someone
who saves lives, not takes them.

625
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,089
Someone who rescues lives
and prevents crime.

626
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,217
I'm sure seeing the climbing number
of victims drove him insane.

627
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,887
He probably believed
he failed to stop the murders.

628
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:09,099
And to make matters worse,
the killer was imitating his mother.

629
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,853
He was practically forced
to relive his mother's traumatizing past.

630
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,105
It must have been

631
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,650
so painful for him.

632
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,902
And you suggest

633
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,155
he would use his pregnant wife
to help out Kang and Jeong?

634
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,867
No, what I meant was…

635
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,118
Captain Cha is not involved.

636
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,330
If anything, he's getting used
by the two of them.

637
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,418
But what if Jeong I-shin
was exploiting such intentions?

638
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,881
As if serial murder wasn't enough,
what if she was using her son

639
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,717
to make her escape?

640
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,304
His life will be…

641
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:50,307
That's why we need
to keep it together for his sake.

642
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,893
Let's see what happens.

643
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,103
A hostage exchange?

644
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,524
The higher-ups would never agree to that.

645
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,442
You said it yourself.

646
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,153
The commissioner would never take on
such a risk that might result

647
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,821
in two serial killers walking free.

648
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,038
Chief Choi.

649
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,666
Jung-ho.

650
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,833
Have you lost your mind?

651
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,294
How could we ever trust
Jeong I-shin enough to release her?

652
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,296
We'll have her wear a tracker

653
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,423
and catch her when she's with the perp.

654
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,634
This is actually our chance
to catch the perp as well.

655
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,512
Jeong I-shin has agreed to cooperate.

656
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,888
What if they're in it together?

657
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,348
What if they're accomplices?

658
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,308
What if this isn't
a chance to catch criminals,

659
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,811
but for the Mantis to make her escape?

660
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:36,979
Just in case,

661
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,649
we'll secure the perimeter
of the exchange site.

662
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,319
We will take every precaution
to prevent escape.

663
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,115
We don't have time.

664
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,493
If the police knew of
a pregnant hostage and she's murdered,

665
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,704
how will you handle the backlash?

666
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,708
We have a little more
than four hours left.

667
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,627
We need to take
Jeong I-shin to the site now.

668
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:04,631
We never should've brought
that woman into this to begin with!

669
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,638
Jung-ho, you're done.

670
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,683
I'll take over the reins from here.

671
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,437
I refuse.

672
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,938
What did you say?

673
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,898
I will see this through.

674
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,034
We received a report of a child screaming.

675
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,328
May I take a look inside?

676
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,289
Are you going to take him and raise him?

677
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,250
Sir, there's no need for all that.

678
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,254
<i>You know about Kang Yeon-joong.</i>

679
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,923
<i>That day,</i>

680
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,344
<i>if I had forced myself in there…</i>

681
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,557
I would've discovered Kang,

682
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,310
and if I had taken
the necessary measures back then,

683
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,772
his father wouldn't have been
murdered either.

684
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:07,069
Then, Kang would've never witnessed
Jeong I-shin murder his father.

685
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,528
And 23 years later,

686
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,114
we could've avoided

687
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,950
Kang following in Jeong's footsteps
and killing all those people.

688
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,373
What has gotten into you?

689
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,874
You know what that town was like.

690
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,460
Half of them didn't want
the mines shut down,

691
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,964
while the other half demanded it
and called for the casino to be built.

692
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,801
Every day, they got drunk
and beat each other up.

693
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,303
It was a complete mess.

694
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,681
Out in the open, on the street,

695
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,558
and even in front of our precinct,
they pummeled each other.

696
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,061
They beat each other to a bloody pulp.

697
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,606
Him beating his child
inside his home wasn't--

698
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,108
Excuses!

699
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,405
Those are all just excuses.

700
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,409
At the end of the day,
we failed to fulfill our duties.

701
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,869
What we couldn't do back then…

702
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,417
Now,

703
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,628
I would like to see it through myself.

704
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,355
<i>You know what the higher-ups</i>
<i>are worried about, right?</i>

705
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,358
Do they suspect them of being accomplices?

706
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,027
That Kang Yeon-joong did all this

707
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,321
to get Jeong I-shin out?

708
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,908
Jeong I-shin remains a dark chapter
in the history of the police.

709
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,036
<i>They wouldn't mind</i>
<i>if she just disappeared.</i>

710
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,261
Yes, I understand.

711
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,395
We'll understand that as your approval
and move accordingly.

712
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,024
It's getting weirder out there.

713
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,860
Who was that?

714
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,695
It's a special order
from the commissioner.

715
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,281
We'll operate independently going forward.

716
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,991
Hyuk.

717
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,468
You tried to save me once.

718
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,888
Thank you.

719
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,102
But can you tell me

720
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,898
how it feels when you go out of your way

721
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,817
to save a person?

722
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,328
All right. Let's head out.

723
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,086
<i>Even when I killed the scum of the earth</i>
<i>who deserved to die,</i>

724
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,380
<i>I was tried in a court of law.</i>

725
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,258
I have to do this.

726
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,369
Momma Bird is passing Woongsan Elementary.

727
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,341
WOONGSAN SERIAL HOMICIDE
INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS

728
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,887
You can step out now.

729
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,873
We'll remain on standby here.

730
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,292
When the hostage exchange commences,

731
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,045
we'll take our spots here, here, and here,

732
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,880
to pursue Kang and Jeong.

733
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,508
But what was the special order
from the commissioner?

734
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:26,554
"Kang does not need to be arrested alive.
Close this case today, no matter what."

735
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,057
"Excluding Lee Jung-yeon and Cha Su-yeol,

736
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,351
don't take extreme measures
for a hostage's safety."

737
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:36,064
"For the sake of Lee and Cha's safety,
and for the sake of stopping Kang,

738
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,234
Jeong I-shin may be shot down."

739
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,527
That was his order.

740
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,655
We'll communicate on channel eight.

741
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,264
Once Jung-yeon is returned…

742
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,851
we'll pursue you immediately afterward.

743
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,318
Let me see your arm.

744
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,236
No need.

745
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,156
Kang has a gun.

746
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,326
So, you must wear this.

747
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,913
A lot of people want me dead.

748
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,831
Kang isn't the only one.

749
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,297
I don't.

750
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,258
So let me see your arm.

751
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,057
I'll be nearby.

752
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,768
Don't worry.

753
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,994
<i>Walk straight up the mountain</i>
<i>behind Mine Number Two.</i>

754
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,039
Make sure the Mantis is cuffed,
and you make sure you're unarmed.

755
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,793
<i>If anyone tries to pull a fast one</i>
<i>or if there's any funny business,</i>

756
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,004
Jung-yeon and your baby
will be killed immediately.

757
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,018
Are you ready?

758
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,078
<i>Baby Bird has brought Momma Bird</i>
<i>out of the community center.</i>

759
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,580
<i>Moving out.</i>

760
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,166
The Mantis is really here.

761
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,770
Bae, you head out first.

762
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,356
Move in a wide arc
around the foot of the mountain,

763
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:49,359
and scout out buildings or caves
that could be used as a hideout.

764
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:51,110
-You got it.
-Stay alert.

765
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,737
Don't forget the perp has a gun.

766
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,323
Yes, ma'am.

767
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,660
As soon as the exchange happens,
our units will move in.

768
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,413
<i>Take your shot</i>
<i>as soon as Jung-yeon is safe.</i>

769
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,373
<i>I was so disappointed.</i>

770
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,209
<i>This is your one chance</i>
<i>if you want to kill me.</i>

771
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,254
<i>Tell me where Jeong I-shin went.</i>

772
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,049
<i>An off-the-record APB</i>
<i>has been issued for you two.</i>

773
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,593
<i>Why were you so lenient with her?</i>

774
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,637
<i>And with me?</i>

775
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,056
That thing burned my mother to death.

776
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:47,018
<i>Doesn't it get so lonely?</i>
<i>Living as a monster…</i>

777
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:50,563
