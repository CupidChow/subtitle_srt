a warning would be useless, I couldn't stop.

67
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:32,500
and still pretended not to know,
like putting on a show?

68
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:43,267

She lost her mom young,
and though they lived together,

75
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:52,500
they didn't get along well.

78
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,267
Why? Hungry?

79
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:15,400
Red. Is that a signal for someone?

80
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:21,333
What signal?

81
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,400
This is the outfit you wore yesterday.

82
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,167
What did you get on it
that you washed it after wearing it once?

83
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,800
I Sin. I'm not a petty person.

84
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,400
Are you hiding something?

85
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,000
You can tell me. What are you hiding?

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,633
I Sin. What are you hiding?

87
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:48,867
She left home as soon as her ID came out.

88
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:52,100
I barely managed to track her down,
and when I went to see her...

89
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,833
I Sin, why do you keep hiding things from me?

90
00:07:55,833 --> 00:08:00,967
it turned out that her husband was
the notorious trash of the neighborhood.

91
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,233
What are you hiding?

92
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,767
I could clearly see how she was living,

93
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:09,696
and not being able to do anything
about it, I was just worried.

94
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:15,767
So I went a few times in secret
to check how she was.

95
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
That night too...

96
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,733
Don't!

97
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,167
How could she do that?

98
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:03,367
You should've made her
turn herself in or reported it.

99
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,333
If you had just reported it back then,

100
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,633
it could have at least stopped there.

101
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,600
After that, she killed five more people.

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,733
That woman did the killing.

103
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:17,300
Why? Why did you just stand by?

104
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,633
I tried to stop her!

105
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,467
But I couldn't go through with it.

106
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:24,467
How could I report my daughter?

107
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,500
As a father, how could I
possibly ruin my child's life?

108
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,467
I know. I'm fully aware.

109
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:36,633
I'm a selfish man who committed unforgivable sins.

110
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,200
I raised you with repentance

111
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,100
and took in other children too,

112
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,767
but does that erase anything?

113
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,267
The debt of sin lasts a lifetime.

114
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,733
Anyway, the killer knows about that.

115
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:59,300
Have you told anyone about this?

116
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,500
Who would I possibly tell?

117
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,533
No one knows.

118
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:09,233
Listen, Su Yeol. Let this end here.

119
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,367
He's already dead.

120
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,967
I made his grave with my own hands,

121
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,867
treated him as deceased,

122
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:19,733
and that's how we've managed till now.

123
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:22,967
You understand that better than anyone.

124
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:26,033
It's because I worked so hard
that you are who you are now.

125
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:29,533
I know, but it's work.

126
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:35,500
Do you think keeping in touch with your mother
will make this end as 'just work'?

127
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,033
The world doesn't work that way.

128
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,400
That murderer,

129
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,833
must you be the one to catch them?

130
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:49,800
My mother committed
her first murder because of me.

131
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,933
So, I have to catch them.

132
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:56,467
That woman killed six people.

133
00:10:56,467 --> 00:11:00,533
Now a copycat has emerged,

134
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:05,533
bringing the total deaths to ten!

135
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:11,667
Since this all started
because of me, I must end it.

136
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:22,267
That's the only way I can survive, isn't it?

137
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,667
The killer knew details about your past

138
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,000
that even the police weren't aware of.

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,733
So, I'll start from the Yeonpo Bridge accident.

140
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,433
These are neighbors who lived nearby at the time.

141
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,633

[Investigation Report]

143
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:21,833
Could they have witnessed
something related to my father?

144
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,933
It's possible because they were neighbors.

145
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,033
This guy's an alcoholic scumbag too.

Could he be the copycat?

150
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,933
Do you remember anything?

151
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:54,667
Is Jung Yeon resilient?

152
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,033
Even if my existence becomes public,
would she still stay by you?

153
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,600
I'll leave.

154
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,333
Will you leave that district officer alone?

155
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:20,700
Then, what should I do?

156
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,667
Kill him?

157
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Could you do it?

158
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:32,800
I'll do it.

159
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,267
What?

160
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:39,800
Ms. Jung I Sin, if something bothers you
or makes you uncomfortable,

161
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,500
do you just kill the target?

162
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,100
I don't.

163
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,233
And I protect my family.

164
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:55,567
Don't play the caring mother now.

165
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,800
This is a warning.

166
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Next time won't be a polite request.

167
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,967
Nothing comes to mind?

168
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:16,667
Do you remember the son of that house?

169
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:25,300
Yes, I remember him. What about him?

170
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,767
When he was young, his mother left home,
and he was extremely lonely.

171
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:36,367
He was timid by nature, so he came
to our house almost every day.

172
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,033
He had injuries on his body,

173
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:42,467
and every day there were more.

174
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,033

175
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:49,400
So, I went to see that guy, his father.

176
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:31,467
Min Jae acted as if he had been abused
even worse than he actually was.

177
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Why?

178
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,200
Kids do that when they want attention.

179

for him, there were limits.

Yes.

Exactly.

In Park Min Jae's life where he's never been loved
and still can't escape that house,

195
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:40,233

To Park Min Jae, Jung I Sin might've been

197
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,167
more than a mother.

198
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:51,533
So, he copied Jung I Sin's methods?

Not sure.

200

lured me to the well

00:27:55,167 --> 00:28:01,133
When we were kids,
we taught city folks how to dig clams.

357
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,933
I don't know. Why can't I remember any of this?

358
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,933
Ugh, why are you like this?

359
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,300
Wait.

360
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:16,267
Then... do you remember the Queen Mantis case?

361
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,933
Queen Mantis?

362
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:21,733
But doesn't everyone know about that,
even if they didn't live there?

363
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:27,967
Ah, maybe you wouldn't know.

364
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,900
It was during the World Cup back then.

365
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,933
What's that?

366
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:40,533
She's a serial killer.

367
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,167
But things got really chaotic back then.

368
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,300
Just across a bridge from Yeonpo,

369
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,000
there's a mining village called Woongsan.

370
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,467
But there, a young woman killed five people.

371
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,800
- Huh?
- Five? Why?

372
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,100
Well, he'd know better, since he's a cop.

373
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:09,633
No, I don't really know either. It's an old case.

374
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,300
Then, I'll explain.

375
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:14,933
They say she was a woman in her 20s,

376
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,533
but no face or name was ever revealed.

377
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:20,533
She's only known by the nickname Queen Mantis.

378
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:24,667
She targeted people who abused women
or children and killed them brutally.

379
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,800
Well, those dead guys did far worse things...

380
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,433
No matter how terrible they were!

381
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:39,000
She can't just go around killing people like that.

382
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,767
Then, what's the law for?

383
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:44,833
Right, you're a cop, after all.

384
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:48,867
But from my artistic perspective,

385
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:52,867
I honestly think Queen Mantis
had an extreme sense of empathy.

386
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:55,767
She just had an incredible sense of empathy.

387
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:57,833
She was extremely sensitive
to other people's pain.

388
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,833
So the abused children and women,
she felt the same pain as them and...

389
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,500
Snap out of it.

390
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,700
It's murder. Cold-blooded murder.

391
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,933
She took lives.

392
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,200
I know that, I do...

393
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,100
But, I mean, I guess it's understandable.

394
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,167
If I were a victim's family,
I might've found it satisfying.

396
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:26,833
But actually, rather than Queen Mantis,

397
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm more curious about her son.

398
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,533
She had a son?

399
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:34,967
Yes, that's what the news said.

400
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:40,233

419

She paid for the broken mirror,

420
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,233
and I started visiting their house
almost daily after that.

421
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:40,267
So, that's what your mother was like.

422
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,833
But why call him hyung?

423

424
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,400

He asked the boy next to me,
'Is this your older brother?'

426
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,700
'No, it's my younger brother.'

427
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,200
He said it like this.

428
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,567
Even though I was taller back then.

429
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:05,367
But anyway, I started
calling him hyung since then.

Hyung, you're so cool.

535
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:00,367
So, this is how you work.

536
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:01,800
Mom should've seen this.

537
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,733
Stop!

538
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:08,600
I asked what you did on the 7th night.

539
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,033
Wow, looks like Mom is really your trigger.

540
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:15,600
Just hearing her name makes your veins pop.

541
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Jeez.

542
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,867
Fine.

543
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:27,600
Get me a laptop. One with internet.

544
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,967
- Why?
- Even this business is competitive now.

545
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:35,000
I have to handle these receipts,

546
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,233
and I need to report
to clients what I've been up to.

547
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,567
I share my location in real time
to keep everything neat.

548
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:45,167
So then, they'll see exactly where I was
and what I was doing, right?

549
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,467
Mr. Seo Gu Wan.

550
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,800
Mr. Seo Gu Wan, look at me.

551
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,867
Mr. Seo Gu Wan, are you okay?

552
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:57,667
Can you see me?

Look at me. Look at me!

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,567
We met at the police station.

555
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,833
Ah, I feel so suffocated.

556
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,067
I can't catch my breath.

557
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,533
My hands hurt too.

558
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:18,733
Just once. Please just once.

559
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:22,533
Please save me. I'm begging you.

560
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:25,900
Please... save me.

561
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:34,867
Are you okay now?

562
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:37,367
Thank you.

563
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:43,467
She's going to kill me.

564
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,667
Who?

565
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,400
Me.

Who will?

567
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,933
Queen Mantis.

568
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,967
Jung I Sin is in prison now?

569
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:58,967
I've heard that recent murders
are similar to the Queen Mantis case.

570
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:00,100
The sooner you talk, the sooner you get out.

571
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,933
It's not about the method,

572
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,392
but they should be killing people
who actually deserve it.

573
00:47:03,392 --> 00:47:05,167
That's the real deal.

574
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,633
Is that how it is?

[Movement Route]

576
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,900
Section Chief, seeing you here alone,

577
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,133
it seems you don't want other cops to notice me.

578
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:22,367
And I guess they don't know about

579
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,033
you and Mom's relationship, huh?

580
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:26,200
Shut your mouth.

581
00:47:26,933 --> 00:47:28,300
I'm on edge.

582
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,367
It's not like I'm trying to make things difficult.

583
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:36,167
I'll carry the fact that you even made
a fake grave to hide it with people

584
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,333
for the rest of my life.

585
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,567
So, here's the thing.

586
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,367
Can't you let me see her just once?

587
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,833
Don't think about leaving.

588
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:57,067
Not until we figure out whether it's you
moving around or just your phone. Huh?

Give me some water.

590
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:04,900
I need to take my medication.

591
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,933
You don't know a darn thing.

592
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:11,500
You're right. I don't know.

593
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,167
I didn't know, so I came here.

594
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:16,000
Why would Jung I Sin try
to kill you, Mr. Seo Gu Wan?

595
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Because I know everything.

596
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,367
I'm a police officer.

597
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:22,700

Jung I Sin, Number 0.

599
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,933
It's a murder only you know about. Right?

600
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,400
I'll keep you safe. Just tell me alone.

I know him well. He's a regular.

Was he here on the night of December 7th?

605
00:48:58,033 --> 00:48:59,933
Wait a minute.

606
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:02,767
Oh, he said he had lots of work back then.

00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:10,400
it seems she secretly bred predatory beetles.

655
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,967

from those beetles and fed it to me.

Why did you do that?

00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,900
I was hoping to get
more information about the case.

662
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,533
Didn't you say he's in the hospital
because his mind is unstable?

663
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,033
What the heck were you talking about?

664
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:16,267
There must be a reason why Seo Gu Wan
went berserk like that.

00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,700
I'm sorry.

666
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,233
Why did you untie him?

667
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:30,733
If he hadn't thrashed around like that,
Seo Gu Wan wouldn't have died.

668
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:32,500
I'm sorry.

669
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:38,700
But, the hit-and-run that killed Seo Gu Wan...

670
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,667
It wasn't an accident but premeditated.

The moment Seo Gu Wan exited the alley.

672
00:55:43,033 --> 00:55:46,033
They targeted and killed him
deliberately before fleeing.

Who could it be?

674
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:53,267
What if the real serial killer
silenced Seo Gu Wan?

00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,533
You remember Number 0?

676
00:55:57,233 --> 00:56:02,167
Seo Gu Wan. He must have known clues
about Jung Won Sik's case.

00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,400
Stop it.

678
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,933
Still, you should've reported to me
before meeting Seo Gu Wan.

679
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:13,067
Manager Kim. Do you have a problem with me?

680
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:18,567
Ignoring all procedures
and treating me like you can't trust me.

681
00:56:18,567 --> 00:56:21,567
Let's speak openly.

682
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,167
It's nothing like that.

683
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:28,933
You're just upset because I'm the team leader?

684
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:34,900
If it weren't me, you would
have been the team leader. Is that why?

685
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:41,100
You caused many incidents
in the narcotics team, right?

686
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,567
Do you think you'll keep
your position if this gets messy?

687
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:49,133
Or if the whole team stand against you...

688
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,333
Are you threatening me now?

689
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:57,367
We follow you not because you're the team leader,

690
00:56:57,367 --> 00:57:00,267
but because we believe it aids the investigation.

691
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:01,467
If we determine otherwise...

692
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:04,600
Then, does this help the investigation?

693
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,433
Another person died.

694
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:09,567
Do you want to argue among ourselves
before the blood even dries?

695
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:12,933
We haven't even gotten close to the culprit.

696
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:17,933
If another dies as we speak, then...

697
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:21,633
It's not just you who's struggling.
We're all exhausted.

698
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:23,333
All of us.

699
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:29,400
