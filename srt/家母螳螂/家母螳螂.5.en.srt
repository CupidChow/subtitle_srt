1
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

3
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,655
FEBRUARY 16, 2002

4
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,700
INTERROGATION ROOM,
WOONGSAN POLICE STATION

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,162
We first met
at the public health center, didn't we?

6
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,291
I was there to check
Song Byeong-cheol's body.

7
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,755
All the onlookers on site

8
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,882
had terrified looks on their faces.

9
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,884
However,

10
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,722
there was one young woman
with a twinkle in her eyes

11
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,683
<i>as she observed the crime scene.</i>

12
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,271
In front of the bathhouse,

13
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,608
and in front of Sataek Apartments,

14
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>you had the same look,</i>

15
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,279
every time I saw you.

16
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,532
I began to wonder…

17
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,743
…why you were like that.

18
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,247
So it's just speculation.

19
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,207
That is why I started

20
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,751
to just follow you around.

21
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,877
Really?

22
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,138
A hairpin that resembles
the one you always wore

23
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,056
was discovered

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,558
<i>at the crime scene.</i>

25
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:23,893
<i>I don't see yours now.</i>

26
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,479
Did you lose it?

27
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,617
As you walk down the street,

28
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,997
you see a man drag his wife
to the front of their home to beat her up.

29
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,042
It's a common sight in these parts.

30
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,170
So you stop the man,

31
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,506
and help the terrified woman.

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,632
Even after all that,

33
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,553
you continue circling the area,
refusing to leave.

34
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,307
Ring, ring.

35
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,357
You were like that every time I saw you.

36
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,276
Nothing better to do?

37
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,069
Maybe you had time to waste?

38
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,364
For what reason?

39
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,700
I grew curious.

40
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,494
I wondered what kind of person you were.

41
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,665
I just kept watching you from afar.

42
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,431
The first condition involving my son
is the most important.

43
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,269
Please change his name,
including his surname.

44
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,442
This is unreasonable,

45
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,903
and beyond my authority.

46
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,614
Then, pass it along
to the person with that authority.

47
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,206
I lost it on the beach.

48
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,334
Also, Detective Choi, these hairpins are

49
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,088
readily available at Mimi's General Store
near the marketplace.

50
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,297
The very same ones.

51
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,591
The big ones cost 2,000 won,
small ones 1,000 won.

52
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,557
And there's one more thing.

53
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,147
I am going to need you
to look after Jeong-ho, my son,

54
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,526
until he reaches adulthood.

55
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,610
Pardon?

56
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,488
"The inherent compassion
of the human heart."

57
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,995
Humans have the ability to show sympathy
to a complete stranger,

58
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,955
fueled by a sense of tender mercy.

59
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,377
That's what I hear.

60
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,215
I want you to instill
that sensibility in Jeong-ho.

61
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,718
Help me

62
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,636
make that child

63
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,639
take after you.

64
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,873
I was…

65
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,918
I apologize.

66
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,755
I was under the impression
his mother had passed.

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,841
You weren't wrong.

68
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,928
I am dead to him.

69
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,517
It has been six hours already.

70
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,728
She was after Seo Gu-wan.

71
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,857
How did Jeong I-shin
find out about that hospital?

72
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,736
She had been there before
and she knows me well.

73
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,407
She probably assumed
I would try to sequester him.

74
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,036
Seo Gu-wan!

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,417
How could I be so dumb?

76
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:21,089
I never thought Jeong I-shin
would know how to drive.

77
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,924
Damn it.

78
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,427
How could I have known
so little about her?

79
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,055
If she had killed Seo,

80
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,224
that means she fled
the Gwanghyeon-dong crime scene,

81
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,267
and found refuge somewhere.

82
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,230
Where could she have gone?

83
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,452
It was abandoned about 1 km away
from the crash site.

84
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,205
The memory card from the dashcam
is nowhere to be found.

85
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,832
The vehicle was reported stolen

86
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,085
near Gwanghyeon Jeil Hospital
around 10 p.m. last night.

87
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,640
Are you hungry, by any chance?
I could make some toast.

88
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,599
Jung-yeon.

89
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,601
-Hey, Su-yeol.
-Get back.

90
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,233
Are you kidding me?

91
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,278
The forgotten serial killer
everyone thought was dead

92
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,946
is perfectly alive
and running around out there.

93
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,240
And what happens
if this leads to another victim?

94
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,825
To another incident?

95
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,035
Go and catch her right now.

96
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,248
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,001
What are you doing here?

98
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,628
Don't say that.

99
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,130
She told me everything.

100
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,303
She knows I abandoned you
after your father died,

101
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,973
and that I lived in hiding
after using that bus accident

102
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,017
and sham gravesite to fake my own death.

103
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,144
Yes.

104
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,189
I told her everything.

105
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,036
Why did you come here?

106
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,371
She means nothing.

107
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,458
I wanted to meet the person
who was by your side.

108
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,168
I'm glad you did, Mother.

109
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,629
Su-yeol, sit.
You can talk sitting down.

110
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,755
No.

111
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,507
She'll be leaving now.

112
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,716
You are, right?

113
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,468
Let's go.

114
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,553
Su-yeol, don't.

115
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,264
She needs to go, Jung-yeon.

116
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,225
I do.

117
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,519
I should go.

118
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,733
Wait, Mother…

119
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,822
Go.

120
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,962
Sir, what's the matter?

121
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,797
You look terrible.

122
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,590
Right.

123
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,133
Gather around.

124
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,103
Walk down.

125
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,231
Slowly.

126
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,788
There's something I've been meaning
to apologize to you all for.

127
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,338
SECURED JEONG. TRANSPORTING HER
TO CONTAINMENT RESIDENCE

128
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,927
Sulking to smiling in an instant.

129
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,722
Did you invest in some bitcoins? Stocks?

130
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,182
If he had invested in them,

131
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,601
he would remain sulking.

132
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,685
That's true.

133
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,021
What?

134
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,231
You said you wanted
to apologize for something.

135
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,568
It's just…

136
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,780
I know the team had been pushing
for Detective Kim

137
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,408
to become the squad leader
for a long time now.

138
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,037
I also believed that would be
the best for our team,

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,496
and was going to promote her,

140
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,165
but it didn't work out.

141
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,170
I don't believe I have ever
officially apologized for that.

142
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,548
Once we close this case,
I'll revisit that matter.

143
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,843
Though you may be disappointed for now,

144
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:40,681
I do hope you can support
Captain Cha for the time being.

145
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,808
That's all.

146
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,400
Menopause.

147
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,443
Right.

148
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,490
Goodness, Chief Choi…

149
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,589
Hold on.

150
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,841
Thanks.

151
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,009
And sorry.

152
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,439
Are you worried about Jung-yeon?

153
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,274
You dare slither into my home

154
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,819
after you kill Seo Gu-wan?

155
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,654
Seo Gu-wan

156
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,948
is dead?

157
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,741
You're going to play dumb?

158
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,535
You escaped,

159
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,870
stole a car from the hospital,
and went to my place.

160
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,664
The timeline and route align perfectly.

161
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,166
I heard you don't want to have a baby.

162
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,919
Why?

163
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,380
Are you afraid they will take after me?

164
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,679
Tell me about
how you killed Seo Gu-wan first.

165
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,306
How? Why'd you kill him?

166
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,101
You just decided to run him over?

167
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,895
He threatened you.

168
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,939
That warrants death, just like your daddy.

169
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,568
<i>You…</i>

170
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,820
want me dead too, don't you?

171
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,905
You…

172
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,534
are just like your mother.

173
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,996
Did you kill Seo Gu-wan?

174
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,914
You tell me first.

175
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,874
How does it feel?

176
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,376
Are you sad

177
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,878
that he died?

178
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,920
Do you pity him?

179
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,798
Or, perhaps…

180
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,968
Are you not the slightest bit relieved?

181
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,470
Now,

182
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,763
it is safe.

183
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,307
Damn it.

184
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,652
What did she say?

185
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,322
She refuses to fess up to it.

186
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,827
No one saw the driver inside the vehicle.

187
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,079
She knows there is no evidence.

188
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,458
But still, we managed to catch her.

189
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
You can go home now.

190
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,754
Sir.

191
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,838
Yes?

192
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,510
Do I…

193
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,472
take after her?

194
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,183
What?

195
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,477
That woman.

196
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,525
What are you talking about?

197
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,777
You're nothing like her.

198
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,762
Su-yeol.

199
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,766
If it's about Jeong I-shin,
I'd rather not hear it.

200
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,895
It's about you.

201
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,736
You sometimes call out
for your mom in your sleep.

202
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,820
You know that, right?

203
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,990
It's a nightmare I have often.

204
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,534
It didn't sound like a nightmare.

205
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,539
You sounded like you missed her.

206
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,675
Lie down comfortably.

207
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,189
Sleep some more.

208
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,066
Rest up.

209
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,985
You need to catch more bad guys tomorrow.

210
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,392
TO MR. CHA SU-YEOL

211
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,727
-<i>Is he dead?</i>
<i>-He's alive. He's talking.</i>

212
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,896
<i>Should we call the police?</i>
<i>Stop recording.</i>

213
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,648
<i>The ones here might need this as evidence.</i>

214
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,441
<i>I'm scared. Let's go.</i>

215
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,448
<i>Do you want to do this while his blood</i>
<i>is still fresh on our hands?</i>

216
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,826
<i>And what happens</i>

217
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,036
if someone else dies before we do?

218
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,204
<i>What then?</i>

219
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,249
Hey.

220
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,002
What now?

221
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,425
Damn it.

222
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
Leave it.

223
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,807
The M.O. mentioned in his webtoon is
identical to the method used in the crime.

224
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,475
Even his place was a Mantis shrine.

225
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,852
And we're just letting him go?

226
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,895
Think about how that makes us look.

227
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,814
Forget interrogation.

228
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,691
Never even got a proper look at his face.

229
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,403
He and Chief Choi
are always so buddy-buddy,

230
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,570
doing whatever they want.

231
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,864
What choice do we have?

232
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:15,451
He has a solid alibi.

233
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,957
Are you just going to let him be?

234
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,794
What? Then, should I flop down
in front of the car to stop them?

235
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,546
No, I mean Captain Cha, that bastard.

236
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,841
I told you to watch your mouth.

237
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,802
Jeez.

238
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,182
Why so serious all of a sudden?
Are they friends or something?

239
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,231
Is Mom doing okay?

240
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,983
I can't comment on that.

241
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,360
You know my situation.

242
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,077
But I'm really curious about something.

243
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,162
Do you really not remember?

244
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,707
How we used to go to the beach
with her when we were little?

245
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,337
I don't.

246
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,797
Really?

247
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,595
That makes me sad.

248
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,972
So sad.

249
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,143
There we go.

250
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,395
Cheers.

251
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,736
We have all your favorites here, Ji-an.

252
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,323
Ji-an, I know you've had
a challenging workload recently.

253
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,449
Eat up and recharge.

254
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,452
I appreciate you treating me
to all these delicious treats,

255
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,580
but why are you treating me?
Park Min-jae was freed already.

256
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,502
You know, it seems you've gotten
pretty lazy since making sergeant.

257
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,838
I mean, are all freed people innocent?

258
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,714
Can we rule him out of the case now?

259
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,007
Dig into him properly.

260
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,552
Internet history, social media,

261
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,720
and the apps he's subscribed to.
Check everything.

262
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,807
I'm sure he's hiding something.

263
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,142
You know about my sixth sense.

264
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,686
My sixth sense is tingling right now.

265
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,146
Does Captain Cha know about this?

266
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,940
Yeah, Captain Cha…

267
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,443
Come on now.

268
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,403
Dearest Ji-an.

269
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,530
Don't be like that. Just help me out here.

270
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,781
Come on.

271
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,458
SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING

272
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,007
Go on. Get out.

273
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,468
Come on now.

274
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,472
You drove me here
because you had something to say.

275
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188
You…

276
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,357
are still a prime suspect in this case.

277
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,986
You must update me
if you ever decide to move

278
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,446
or travel long-distance.

279
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,074
Changing the subject, I see.

280
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,535
Don't worry.

281
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,080
I won't tell anyone about you and Mom.

282
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,588
This detective agency would crumble
if I weren't acutely perceptive.

283
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,385
And what sort of friendly officer
drives you home after questioning?

284
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,639
I know you did to give me
that warning for my sake.

285
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,020
Bro.

286
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,939
You know my dad, right?

287
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,525
The only childhood memories I have
are of him beating me up.

288
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,821
But I woke up one day…

289
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,034
and found myself beating him up.

290
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,209
Time is a very scary thing.

291
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,587
The man whom I was once terrified of

292
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,799
has become someone
I have to take care of now.

293
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,634
Mom may have become

294
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,304
someone you have to take care of now.

295
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,975
A lot of time has passed.

296
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,853
I'm just saying.

297
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:15,983
When that woman…

298
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,487
was there…

299
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,282
that night.

300
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,327
Do you think she was there

301
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,705
to kill your dad for your sake?

302
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,752
Did Mom say that?

303
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,337
That's not what happened.

304
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,340
She just killed those people
because she wanted to.

305
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,676
She wanted to kill,
but she couldn't just go out

306
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,261
and murder random people.

307
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,847
That's why she went out of her way
to find miscreants to kill.

308
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,181
And she rationalizes it

309
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,393
by saying those people deserved to die.

310
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,814
It's all for her sake, not yours.

311
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,401
So…

312
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,904
just forget about that woman.

313
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,490
I don't think I can see it that way.

314
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,541
I'm leaving. Get out.

315
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,296
Come on, Bro. Please…

316
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,842
Mom definitely loved you.

317
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,054
Why do you refuse to accept that?

318
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,599
Why do you keep pretending like
that never happened?

319
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,893
And whatever she did,

320
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,895
she's still your mom.

321
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,064
Get out.

322
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,318
Damn it.

323
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,490
You two are exactly alike.

324
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,624
Hey.

325
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,293
Say that again.

326
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,420
You're rationalizing too.

327
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,798
You're going out of your way
to demonize her.

328
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,008
Did you forget how many people she killed?

329
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,718
That's not who she was with me!

330
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,805
Nor was she like that with you.

331
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,889
Bro.

332
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,100
Just be honest.

333
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,143
You missed her.

334
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,062
But you can't admit it. Why?

335
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,272
Because missing someone
who abandoned you

336
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,899
only leads you to more suffering.

337
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,069
That's why you make her out
to be someone you can't miss.

338
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,821
You cast her as the devil.

339
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,030
But you know what?

340
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,074
That's what you call rationalization.

341
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,409
Mom's not the one rationalizing, you are.

342
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,746
That's some real bullshit.

343
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,165
So what if she's my mom?

344
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,292
Does that mean
she can commit heinous murders,

345
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,335
but I'm required

346
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,380
to empathize, cherish, and miss her
just because she's my mom?

347
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,048
Am I?

348
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,509
You think that's humane?

349
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,012
Get your shit together.

350
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,806
Okay?

351
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,977
Stop idolizing
that despicable serial killer…

352
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,690
and try to live a normal life.

353
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,639
Catch my son's killer!

354
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,767
All you do is waste taxpayers' money.

355
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,727
Jesus.

356
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,936
Hurry up and drive.

357
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,273
What a mess.

358
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,653
This case may end up
going to headquarters.

359
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,322
Jeong I-shin

360
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,575
only agreed to consult with Captain Cha.

361
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,827
If a new team takes over--

362
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,995
What about her?

363
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,080
After I jumped through hoops
to get her for you,

364
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,541
you couldn't even get me
a composite sketch.

365
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,211
I also need something
to show off in front of the higher-ups.

366
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,671
If a new team takes over,
it'll just lead to more people

367
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,423
finding out about Jeong's situation.

368
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,800
Please give us a little more time.

369
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,888
There's no one else who understands
the copycat killer better than her.

370
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,974
You'd better not be
empty-handed next time.

371
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,768
Thank you, sir.

372
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,940
The culprit even knows
that Jeong I-shin killed her husband.

373
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,109
That wasn't even revealed
to the police 23 years ago.

374
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,445
I guess… maybe Seo Gu-wan?

375
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,405
He seemed to have an inkling,

376
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,950
but considering he kept
no other record of it,

377
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,660
I don't think he knew much.

378
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,913
If Seo did know everything,

379
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:43,124
he would've at least hung
a picture of my father under "zero."

380
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,254
Who could it be?

381
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,256
How do they know

382
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,342
everything about Jeong I-shin's crimes?

383
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,303
It must be someone

384
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,139
who Jeong intentionally shared
her secret past with.

385
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,434
I already checked with Anwon Prison.

386
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,688
The only one
who had contact with her was Seo.

387
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:08,650
And the only people she ever
wrote letters to or communicated with

388
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,819
were you and Seo Gu-wan

389
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,529
for the past 23 years.

390
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,449
Then someone else must have known
the truth, including that incident.

391
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,957
Her first murder
where she killed her husband.

392
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,042
Is there anyone else who would've

393
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,128
known about that?

394
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,173
Wait.

395
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,635
There's that psychiatrist
who assessed her mental state

396
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,096
immediately after she was arrested.

397
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,390
She was on a business trip last time.

398
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,475
That doctor?

399
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,439
Are you suggesting that the doctor
talked about Jeong to someone else?

400
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,608
Breaking doctor-patient confidentiality
in the process?

401
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,279
Even if she had, the healthcare laws…

402
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,034
Damn it. I don't know.
We'll never get that warrant.

403
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,371
Let's just go and see her.

404
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,706
What about the warrant?

405
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,958
Hey.

406
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,376
Su-yeol.

407
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,506
RAYEON CERAMIC STUDIO

408
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,991
Hey, Min-jae.

409
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,952
Hello.

410
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,330
You must be here to see Ah-ra.

411
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,998
-Yes.
-Come inside for a cup of tea.

412
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,249
No, that won't be necessary.

413
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,627
Some shady guy
in the workplace of two lovely women?

414
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,961
That'd be just wrong.

415
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,881
Go inside. It's cold.

416
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,759
Wait, Min-jae.

417
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,843
Yes?

418
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,349
When Su-yeol was little
and living with his mother,

419
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,935
what was their relationship like?

420
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,107
Just your typical mother and son.

421
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,402
Like adoring one another

422
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,904
and protecting each other?

423
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,282
Right.

424
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,535
That was just everyday life for them,

425
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,454
but from the outside, they looked happy.

426
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,581
Something like that.

427
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,710
-I should get going.
-Okay.

428
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,764
MIND LOVE PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

429
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,849
The thing is,

430
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,977
this would be an essential lead for us.

431
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,938
Has Jeong I-shin ever discussed

432
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:55,066
murdering her husband with you?

433
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,445
Surely, you must be aware of the oath

434
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,738
that physicians take.

435
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,450
Yes, I am. But…

436
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,037
This is quite a crucial issue for us.

437
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,461
If, by chance, you divulged
such information to someone else--

438
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,963
I have patients waiting.

439
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,427
Did you bring a warrant?

440
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,095
Well, you see…

441
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,099
-Then, I think we're done here.
-I told you I was in pain! I'm in pain!

442
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,477
Don't worry. It happens sometimes.

443
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,561
I see.

444
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:37,108
-Excuse me for a moment.
-Should I have predicted I'd be sick?

445
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,319
Nurse Park.

446
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,365
Nurse Park, does he have
a history of treatment with us?

447
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,994
-Sir, could you give me your name?
-I'm in so much pain!

448
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,412
PATIENT THERAPY RECORDS

449
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,415
Why do you want to know my name?

450
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,459
That is my private data!

451
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,461
This won't do.

452
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,756
Call security right now.
And the police, if you must.

453
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,009
Sir, you need to tell us
what's exactly bothering you.

454
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,720
My head feels like it's splitting open.

455
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,431
I'm in so much pain!

456
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,391
I guess I have to come back

457
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,519
with the proper documentation.

458
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,238
My goodness.

459
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,614
I really put on a show.

460
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,408
If you stalled a bit more,
I could've copied everything.

461
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,119
Damn it.
Security just popped out of nowhere.

462
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,789
Just imagine how it'd make me look
if I got caught by them.

463
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,458
Well done.

464
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,293
I hope we got something useful.

465
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:43,341
It seems Jeong I-shin
did talk about her first murder.

466
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,969
Even about how it was impulsive.

467
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,136
But there's no way

468
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,973
for us to make the doctor talk about
who she shared that with.

469
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,975
They won't issue a warrant for this.

470
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,769
We also must consider the possibility

471
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,647
that it wasn't her,
but someone else who stole these records.

472
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,607
-Let me see.
-Sure.

473
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,036
-Sir.
-Yeah?

474
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,747
Do you think this is right?

475
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,915
What do you mean?

476
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,293
You and I working alone like this.

477
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,212
Maybe it'd be better for the investigation

478
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,755
if we share

479
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,425
everything about Jeong I-shin
with the team and get their help?

480
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,718
You think

481
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,762
they'd "help out" the captain
who's been lying to them this whole time?

482
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,099
You're just setting yourself up
for your own downfall.

483
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,271
You're not the only one suffering.

484
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,231
This is hard on all of us.

485
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,817
Us.

486
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,321
We'll be exposed eventually.

487
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,615
And when that happens,

488
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,327
remember Detective Kim
is a true police officer.

489
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,579
She has a good command
of the team as well.

490
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,748
I'm sure she'll do a good job.

491
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,295
It ends with her talking
about her childhood.

492
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,338
Sir.

493
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,923
What is this?

494
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,424
I-shin's mother…

495
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,136
So your maternal grandmother.

496
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,097
It says she died
while Jeong I-shin watched.

497
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,484
JUSIN CHURCH

498
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,786
That night…

499
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,913
<i>Mom!</i>

500
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,331
<i>…a fire broke out at our house.</i>

501
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,085
<i>Her mother never made it out.</i>

502
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,465
<i>When she heard</i>
<i>her mother cry out for help,</i>

503
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,636
she tried to run in there to save her.

504
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,473
I was scared.

505
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,183
So scared.

506
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,435
All I did

507
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,146
was hold onto that girl and stop her

508
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,232
from jumping into the fire.

509
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,986
I held onto her for dear life
until the end.

510
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,280
"I couldn't lose her too."

511
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,827
That was the only thought on my mind.

512
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,121
She…

513
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,000
clawed at me as she thrashed and wailed.

514
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,627
And after that day,

515
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,257
she shut me out.

516
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,385
<i>Maybe</i>

517
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,138
<i>seeing that happen to her mother</i>

518
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:41,227
<i>was what led her to commit</i>
<i>all those horrific deeds.</i>

519
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,740
It's all my fault.

520
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,617
If I had jumped into the fire

521
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:01,164
and just burned to death with her mother,

522
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,459
then all those innocent people
wouldn't have…

523
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,214
Pull yourself together.

524
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:12,550
So you're bound to become a serial killer

525
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:14,135
if you lose a parent in an accident?

526
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,012
Then, what about me?

527
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:18,347
No, that's not what I meant.

528
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:24,270
I remember.

529
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,149
The day that woman was arrested,

530
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,445
<i>I was alone at the police station.</i>

531
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,036
You must be Jeong-ho.

532
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,504
I'm your grandpa from your mother's side.

533
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,841
An old man I'd never met before showed up

534
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:56,677
and hugged me tightly.

535
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,305
Did I?

536
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,892
I was raised

537
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,647
by you and Chief Choi.

538
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,818
Jeong Hyun-nam and Choi Jung-ho.

539
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,030
You two are my parents.

540
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,745
<i>I don't want to.</i>

541
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,376
<i>-I can't.</i>
<i>-You're okay.</i>

542
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,379
<i>I'll be right by your side.</i>

543
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,049
<i>Go on. It's not hard.</i>

544
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,135
-Captain.
-Yes?

545
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,303
A courier just dropped this off for you.

546
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,639
What is it?

547
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,015
No idea.

548
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,023
TO MR. CHA SU-YEOL

549
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,825
It's a trending dating app called Amor.

550
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,578
Park Min-jae is a subscriber.

551
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,039
He follows this woman named Jo-i,

552
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,499
and she follows him back.

553
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,502
Are those really her pictures?

554
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,588
They look to be AI-generated.

555
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,632
She could have a different face
or she could even be a man.

556
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,217
So, what about her?

557
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,304
Look at Jo-i's list of followers.

558
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,222
Park wasn't the only one
she followed back.

559
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,516
Jeong Won-sik, the first victim,

560
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,518
along with Kang Su-cheol, Yoo Si-hyeon,

561
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,104
and even Kim Hyeon-u all followed Jo-i.

562
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,068
No way. We got the bastard.

563
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,778
We finally found the connection.
This--

564
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,863
What's that?

565
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,698
Well…

566
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,826
You punks.

567
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,911
Hold on a second.

568
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,997
Come on. This is as good as done.

569
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,999
We find the profile owner and arrest him.

570
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,918
Why hand over a done deal to the captain?

571
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,961
Hey, Bae Sung-gyu,
have you lost your mind?

572
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,380
This is a murder case.

573
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,549
Unity would barely be enough,

574
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,593
and you're busy splitting us up?

575
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,012
You agreed the captain
had a hidden agenda not too long ago.

576
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,096
Everyone.

577
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,765
I need you to see this.

578
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,867
How did it get here?

579
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,203
It was anonymously sent via courier.

580
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,789
I delivered it to the captain
after security cleared it.

581
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,000
The phone belonged to Kim Hyeon-u,
the Nodu Stream victim.

582
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,377
That crazy son of a bitch.

583
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,297
INCOMING
BLOCKED NUMBER

584
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,140
Hello?

585
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,394
<i>Deliver the phone to that woman.</i>

586
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,728
<i>You understand, right?</i>

587
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,649
I'm having trouble hearing you.
Can you speak a little louder?

588
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,777
<i>Don't pull any stupid shit.</i>
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

589
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,619
"That woman"? What is he talking about?

590
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,957
Well…

591
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,376
Captain.

592
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,461
Captain Cha, may I have a word?

593
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,754
We need to talk.

594
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,715
What the hell is this?

595
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,009
Do we look like idiots to you?

596
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,304
You two sneak off to whisper
about something every chance you get.

597
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,806
If you actually see us as a team,
have the discussion here.

598
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,393
Let's not do this.
I'll explain everything later.

599
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,979
-Captain Cha.
-Hold on.

600
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,832
Jeong I-shin…

601
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,586
has been aiding our investigation.

602
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,962
-Captain Cha.
-Chief Choi!

603
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,633
At this moment, we need to come together.

604
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,553
The culprit wants
to speak to Jeong directly.

605
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,221
Having them talk will lead to a clue.

606
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,557
This is our chance to catch the culprit.

607
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,851
We'll lose that chance
if we just do it alone.

608
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,188
Then, all the intel Captain Cha
has brought us until now--

609
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,815
The commissioner
wanted it kept confidential.

610
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,653
I'm sorry.

611
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,824
I'm also fully aware
that an apology won't be enough.

612
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,994
After secretly hoarding all that intel,

613
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,871
now you need us and ask for help?

614
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,332
Unbelievable.
And you call yourself the captain?

615
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,417
Damn it.

616
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,296
I knew the moment I saw you…

617
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,923
Forget it.

618
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,635
Good luck to you two.

619
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,059
Well?

620
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,061
You want to stay here and be disrespected?

621
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,190
Is that all?

622
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,988
-And Jeong I-shin--
-I did it.

623
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,532
I ordered him to do it.

624
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,866
I'm the one you should curse out.

625
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,370
No one can know that we're working

626
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,579
with the Mantis herself.

627
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,331
If any of this gets leaked to the media,

628
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,126
we'll all be done for. You know that.

629
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,129
I know you're all upset,

630
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,339
but curse me out and whatever else,
after we catch him.

631
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,174
Did you not hear me, Mr. Cha?

632
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,136
I asked if you are hiding
anything else from us.

633
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,768
No, I'm not.

634
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,114
It's a dating app.

635
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,157
A woman named Jo-i.

636
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,701
All four victims followed her profile.

637
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,369
-Detective Kim.
-Be quiet.

638
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,787
Damn it.

639
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,122
We're cracking the account.

640
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,542
There's a good chance one of her followers
will be the next victim.

641
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,214
Detective Kim.

642
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,800
Thank you.

643
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,934
Finally, we get to meet her,

644
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,686
the world-famous Mantis.

645
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,483
KIM NA-HEE

646
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,903
Let's head out.

647
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,905
Hyuk, can you grab my jacket?

648
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,656
Yes, sir.

649
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,788
Hey, wait.

650
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,303
You couldn't pick up one more?

651
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,639
Not one redeeming quality.

652
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,878
He's confident.

653
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,506
He believes he'll never be caught.

654
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,176
He originally replicated your M.O.
in the beginning,

655
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,637
but he has now started
adding his own touches,

656
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,931
like mirrors,

657
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,476
to inflict greater pain on his victims,
flaunting his violent tendencies.

658
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,478
Vanity and arrogance.

659
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,856
You want to provoke those inclinations
to cause him to slip up.

660
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,066
That's right.

661
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,614
Great minds think alike.

662
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,659
Where are we with Jo-i?

663
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,623
The app is based overseas,
so it's taking some time.

664
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,791
It'll be done soon.

665
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,005
Ms. Jeong.

666
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,591
He'll be calling soon.

667
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,260
This will be your chance

668
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,388
to repay, even in part,
for the crimes you've committed.

669
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,907
PARK MIN-JAE

670
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,578
SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING

671
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,347
Well, this is a surprise. I thought
you never wanted to see me again.

672
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,974
<i>Mr. Park Min-jae. This is Choi Jung-ho.</i>
<i>We met last time.</i>

673
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,519
You use a dating app called Amor,
don't you?

674
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,022
Yes, I do.

675
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,523
<i>By chance,</i>

676
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,568
have you ever chatted
with a woman named Jo-i?

677
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,653
Jo-i?

678
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,197
<i>Oh, right.</i>

679
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,866
Yes, she said she was a fan of my webtoon.

680
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,160
We never met in person, though.

681
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,497
If she ever contacts you again,
please let us know immediately.

682
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,375
Especially if you ever get
the chance to meet her.

683
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,294
But… why?

684
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,714
Hold on.

685
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,092
This must have something
to do with the case. Right?

686
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,387
<i>Wait. Hold on.</i>

687
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,224
Can you let Su-yeol know
he should call me himself

688
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,893
if he needs to talk to me in the future?

689
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:50,979
All right.

690
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:52,981
What did he say?

691
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,735
He said you should call him
yourself next time.

692
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,323
He's calling.

693
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,210
<i>Let me see your face.</i>

694
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,587
<i>I need to check</i>
<i>you're really Jeong I-shin.</i>

695
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,258
<i>It's nice to meet you, Ms. Jeong.</i>

696
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,969
Why are you imitating me?

697
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,054
<i>I just want</i>

698
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,558
<i>more people to know</i>
<i>about the things you have done.</i>

699
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,309
<i>Don't you think it's fun?</i>

700
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,394
The mirror

701
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,854
was a nice touch.

702
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,940
I only ever thought about torturing them

703
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,276
and killing them.

704
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,446
But you made them witness it
themselves until the end.

705
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,657
<i>It sounds like you have an audience.</i>

706
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,202
<i>I'm using a frequency converter,</i>
<i>so you won't be able to track me.</i>

707
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,665
What's next? That can't be the end.

708
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,584
<i>Today.</i>

709
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,294
<i>When the final scene ends,</i>

710
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,837
<i>so will his life.</i>

711
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,509
I'm envious.

712
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,137
It's been so long since I've had a taste.

713
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,848
<i>The inspiration behind all my performances</i>

714
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,101
<i>comes from you, Mantis.</i>

715
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,478
CALL HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED

716
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,272
Hold on. He said, "final scene."

717
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,691
"Final scene."

718
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,819
Does that make you think of anything?

719
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,990
Movies. Plays. Like a performance.

720
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,701
Take a look at the occupations
of Jo-i's followers.

721
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,750
KIM SEO-JUN

722
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,711
Kim Seo-jun, one of her followers,
is an opera singer.

723
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,004
<i>Tosca</i>.

724
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,756
It's today at Gwangju Arts Center.

725
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,549
Let's go.

726
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,801
That can't be it.

727
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,639
That would be too easy.
He's got something up his sleeve.

728
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,141
We need to check
if there's even the slightest doubt.

729
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,309
And I'm sure

730
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,895
Jo-i will also be cautious
with all the people around.

731
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,272
He doesn't care about any of that.

732
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,317
You must think like Jo-i.

733
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,401
That's how you catch him.

734
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,903
Or…

735
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,072
you could think like me.

736
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,387
TOSCA, AN OPERA BY PUCCINI
TICKET BOX

737
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,806
Hyuk, you guard the entrance.

738
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,975
The rest can keep an eye
on the performers.

739
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,102
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

740
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,607
SCARPIA, BARITONE,
KIM SEO-JUN

741
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,678
I wonder what I should do.

742
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,139
Should I help Su-yeol out?

743
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,477
Okay.

744
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,774
Jo-i…

745
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,651
Hello.

746
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,829
Please read it.

747
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,207
IT'S BEEN A WHILE

748
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,505
"CAVARADOSSI" DRESSING ROOM
LEE SA-YA

749
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,260
Excuse me. I'm with the police.

750
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,434
Updates.

751
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,728
The backstage corridor has been secured.

752
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,526
Access restricted
from dressing rooms to the entrance.

753
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,695
Checking the audience members.

754
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,905
Nothing to report yet.

755
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,046
The second act is almost over.

756
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,881
Kim Seo-jun doesn't appear
in the third act.

757
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,884
He'll soon be stabbed
with the dagger on the table.

758
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,720
Working on my webtoon.

759
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,640
Even if no one is reading it. Send.

760
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,981
YOU HAVE ME.
AM I NOT A PERSON? AM I AI?

761
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,233
Sorry.

762
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,444
Maybe.

763
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,824
WHAT?

764
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,409
How could I be sure

765
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,703
unless you're standing in front of me?

766
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,996
The app might be using AI

767
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,582
to increase subscribers.

768
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,334
I think that sounds plausible.

769
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,759
Come on. Take the bait. Go on.

770
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,981
What?

771
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,238
He's going to do it in front
of all these people watching?

772
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,824
That's not the Mantis's style.

773
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,161
But--

774
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,328
A life is on the line.

775
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,789
We have no other choice.

776
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,172
Do you have stage access?

777
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,226
Hello. I'm with the police.

778
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,062
I just need to check this.

779
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,191
Keep up the good work.

780
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,253
HOW CAN I CLEAR MY NAME?

781
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,297
Come here.

782
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,387
SERIOUSLY?
THAT'S WHERE WE END UP?

783
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,890
You said you were a fan of my work.

784
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,810
This is your chance to be the first

785
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,521
to read how my webtoon ends.

786
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,693
Take the bait. Go on.

787
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,463
Secure Kim Seo-jun.

788
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:19,219
<i>We will now have a 20-minute intermission.</i>

789
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,138
<i>The performance will resume</i>
<i>in exactly 20 minutes.</i>

790
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:26,017
<i>Please enjoy this break</i>
<i>and return to your seats promptly.</i>

791
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,397
<i>Please return to your seats on time</i>
<i>to ensure the show can run smoothly.</i>

792
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,865
Wait, where did Mr. Kim Seo-jun go?

793
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,991
Where is he?

794
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:42,951
Oh, he's gone.

795
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:43,869
Who cares?

796
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,370
What?

797
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,748
Where's Kim Seo-jun?

798
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,918
He was just there, but he disappeared.

799
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,674
Kim is not in the third act.

800
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,301
We must spread out and find him.

801
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,764
Sir, it seems Kim left in a hurry
without even taking his makeup off,

802
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,600
and just a mask on his face.

803
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,483
He's nowhere to be found.

804
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,663
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

805
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,125
Okay!

806
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,794
WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS?

807
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,715
68 HYEON-RO, SEOYEON-DONG,
NAMGWANG-GU, GWANGJU

808
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,342
I'LL BE THERE IN AN HOUR

809
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,343
Yes!

810
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,764
I'm a genius.

811
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,236
PARK MIN-JAE

812
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,824
Never there when you need him.

813
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,514
Outside parking lot.

814
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,140
<i>Kim Seo-jun spotted. Come here.</i>

815
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,771
Kim Seo-jun!

816
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,898
Stop right there!

817
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,985
Stop!

818
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,283
JO-I IS ON THE WAY TO MY STUDIO
COME AND CATCH HER

819
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,536
Hey!

820
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,417
You got me. I surrender.

821
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,797
What?

822
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,257
What's this?

823
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,511
I DID JUST AS JEONG I-SHIN DID.
YOU NEED TO TREAT ME THE SAME.

824
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,570
Damn it. What's going on?

825
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,448
We'll be taking this.

826
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,241
Let's happily learn our lesson now.

827
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,617
Mr. Kim Seo-jun.

828
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:33,496
You're under arrest
for illegal narcotics use and possession.

829
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,418
JO-I IS ON THE WAY TO MY STUDIO
COME AND CATCH HER

830
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,687
SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING

831
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,453
Back then…

832
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,458
why didn't you tell me?

833
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,545
About your husband.

834
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,422
The well.

835
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,050
Your first murder.

836
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,720
You didn't ask.

837
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:35,225
Aside from the five that were discovered,

838
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,727
you never asked about anything else

839
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,356
as if doing so would infringe
on my privacy.

840
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,742
I heard you visited

841
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,620
Park Eon-bae,

842
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,082
Park Min-jae's father,
to kill him back then.

843
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,849
I just don't know

844
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,397
what I've been doing up until now.

845
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:26,818
Tell me.

846
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:32,365
What else is there?
Exactly how many more are out there?

847
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,702
I know it's late…

848
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,038
but let me still ask now.

849
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,374
Chief Choi,

850
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,836
you have always trusted people so easily,
back then and even now.

851
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,214
That's your issue.

852
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,594
You wanted to help me back then as well.

853
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:54,804
I remember.

854
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,390
Park Eon-bae.

855
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,395
Were you really planning to kill him?

856
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,861
That kid was always
lingering around our place.

857
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,030
Min-jae.

858
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,698
Park Min-jae.

859
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,911
When he looked like he was starving,
I would feed him.

860
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,164
When his face was covered in soot,
I would bathe him.

861
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,290
I even played with him.

862
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,295
But he was always desperately
yearning for something.

863
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,107
Min-jae!

864
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,028
This is Detective Kim Na-hee
of Nambu Police.

865
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,155
-Please send an ambulance to 68 Hyeon-ro.
-Min-jae!

866
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,622
Min-jae.

867
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,542
Min-jae, you need to wake up.

868
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,834
Who did this to you?

869
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,670
Who did this to you?

870
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:09,754
Min-jae.

871
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,472
Min-jae.

872
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:21,641
Bro.

873
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,851
Min-jae, you need to wake up.

874
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,229
It'll arrive in five minutes.

875
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,902
Min-jae, you can't die.

876
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,654
Wake up!

877
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,198
You need to wake up, Min-jae!

878
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,317
Please help me.

879
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,320
<i>I will think like Jeong I-shin</i>
<i>and act like Jeong I-shin.</i>

880
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,237
<i>Hey.</i>

881
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,614
<i>Kang Yeong-ho</i>
<i>from the coal miners' housing.</i>

882
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,407
<i>His nose was seared with a hot spoon,</i>

883
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,159
<i>before bleeding to death.</i>

884
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,243
<i>You know this song, don't you?</i>

885
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,830
<i>He even hummed</i>
<i>the same song from 23 years ago.</i>

886
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,665
<i>The victim is already in danger.</i>

887
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,500
He will end up dead at this rate!

888
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,754
Some bloodshed will be inevitable
if we want to catch the culprit.

889
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,922
<i>We have no need for a captain</i>
<i>who has no interest</i>

890
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,507
<i>in keeping victims alive.</i>

891
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,467
<i>Please leave.</i>
