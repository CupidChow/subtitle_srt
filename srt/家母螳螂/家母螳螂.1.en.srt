position is vacant, right?

Yes.

00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:54,100

would be perfect for it.

- Manager Kim?
- Yes.

as team leader already,

208

If we don't catch the killer
now, more victims will follow.

368
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,367
We have to act before it blows up.

think carefully.

Jung I Sin agreed to help with this case.

379
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,967
But Jung I Sin...

380
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,600
wants to communicate only through you.

381
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,467
Huh?

382
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,967
What are you doing?

383
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,367

385
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:54,300
Wait, you said this was hard to get.

386
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,867
I did.

387
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:58,267
But I was blaming the soil too much.

388
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,500
The color doesn't come out because of this soil,

389
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,800
and the texture is rough because of that soil...

390
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,333
Actually, it's my skill that's the problem, right?

391
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,333
Should I just throw it all away?

392
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,467
No, no...

393
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,500

00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:30,367
you should be a cop.

00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,300
Since five people have died,

408
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,167
you need to save five people.

412
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,467
I heard the victim was decapitated. Is that true?

413
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,300
Could this be the same perpetrator
as the Noducheon murder?

414

Since this is an ongoing investigation,

415
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,800
we'll hold an official briefing.

416
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,100

Look at the neck incision here.

The clean cut suggests
it was done in one swift strike.

00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:34,900
This is different from how I did it.

507
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,467
I used a saw.

00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,533
When the saw blade

509
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:40,933

This guy doesn't seem to know that kind of thrill.

513
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,067
With an axe, it'd be a man, right?

514
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:57,033
Judging by his strength, seems so.

515
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,833
You need to tell me something new,

00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:05,200

and there's the smell of blood,
or something like that?

537
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,400
Is it wrong to get excited by the smell of blood?

00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,433
I love it.

551
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:41,767
That's the smell when you enter the world.

552
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,467
I see.

553
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,767
But here's the thing.

554
00:32:56,833 --> 00:33:00,400
I've met countless criminals,

555
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,567
but as a cop, I don't care
about their lives or memories.

556
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,267
Ms. Jung I Sin,

557
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:09,067
who particularly enjoys blood scent.

558
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:10,767
I'll examine more photos.

559
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:13,100
I'll take my leave for today.

560
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,133
Let's go.

561
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:16,900
Can I see

562
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,300
the crime scene?

563
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,660
I mean, something came to mind

564
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,633
and I want to confirm it.

565
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,233
Feed me.

566
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:47,567
Whether it's 23 years or 230, people won't change.

567
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,767
They enjoy all the benefits of the system,
yet show no remorse. You saw earlier, right?

568
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,500
Like people on a picnic,

569
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,433
she exploits our vulnerable position,

570
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:58,233
drags out time, and just tries to have her fun.

571
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:59,800
Whatever it takes,

572
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,900
I just need to catch the killer.

573
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,300
If we spend the time catering to that woman,
nothing gets done.

574
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,833
Will you really take her to the scene?

575
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,600
Of course I will.

576
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,200
Jung I Sin...

577
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,800
She's not doing this for fresh air.

578
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,100
23 years ago,

579
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,500
among Jung I Sin's murders,

580
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,667
I only had evidence for one case.

581
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,733
And even then, it was just
circumstantial, no hard proof.

582
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:41,700
The whole country was
caught up in World Cup fever,

583
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,533
and news of serial killings
was a huge political burden.

584
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,767
Politicians were calling me every day,

585
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:50,267
and in desperation, I clung to
that flimsy suspicion like a rotten lifeline.

586
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,967
That's how

587
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,433
I arrested Jung I Sin.

588
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The moment I put the cuffs on her,

589
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,633
she smirked at me.

590
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:02,133
As if

591
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,033
she had known this day would come all along.

592
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,233
Since I had nothing but circumstantial evidence,

593
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,567
I desperately needed her confession.

594
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:14,333
And Jung I Sin knew it, too.

595
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,000
We had

596
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,267
no choice

597
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,533
but to meet her demands...

598
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,233
Solitary cell,

599
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,733
music,

600
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,400
coffee...

601
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,933
Yeah,

602
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:30,000
and more...

603
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,667
Anyway, Jung I Sin

604
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,500
might make a deal,

605
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,100
but she was never a woman who owed anyone.

606
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,867
Eun Ae.

607
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:46,167
Oh my.

608
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:49,133
She's making herself right at home.

609
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,300
Sorry for asking this suddenly.

610
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,300
They said there's no space at the facility.

611
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,967
Please just take care of her until one opens up.

612
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,833
What's there to be sorry about?

613
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,900
She's adorable,

614
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,467
and the house felt too quiet anyway.

615
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:06,467
It's nice remembering old times.

616
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:08,767
But, you're always taking a handful of pills.

617
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:10,533
An old body like mine
isn't anything to fuss about.

618
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:11,967
Whenever something bad happens,

619
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,467
if there's a kid involved,

620
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:15,200
that kid's

621
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,167
always the biggest victim.

622
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,933
Here we go again.

623
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:22,433
A millionth time hearing this.

624
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,167
I didn't put much in here,
since it's just the two of you.

625
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,500
The corn was frozen right after picking,

626
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,300
so make sure you put it straight in the freezer.

627
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm leaving.

628
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,467
Stay for a meal at least.
You came all the way here.

629
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,200
No, I should go.

630
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,033
I still need to get Eun Ae fed.

631
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:43,800
She may look cheerful,
always laughing and playing,

632
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
but sometimes she says strange things.

633
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,967
Her mental state isn't good.

634
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:48,967
What kind of strange things?

635
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,033
She said someone tried to shoot her mother.

636
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,700
This isn't even America.

637
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,133
Anyway, don't worry.

638
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:57,333
I'll go now. Don't bother seeing me out.

639
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:04,133
The kid is telling the truth.

640
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,433
What do you think?

641
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:08,700
The color's different, right?

642
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,333
You're saying this is really your work?

643
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,300
I told you it is.

644
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:18,600
No way. Absolutely not.

645
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,400
Wait,

646
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,733
I need to step outside and check it in the light.

647
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,900
Oh, I see.

648
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,067
You switched the clay, didn't you?

649
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:33,200
What soil?

650
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,133
Why does the texture feel completely different?

651
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:37,900
I changed the clay too,

652
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,200
but it's like...

653
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,300
I changed my whole mindset.

654
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:43,967
The color's nice too, right?

655
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,367
Yeah, it's beautiful.

656
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,367
Huh?

657
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,233
[Jusin Church]
Has Grandpa come?

658
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,233
Oh, wait.

659
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,267
I got so angry suddenly...

660
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:01,000
The kid could've gotten hurt.

661
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,867
Su Yeol,

662
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,900
but you saved Eun Ae.

663
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,433
No, that's not it.

664
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,700
It's not the first time.

665
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,000
And I hate

666
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,200
that about myself.

667
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,433
It's okay.

668
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,433
It's fine.

669
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:24,600
I met her.

670
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,000
Eun Ae's mom?

671
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,267
I...

672
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:30,300
still have nightmares.

673
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,733
What?

674
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:34,467
That woman,

675
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,967
stabbing,

676
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,000
cutting people...

677
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,433
Su Yeol.

678
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:40,967
Laughing...

679
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,067
Why did you meet her?

680
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:52,567
You know there's been a murder lately, right?

681
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,300
Some insane person

682
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,800
is copying exactly what she did back then.

683
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,100
That's why

684
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,267
I needed her cooperation.

685
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,467
No!

686
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,833
Are you the only police in Korea?

687
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,467
You said you still have nightmares.

688
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:11,300
Don't worry.

689
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,333
I'm not a child anymore,

690
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:18,000
and it happened 23 years ago.

691
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,833
The terrifying woman

692
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,667
who killed people and laughed in front of me,

693
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:23,867
now she's just

694
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,700
an old,

695
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,800
insignificant criminal.

696
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Confirming that

697
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
could make me

698
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:36,867
feel better, right?

699
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,867
You won't feel better.

700
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:40,967
What she did...

701
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:43,467
She is pure evil.

702
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:46,533
No one meets a devil and feels at ease.

703
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:48,667
Never,

704
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:50,000
never meet her again.

705
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,233
Once is enough.

706
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,733
Got it?

707
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:56,600
Well...

708
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:15,400
Why?

709
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,233
Is someone there?

710
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:18,733
No.

711
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:21,400
I'm fine. I can still walk.

712
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,367
I'm leaving now, so go on inside.

713
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,233
I'll eat what you brought. Thank you.

714
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,933
Alright.

715
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,233
No.

716
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:36,000
He already said no before.

717
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,633
So if he says no, that's it?

718
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:41,033
There's no other way now, is there?

719
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:43,667
Let's just push through...

720
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,100
Hey, wait up.

721
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:49,600
Hey, hey, Manager Kim.

722
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:53,688
[Trusted and Beloved Southern
Provincial Police by the Residents]

723
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,280

724
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,304
Yes?

725
00:41:58,304 --> 00:42:00,400
I'll ask you one more time.

726
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,267
Please let me meet Jung I Sin.

727
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:06,733
The culprit is replicating Jung I Sin's crimes
down to the smallest details.

728
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,733
We'll definitely find something useful.

00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:09,900
Ugh.

730
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,867
I believe I already answered.

731
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:19,400
But...

732
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,700
Please reconsider just once.

Section Chief, if you'll permit me,

734
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:26,467
I'll prepare an interrogation questionnaire.

735
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,367
Oh my.

00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:30,700
I told you,

737
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,933
just informing you that Jung I Sin is alive
already puts pressure on upper management.

738
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:37,933
At the very least, the people
actually investigating need to know.

739
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:42,133
I had to push hard
to even get this much information to you.

740
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,267
Hey, but if you keep acting
like this, what does that make me?

741
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:47,667
If that's the case, why did
you even tell us she's alive?

742
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,900
Isn't it because you were
worried too, Section Chief?

743
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,867
[Violent Crimes Unit]

744
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,733
What if she wants to?

745
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,533
All criminals are the same.

746
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:05,300
They itch to brag about their crimes.

747
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,800
Scratch their ego a bit,

748
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,833
and they'll spill everything 100%.

749
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:12,633
Then, let us at least request cooperation once...

750
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:16,933
Oh, come in.

751
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,800
Alright, everyone's attention.

752
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,304
Starting today, we have new inspector, Cha Su Yeol.

753
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,433
Huh?

754
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:29,767
But, you said we wouldn't get replacements...

755
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,467
How do you do?

756
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:33,633
I'm Cha Su Yeol, your new team leader.

757
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:35,833
I look forward to working with you.

758
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:38,333
Since he was suddenly
appointed, it'll be hard to adapt,

759
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,700
so give him lots of support, okay?

760
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,867
Nice to meet you.

761
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:50,467
I'm Kim Na Hui.

762
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:52,267
I'm Cha Su Yeol.

763
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,667
What are you all doing?

764
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,533
Uh...

765
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,467
Who are you?

766
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,733
Jung I Sin injects victims
with anesthesia to restrain their bodies,

767
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:07,867
and when they wake up, she kills them
through brutal acts like dismemberment.

768
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:10,200
She deliberately inflicts
pain before killing them,

769
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,233
going through such a troublesome process...

770
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,700
Excuse me,

771
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,833
just a moment.

772
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:18,900
Could we see the photos
from the second murder again?

773
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,000
Yes.

774
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,567
[Sincerity Express Murder]

775
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:23,433
Yes, right there.

776
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,500
That mirror there.

777
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,767
There was no mirror
in the murder 23 years ago, right?

778
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,267
Yes, we thought that was unusual too.

779
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,333
The perpetrator

780
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:37,233
probably wanted the victim
to see themselves dying.

781
00:44:38,233 --> 00:44:41,433
There was no mirror during
the first Riverside murder,

782
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:44,567
and this is the first time
a mirror was used here....

783
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:46,533
Then,

784
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:48,633
wouldn't that suggest the guy isn't just copying,

785
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:51,700
but adding his own style, showing off somehow?

786
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,900
You could think that,
but this is a moving warehouse,

787
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,600
and that mirror was already there.

788
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,167
In its current position?

789
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,567
We didn't check...

790
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,700
You should've checked for relocation marks.

791
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,300
If the perpetrator

792
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,100
deliberately placed the mirror there,

793
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,067
that's a meaningful act, right?

794
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:23,100
He pretends to respect Jung I Sin,

795
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,567
but in fact, he's showing off,

796
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:25,567
thinking he's better,

797
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:28,767
that he killed the victim in a more painful way.

798
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,100
Couldn't that be considered
a display of arrogance?

799
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,400
What, is that some kind of suffering competition?

800
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,100
What if that's the case?

801
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,400
Then

802
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,500
he might push himself too far to prove

803
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,967
he's better and make mistakes.

804
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:47,633
But, we're not expecting more victims to appear.

805
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,000
Of course not.

806
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,600
That's why we're all gathered here.

807
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:57,367
What about the victims?

808
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:58,667
Any common traits?

809
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:00,700
The victims from 23 years ago

810
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,767
shared experiences of violence
or abuse against women and children,

811
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:04,867
but in this case,

812
00:46:04,867 --> 00:46:07,400
aside from the first one,
there's no common pattern.

813
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,967
Since there's no consistent
link between the victims,

814
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,533
predicting the next one is difficult.

815
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:15,133
We can only estimate how they might be killed.

816
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:18,667
So, the third case from 23 years ago...

817
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,433
Drowning.

818
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:25,000
That means the third victim would have drowned...

819
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,167
Anyway, we still have no leads.

820
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,533
There's CCTV footage near the storage warehouse.

821
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,967
It's too dark. Can't we enhance it?

822
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,833
That's the best we can do.

823
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,400
Good work today.

824
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,633
It's our first day,

825
00:46:46,633 --> 00:46:48,833
so consider this a team-building session.

826
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,067
Let's wrap up here.

827
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:52,700
I have a request for the team leader.

828
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,867
I want to meet Jung I Sin.

829
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:56,700
The killer's copying Jung I Sin's methods.

830
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,133
I think Jung I Sin might know something.

831
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:00,367
What do you think?

832
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,667
Manager Kim, about that...

833
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:14,733
Is our investigation sufficient?

834
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:18,200
If it were sufficient, maybe.

835
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,233
But it's not.

836
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:21,933
I don't want to rely on criminals for answers.

837
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:23,433
Someone who's been

838
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:24,867
locked up for 23 years

839
00:47:24,867 --> 00:47:26,767
might not be helpful.

840
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:27,800
But...

841
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,900
We already settled this.

842
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,167
Alright, let's go greet the Commissioner.

843
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,233
What?

844
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,733
Our investigation isn't thorough?

845
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,200
He's saying we didn't do our jobs properly, huh?

846
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,200
What does that washed-up guy know?

847
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,267
Watch your tone.

848
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:50,700
Regardless, we're a team now.

849
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:52,967
Anyone want coffee?

850
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,933
I want some iced plum.

851
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:05,933
Quick to adapt, Manager Kim.

852
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:07,700
Exactly.

853
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,467
Then, what should I do with this?

854
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,933
I've been carrying this around just in case.

855
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,067
What?

and it's our first meal together,

into the investigation.

answer with investigation.

899
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,400
Shh, be quiet.

900
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:33,600
You do remember something, right?

901
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:38,167
The culprit moved it deliberately.

902
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,333
I guess he was trying to show
he inflicted more suffering on the victim.

903
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:47,333
Yet he copied every other detail.

904
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:50,867
Under the condition
of using tools within this room.

905
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:56,833
You're not here just to see
how exactly he copied it.

00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:02,433
The neck.

907
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:04,333
He could've severed it cleanly.

908
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:07,267
But, he chose to leave it partially intact.

909
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,333
I did the same once.

Why?

If the culprit wanted

00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:15,300
to mimic the 23-year-old case,

917
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,900
what references did they use?

00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,200
News articles and published photos, obviously.

919
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,100
There was exactly one newspaper
that published the crime scene photos.

920
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,900
So?

921
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:55,500
Ms. Jung I Sin!

922
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:03,433
Is that all?

923
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:06,600
What about the newspapers?

924
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,967
What are you talking about?

925
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:14,967
That's something the police handles, isn't it?

926
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:17,067
I'm the criminal,

927
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,167
you're the police.

928
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,367
Weren't we in that kind of relationship?

929
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:29,033
Ms. Jung I Sin.

930
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:31,933
You know this permission

931
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:34,800
was really hard to get, right?

932
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,100
You need to give us something.

933
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:47,300
Fine, enough.

934
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:56,167
Yes, Team Leader.

935
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,533
Yes, the newspaper article?

936
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:00,533
[A Serial Killer in One Neighborhood;
Second Murder Occurs in Woongsan]

937
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:02,033
Yes, we have it.

938
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:04,733
Sending it via PolMessenger now.

939
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,633
Why would he...

940
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:17,733
[Second Murder Occurs in Woongsan]

941
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:20,033
Enhance the brightness here.

942
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:22,033
Brighter?

943
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:24,967
Here. Zoom in here.

944
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,033
This photo is flipped.

945
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:44,533
- Yeah.
- A printing error, probably.

946
00:58:44,533 --> 00:58:46,733
Was it intentional design?

947
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:48,600
Wait a second.

948
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:52,033
What?

949
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:54,533
So that means the head was actually on the left,

950
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:57,100
not the right.

951
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:01,233
This guy didn't copy it from the newspaper.

952
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,733
[Trial Record, documents created during lawsuit]
He must have seen trial record

953
00:59:02,733 --> 00:59:04,336
[Trial Record, documents created during lawsuit]
or investigation materials.

954
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,700
Yes.

955
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,767
Find some trial records or investigation
documents related to Jung I Sin...

956
00:59:15,767 --> 00:59:17,600
Already searching?

957
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,367
Got it.

958
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:25,867
Let's hurry.

959
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:19,300
I think it was last year when he came here.

960
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,533
Jung I Sin sent letters from Anwon Prison?

961
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:25,333
Jung I Sin, whom the world believes to be dead...

962
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:27,100
- Hey.
- What the heck, you punk?

963
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,500
That woman isn't helping us.

964
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,533
She's using us.

965
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:32,733
How was your mother? What kind of person was she?

966
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:33,867
If I tell you,

967
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:36,133
will you tell me where Kim Tae Seok is?

968
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,267
Shouldn't we make Seo Gu Wan talk?

969
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,600
Seo Gu Wan isn't here.

970
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,533
We need to end this. We have to kill him now.

971
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:44,200
Seo Gu Wan!
