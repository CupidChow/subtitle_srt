We've just started searching
from the 3rd and 13th floors.

181
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,500
What if the suspect on another floor
hears the bell and escapes?

182
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,433
We can't wait any longer.
We have to catch the suspect.

183
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,400
Check rooms 1305, 1304, 1312,
1317, 1318, 1319, 1320, 1322...

184
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,033
- Confirm all. Got it? Let's go.
- Alright.

185
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,400
Spread out to rooms 304, 305,
312, 317, 318, 319, 320, 322.

186
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,033
- Got it.
- Understood.

187
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,467
Police. We're need to check the room.

188
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,067
Oh, sorry! Police work.

189
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,800
Sorry to disturb you. Please rest.

190
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,267
Police. Thank you.

191
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:30,967
Apologies. Police, excuse us.

192
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,167
Police. Just a moment, sorry.

193
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,000
Thank you.

194
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
This is really tough...

195
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,833
Where should I start?

196
00:17:55,833 --> 00:18:00,467
Arms? Legs? The neck's quick, right?

197
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,933
Ji An, did you check the CCTV?

198
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,867
No guests match Joy's followers.

199
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,967
Today's highlight.

200
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,733
A spoon and a torch set.

201
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,467
Wait, what about the mirror?

202
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,067
Today, it's all for you.

203
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,833
We'll do it strictly your way.

204
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,500
No, that's not necessary.

205
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,467
I know the police are there.

206
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:32,367
Don't waste time with tricks or nonsense.

207
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:36,200
Enough nonsense.

208
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,833
Good, this part's my favorite.

209
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,200
All potential exits are blocked.

210
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,267
He'll die at this rate, Team Leader.

211
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:07,533
The exits are sealed. Let's ring the bell.

212
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,267
Team Leader.

213
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:13,400
The method matches the one 23 years ago.

214
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,867
Team Leader.

215
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,200
If we press the emergency bell,

216
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
they'll notice and flee.

217
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,433
We can catch them if that's the case.
All exits are blocked.

218
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:24,667
Even if they're on another floor,

219
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:28,933
unless they jump from
the rooftop, we can catch them.

220
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,733
He'll die if we keep stalling!

221
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:35,100
We can't catch the killer without bloodshed.

222
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,167
What does that mean?

223
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:39,233
Wait! Wait, huh?

224
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:46,933
You have to think like them, like me, Jeong Ho.

225
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:50,000
Team Leader.

226
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,067
The 4th-floor CCTV's been off for two hours.

227
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,433
Room 418.

228
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,300
What?

229
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,067
Room 418.

230
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
Seal all exits to the 4th floor.

231
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,233
Time to end this!

232
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,000
Team Leader!

233
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,297
What's going on?

234
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,384
- Why is the bell ringing?
- What's happening?

235
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:50,433
Hurry, we have to run!

236
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:53,367
Police. Stay calm.

237
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,000
The suspect's dressed like a guest.

238
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,056
Stay close, everyone. Police.

239
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,767
This is unbelievable.

240
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,533
Police. Step aside, please.

241
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:04,580
- What on earth is happening?
- Excuse us.

242
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,100
Police coming through.

243
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,700
Sorry, excuse us. Coming through.

244
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,433
Call an ambulance! Now!

245
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,633
Sir, are you conscious?

246
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:29,667
I'm police.

247
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:34,367
Sir, it's over now. Don't worry.

248
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,200
Who are you?

249
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,167
Ah, Team Leader!

250
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,467
Team Leader, are you okay?

251
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:13,467
Team Leader. The victim's Son Hyeon Ho.

252
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:17,633
He was among Joy's followers.
He managed this hotel.

253
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,900
I assumed he was just
another guest so I missed it.

254
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Luckily, he survived.

255
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,700
Good work.

256
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,167
By the way, the emergency alarm earlier,
was that Team Leader Cha?

257
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,700
Good call, huh?

258
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,567
I pressed it.

259
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,700
Team Leader told us not to.
He said the suspect would flee.

260
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,867
What?

261
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:00,992
He said we can't catch them without bloodshed.

262
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:04,667
Jeez. How did he become like that all of a sudden?

263
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,933
Park Min Jae...

264
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,633
Huh?

265
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:14,300
Min Jae, don't die. Wake up.

266
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,967
Open your eyes, Min Jae! Park Min Jae!

267
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:20,733
I'll think like Jung I Sin
and act like Jung I Sin.

268
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:23,567
Help me catch them. Please.

269
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,067
Seong Gyu. Investigate Team Leader Cha.

270
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,167
Team Leader Cha?

271
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,900
Yeah.

272
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,400
Check him out.

273
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,633
Why did a narc suddenly come here?

274
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:43,467
Why Team Leader Cha specifically?

275
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:46,000
What exactly is his relationship
with Park Min Jae?

276
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,733
Why did he change so drastically?

277
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,633
What if you're late again today?

278
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:07,433
Considering your son's condition
and his young age,

279
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,200
custody would undeniably favor the mother.

280
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,567
I see.

281
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:14,067
But, please be cautious
in front of the investigator.

282
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,033
Understood.

283
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:22,667
My apologies.

284
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:24,867
- Frog legs.
- Hello.

285
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:28,267
Frog legs.

286
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:36,400
Ho Jun, how many people live in your house?

287
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:48,133
Are those people here now?

288
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,567
Wow, you drew this really well.

289
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:58,500
Did you draw this, Ho Jun?

290
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:03,433
Who's this person?

291
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,333
What about this one?

292
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,600
Good job.

293
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,267
Where do you think Mommy is?

294
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:24,400
So this is mommy.

295
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,367
Miss, could you ask Ho Jun whether he likes

296
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,967
being with Mom or Dad more?

297
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,633
- Investigator?
- Wait.

298
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,500
- Why ask something that wasn't planned?
- Unacceptable.

299
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,867
This situation already stresses Ho Jun.

300
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,333
If she pushes with such questions...

301
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,300
This question has to be asked...

302
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,933
No...

303
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,367
Do you need anything else?

304
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,367
Ho Jun must be having a really hard time.

305
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,533
- Please ask him.
- Wait...

306
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:54,633
Miss. Please ask him.

307
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,900
We almost caught them.

308
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,700
Almost? He nearly killed someone.

309
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,933
But, we saved the victim.

310
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,633
You probably don't care, but...

311
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,900
This is Yeonpo. Remember?

312
00:27:56,867 --> 00:28:02,833
You, Min Jae, and me
spent all day at the beach together.

313
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,200
I also included Min Jae in the drawing.

314
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,367
I remember the sea.

315
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,533
Would Min Jae like it?

316
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,767
These are hotel crime scene photos.

317
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:35,767
And this is the material related to
the case you committed 23 years ago.

318
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,100
[4th Case, Woongsan Serial Murders]

319
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,433
They tried to reenact the past crimes exactly.

320
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:45,200
Compare these, and share any connections you see.

321
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:53,967
I can't go back, so take care of this yourself.

322
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,600
You know this song, right?

323
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,367
They even hummed it exactly like I did back then.

324
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,333
How did they know that?

325
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,167
That detail isn't even in the statement.

326
00:29:56,033 --> 00:30:00,800
- At the scene...
- At the scene. Right?

327
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,800
They were there, observing it at the scene.

328
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,567
But why didn't they report it later?

329
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:18,367
Because I gave them what they wanted.

330
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:29,533
These two, I didn't do them.

331
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:39,167
The cut is 1.5 cm, very shallow wounds.

332
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:43,733
Something like a box cutter?

333
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:48,400
Even full-force stabs left only these marks.

334
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,567
Whether in a wardrobe or anywhere else,

335
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:56,200
if they wanted to stab the already-dead man
again like this after I left...

336
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:07,300
The family was only the wife and a young boy.

337
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,067
If it's a shallow wound...

338
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:13,167
Do you remember? The mining village.

339
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,867
There was that kid always hanging around.

340
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,567
Mom!

341
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:55,967
There was a kid who carried around
dead cats like dolls.

342
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:59,400
That child's body was covered
in all kinds of wounds,

343
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:04,833
even severe burns that left
one side of his nose disfigured.

344
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,533
Kang Yeong Ho.

345
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,933
He locked the child in the bathroom

346
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,767
and forced him to eat feces.

347
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,967
He chained his legs and later...

348
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,667
With a spoon heated in the fire,

349
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,900
he even burned one side of the nose.

350
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,467
How could someone do that to their own son...

351
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:32,300
Your own dad tried to kill you.

352
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,167
The child was 12 at the time. Kang Yeon Jung.

353
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:46,133
He watched me at the scene.

354
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:07,500
To him, I must have been the one
who always gave him what he wanted.

355
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,967
Naturally, he would have been curious.

356
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,467
That's how he found you,

357
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,300
and even your family.

358
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,167
Your house, and Jung Yeon.

359
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:28,700
Your wife is in danger.

360
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:39,867
Section Chief, I need officers
assigned immediately.

361
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,967
Yes, for Jung Yeon.

362
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:56,967
The suspect apparently mimicked

363
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,800
Jung I Sin's humming and melody exactly

364
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,767
during the 23-year-old case.

365
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:04,700
Knowing that means he must have
seen Jung I Sin's murder firsthand,

366
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,200
whether hidden or otherwise.

367
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,733
The victim back then, Kang Yeong Ho, had a son.

368
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,333
He suffered such severe abuse that there was even

369
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,500
public sympathy for Jung I Sin at the time.

370
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,667
The son is Kang Yeon Jung.

371
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:29,333
He appears to be the real killer behind this case.

372
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,567
[Kang Yeon Jung]

373
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,733
This is his resident registration photo.

374
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:37,933
But there are no records of him after this.

375
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:42,033
As of now, Kang Yeon Jung's mother
is hospitalized with alcohol-related dementia.

376
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:44,333
But since then, there's been no change of address,

377
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,767
and he hasn't opened
any bank accounts or credit cards.

378
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:50,167
He probably used illegal means
to change his identity.

379
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,933
I wouldn't have kept living
as Kang Yeon Jung either.

380
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,067
The time he lived under that name

381
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,767
must've been worse than hell.

382
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,100
[Kang Yeon Jung]

383
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,700
Did you find the address
of his mother's nursing home?

384
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,767
It's in Sangbong City. Not too far.

385
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,133
Mark the address.

386
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:09,833
Manager Bae and Hyuk, please handle
the neighborhood investigation around the victim.

387
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,933
- Understood.
- Let's go.

388
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,567
Wait, no, what I mean is...

389
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,200
He's the type who puts his own reputation first,

390
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,900
whether someone lives or dies, absolutely.

391
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,033
Then why even catch the suspect, huh?

392
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm trying to reduce the number of victims...

393
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,967
Did you ask him that directly?

394
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,000
Ask him what?

395
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,733
Whether he wanted to boost
his reputation or stop more killing.

396
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:57,333
Did you ask Team Leader? You missed the suspect.

397
00:35:58,267 --> 00:35:59,867
What are you talking about, man?

398
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,400
There he is.

399
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,367
Aren't we all part of the same team?

400
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,267
Ugh, whatever.

401
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,667
If you're gonna dig into a teammate's business,

402
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,367
do it on your own.

403
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,300
Do it on my own?

404
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,733
That punk suddenly uses informal speech.

405
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:28,333
Fine, I'll do it on my own.

406
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,367
Yes, correct. Kang Yeon Jung.

407
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:39,533
Your son. Have you met him recently?

408
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,367
Yeon Jung?

409
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:46,467
My son?

410
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,833
He needs to run away.

411
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:52,867
My husband's coming to get him.

412
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,600
Why?

413
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,533
Yeon Jung needs to escape.

414
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:58,600
Why?

415
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,733
Why does Kang Yeon Jung need to run away?

416
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:04,733
Madam! Madam!

417
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:07,600
Team Leader, a word.

418
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,567
Does anything come to mind?

419
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,600
It seems like you met the victim.

420
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,900
Well, it's just that he's a close friend.

421
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,900
And now that friend's in intensive care
because of this punk.

422
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,767
We need to catch them.

423
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:29,600
Please just tell us anything
you remember. It's okay.

424
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:33,933
Well, honestly, that friend
was kind of... sleazy, you know?

425
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:35,533
He signed up on all these apps

426
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:38,267
and kept meeting different women everywhere.

427
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:39,533
This woman too?

428
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,133
Yes.

429
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:43,700
Look here.

430
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,267
He bragged excitedly about meeting her,

431
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,167
but then went completely silent afterward.

432
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,667
I mean, I'm a guy too, so naturally I got curious.

433
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:51,667
- Right.
- So,

434
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:54,167
I bought him a couple glasses
of wine and pressed him.

435
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:57,767
So, he was being honest with me
back then, saying it seemed like

436
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,600
things were going a bit wrong.

437
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,067
- Going wrong?
- Yeah.

438
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,833
Why? Oh, her looks?

439
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,333
He said she was attractive.

440
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,400
Of course, the profile photos were all fake.

441
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,567
You know, those dating apps tend to be like that.

442
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:13,000
People hardly ever post their real photos.

443
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,867
But the problem is... Oh, jeez...

444
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:19,733
Do I really have to talk about all this?

445
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:22,367
You can tell us. We're police.

446
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,533
Just speak freely.

447
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:26,133
Team Leader, try to repeat after me.

448
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:28,600
Frog legs.

449
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,500
What's that all of a sudden...

450
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,800
Just try it. Frog legs.

451
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,367
When pronouncing the 'legs',
pull the corner of your lips up.

452
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,667
Frog legs.

453
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,100
- Legs...
- Legs...

454
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,967
People like that don't really
listen to what's being said.

455
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:48,000
They just watch the speaker's face.

456
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,700
So, that's why she's like that.

457
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,033
Frog legs...

458
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:53,767
Yeah.

459
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:05,367
Anyway, that crazy punk met a woman here.
Without the company knowing.

460
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:06,467
Even Joy?

461
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:07,733
Yes.

462
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:11,167
The moment Joy brought him into her room,
she told him to turn off all the lights,

463
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:13,467
and from then on he started
to feel something was off.

464
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:16,433
But you know, he figured
she just liked to take the lead,

465
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,200
so he let it slide.

466
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,367
And then?

467
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:23,200
Did the woman make any
threatening moves or anything?

468
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,233
It was quite the opposite.

469
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:25,767
- Opposite?
- Yeah.

470
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:28,500
While they were in the middle of... you know...

471
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,100
she suddenly asked him to choke her.

472
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,500
- The woman?
- Yes.

473
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,733
He thought maybe she was into some kinky stuff,

474
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:37,733
so he just pretended to go along.

475
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:40,700
But then, she kept saying, 'Harder! Harder!'

476
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,000
Really pushing him.

477
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,600
He said it scared him,
like he might actually kill her,

478
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,000
so he stopped.

479
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,500
After that, he panicked

480
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
and barely escaped in a daze.

481
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,100
Anything else?

482
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,467
Well...

483
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,300
What really terrified him was

484
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,233
when he had his hand around her neck

485
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:04,900
and she suddenly got excited

486
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,567
and told him to kill her.

487
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:10,067
She said that killing her
would save a lot of people...

488
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:12,700
I mean, that's seriously creepy, right?

489
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,100
That's why he stopped.

490
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,667
Madam. I'm genuinely curious.

491
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,233
Why does Yeon Jung need to run?

492
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:39,100
He killed Dallae.

493
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,200
Wh... Who's Dallae?

494
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,933
The dog.

495
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,533
The dog next door.

496
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,567
Doggie.

497
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:59,367
Her memories all seem mixed up.

498
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,300
Madam.

499
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,967
Yeon Jung. Have you seen him recently?

500
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:15,533
When?

501
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,800
Just now.

502
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,567
What?

503
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,267
He put on makeup again.

504
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:32,633
Trying to become a girl.

505
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,367
He wore makeup again.

506
00:41:37,033 --> 00:41:41,600
Run away. My husband's coming to catch you.

507
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,833
Ma'am. Did anyone else visit her just now?

508
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:46,933
Oh, yes.

509
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:49,333
Someone left right before you arrived.

510
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:52,888
Darn it.

511
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:55,833
Got it, Manager Kim.

512
00:41:56,733 --> 00:42:00,700
There's a record of the visit,
but the CCTV was broken.

513
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,833
From what the nurse and the front desk said,

514
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:06,400
even though the visitor wore a hood
and a mask, it was a woman.

515
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:09,600
A woman?

516
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,300
Yes.

517
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:32,133
Yes. All good right now.

518
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,033
Alright.

519
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:35,733
Alright, good work.

520
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,467
She said Kang Yeon Jung came,

521
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,500
but her dementia is so advanced now

522
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,033
that it's impossible to get through to her.

523
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:53,433
So, even if Kang Yeon Jung really
did visit, we wouldn't be able to

524
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,600
get any useful information.

525
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,833
Well... I've been thinking.

526
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,800
Even if Kang Yeon Jung's mother's mind
drifts in and out,

527
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,700
what she said could all be true.

528
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,500
What do you mean?

529
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,967
That it's her son,

530
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,400
that he used to kill dogs
and cats and carry them around,

531
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,133
that he wore makeup, all those could be facts.

532
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,867
If all of that's real,

533
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:25,100
whether it came from his father's abuse

534
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,467
or was just who he was,

535
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:31,533
what's clear is that Kang Yeon Jung showed

536
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:34,500
antisocial tendencies from childhood,

537
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,167

00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:26,400
I don't want our child to have my blood.

718
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,267
You don't know about...

719
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:33,500
What are you talking about, Su Yeol?

720
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,567
- Su Yeol... Su Yeol.
- Wait.

721
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:45,867
I love you, Jung Yeon.

722
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,233
I'm sorry for lying.

723
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,833
They're agitated now.

724
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:08,100
They're trying to erase the tracks.

725
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,433
Bring Su Yeol here.

726
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:11,067
[I'll stay at A Ra's place for just a few days.]
He's as desperate as you are.

727
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:13,567
If it's not about helping her son,

728
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:16,333
but about some ulterior motive to use him.

729
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:18,567
She said you're happy because of her.

730
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:21,200
[My husband Su Yeol]
How did you meet Jung Yeon?

731
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,133
Put out an APB in the area
and send them immediately.

732
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,500
Jung I Sin is coming here?

733
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,000
Special orders from the Commissioner.

734
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,500
From now on, we operate independently.

735
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,900
If you go, you'll die.

736
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,000
I have to do this.
